APPENDIX\n\n## stakeholders letter to our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, Cemex set the pace with outstanding operational and strategic performance, delivering record results.\n\n## Dear Fellow Stakeholders,\n\n## An Exceptional Year\n\nIn 2023, Cemex set the pace with outstanding operational and strategic performance. We delivered record results, doubled our free cash flow generation, and grew EBITDA by 25% as we recovered from the extraordinary inflationary pressures of the last few years. Our performance is a testament to the focus and commitment of our employees worldwide. Their relentless innovation, unwavering dedication, and steadfast perseverance are creating a greener, more resilient future for generations to come as well as a profitable future for Cemex. In this year's report, we take great pride in sharing our progress and commitment to sustainable business practices.\n\nWe demonstrated the e/ffectiveness of our global business strategy: Successfully navigating a challenging demand backdrop in most markets and delivering excellent financial results. With EBITDA margin expansion of two percentage points, driven by strong pricing and decelerating cost inflation, we reached our goal of recovering 2021 margins. Doubling our free cash flow after maintenance capital expenditures to US$1.2 billion was a key highlight, growing US$655 million, on the back of higher EBITDA and a turnaround in working capital investment. Additionally, our leverage ratio declined significantly. This new foundation allows more flexibility going forward for accelerating our bolt-on growth strategy, initiating a sustainable shareholder return program, and further strengthening our capital structure.\n\nAs this Integrated Report was being written, we celebrated Standard & Poor's upgrade of Cemex to investment grade. This is a very important milestone for our company. While we had record results in 2023, this rating recognizes the successful execution against our medium-term strategy and consistent financial performance over several years.",

APPENDIX\n\n## Record\n\n## US$ 3.35B\n\nEBITDA with 25% growth\n\n## 2023 Highlights:\n\n- l Full-year EBITDA grew 25%, reaching a record US$3.35 billion, driven by the contribution of pricing over costs, growth investments, as well as our rapidly expanding Urbanization Solutions business.\n- l Growth investments contributed to 13% of incremental EBITDA, while Urbanization Solutions grew by double digits.\n- l Strong pricing, easing cost inflation, and operational e/fficiencies drove EBITDA margin expansion of two percentage points, allowing us to reach our goal of recovering 2021 margins.\n- l Free cash flow of US$1.2 billion, reaching a six-year high, driven by EBITDA and lower working capital investment resulting from a management initiative to normalize working capital investment as pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions ease.\n- l Our leverage ratio declined by 0.8 times of a turn to 2.06 times.\n- l Our return on capital for the full year expanded by 1.5 percentage points, to close to 14%. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- l Our already high Net Promoter Score improved to 70, reaching well above the industry benchmark, and competitive with other well-regarded customer-oriented companies, and reflecting the e/ffectiveness of our customer centricity focus.\n- l 2023 was another year of remarkable progress in decarbonization with a 4% decline in Scope 1 specific net CO2 emissions  driven by an internal record alternative fuel substitution rate of 37% and a reduction in clinker factor to 72%. Since the launch of our Future in Action program in 2020, we have accelerated the pace of our decarbonization, reducing Scope 1 and 2 specific emissions by 13% and 12%, respectively, a pace that previously would have taken us 15 years to accomplish.\n- l We were recognized by CDP on its prestigious A list for transparency on climate change disclosure.\n\nBeyond exceptional financial results, we are passionately committed to health and safety and continue to lead the industry in safety. In 2023, our employee Lost Time Injury (LTI) Frequency Rate was 0.6, with zero incidents across 96% of our global operations. These results provide both motivation and clear evidence that our continuous improvement commitment is producing positive outcomes as we aim toward our Zero4Life goal.\n\nBuilding on our more ambitious 2030 decarbonization targets that we revised in 2022, we also updated our Green Financing Framework and our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. Our targets are validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for alignment under their 1.5\u00b0C scenario, the most ambitious pathway defined for the cement industry. Reducing the carbon footprint of our operations is the right thing to do, and we are delivering solidly on our 2030 commitments as we execute against our updated targets.\n\n1 Excluding goodwill.\n\nWith regard to customer centricity, Cemex achieved a record Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 70, strongly surpassing the industry benchmark for customer loyalty. We achieved this milestone seven years ahead of our 2030 target. This score partially reflects our success in the rollout of our superior digital customer experience. Used by 87% of our recurring customers, our Cemex Go platform continues to evolve and is an important enabler of our transition to a lower-carbon industry by better organizing our supply chains, transitioning to a paperless industry, and increasing overall e/fficiency in our business.\n\n## Environmental Excellence\n\nWe realized record results across our climate action agenda. We achieved lower CO2 emissions and set new standards in environmental stewardship. Through our Future in Action climate action strategy, Cemex is steadily transitioning toward a low-carbon economy, leveraging alternative fuels, promoting a circular economy, and embracing clean energy sources. As a leader in combating global climate change, Cemex is making significant progress toward our ambitious goals for 2030, with our ultimate aim to become a net-zero carbon emissions company by 2050.\n\n## Accelerating Our Pace for Decarbonization\n\nOur record-breaking performance is underpinned by our 4% reduction in Scope 1 specific net CO2 emissions  in 2023, driven by an increase in alternative fuel usage to 37% and a reduction in clinker factor to 72%. Our ability to use alternative fuels has been supported by our industry leadership in hydrogen injection technology. We continued our global rollout of this technology, and it's now used in half of our cement plants. In Mexico alone, we made sizeable investments installing new hydrogen units and plan to continue scaling hydrogen use in our operations worldwide.",

APPENDIX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating Products & Solutions with Sustainable Attributes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ 220\n\nproject portfolio focused on research, innovation, and development of solutions\n\nWhile we lower our carbon footprint in our processes, we remain focused on creating demand for products and solutions with sustainable attributes. In September, we became the first company in our industry to provide validated environmental impact disclosure for all core products across our main markets globally. This transparency is an essential step in working alongside our clients as a sustainable construction partner to decarbonize the built environment.\n\nOur e/fforts over the last few years are paying o/ff. Our Vertua \u00ae products with sustainable attributes currently account for 56% of our total cement sales and 48% of total concrete sales, progressing significantly ahead of our 2025 sales goal of 50%. Vertua's \u00ae strong market adoption is contributing to sustainable construction and positioning Cemex as a preferred partner dedicated to driving lasting change.\n\nIt is projected that two out of three people will be living in cities by 2050. This migration will require the infrastructure equivalent of New York City to be built every month for the next 40 years to meet population growth and rapid urbanization. This expansive growth, coupled with the rapid depletion of the earth's natural resources, creates significant challenges for future economic development and climate action. The reduce, reuse, and recycle approach of a circular economy can help restore balance to our natural resource base and contribute to a low-carbon world. Through e/fficient design and material reuse, we believe our industry can play a critical role in a circular and sustainable world.\n\nOur new global waste management business, Regenera, is key to a circular economy, leveraging our global expertise in using industrial waste and byproducts as substitutes with sustainable attributes in production processes. Reporting an extraordinary performance in 2023, we repurposed close to 28 million tons of waste and byproducts, which is about the same amount of waste collected across England during the year. By 2030, we aim to increase this to 41 million tons with a focus on municipal and industrial waste; construction, demolition, and excavation waste; and other waste and industry byproducts.\n\n## Investing in Innovation\n\nTo achieve carbon neutrality, it is essential to explore new technologies. Our portfolio of more than 220 projects, focused on research, innovation, and development of solutions, is designed to help us achieve our climate goals. Through Cemex Ventures, we continue to explore innovative solutions with investments in the construction value chain, as well as in companies that help us accelerate our decarbonization path. Since its launch, Cemex Ventures has invested in 23 startups,\n\ndeveloping a collaborative platform between entrepreneurs, universities, and private industry to address challenges in the construction environment and promote sustainable construction.\n\n## Conserving Our Links to Nature\n\nWe continue to optimize water use and promote biodiversity preservation programs, like our El Carmen nature reserve in Coahuila, Mexico. This past year, we bred and reintroduced the first genetically pure American bison o/ffspring as part of our e/fforts to preserve this species in North America. This is one of our most profound rewilding and biodiversity projects and gives us pride knowing we are contributing to the preservation of wilderness ecosystems.\n\nOur quarries also have the potential to serve as catalysts for positive contributors to biodiversity and ecosystem preservation rather than just sites of extraction. We have pledged to establish biodiversity baselines for all active quarries by 2025, laying the groundwork for a nature-positive approach that prioritizes the flourishing of ecosystems.\n\n## Promoting a Green Economy\n\nMomentum across our industry continues to accelerate the pace of frameworks and regulations that are shaping a net-zero world. While we are walking the talk, we are also using our voice to promote a green economy as it underpins our climate action e/fforts. We continue to deepen collaborations with select partners to develop industrial-scale technologies, products, and solutions for a greener built environment.",

APPENDIX\n\nWe also lend our expertise to industry associations to help drive and sustain change and today hold nearly 200 industry leadership roles across the globe. We are proud that our CEO was elected as president of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA). The GCCA represents a staggering 80% of the world's cement production capacity outside of China and recently signed a historic partnership with the China Cement Association (CCA), which represents more than 50% of the world's cement production, to work together to accelerate decarbonization across the industry. This is the decade to deliver with public and private sectors collaborating to reach our full potential as a carbon-neutral society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n25\n\nyears of Patrimonio Hoy have transformed the lives of 665,000 families, improving the living conditions of over three million people\n\n## Social Impact\n\nAround the world, Cemex makes a positive and lasting di/fference in the cities and communities where we operate. We focus on empowering people, improving housing and infrastructure, building green spaces and resilient communities, and supporting local economies through skills development, entrepreneurship, and sustainability for a just transition. We are proud to rely heavily on local small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up approximately 60% of our global supplier network. In 2023, we continued setting the pace as part of the UN Global Compact's Sustainable Supplier Impact Program where we co-led one of five pilot projects, and the only one with global outreach. Over 1,200 suppliers across five geographies participated in this five-module program, which enabled the development of sustainability strategies for over 100 construction industry suppliers.\n\nOur flagship social impact program Patrimonio Hoy turned 25 in 2023, setting the cornerstone for Cemex to build a better, more sustainable future. Benefitting 665,000 families and improving the lives of over three million people, Patrimonio Hoy helps build resilient homes that improve living conditions for communities potentially a/ffected by climate change and natural hazards. In recognition of its milestone, Patrimonio Hoy received a social transformation award from Corresponsables, a Spanish CSR B-Corp.\n\nWhen high-impact climate events occur, Cemex steps up to help. In late October, Hurricane Otis was the most powerful storm on record to strike Mexico's Pacific coast, wreaking havoc on Acapulco. Cemex quickly stepped in to support our communities, distributors, and customers with swift assistance to help begin the cleanup and restoration process.\n\n## Disciplined Execution, Sustainable Growth\n\nWe remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy to continue delivering sustainable growth. Our success in 2023 caps o/ff several years of solid financial performance that now allows us to focus more on our bolt-on growth investment strategy, a progressive shareholder return policy, and further strengthening our capital structure. With global challenges such as climate and the construction of new supply chains, our industry is in a moment of significant transition. As the built environment evolves, Cemex is well-positioned to prosper. The future is bright. On behalf of Cemex's Board of Directors, our management team, and our employees, we thank you for your continued confidence in Cemex.\n\nSincerely,\n\n## Rogelio Zambrano\n\nChairman, Board of Directors\n\nFernando A.

Free Cash Flow after maintenance CapEx of US$1.2 billion reached a six-year high, more than doubled compared to 2022 levels. Results were bolstered by strong pricing for our products across all markets, decelerating input cost inflation, and contributions from Cemex's growth investment strategy and Urbanization Solutions business.\n\n| In millions of US dollars                                                    | 2023   | 2022 2   | Var.

This foundation should give us additional flexibility in capital allocation, where we continue to accelerate investments in our bolt-on growth strategy, initiate a sustainable return program for shareholders, and bolster our capital structure. Based on free cash flow generation over the past few years, the Board of Directors is proposing a progressive dividend program at Cemex's Ordinary General Shareholders Meeting on March 22, 2024.

This framework outlines principles for issuing various sustainabilitylinked financing instruments, including bonds, private placements, loans, and derivatives. In 2022, Cemex launched its Green Financing Framework, which facilitates the issuance of bonds, loans, and other debt-like instruments for eligible green projects. Both frameworks were updated in 2023 to support our more ambitious decarbonization goals, validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for alignment under their 1.5\u00b0C scenario, the most ambitious pathway defined for the cement industry.\n\nThis latest update of Cemex's Green Financing Framework expands eligibility criteria to incorporate innovative projects such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology, crucial for achieving net-zero CO\u2082 emissions.\n\n## Developments related to sustainability-themed funding in 2023:\n\n- l Updated both our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and Green Financing Framework to align them with Cemex's more ambitious 2030 decarbonization goals.\n- l Closed the refinancing of our sustainability-linked syndicated bank facility, which consists of a US$1 billion term loan and US$2 billion committed revolving credit facility.\n- l Issued $6 billion Mexican pesos, the equivalent of approximately US$350 million, in peso-denominated sustainability-linked long-term notes (certificados burs\u00e1tiles de largo plazo).

Our higher prices in local currency terms in all regions drove our top-line growth.\n\nCost of sales, as a percentage of Sales , decreased by 2.7pp to 66.3% in 2023 mainly driven by pricing of our products, easing cost headwinds, and operational e/fficiencies.\n\n## Operating expenses, as a percentage of Sales ,\n\nincreased by 0.6pp to 21.5% in 2023 mainly driven by higher maintenance, professional services, and other expenses.\n\nEBITDA grew 25%, reaching a record US$3.35 billion, driven by growth in all four regions. EBITDA outperformance reflects not only strong pricing of our products and decelerating input cost inflation, but also the success of our growth investment strategy, as well as continued growth in our Urbanization Solutions business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA margin increased by 2.0pp from 17.2% to 19.2% in 2023. The expansion reflects pricing strategy execution for our products, as well as easing cost inflation and operational e/fficiencies, with the fullyear margin exceeding our goal of recovering 2021 levels, after adjusting for volume and product mix.\n\nWe reported a Controlling Interest Net Income of US$182 million in 2023. Despite better operating performance, net income for the year was lower\n\ndue to a provision for a tax fine created in the fourth quarter related to a tax matter in Spain from two cases covering the years 2006 to 2014. In addition, in 2022 we recorded extraordinary gains resulting from several divestments.\n\nTotal debt decreased by 8%, or US$661 million, to US$7.5 billion at the end of 2023.",

In 2023, our cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates volumes increased by 3%, 7% and 9%, respectively.\n\nIn 2023, our operations in Mexico experienced a strong performance in volume driven by the formal sector and supported by infrastructure and nearshoring, particularly in the north and southeast. Importantly, we saw a pickup in bagged cement demand in the second half of 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## United States\n\nOur U.S. operations' sales increased by 6% to US$5.3 billion, while EBITDA increased by 37% to US$1.0 billion, an important milestone for the business. Our U.S. operations' domestic gray cement and ready-mix concrete volumes decreased by 13% and 10%, respectively, in 2023.  Aggregates volume rose 1% for the year.\n\nVolume decline largely reflects bad weather, lower residential and commercial demand, completion of some large industrial projects, as well as some market share loss due to our pricing strategy for our products. In response to the slowdown in demand, we were once again able to reduce our lower-margin cement imports to support profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global Operations (in millions of US dollars)\n\nSales by Product (percentage)\n\n| Business Unit                               | Sales 5   | Operating  Earnings Before   Other Expenses, Net   | EBITDA   | Total  Assets 4   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| Mexico                                      | 5,060     | 1,267                                              | 1,488    | 5,381             |\n| United States                               | 5,338     | 557                                                | 1,040    | 12,998            |\n| Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia 1     | 5,059     | 375                                                | 703      | 6,509             |\n| South, Central America, and the Caribbean 2 | 1,725     | 315                                                | 399      | 2,290             |\n| Others and intercompany eliminations 3      | 206       | (401)                                              | (283)    | 1,255             |\n| Consolidated Amounts                        | 17,388    | 2,114                                              | 3,347    | 28,433            |\n\nSales by Region (percentage)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

APPENDIX\n\nOur pricing strategy, growth investments, and decelerating costs were the primary drivers to achieve 37% EBITDA growth despite volume headwinds. We are recovering multiyear cost inflation through pricing, evidenced by material margin recovery observed throughout 2023.\n\n## Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n\nDuring 2023, sales increased 3% to US$5.1 billion, while EBITDA increased by 5% to US$703 million. Our regional domestic gray cement, ready-mix concrete and aggregates volumes decreased by 10%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.\n\nDespite volume headwinds, Europe posted record EBITDA, growing more than 20%, with margin expansion of 2pp. These achievements are attributable to the success of our 'One Europe' strategy implemented in 2019 which consolidated and integrated our footprint in the region, accelerated our climate action e/fforts, while rationalizing costs and pursuing bolt-on growth investments in integrated urban micro markets.\n\nEurope continued to post new records in climate action, reducing CO2 emissions by 44% since 1990, and is well on its way to match the EU's 55% 2030 carbon emissions reduction target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdverse competitive dynamics in the Philippines, as well as an overall slowdown of construction activity in the subregion, negatively impacted results throughout the year for the Middle East, Africa, and Asia region.\n\n## South, Central America, and the Caribbean\n\nAfter a challenging 2022 where pricing for our products struggled to keep up with cost inflation, sales and EBITDA increased by 7% and 4% in 2023. Ready-mix concrete volumes remained flat and aggregates volumes increased by 8%. Regional domestic gray cement volumes decreased by 3% for the year. While bagged cement demand remains under pressure, bulk volumes continue to grow, supported by infrastructure projects such as the Bogot\u00e1 Metro, the 4th Bridge over the Canal in Panama, and tourism-related projects in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe pricing of our products drove top-line growth, but it was still not su/fficient to cover input cost inflation.\n\n## Global Trading\n\nIn 2023, we traded around 12 million tons of cementitious and non-cementitious (other) materials, in more than 50 countries, including around\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnine million tons of cement and clinker and around three million tons of cementitious and other materials. Our trading network enables us to maximize the capacity utilization of our facilities worldwide while reducing our exposure to the inherent cyclicality of the cement industry. We are generally able to distribute excess capacity to regions around the world where there is a supply shortage. In addition, we believe that our worldwide network of strategically located marine terminals allows us to coordinate maritime logistics on a global basis and minimize transportation expenses. Our trading operations also enable us to explore new markets without significant initial capital expenditure.\n\nFreight rates, which account for a large share of the total import supply cost, have been subject to significant volatility in recent years. However, our trading operations have obtained significant savings by contracting maritime transportation in due time and by using our own and chartered fleets, which transported around 75% of of our cement, clinker, and other commodities traded volume during 2023.\n\nIn addition, we provide freight service to third parties, which allows us to generate additional revenues.",

Cemex is the first company in its sector to set industry-leading climate targets for its operations in Europe which align directly with the EU's aspiration of 55% CO2 reduction by 2030. Cemex has also committed to become a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. To reach our CO2 reduction goals, innovative technologies, and considerable capital investments\n\nhave to be deployed. Since EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) began in 2005, over US$448 million of our investments in Europe are either already executed or planned in the next years to support our CO2 reduction objectives. These investments include, but are not limited to, the general process switch from fossil fuels to lower carbon alternatives, becoming more e/fficient in the use of energy, sourcing alternative raw materials that contribute to reducing overall emissions or clinker factor, developing and actively promoting lower carbon products, and the recent deployment of groundbreaking hydrogen technology in all Cemex's European kilns. Cemex is also working closely with alliances to develop industrial-scale technologies toward its goal of a net-zero carbon future. Strong and clear regulations, such as EU ETS and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), give companies like Cemex the confidence and certainty to enable these investments.",

APPENDIX\n\n## Industry-First Sustainability Fact Label\n\nIn another industry-first, Cemex provides a fact label for products under the Vertua \u00ae brand, which details the product's sustainable attributes. Each attribute is explained to provide consumers with context on the product's benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transparency in Our Products' Environmental Impact\n\nWe provide meaningful product environmental impact information to remain transparent. Cemex is the first company in the industry to provide the Global Warming Potential and environmental impacts information for its core products in all its main markets. This disclosure is customized by location and is useful for architects, engineers, contractors, and customers seeking sustainable construction or green certifications.\n\nCemex provides environmental impact information in two ways:\n\n## Environmental Product Declarations\n\nThe United States is the first of our markets where we provided Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) on-demand to our customers. EPDs provide real-time environmental data on the Global Warming Potential and other relevant environmental impacts such as acidification, abiotic depletion, and eutrophication, among others.\n\n## CERO2\n\nThe CERO2 carbon footprint measurement tool calculates the environmental footprint of a product in a particular location, in detail. The tool provides a much higher degree of accuracy than other carbon calculator tools currently available in the market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A Learning Experience Beyond Our Teams\n\nIn order for our technical teams to be wellversed in the sustainable attributes of our products, we build their knowledge through our Early Conversion initiative, which provides training and best-practice sharing. We also reinforce our commercial teams' knowledge of green building standards so they can provide guidance to our customers applying for green certifications.\n\nAlso, as part of our commitment to better serve our external clients, we created a basic training program consisting of masterclasses. This program focuses on showcasing the sustainable attributes of the Vertua\u00ae portfolio of products and how it can be used in building projects. We rolled out masterclasses to specific groups of customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and the SCAC region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More on page 76 of this report.",

ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n6. LEADING WITH INTEGRITY\n\n7. APPENDIX\n\nCemex gives priority to the use of alternative fuels with high biomass content. Biomass waste has already removed and absorbed CO\u2082 from the atmosphere, so when it is later used as a fuel, it has a neutral impact on our gross emissions.\n\n## Alternative Fuels\n\nIn 2023, alternative fuels constituted 37% of our fuel mix, setting a company record for the third consecutive year. For the year, we increased the alternative fuels rate by 2 percentage points compared to 2022. We are also using alternative fuels with a high biomass content, which is key to reducing direct CO\u2082 emissions from the clinker production process. Last year, biomass content was 11.8% of our total fuel mix.\n\n## Alternative Fuels Across Geographies\n\nAlternative fuels can eliminate our reliance on carbon-intensive fossil fuels, powering our kilns while also supporting our communities in waste management. Alternative fuels are waste from various sources that include municipal, commercial, and industrial residues that contain recoverable energy. Most often, this waste ends up in landfills without energy recovery and generates methane, which is up to 80 times more harmful than CO2. The most common alternative fuels are agricultural fuels, refuse-derived fuel (RDF), tire-derived fuel (TDF), and alternative liquid fuels.\n\n## Alternative Fuels Rate (percentage)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEurope: Our cement plants in Europe remain our benchmark in alternative fuel consumption, with rates above 70% in the Czech Republic, Germany, and the U.K.\n\nPoland: Our Chelm and Rudniki cement plants maintain their leadership, consistently achieving substitution rates above 90%.\n\nMexico: In 2023, we doubled our alternative fuel substitution rate since 2020, reaching 43%, by securing a stable supply of alternative fuels and making investments to enhance equipment in our cement plants.\n\nColombia, Panama: Our operations have incorporated RDF, TDF, and some residual biomass into their fuel mix. Both operations have installed RDF shredders and feeding systems, enabling them to introduce new alternative fuels and support local communities with proper waste disposal.\n\nPhilippines: Our Philippines operation significantly increased RDF consumption, achieving nearly a 24% substitution rate by providing circularity solutions to waste management companies, communities, local authorities, and municipalities. Recovered residual waste was converted into RDF and used as an alternative fuel in our Solid Cement plant. RDF constitutes over half of our alternative fuels substitution rate, which is close to 50% in this plant.\n\n## Hydrogen Injection\n\nAs an industry pioneer, Cemex has adopted hydrogen injection to improve combustion conditions, allowing for greater use of alternative fuels and reducing CO\u2082 emissions from fuel consumption. In 2023, we used hydrogen injection in our kilns in all of our European plants. We continued our global rollout of this technology and we now use hydrogen injection technology in 50% of our clinker production. Throughout the year, we successfully installed new units in Mexico, Jamaica, and the Philippines, yielding positive results, and we anticipate implementation of this technology in the U.S. in the near future.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Clinker, the key component of cement, is produced by calcining together limestone, clay, and other materials in a rotary kiln at temperatures nearing 1500\u00b0C. This is an energy-intensive, carbon-emitting process that generates the most direct CO\u2082 emissions in the cement production process. To reduce our clinker factor, we use byproducts from other industries, like blast furnace slag and fly ash, as alternatives to clinker. While maintaining identical product quality and durability, our new clinker types emit up to 20% less CO\u2082.\n\nWe are well on our way to achieving our 2030 target of 68% clinker factor in our cementitious products by utilizing several strategies. We use supplementary cementitious materials, like calcined clays, to reduce embodied CO\u2082 process emissions and CO\u2082 emissions associated with clinker production. In 2023, we increased our production of blended cement to almost 82%, a 7% increase against 2022.\n\nClinker Factor (percentage)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decarbonated Raw Materials in Clinker\n\nIn 2023, we used 4% of decarbonated raw materials in our raw mix, which is equivalent to avoiding more than 660,000 tons of CO\u2082 in all our global operations. Compared to 2022, we registered a 14% increase in the consumption rate of decarbonated raw materials across our operations. In our European operations, we achieved close to 10% of decarbonated raw materials use, positioning this region at the forefront of carbon emissions reductions in our global operations.\n\n## Thermal Efficiency\n\nCemex has researched low-temperature and low-CO\u2082 clinkers for more than 20 years, successfully developing novel clinkers with a 10% to 20% lower CO\u2082 footprint. We have introduced these clinkers in a significant number of our cement plants, primarily in Mexico and Europe. Availability of required raw materials to produce new clinkers can be challenging in some locations; however, we are committed to investing in the development of innovative clinkers with a smaller CO\u2082 footprint, actively scouting potential sources of key input materials, and leveraging our global footprint to unlock the scalable solutions across our regions.\n\nBy adjusting the traditional composition of clinker and using special mineralizers in the raw mix, these technologies significantly reduce the energy intensity of clinker production, and utilize a di/fferent chemical reaction to release less CO\u2082 compared to ordinary Portland Cement. Thermal e/fficiency is further enhanced by improving the quality of alternative fuels and employing supporting technologies, such as hydrogen injection. We collaborate closely with our alternative fuel suppliers, equipping our plants to promote lower heat consumption and more stable operations.",

APPENDIX\n\nWe continue working on innovation and emerging transportation technologies so we can achieve our goal of becoming a net-zero CO\u2082 company by 2050.\n\n## Driving Down our Own Fleet's Emissions\n\nAs one of the largest ready-mix concrete companies in the world, reducing our transport emissions is vital for addressing climate change, reducing our CO\u2082 footprint, and achieving our 2050 net-zero target. Our multi-pronged approach accelerates our use of available proven transport technologies, such as lower-carbon trucks and renewable fuels, and increases collaborations to discover, pilot, learn, and scale long-term solutions like hybrid and zero-emission vehicles. Our comprehensive transport strategy is clear: Decarbonize our global fleet, which is part of our Scope 1 (direct) emissions and decarbonize our transportation services, as part of the e/fforts to reduce our Scope 3 (indirect) emissions.\n\n## Decarbonizing our Global Fleet\n\nWe now have more than 1,000 heavy-duty trucks powered by lower-carbon fuels. In 2023 alone, we added nearly 473 lower-carbon trucks, mostly concrete mixer trucks powered by low-emission compressed natural gas or renewable natural gas. Over half of these vehicles were deployed in Mexico, with the remaining half split between California and Colombia. These trucks have a carbon footprint approximately 25% lower than the diesel trucks they replaced and have resulted in a 5% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions across our owned fleet. This aligns with our commitment to reduce third-party transport emissions by 30% by 2030, compared to our 2020 baseline.\n\nRenewable Fuels: We are expanding the use of renewable diesel. It is fully compatible with our current fleet and can reduce 60% to 80% of the carbon footprint from transport when used in 100% concentrations. Our operations in California are leading this e/ffort, with close to 70% of its fleet using renewable diesel fuel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nZero-Emission Solutions: Along with strategic suppliers, we are accelerating the development of fully-electric on-highway trucks and now have five fully-electric units operating in Germany, Dubai, and Mexico. We have also deployed close to 500 hybrid or zero-emissions vehicles in our sales fleet, mostly in Europe.\n\nElectromobility Solutions: At COP28 in Dubai, we unveiled a fully-electric mixer truck, the first of its kind in the Middle East and the only one developed in our industry for this region. Earlier in the year, we announced that Volvo Trucks had supplied us with the world's first fully-electric and zero-emission heavy concrete mixer truck. We have completed several multi-country pilots using fully-electric ready-mix concrete trucks.\n\nWhile fully electric heavy-duty trucks are not yet widely available on an industrial scale, Cemex is actively collaborating with multiple original equipment manufacturers to advance net-zero transportation technologies. We expect to gradually continue introducing and testing new prototypes for zero-emission ready-mix concrete trucks to our fleet.\n\n## First Movers Coalition Founding Member\n\nCemex is one of 35 founding members of the World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition (FMC), which brings together global businesses to create market demand for zero-carbon solutions while scaling emerging technologies. FMC members are committed to zero emissions by 2030 in 30% of their heavy-duty on-highway transport purchases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

APPENDIX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our 2030 targets validated by SBTi, we strive to reduce by more than half our specific Scope 2 emissions, aiming to emit no more than 24 kgCO 2 /ton of cementitious product.\n\n## Carbon Emissions from Concrete Production\n\nTo reinforce our goal to fully decarbonize all of our business lines, we have established an intermediate 2030 target to reach a 30% reduction in net CO2 emissions in the cement used to produce a cubic meter of concrete compared to our 2020 baseline. By 2023, we achieved a 16% reduction from 2020 levels, primarily through enhancements to our ready-mix composition, maintaining the strength and performance our markets expect.\n\n## Scope 2: Clean Electricity\n\nIn 2023, we achieved 36% clean electricity consumption in our cement plants. This achievement demonstrates our e/fforts toward increasing clean electricity utilization and translates into a tangible reduction in our indirect emissions.\n\nOur 2030 target as validated by SBTi under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario is to reduce our Scope 2 emissions by 58% from our 2020 baseline, so that we would be emitting no more than 24 kgCO2 per ton of cementitious material. To achieve this goal, we expect to reach a 65% share of clean electricity sources in our electricity supply mix by 2030. As of December 2023, our Scope 2 specific emissions were reduced 12% compared to our 2020 baseline. Cemex aims to achieve its 2030 goal by developing grid-connected and onsite renewable energy generation, including waste heat recovery facilities in our cement kilns, contracting long-term clean electricity supply through physical and virtual power purchase agreements, leveraging clean electricity supply o/ffers from our suppliers, and using instruments such as energy attribute certificates.\n\nTo help us increase the use of clean electricity, a key component in mitigating Scope 2 emissions, we established several new partnerships and made progress on specific initiatives and projects in 2023.\n\nPoland: Cemex signed an eight-year agreement to purchase clean electricity from Statkraft starting in 2025 to cover about 30% of the electric power required for our cement operations in Poland.\n\nSpain: We entered into a 10-year agreement with Acciona Energ\u00eda to supply our cement operations in Spain with renewable electricity.\n\nColombia: We pursued two crucial agreements: a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for renewable energy directly powering our cement plant from a solar installation and a separate 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) supplying our Colombian cement operations from a solar park.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR\u00ae Partner of the Year for Fifth Straight Year\n\nIn 2023, our U.S. operations were named EPA ENERGY STAR\u00ae Partner of the Year, marking its fifth consecutive year receiving this recognition. The company was awarded the Sustained Excellence in Energy Management Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy-the highest honor among ENERGY STAR\u00ae awards. The award puts Cemex's U.S. operations among a distinguished group of companies that have made long-term commitments to fight climate change and advance energy e/fficiency.\n\nOver the last 15 years, our U.S. operations have received more than 60 ENERGY STAR certifications, and dozens of its cement terminals and ready-mix concrete operations have achieved the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry.",

APPENDIX\n\n## creating a circular economy starts with us\n\nA circular economy demands that society reduce waste, conserve resources, and minimize environmental impact. We know this starts with us, and it's why we've designed our manufacturing processes to become waste consumers and actively reduce our CO 2 emissions.\n\nCircular economy solutions help us break free from the linear take-make-waste model by reducing waste and pollution and keeping materials and products in use for longer. We aim to maximize the use of non-recyclable waste and byproducts with a particular focus on three waste streams: 1) municipal and industrial; 2) construction, demolition, and excavation waste (CDEW); and 3) industry byproducts.\n\nWe utilize the waste streams in three of our climate action decarbonization levers: Alternative fuels, clinker substitution, and alternative raw materials.\n\nOurs is one of the few industries that can repurpose waste e/fficiently and e/ffectively. In 2023, Cemex repurposed close to 28 million tons of waste, which is about the same amount of waste collected across all of England in a year. By 2030, we aim to increase the amount of waste and byproducts we repurpose by more than 50%.\n\n## Benefits of a Circular Economy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduces demand for virgin raw materials\n\nDecreases carbon emissions\n\nAvoids methane emissions from landfills\n\nPreserves nature and biodiversity\n\nImproves resource efficiency\n\nCreates new business opportunities\n\n## Our Circular Economy Breakthroughs\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in waste management solutions, Cemex launched Regenera in 2023 as a business line specialized in providing circularity solutions to extend the life cycle of products and materials by reusing them into value-added products.

In 2023, we recovered approximately 9 million tons of CDEW, marking an 5% increase over 2022.\n\n## Gennevilliers Circularity Platform\n\nOur Gennevilliers Circularity Platform in Paris celebrated its fourth anniversary in 2023 and is an ideal example of managing CDEW. When the platform began, it managed approximately 250,000 tons of CDEW generated by our customers and own operations. Today, the operation manages more than 2.1 million tons of materials, such as rubble, demolition waste, excavated material, and inert soil.\n\n- l Supplied 15,000 tons of recycled aggregates used to develop four fields for the 2024 Olympic Games\n- l Sold approximately 28% of the managed material as recycled aggregates\n- l Provided concrete recycling and soil management for Line 15 Grand Paris Express project\n- l Completed restructuring of the Parisian port site dedicated to the circular economy, enhancing Gennevilliers' waste management capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other Waste and Industry Byproducts\n\nWe value waste byproducts from other industrial processes as alternative raw materials. This helps our partners reduce waste in their operations, and enables Cemex to preserve natural resources and reduce its CO\u2082 footprint. Together we can protect the environment and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nIn 2023, we replaced more than 11 million tons of raw materials with alternative byproducts and waste from other industries. In the cement production process, we can replace part of the clinker with byproducts, including fly ash and slag. In the readymix concrete production process, we can recycle materials to use as cement substitutes.\n\nIn our operations, we aim to maximize the reuse of cement kiln dust in the production loop. When this process is not possible, we make e/fforts to recover this byproduct for other uses such as soil or road stabilization, fertilizer enhancer, or de-icing agent for roads. Furthermore, with our range of admixture products Isocycle, we can transform the waste concrete into a value-added material that can be reintroduced into the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of the end of 2022, Cemex's 4/22 coarse recycled aggregate was the first and only recycled aggregate in France to receive the NF Certificate.",

We monitor and prioritize our operations by establishing action plans to generate positive outcomes for nature and society.\n\nWe know climate is deeply linked to nature, and we do our part to conduct our business responsibly and sustainably. We aim to keep our land, oceans, freshwater and atmosphere  healthy for future generations.\n\n## Water\n\nWater is humanity's most precious resource. It is also a key input in ready-mix concrete, and is needed to produce cement and aggregates as well as to cool, remove dust, and clean. That's why we are moving to develop water system maintenance\n\nroutines, install water recycling systems, and monitor discharge quality, particularly in sites with the highest water related risks and the most significant commercial impact to our operations.\n\n## Water Action Plans (WAPs)\n\nUsing our Water Stress Map Assessment, we identify operations located in water-stressed zones and develop a Water Action Plan (WAP). These plans mitigate water risks by adopting recommendations based on the Water Risk Filter tool from the World Wildlife Foundation.\n\n## Water Stress Map Assessment\n\nOur Water Stress Map Assessment, performed in 2020 in collaboration with the University of Alcal\u00e1 Foundation in Spain, analyzed the water stress level of 1,500-plus cement, ready-mix, and aggregates sites. Using the Aqueduct, an online tool run by the World Resources Institute, provided us with information on water quantity and quality and regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nSites Included in Cemex's Water Stress Map Assessment (sites by business)*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n64\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREADY-MIX CONCRETE\n\n>\n\n1,235\n\nAGGREGATES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n235\n\n1% of our operations are located in extremely high water-stressed zones\n\n15% of our operations are located in high water-stressed zones\n\n30 %\n\nof our operations located in waterstressed zones, comprising sites in extremely high and high water-stressed zones, have implemented Water Action Plans as of December 2023\n\n*Sites at the time of the assessment",

By increasing our use of wastewater from other industries, such as bottling and beverages, or wastewater from treatment plants, or by collecting and recovering rainwater, we are meeting our goals and reducing the climate change pressure on this valuable resource.\n\n## Freshwater Use by the Numbers\n\nTotal Water (million m 3 )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWITHDRAWALS\n\n52.5\n\nCONSUMPTION\n\n38.4\n\nTotal Consumption by Product\n\n255 l/ton\n\nCEMENT\n\nREADY-MIX\n\nAGGREGATES\n\n233 l/m 3\n\n135 l/ton\n\n2030 Targets on Specific Freshwater Withdrawals Reduction (percentage)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEMENT 20\n\nAGGREGATES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n15\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREADY-MIX CONCRETE\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasing the Use of Non-Freshwater Across Our Operations\n\nCemex is working with the sustainability consulting firm Environmental Resources Management to develop a global zero freshwater and zero discharge framework and an associated measurement protocol. These will be used to assess progress and communicate in a transparent and accurate manner on this material topic, while at the same time promoting the replacement of withdrawn freshwater with alternative sources and zero wastewater discharge. These actions will be implemented in our di/fferent business line plants.\n\n## Using Alternative Water Sources in Mexico\n\nOur operations in Mexico are rapidly replacing freshwater with alternative water sources in our ready-mix plants. In 2022, all our ready-mix operations in the Monterrey area replaced 100% of their fresh or potable water consumption with non-freshwater and/or rainwater sources. In 2023, we extended this same successful practice, reaching 100% in the ready-mix operations in Canc\u00fan, La Paz, Los Cabos, Cuernavaca, and Le\u00f3n, and reaching a 49% rate of freshwater substitution in the ready-mix line of business across the Mexico region.",

The goal is to help restore the ecosystem services to where they were before extraction.\n\n- Lastly,\n\n## Compensation\n\nfor any part of the impact area that could not be restored or rehabilitated, compensation is sought with a Biodiversity Action Plan.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nOur biodiversity strategy focuses on enhancing biodiversity in and around our quarries, conservation initiatives, and development of local Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs). Our Biodiversity Policy guides us to be responsible stewards of our natural resources. It integrates our practices with the highest standards and aligns our biodiversity initiatives with our decision-making process, management system, and business model. Our policy is aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) sustainability guidelines, giving us confidence in our continuous work toward protecting and enhancing the natural environment beyond our operations.\n\n## Quarry Rehabilitation Plans\n\nQuarry rehabilitation is a crucial process that aims to restore and enhance the natural environment after quarrying activities. It begins with an initial site assessment, followed by the development and implementation of a biodiversity management plan, and concludes with  reporting and performance measurement. As of 2023, 100% of all active quarries have a rehabilitation plan in place.\n\n## Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs)\n\nCemex recognizes the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the importance of protecting biodiversity across our operations. To this end, our BAPs guide operational sites to incorporate biodiversity management into their standard processes. As of 2023, the 40 sites located in high biodiversity value areas detected in our original 2010 proximity study have implemented a BAP. The 2021 updated proximity study detected 26 new priority sites with high biodiversity value, representing a 72% advance in our 2030 goal of having BAPs in place in 100% of active sites identified as High Priority.\n\n## Biodiversity Proximity Study Achievements\n\n## 72 %\n\nof our quarries located in high biodiversity value areas have Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) in place\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npriority species have benefited from BAPs\n\n+\n\n100\n\n## + 25,000\n\nhectares of area positively impacted by conservation projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconservation groups and stakeholders identified and engaged\n\n~\n\n100\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstudents engaged in environmental education\n\n## Third-Party Certifications\n\nOur strategic approach extends beyond our BAPs in high-priority quarries and seeks third-party certifications for our conservation e/fforts in sites not in highvalue biodiversity areas. Our conservation activities bring our employees and communities together in wildlife enhancement initiatives and foster awareness of how industry and natural habitats can coexist.\n\nWe currently have 60 sites in six countries with third-party conservation certifications. These certifications are issued by leading environmental organizations such as the Wildlife Habitat Council, ECOCERT, Texan by Nature, and Croatia's Ministry of Environment and Energy, among others.\n\n## Wildlife Habitat Council Certifies Florida Sites\n\nEight Cemex sites in Florida are certified by the Wildlife Habitat Council, encompassing 28 active projects related to biodiversity conservation or biodiversity training conducted with community members within each quarry. These sites are Brooksville South Cement Plant and Quarry, Center Hill Quarry, 474 Sand Mine, Gator Sand Mine, Lake Wales Sand Mine, Alico Quarry, FEC Quarry, and the Miami Cement Plant.\n\nEducational Projects - Provide hands-on learning opportunities aligned with Florida educational and science standards and complement classroom learning. Cemex provides or reimburses the schools for materials and provides bus transportation for students.\n\nHabitat Projects - The Uplands Scrub Habitat, adjacent to the classroom at the Lake Wales Sand Mine, introduces students to native plants and animals by showcasing them during their visit.\n\nEarth Day Celebrations - Create awareness and community engagement. Center Hill's Earth Day Celebration teaches 1,100-plus residents about sustainability, showcases the limestone quarry through tours, and provides a platform for performances from local students.",

APPENDIX\n\n## Nature Positive Strategy\n\nWe continue to define nature-positive baselines for all our operations with plans to demonstrate relevant progress by 2030. We are working towards restoring ecosystems to help nature recover in all our quarries by 2050. As of December 2023, we already have 42 sites with a nature positive baseline which represents 15% of our total active quarries.\n\nIn the U.K., Cemex is actively aligned with the Nature Positive Initiative, working to 'Halt and Reverse Nature Loss by 2030 on a 2020 baseline and achieve full recovery by 2050.' For the U.K. pilot, we assessed the impacts of our operations using Biodiversity Pressure Points - land use change, climate change, pollution, responsible consumption, and invasive species.\n\nOur key actions to deliver nature-positive outcomes include:\n\n- l Mapping habitats on our landholdings, establishing a 2020 baseline.\n- l Aligning nature targets with the company's netzero CO2 by 2050 commitment.\n- l Implementing measures to reduce pollution with specific targets in place.\n- l Evaluating our dependence on nature using a Natural Capital Accounting tool.\n- l Incorporating guidance and actions in Biodiversity Plans to responsibly remove invasive species.\n\nIn 2023, we mapped 12 sites (10 in the U.K. and two in Croatia) with plans to complete European operations by the end of 2024 and the remaining sites within the next two years. This data will be used to measure and increase natural habitat areas, contributing to our BAPs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Cemex Nature Book Series Celebrates 30th Anniversary\n\nIn 2023, we proudly celebrated the 30th edition of the Cemex Nature Book Collection: The Last Ice. Through inspiring images of majestic frozen landscapes, this milestone edition emphasizes the urgent need to protect our polar region and mitigate climate change.\n\nReaders travel to the most remote, extraordinarily beautiful frozen lands in The Last Ice.

For every hectare of global active operations, we keep seven hectares of conservation land in El Carmen Nature Reserve, one of the most biodiversity-rich areas in North America and one of the five greatest wilderness ecosystems in the world.\n\nSince 2016, El Carmen has received the Gold Conservation Certificate, the highest award granted by The Wildlife Habitat Council for conservation e/fforts.\n\n## Successful Reintroduction of the American Bison\n\nAfter an absence of more than 100 years, the American bison runs again in the Coahuila plains in Mexico.\n\nCemex's conservation e/fforts in the El Carmen Nature Reserve reached the goal of completing the first complete breeding cycle of the American bison in this location. In 2023, the first 100% native bison o/ffsprings of the reserve were born. These specimens are descended from other calves that were born in the reserve during 2020, whose parents were the first bison reintroduced in El Carmen as part of the e/ffort to conserve the species in North America.\n\nThe reintroduction of the American bison is one of Cemex's transcendental projects in terms of rewilding and biodiversity conservation. Presently, there are 94 bison in the El Carmen Nature Reserve, with a medium-term goal to increase their population to 300.\n\nPhoto by: Melissa Groo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rewilding El Carmen Nature Reserve\n\nWith 130,000 hectares located in northern Coahuila, Mexico, and southern Texas, United States, our El Carmen Nature Reserve has five di/fferent ecosystems and is home to more than 1,500 plant species, 289 avian species, 81 types of reptiles and amphibians, and 80 mammal species, including some endemic species.

APPENDIX\n\n## Air Quality\n\nIn 2023, 99% of our clinker production was subject to Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS), mainly for our major emissions, Particulate Matter (PM), Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), and Sulfur Oxide (SOx), regardless of whether or not this was required by state or local regulations. It is not only a monitoring tool, but also a benchmark tool to share best practices and allows our operators to closely monitor major air emissions in kilns and analyze trends and action points.\n\n## Emissions Abatement by the Numbers\n\nMajor air emissions - PM, NOx, and SOx - are released as part of the cement manufacturing process. Minor air emissions-including volatile organic compounds, dioxins and furans and other heavy metals-are released in small quantities.\n\n## Progress Toward Our 2030 Air Emissions Reductions Targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 85 %\n\n## 68 %\n\n## 42 %\n\nwe reduced our PM emissions compared to our 2005 baseline. 2030 target: 95%\n\nwe reduced our SOx emissions compared to our 2005 baseline. 2030 target: 67%\n\nwe reduced our NOx emissions compared to our 2005 baseline. 2030 target: 47%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continually invest in high quality emissions abatement techniques and equipment.\n\n## US$ 14 million\n\ninvested in 2023 in technologies to monitor and reduce air emissions from our production process\n\n## 99%\n\nof our clinker is produced in kilns with CEMS to measure major air emissions and our industrybenchmark online data analyzing tool\n\n## Cemex Environmental Management System\n\nOur risk-based Environmental Management System (EMS) systematically audits internal compliance with our environmental policy across all our global operations. EMS is aligned with global environmental standards such as the ISO 14001 and the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, allowing us to achieve ISO 14001 certification in 83% of our cement sites. This past year, we implemented EMS in 91% of our businesses, compliant with our internal environmental management standard.\n\n## Environmental and Social Performance Management\n\nOur EMS integrates environmental performance, impact assessment, stakeholder engagement, and response to events with input from a range of subject matter experts. Our Environmental and Social Incident Reporting process enables our global sites to maintain open communication with our communities where we operate, as well as have a proactive approach to incident response. It also serves as a grievance mechanism to register complaints from external stakeholders.\n\n## Environmental and Social Incident Reporting Framework\n\nOur standardized framework recognizes and registers incidents in three categories according to their severity: major, moderate and minor. Last year marked the fifth consecutive year during which no major (Category 1) environmental events were registered.\n\n- l Dialogue and Engagement: We work to maintain open communication channels with our neighbors, law enforcement o/fficials, public agencies, and other stakeholders.\n- l Rapid Response: Global, regional, and local Rapid Response Teams are trained to address environmental and social impact events and hold annual emergency drills according to contingency plans at each of our sites.\n- l Continuous Improvement: We consistently record events at every level of our business to identify recurring root causes as well as implement and share corrective actions.\n\n## Environmental and Social Incidents and Complaints Reporting (percentage)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regardless of one's role with Cemex - whether an employee, contractor, supplier, or community member- we strive for everyone to return home safely to their family every day.\n\nIn 2023, we continued strengthening our three health and safety focus areas:\n\n- l Zero4Life We are committed to a work environment with zero injuries. For the past nine years, our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate has been between 0.5 and 0.6, a positive industry benchmark.\n- l Health & Safety Culture Our standardized global programs instill consistency across geographies and highlight local best practices, so we all learn from each other and foster a common principle of care.\n- l Global Well-Being Four pillars underscore Global Well-Being at Cemex: Emotional and physical health, financial fitness, and workforce experience. Our goal is to support employees and to help them live a happy and healthy life inside and outside of work.\n\n## Our Zero4Life Commitment\n\nZero injuries across our business. That's our goal. With our passionate commitment to health and safety, we continue to lead the industry in safety. In 2023, our employee lost time injury (LTI) frequency rate was 0.6, and we had a 31% reduction in contractor LTIs in the year. We had zero incidents across 96% of our global operations. These results provide both motivation and clear evidence that our continuous improvement commitment is producing positive outcomes, yet we will not be satisfied until we achieve zero injuries across all our operations.\n\nWe have a wide range of strategies that start with integrating health and safety into all operational levels and are framed by our global policy and management system. We monitor leading and lagging indicators, implement regional and local initiatives, and adopt best practices, all in the spirit of continuous improvement.\n\nIn addition to our approval and Health & Safety induction process for all contractors, our Contractor Health & Safety Verification program helps us verify that all contractors are qualified and able to comply with health and safety processes while working with us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe that a strong health and safety culture directly contributes to SDG 8 and supports SDG 9 by promoting responsible industrialization, resilience, and innovation. It also aligns with SDG 11 by establishing safe workplaces that enhance the overall well-being of urban areas and human settlements.\n\nCemex is a positive safety benchmark for a global company in our industry. *\n\n0.5-0.6\n\nEmployee LTI Frequency Rate for the past nine years\n\n96 %\n\nof our operations achieved zero employee and contractor LTIs in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n31 %\n\nreduction in number of contractor LTIs in 2023\n\n*As per an internal analysis utilizing publicly available information conducted for companies within the global cement and concrete industry.\n\n- More about our Contractor H&S Verification program on page 84 of this report",

From our management approach and systems to our policies and procedures to our training, we have standardized our programs across geographies, leading to innovation and consistency globally. We place great importance on how we manage this top priority.\n\n## Integrating Health & Safety Into Our Business Health & Safety Management\n\nOur interconnected organizational structure fosters a coordinated, consistent, and collaborative approach to reach our company-wide goal of zero injuries. It starts with our CEO who oversees our health and safety strategy and performance. Our Board of Directors regularly reviews our health and safety performance. Every year, the Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact, and Diversity Committee discusses action plans and evaluates health and safety risks. Weekly health and safety performance and monthly result recaps keep our country, regional, and corporate leaders updated on our progress.\n\nUsing standardized controls and procedures, our Health & Safety team monitors our progress in the countries where we operate. We have a robust organizational structure and working groups that supervise, report on performance, and share best practices across the company through a coordinated, consistent, and collaborative approach.\n\n- l Health & Safety Functional Network: Health and safety trained company specialists and their teams.\n- l Global Health & Safety Council: Corporate and regional representatives who support our Health & Safety Functional Network.\n- l Global Health Forum: Group of internal experts leading initiatives to share best practices and help other employees and contractors adopt healthier lifestyles.\n\n## Performance Management\n\nOur Cemex Health & Safety Management System (HSMS) empowers our leaders to implement a successful health and safety strategy and adequately allocate resources to training programs across our operations. Our line managers utilize our HSMS for annual self-assessments and for developing annual Health & Safety Improvement Plans for their teams. The system defines performance requirements and goals in accordance with local regulations, helping us assess potential risks and plan mitigation measures. Communication tools are embedded in the system and allow us to share best practices with our operations employees and contractors.\n\nManagement of Pandemics and Epidemics\n\nUnderpinned by a strong emphasis on leadership and accountability, Cemex management is responsible for validating that health and safety is our overriding priority. The company's management also validates that we plan, implement, monitor, and review the e/ffectiveness of controls aimed at eliminating or minimizing risks to our workforce or those a/ffected by our business activities.\n\nEvery Cemex site has the HSMS in place, and most of our cement sites are certified by ISO standard 45001, an international standard that sets out the criteria for an occupational health and safety management system and provides a framework for organizations to identify, manage, and continually improve their health and safety performance. This standard helps us establish a systematic approach to occupational health and safety and fosters employee well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->",

LEADING WITH INTEGRITY\n\n7. APPENDIX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Policies and Procedures\n\nOur Global Health & Safety Policy is the foundation for our health and safety commitment and the cornerstone of our HSMS. This policy establishes clear expectations for all levels within our organization and is applicable to all of our operations. It outlines how to conduct activities that care for the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and those in the communities where we operate. Additionally, it reinforces communication with suppliers, performance reports, and incident investigations. This global policy is applied in all our operations.\n\nThe HSMS undergoes regular audits through the Corporate Governance Health & Safety Audits program. This global program conducts cross-regional audits in multiple local operations annually. Operations with implemented HSMS can achieve external certification according to the ISO 45001 standard. This program generates a dynamic of continuous improvement and good practice sharing in health and safety topics across our operations.\n\n## Learn more about our policies in our website\n\n## Training & Collaboration\n\nContinuous training of our workforce represents a strategic investment in empowering and cultivating a highly trained and safety-conscious global workforce that transcends compliance. We continually update our training programs so our employees have the knowledge, skills, and experience to perform their jobs safely.\n\nIn 2023, we created the Health & Safety Leadership Development Process to enhance leadership skills among operational line managers and supervisors. This initiative includes identifying strengths and opportunities, implementing development plans, and aligning health and safety capabilities with career pathways. Following three successful pilots, we plan to implement this program across our regions in 2024.\n\n## Cemex University Health & Safety Academy\n\nsupports our unwavering commitment to carrying out our activities in a safe and healthy manner and to care for the well-being of our employees, contractors, and everyone we may interact with as a result of our activities.\n\nCompletion of the Cemex University Health & Safety Academy is a requirement for executives, line managers, plant supervisors, and corporate o/ffice supervisors. This program strives to achieve a comprehensive understanding of responsibilities and accountability, reinforcing our health and safety culture and practices within their teams. Regular refreshers are conducted as needed to maintain and enhance this commitment.\n\n## +7,500\n\ncourses were completed by our employees during 2023\n\nTopics covered in the courses include Health & Safety Leadership, Importance of People, Processes, and Facilities to manage H&S, Incidents' Root Cause Analysis, Key Elements for Supervisors to Manage Operations according to the HSMS, and Becoming Proficient in our HSMS.\n\nComplementing our safety initiatives, the Visible Felt Leadership (VFL) practice creates a structured platform for leaders to actively connect with frontline employees and contractors, fostering open communication on health and safety matters. In 2023, our leaders engaged in nearly 283,000 VFL onsite interactions, underscoring our dedication to transparent dialogue and the ongoing improvement of safety practices. Over the past decade, VFL has consistently delivered benefits such as heightened safety awareness, improved incident reporting, and enhanced safety culture.\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our commitment to include an online version of VFL training for our leaders. This platform reinforces e/ffective onsite engagements while also covering the broader concept of VFL requirements on a day-to-day basis. The versatility of VFL o/ffers general benefits, including improved safety communication, strengthened leadership engagement, and a proactive safety culture that resonates throughout the workforce.\n\n## 283,000\n\nVFL onsite interactions between leaders and front-line workers",

This collaborative approach reinforces our safety culture, enhancing workplace consistency and reliability. On average, each worker engages in around five such interactions monthly, showcasing a widespread commitment to a safe working environment.\n\nInitiated in 2021, the Take 5 Together program includes comprehensive training across all operations, embedding a pre-task personal risk assessment for safer work practices. Take 5 Together not only strengthens our safety culture but also enables active contributions to a safe and reliable workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety Is Everyone's Responsibility\n\n## Near Miss/Hazard Alert System\n\nCemex continues its decades-long practice of actively involving employees and contractors in controlling risk and preventing incidents. Our Near Miss/ Hazard Alert System advises management of potential health and safety risks by those who see it firsthand. Our Intelex App allows for near-miss reporting hazards, inspections, and health and safety leadership visits - anytime, anywhere -  enabling prompt reactions to prevent injuries. For o/ffline workers, we've introduced an additional mobile Zero4Life solution and anticipate it will provide the same capability to capture near-misses and hazard alerts.\n\nOur global procedures include guidelines to investigate work-related injuries, occupational diseases, and incidents. The goal is to learn from previous occurrences and replicate these learnings in all our sites. Root-cause analysis of injuries and occupational health cases will help us learn from past incidents, yet we want to do more. We are tracking new predictive safety indicators designed to monitor and measure the e/ffectiveness of our initiatives, identify hotspots, and develop preventative actions. All data has been integrated into our Global Health & Safety indicators dashboard, allowing for greater learnings and insights across our operations.\n\n## Streamlined Global Corporate Governance Audits\n\nOur annual corporate governance audit program evaluates an average of 40 global operational sites each year, ensuring comprehensive coverage across all countries within a three-year cycle. An 'operational site' is not restricted to a single location and encompasses operations that may involve multiple sites or facilities, such as concrete plants. The primary objective is to conduct an independent assessment of compliance within our health and safety management system, providing valuable feedback and improvement recommendations.\n\n## Leveraging Our Expertise to Protect Vulnerable Road Users\n\nJust as we adopt innovative approaches to safety for our drivers and contractors, we are doing the same for motorists, motorcyclists, cyclists, pedestrians, and other vulnerable road users. We draw on our knowledge and collaborate with others to promote best practices in the communities where we operate. Working with educational institutions, tra/ffic authorities, community groups, and civil society organizations, we implement awareness campaigns on road safety, regulation compliance, and accident prevention. Tapping our best and brightest, Cemex employees teach defensive driving and the importance of road safety basics to members of these communities while explaining the safety features of our vehicles.\n\nIn Colombia, for example, over 50,000 people participated in awareness campaigns involving vulnerable road users and stakeholders. The initiative extended to approximately 2,000 motorcyclists from leading delivery companies, fostering alliances with government entities, motorcycle manufacturers, and transportation companies.\n\nWe go beyond training and leverage technologies to advance our Zero4Life goals. Our trucks are equipped with vehicle sensors, camera systems, mobile apps, and GPS tracking, crucial elements in safeguarding vulnerable road users. These features aim not only to meet but to exceed local legislative requirements, exemplifying our dedication to exceeding safety standards.",

Our learnings from these tests in Mexico will allow us to optimize functionality and e/fficiency.\n\n## Mobile and Digital Solutions\n\nIn 2023, we continued to expand our safety processes by developing mobile and digital solutions. These solutions allow our workers to use their mobile devices to register safety procedures before starting any task or to capture near misses, unsafe conditions, or acts. We expect to continue to implement these solutions in all the countries where we operate.\n\n## Virtual Reality Training in the Dominican\n\nRepublic We have introduced a Virtual Reality safety training program in the Dominican Republic. This initiative focuses on high-risk tasks like working at heights, isolating machinery, and safety essentials for frontline supervisors and workers. Through immersive simulations, participants experience tasks, make real-time decisions, and grasp consequences in a controlled environment, complementing our traditional safety methods.\n\nDrone Usage in Mexico In 2023, our operations in Mexico implemented drone usage to enhance site safety, road safety, and training. This initiative prevents worker exposure to highrisk tasks like working at heights by enabling inspections of roofs and tall structures. It also aids in identifying road safety risks, o/ffering an aerial perspective on dangerous routes or truck accesses before material delivery. Utilizing aerial footage of operations and vehicle maneuvers enhances worker training for safer task execution, mitigating potential incidents.\n\nSafety Assistance Systems in Europe Cemex is reinforcing its commitment to health and safety across European admixture facilities with the installation of innovative safety assistance systems. The technology includes a reverse assist camera for forklift trucks, detecting pedestrians and automatically reducing speed in case of danger. This safety guard system also projects warnings at building gates, enhancing awareness for pedestrians and other forklift operators. Following successful trials in Germany, implementation has commenced in the U.K., with further plans for a broader rollout in the region in 2024. The initiative aligns with Cemex's dedication to workplace safety and innovation, receiving positive feedback from employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Telematics\n\nTelematics data provides real-time information about trucks and drivers' conditions. Linked to our Transportation Control Tower in Mexico, geofencing technologies and telematic data provide information about driver fatigue and distractions, speeding, route deviations, and vehicle maintenance. By the end of 2023, this realtime data was available for 99% of our company-owned vehicles, 87% of contractor vehicles in Mexico's supply chain area, and almost all of Cemex's light vehicles.",

With our Future in Action program as the foundation, we continue to address organizational design, tie a portion of variable compensation to the achievement of our CO2 reduction goals, and promote sustainability training. This approach propels us toward our environmental objectives and serves as a powerful engagement tool, fostering a shared commitment to a sustainable future.\n\n## Enhanced Organizational Design\n\nIn 2023, we created a robust organizational design to better support our Future in Action goals across the company. We refined our operating and technical teams to address specific roadmaps, initiatives, and processes in our Future in Action program. We expect to continue to evolve and enhance our structure so we may accelerate actions that help us meet our climate targets.\n\n## Executive Variable Compensation\n\nSince 2022, we've enhanced our Executive Variable Compensation program to include our ambitious carbon reduction goals as a variable. We also expanded the program to incentivize more than 4,500 eligible executives, which represents 10% of our global workforce. Our goal: Steer the company in reaching its organization-wide sustainability commitment.\n\nWhile regional objectives vary, executing in support of our CO2 targets carries a weighting of +10% or -10% in annual executive variable compensation. The yearly variable compensation for our executives is determined based on both overall business performance and individual performance management outcomes. This includes evaluating employee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nachievement of goals (what) and adherence to values (how).\n\n## Cemex University Sustainability Academy\n\nThe Cemex University Sustainability Academy is designed to connect our employees with our Future in Action strategy and Sustainability goals, providing a common understanding of the envi-\n\nronmental challenges we face and Cemex's agenda to address them.

APPENDIX\n\n## Developing People, Delivering Performance\n\nAttracting, retaining, and developing the best talent requires us to o/ffer accelerated opportunities for growth in a transparent, inclusive, and rewarding environment. Our talent management cycle has a set of three interconnected processes: performance management, talent management, and succession management. Working in concert, these cycles look to maximize our organization's performance potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance Management\n\nOur Performance Management Process cascades goals to the organization, starting with the CEO, aiming to ensure that individual and team goals align with our company values and priorities. We use a 360\u00b0 evaluation, a comprehensive feedback process where supervisors and employees assess performance from multiple perspectives, to assess what they achieved and how they achieved it based on our six corporate values. Our continuous feedback loop empowers our employees\n\nand supervisors to discuss, set, and evaluate performance goals collectively. These collaborative discussions foster personal and professional growth aligned with our evolving organizational needs.\n\n## Talent Review\n\nOur Talent Review Process relies on insights gathered from our performance management results. This process encourages an equitable and thorough evaluation of employees using two criteria: Performance and promotion readiness. Leaders engage in employee discussions and calibration with peers, listening to di/fferent perspectives and defining development plans. This approach provides supervisors with a holistic evaluation of their team members, which is then shared individually during feedback sessions, promoting a culture of continuous improvement.\n\n## Succession Management\n\nSuccession Management leverages insights from the talent review conversations and enables us to build a talented pool of leaders with functional skills and business understanding to successfully implement our strategy. One of our main objectives is to identify and develop people with the potential to fill leadership positions. We strive to o/ffer them opportunities to build experience and capabilities while strengthening our talent pipeline. This allows employees to meet career development expectations, challenges them with new professional development opportunities, and prepares them for future roles.\n\nOur processes also help the company make informed decisions on sta/ffing choices, participation in Leadership Development Programs, and potential challenges or gaps in our global talent needs. Serving as our guide, this leads us toward e/ffective and forward-thinking initiatives while fostering continuous talent development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Competitive Compensation and Benefit Packages\n\nWhen our people have the resources they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives, they bring their best to the workplace. We believe that our competitive compensation and benefits packages are key contributors to a superior workforce experience. We evaluate our local competitiveness, inside and outside our industry, in the markets where we operate every two years. Our learnings help us recognize trends in specialized areas like technology and sustainability and provide benchmarks to ensure we remain competitive to attract and retain talent.\n\nOur benefits programs include health and wellness, financial and retirement, time o/ff and leave, and work-life balance schemes, such as flexible working hours. We constantly monitor and review our benefits o/fferings to ensure we are meeting the needs of our workforce.",

Our emphasis on developing green spaces, services, and\n\ninfrastructure seeks to harmonize the natural and built environments, creating a balanced and sustainable urban landscape.\n\n## Disaster Relief Hubs\n\nNow in its second year, our Disaster Relief Hubs are secure physical sites stocked with essential humanitarian supplies. We have five hubs globally located in the United States, the Philippines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Each Hub is crucial in supporting employees and our local communities during emergencies triggered by climate-related disasters.\n\n## Responding to Hurricane Otis in Mexico\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Otis in Acapulco, Cemex initiated swift disaster relief. Aligned with the emergency relief e/fforts of SEMAR (Mexico's Secretariat of the Navy) and SEDENA (Mexico's Secretariat of National Defense), our immediate response included an investment for humanitarian aid within the first 30 days, providing supplies and food kits to employees and community members, and extending economic support to local institutions.\n\n## Building Resilient Communities\n\nCemex operates 25 Global Community Centers across Colombia, the Philippines, Panama, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the United States. These centers focus on developing new skills and employability competencies, particularly for women and youth, through targeted training sessions.\n\nPhilippines Cemex's emergency preparedness initiative, Batang Alerto, educates school-aged children and communities on weather emergency preparedness, emphasizing community resilience. To date, over 600 people have participated in the program.\n\nEgypt 'My Town is My Home' Clean-Up Campaign: In partnership with the Assiut Governorate and two Community Development Associations, Cemex led the 'My Town is My Home' initiative in Mankabad and Bani-Ghaleb villages, collecting approximately 300 tons of waste. This underscores our commitment to circularity through the waste management program in these villages.\n\nGermany Project Meadow Orchard: R\u00fcdersdorf community members and Cemex employees collaborated on the planting of a meadow orchard in the Museums Park. This initiative provides a haven for 5,000 species, actively supporting the creation of a biodiversity-friendly paradise.\n\nMexico Mission Zero Strategy involves a public platform o/ffering comprehensive road safety training, empowering the community with essential skills. Over 48,400 individuals have benefited as of December 2023.\n\nSpain Since 2017, Cemex has led road safety education in Majorca through the 'PLEASE' platform. Each year, we promote sustainable mobility and responsible transportation practices through training and awareness campaigns. Over the six years of the initiative, we've conducted more than more than 1,000 courses.\n\n## Global Volunteering\n\nCemex takes pride in o/ffering employees flexibility to contribute their time and talents during work hours and weekends. Guided by our Global Volunteering Guidelines, we extend the opportunity to employees' families to join impactful volunteer experiences. Our volunteerism actively contributes to addressing pressing social challenges, and this year's global events brought together employees, communities, and partners to tackle various issues, supporting circularity, community engagement, donations, education, health and safety, infrastructure, and reforestation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+76,300\n\nvolunteer hours registered in 2023\n\n## +10,000\n\nvolunteers participated in over 600 events worldwide",

APPENDIX\n\n## trust, respect, mutual value supplier relationships:\n\n## Contractor Health and Safety Verification\n\nOur dedication to health and safety extends to contractors accessing our sites, underscoring our top priority. The Cemex Contractor Health & Safety Verification Program is crafted to promote that contractors adhere to rigorous health and safety standards and proper training and hold relevant accreditations for their work within Cemex operations. Executed globally in collaboration with specialized firms, we involve all business units to fulfill the program's objectives.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved an impressive 93% contractor health and safety verification rate, surpassing our 85% goal. Contractors are not permitted to work on our premises when they fall short of verification. In specific countries, when necessary, an additional layer of review and approval by the location leader is required before access to our premises is granted. This allows for a thorough and stringent approach to health and safety standards.\n\n## Suppliers' Code of Ethics and Conduct\n\nOur commitment to managing supplier relations in accordance with applicable laws and regulations is rooted in fostering a culture of integrity, honesty, respect, transparency, and open communication that seeks to strengthen our bonds. Aligned with our principles, policies, and values, we promote the understanding and adherence of our suppliers to not only some of our policies but also to the Cemex Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and the Code of Conduct When Doing Business with Us. The latter is embedded in our membership and commitment to the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA).\n\nFurther, our suppliers' acknowledgment of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Code of Conduct when Doing Business with Us, Global Anti-Corruption Policy, and Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy, among other policies and principles, is integral to comply with our suppliers' registration process. In particular, respect for human rights is embedded in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Code of Conduct when Doing Business with Us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ 100\n\nSMEs in our supplier network enabled to develop a sustainability strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur work with our suppliers toward fostering continuous innovation and sustainable practices supports SDG 8 in addition to our priority SDGs 9, 11, and 13.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about our Cemex Code of Conduct When Doing Business with Us.\n\n- Learn more about our Global Policy for Third Parties.",

APPENDIX\n\n## Empowering Local SMEs for Global Decarbonization\n\nOur supply chain, integral to our global decarbonization goals, relies heavily on local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), constituting approximately 60% of our network. Despite leveraging global value chains for production and market targeting, these SMEs could face challenges such as limited capital and technological expertise. Cemex addresses these issues by actively engaging with SMEs, providing tools to support them in their decarbonization journeys, fortifying the supply chain, and promoting a just transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\n## Strengthening Supplier Partnerships\n\nOur supplier programs fortify our relationships and foster collaboration. By striving to align with applicable regulatory standards, we contribute to our supply chain's future and our vision of a more sustainable world. Simultaneously, our dedication empowers SMEs, providing a deep understanding of their role in sustainable development and helping them navigate business risks confidently.\n\nWe believe that companies in our industry should prioritize supporting SMEs within their supply chain to comply with evolving sustainability standards. This collaborative approach not only strengthens the resilience of our supply chain but also underscores our dedication to responsible and sustainable business practices.\n\nLocal small and mediumsized enterprises constitute approximately 60% of our supplier network.\n\n## UNGC Sustainable Supplier Impact Program\n\nIn 2023, we continued setting the pace by participating in the UN Global Compact's Sustainable Supplier Impact Program. Cemex co-led one of the five pilot projects, the only one with global outreach. The program featured unique learning assets and live sessions with sustainability topics such as climate action and sustainability journeys.

Additionally, a new e-sourcing platform module (e-Auctions and e-Requests) was launched in key regions, enabling online negotiations, expanding our supplier base, and streamlining processes.\n\nWe continue automating transactional tasks and redefining procurement tactics, processes, people skills, and support systems to reduce workloads and enable our talent to focus on high-value activities.\n\nWe are also optimizing fleet management across geographies and building our future low-carbon and zero-emissions fleets.\n\n## Enhanced Innovation Collaboration\n\nSuppliers actively contribute ideas to enhance our products, processes, and services through our Smart Innovation Model. We carefully select and implement the most viable concepts, acknowledging and endorsing the contributing suppliers.\n\nThis model promotes collaborative problem-solving, aligning stakeholders to improve our operations. Over the past two years, suppliers in Mexico alone have submitted over 50 ideas, with three recognized for their potential positive impact on the environment, costs, and e/fficiency.\n\n## Global Impact Through Ideas\n\nSince 2006, we've received over 500 ideas from our global and local suppliers, emphasizing the enduring success of our innovation collaboration.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Advancement\n\nOur 2030 target of a 90% critical supplier sustainability assessment is driving proactive measures. We regularly assess suppliers critical to our operations, prioritizing those with the highest spending and potential impact on continuity, encompassing health, safety, and environmental risks.\n\n## Streamlined Assessment Process\n\nIn partnership with a third-party firm, we engage our critical suppliers in a sustainability assessment aligned with ISO 26000 guidelines. Covering social, environmental, health and safety, business ethics, stakeholder relationships, and financial performance standards, this assessment fosters a comprehensive view.\n\n## Dynamic Improvement Framework\n\nUpon analysis of assessment results, the third-party firm presents a detailed report with findings, conclusions, and a proposed action plan to address any identified gaps. Integrated into each supplier's scorecard, this evaluation is periodically updated to prioritize those showcasing progress in their sustainability practices.\n\n## Supplier Sustainability Assessment\n\n(% of critical suppliers spend under our company's procurement scope)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expanding Sustainability Initiatives\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our sustainability e/fforts to cover non-critical all suppliers in a sustainability assessment.

APPENDIX\n\n## Executive Compensation\n\nIn 2023, we paid an aggregate amount of US$71 million in compensation to the members of our Board of Directors and our senior management, of which US$24 million was paid as base compensation and cash-based performance bonuses, including pension and post-employment benefits, and US$47 million corresponded to stock-based long-term compensation. Members of our Board of Directors are compensated in a fixed amount based on participation in meetings of our Board of Directors, which is approved each year at our Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting. The Chairman of our Board of Directors is compensated in a similar manner as our senior management.\n\n## Variable Compensation Plan\n\nThe Variable Compensation Plan available to our senior management takes into account individual performance, as well as metrics that consider their business unit, regional and consolidated global results as compared to the company's specific annual target goals, including certain health and safety and sustainability-related factors.\n\n## Compensation of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.'s Chief Executive Officer and Senior Management *\n\nFull Year 2023-Chief Executive Officer\n\nFull Year 2023-Senior Management\n\n| Salary                                   | 20%   | Salary                                   | 42%   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Short-Term Performance Bonus (Cash)  20% |       | Short-Term Performance Bonus (Cash)  23% |       |\n| Long-Term Performance Bonus              |       | Long-Term Performance Bonus              |       |\n| (Restricted Stock)                       | 40%   | (Restricted Stock)                       | 23%   |\n| Long-Term Performance Shares             | 20%   | Long-Term Performance Shares             | 12%   |\n|                                          | 100%  |                                          | 100%  |\n\nSince 2022, our Variable Compensation Plan includes a new CO2 Emissions Component related to carbon reduction goals that could have an impact ranging from -10% to +10% in the total cash payout of the annual Variable Compensation Plan. Furthermore, in March 2022, we expanded our Variable Compensation Plan to cover more than 4,500 executives. During 2023, the variable compensation payment to employees was US$79.4 million. Following 2022's results, the percentage of variable compensation paid in 2023 was 66.9% of target variable compensation.\n\n## Restricted Stock Incentive Plan\n\nOur senior management receives stock-based compensation by being allocated a specific number of restricted equity securities as variable compensation to be vested over a four-year period. We have three compensation programs that conform to our Restricted Stock Incentive Plan: (1) the Ordinary Plan, whose annual award is calculated based on the result of the gross annual guaranteed compensation of the participants in Dollars as of May 31 of each calendar year, times a management factor that ranges from 12% to 24%, divided by the last 90-day average closing price converted into Dollars of Cemex's CPOs as of June 30 of such calendar year; (2) the Key Value Positions Plan, which includes executives in key-value positions and whose annual award is based on the result of the variable cash compensation bonus in Dollars paid in the prior year to these participants and divided by the last 90-day average closing price, converted into Dollars, of CPOs as of April 15 of each calendar year; and (3) the Performance Plan, a long-term performance plan with compensation based on Cemex's total shareholder return versus peer groups and vesting occurring at the end of three years in a single 100% block.\n\nIn 2023, our Restricted Stock Incentive Plan was amended to allow for the granting and vesting of awards in ADSs, which we expect to begin in 2024. All other terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Incentive Plan remained substantially unchanged.\n\n## Extraordinary Management Grant\n\nOur Extraordinary Management Grant is a retention program o/ffered at the company's sole discretion to a selected number of employees that do not participate in the Ordinary Plan, Key Value Positions Plan or the Performance Plan. Under the Extraordinary Management Grant vesting occurs at the end of three years in a single 100% block, at which time the resulting number of CPOs become unrestricted immediately. Since the Extraordinary Management Grant came into e/ffect in 2022 and there is a three-year vesting period, as of December 31, 2023, no CPOs have vested under the Extraordinary Management Grant.\n\n## Compensation of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.'s Chief Executive Officer and Senior Management\n\nThe base salary of the Chairman of our Board of Directors is 27% fixed and 73% variable. Our executive compensation structure is reviewed every two years by an external firm specializing in multinational risk management, insurance brokerage, and advisory. The total compensation (including fixed and variable compensation) of the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer is approved every year by the Corporate Practices and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which is integrated by three independent Board members.",

The training course covered issues such as fraud, verbal harassment, sexual harassment, conflicts of interest, and the protection of confidential information. This training not only provided tools for ethical decision-making, but also o/ffered a general overview of our ETHOS program. Employees were encouraged to leverage ETHOSline for confidentially addressing ethical concerns.\n\n|

Employees, stakeholders, and third parties can raise issues via available reporting channels, such as our online portal (ETHOSline), email, phone line, or local and global committees. We strongly encourage reporting and maintain a strict no-retaliation policy for those who report in good faith.\n\n## ETHOSline\n\nETHOSline is our institutional reporting mechanism, accessible through our website, mobile devices or our intranet, that is open and free for anyone to use. This secure, confidential, and independent platform is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to both employees and the general public, including third parties, to report any allegations of misconduct anonymously or confidentially. To secure confidentiality, ETHOSline runs on a platform provided by NAVEX Global, a third-party expert on ethics and compliance reporting. Certain reports go directly to\n\nthe company's internal audit area, which directly reports to Cemex's Board of Directors' Audit Committee, comprised exclusively of independent board members.\n\nTo achieve impartial, credible, fair and consistent results, our ETHOS governing bodies must abide by our ETHOS manuals which provide directives and guidelines on how to properly manage reports, complaints, and inquiries received through ETHOSline, with the purpose of guaranteeing an e/ffective end-to-end process. In 2023, 133 executives, who are members of our ETHOS governing bodies, received training on global ethical trends and investigation procedures.\n\nDuring 2023, a total of 1,046 cases were reported through our o/fficial channels, of which approximately 80% were received through ETHOSline, approximately 20% were received through local committees, and less than 1% were received through our Global Ethics and Compliance Committee. Out of those cases, 939 were closed\n\nDuring 2023, we emphasized the importance of our ETHOSline channel to employees by providing transparent summaries of investigation outcomes, reinforcing our commitment to accountability.\n\n## Ethics Cases\n\n(percentage)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- l Employee Relations, Diversity and Workplace Respect\n- l Business Integrity\n- l Misuse, Missappropriation of Corporate Assets\n- l Environmental, Health & Safety\n- l Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting",

As a result of the investigations, 94 employees were dismissed, 43 employees received remedial training, 186 employees were subject to disciplinary action, 29 vendors were prohibited from working with Cemex, 13 vendors were subject to remedial measures, four customers were subject to remedial measures and one customer can no longer have a business relationship with Cemex. Additionally, 75 internal processes and policies were reviewed and updated. We also resolved 93 inquiries through our o/fficial channels.\n\nFurthermore, we have a process to safeguard whistleblowers from retaliation. This process includes providing individual follow-up to whistleblowers after the submission and resolution of cases through surveys. Additionally, for employee reporters, we assess changes in their employment status after reporting.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, we launched the ETHOS culture survey with over 50% employee participation. Key findings from this representative sample revealed that 93% of our employees are familiar with the program and its policies, and 92% hold a positive perception of its functions, including communication and training. Acknowledging a common challenge among companies, we recognize the need to enhance trust, allowing employees to report concerns without fear of retaliation. We intend to continue fostering the growth of this trust.\n\n## Internal Legal Audits\n\nOur internal legal audits serve as another means to evaluate and verify the knowledge and compliance of Cemex's relevant policies by certain key employees. The ultimate purpose of this exercise is to identify areas of opportunity to continuously improve and enhance our compliance policies and procedures.\n\n473 internal legal audits were conducted in 2023, both in person and remotely, in 29 countries, with a particular focus on anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, antitrust, sanctions programs, export controls and anti-boycott laws, insider trading, handling Cemex's confidential information, human rights, and conflict minerals. We performed audits in 100% of the countries where we operate which are considered high-risk, meeting our 2025 target ahead of plan.\n\n## 100 %\n\nHigh-Risk Country achieving our 2025 target ahead of plan\n\n## Case Reception and Administration Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Our ERM system, established at country, regional and global levels, follows a bottom-up and top-down strategy to foster information flow across the organization, support better-informed decision making and enhance risk and opportunity management.\n\nESG risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, are managed within the ERM system.\n\n## Risk & Opportunity Governance\n\nOur Board of Directors, through its corresponding Board Committees, provides strategic guidance and oversight on risk and opportunity management by regularly discussing the enterprise risk and opportunity agenda and reviewing the e/ffectiveness of our risk and opportunity management system enforced by our Risk Management Committee, including guidance on ESG matters, including but not limited to human rights and climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee is composed of Executive Committee members at a global level. It reviews Cemex's risk exposure at least twice a year through the discussion of the enterprise risk and opportunity agenda. Cemex's senior management teams at country and regional levels are responsible for reviewing the most significant risks and opportunities and enabling strategies for risk and opportunity treatment.\n\nOn an annual basis, Cemex performs internal and external assessments of the e/ffectiveness and maturity level of its ERM system.\n\n## Risk & Opportunity Management Process\n\nOur global, regional, and country risk and opportunity agendas result from a comprehensive ERM process structured to identify and manage di/fferent types of risks, trends, emerging concerns, and opportunities that could impact Cemex's strategic priorities in the short, medium, and long terms.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These risks and uncertainties are listed and prioritized based on their overall risk rating, which is based on their estimated probability (likelihood of the risk materializing) and impact (qualitative/quantitative consequences for Cemex if the risk materializes). In 2024 and beyond, new risks and uncertainties may emerge or materialize due to changes in markets, business or regulatory environments and other factors and/or the ones stated here may assume a lesser or greater importance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUncertain Economic Conditions \u00a5 EG, I\n\n## Description\n\nOur industry, businesses, and markets are influenced by global, regional, and national economic conditions. Monetary policies to reduce inflation, policy divergence in the largest economies and their potential cross-border negative e/ffects, energy and food price shocks, global tightening of financing conditions triggering widespread emerging market debt distress, rapid growth of cryptocurrencies without clear regulation and geopolitical risks like escalation of regional wars are some potential sources of economic risk that can significantly change the expected economic growth and demand for construction and building materials.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nMarket contraction, lower sales, increased input and operational cost, tightening of financial markets, foreign exchange volatility, among others, all\n\nof which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Enhance EBITDA growth and margin through strong pricing and increased sales from Vertua products and Urbanization Solutions.\n- l Deliver superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies and Cemex Go.\n- l Compete based on quality, client segmentation, and higher value proposition.\n- l Optimize our portfolio for growth; accelerate bolt-on and margin enhancement projects.\n- l Maintain a strict cost discipline.\n- l Execute financial strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChanges in Competitive Landscape \u00a5 CC, EG\n\n## Description\n\nThe markets in which we operate remain highly competitive and are served by a variety of established companies with recognized brand names. New production capacities, increasing imports, new market entrants, rising inflation and logistics costs, aggressive pricing strategies by competitors, business combinations, and industry consolidation, among others, have caused and may continue to cause supply-demand imbalances and a/ffect the competitive landscape. Additionally, a potential decline in demand for cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and other materials and solutions, including urbanization solutions, could a/ffect market conditions.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nFailure to compete e/ffectively may a/ffect our price and volume strategy and the results of our operations. We may lose substantial market share, our sales could decline or grow at a slower rate, and our pricing and margin enhancement e/fforts could be hindered, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and the results of our operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Deliver superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies and Cemex Go.\n- l Compete based on quality, client segmentation and higher value proposition.\n- l Grow EBITDA through margin enhancement, pricing discipline, and by securing public and private construction spending through our commercial strategy.\n- l Optimize our portfolio for growth; accelerate bolt-on and margin enhancement projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPolitical Uncertainty\n\n\u00a5\n\nHS, CC, EG\n\n## Description\n\nWe are subject to the political, social, and economic environment of the countries where we operate. Changes in federal or national government and the political party in control of the legislature in any of the countries where we operate could result in changes to the countries' economic, political, or social conditions, and in changes to laws, regulations and public policies, which may contribute to economic uncertainty or adverse business conditions and could also materially impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.

Globally, in 2024 the political risk will be heightened by elections in at least 64 countries, including some of our markets (Mexico, the U.S, Panama, Dominican Republic, Croatia, UK). The EU Parliament will also face elections to renew its members. Additionally, future snap elections cannot be discarded.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nPolitical uncertainty, economic slowdown or recession, social instability, business disruption, increased costs, imposition of new regulations and/or taxes, instability of business landscape, negative impact on governability and rule of law, public policy uncertainty, delay to obtain or renew permits, among others. All of these events have the potential to materially and adversely impact our people, business, financial condition, liquidity, and the results of our operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Execute tailor-made public a/ffairs strategy per country.\n- l Cooperate and engage with governments, regulators, and legislators through business associations.\n- l Implement business continuity plans and Rapid Response Teams to safeguard the lives of our people and minimize operational disruption.\n- l Monitor political, geopolitical, and social events and plan for risk scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Unexpected Escalation of a Geopolitical Conflict \u00a5 H&S, CC, EG\n\n## Description\n\nAs a global company, Cemex is wary of specific geopolitical tensions that could have a sudden escalation, a/ffecting the lives of our employees and business results. The development of previous and new geopolitical conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, will determine the impact they could have on our markets, business results, and financial conditions. In addition, tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as maritime tensions between China and Southeast Asian nations (e.g., the Philippines) regarding claims in the South China Sea are constantly evolving. They could be exacerbated by the Taiwan (January 2024) and the U.S. (November 2024) presidential elections.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nGeopolitical conflict (especially if sudden) could impact our people, and materially and adversely a/ffect our business continuity, reputation, liquidity, and the results of our operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Implement business continuity plans and Rapid Response Teams to safeguard the lives of our people and minimize operational disruption.\n- l Monitor political, geopolitical, and social events and plan for risk scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Risks \u00a5 HS, CC, EG, S\n\n## Description\n\nWe are subject to an increasing number of ESG laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also aware of evolving (and increasing) stakeholder expectations. The global regulatory framework relating to ESG will continue to evolve. ESG performance, in general, is also under increased scrutiny from stakeholders and society at large. The lack of clarity of some of these new legislative developments, as well as inconsistent and conflicting frameworks and standards can be challenging. Non-compliance, or adherence to, or changes in such laws, regulations, and practices, and/or their interpretation by stakeholders, stakeholders' diverse expectations, and/or any significant delay in assessing the impact and/or adapting to such changes may result in potential risks, which could lead to fines, penalties and operations being halted.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nThese laws and regulations expose Cemex to the risk of substantial costs and liabilities including higher investment in equipment and technology, fines and other sanctions, the payment of compensation to third parties, remediation costs, business disruption and damage to reputation, restrictions on production facilities, reputation damage, loss of customers, di/fficulty to retain and attract talent, social activism, new mandatory operational and disclosure requirements, among other things, which could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and the results of our operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Execute Cemex's ESG Strategy which includes its Future in Action Program.\n- l Comply with ESG laws and regulations and adhere to the highest ESG standards and practices.\n- l Engage with key stakeholders for proactive communication and risk and opportunity management.\n- l Continue the operations of our ESG-related committees: Global ESG Committee, Regional and Country Sustainability Committees, Ethos Committee, Human Rights Taskforce, among others.\n- l Promote ETHOS line to report alleged ethics, compliance, or governance violations.\n- l Board oversight and guidance on ESG risk and opportunity management through the discussion of the ESG Risk & Opportunity Agenda by the Board's Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact, and Diversity Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate-Related Risks \u00a5 HS, CC, EG, S\n\n## Carbon Regulation-Transition Risk\n\n## Description\n\nCemex is subject to a growing number of CO2 regulations aiming to incentivize CO2 emissions reduction. In jurisdictions with carbon regulation in place, such regulations often manage CO2 pricing in the form of cap-and-trade systems, particularly in Europe and some states in the U.S. In other geographies, new or stricter CO2 regulations are under discussion or development and could imply a higher CO2 cost for Cemex in the short- and medium-term, for example,",

APPENDIX\n\n## Main Strategic Risks and Treatment Strategies  (Continued)\n\nin the form of emission trading systems or CO2 taxes. Unclear CO2 regulations could result in double regulation. For example, an entity may be subject to a cap-and-trade scheme as well as an emissions tax, which may have inconsistent or overlapping policy objectives. Likewise, the unequal application of a CO2 pricing mechanism between local and foreign producers could cause competitive disadvantages. On the other hand, government policies that incentivize the use of alternative technologies to reduce CO2 emissions (e.g., circular economy practices) are not advancing at the required pace or at the same pace in all geographies in which we operate, which may slow down the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nIncreased costs resulting from regulation, pricing pressure exerted by imports from countries with less stringent CO2 regulations, substantial penalties in case of non-compliance with laws and regulations, and non-achievement of our carbon emission reduction targets may all have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Technology-Transition Risk\n\n## Description\n\nDevelopment and scale up of technologies are key to reduce CO2 emissions to meet our 2050 net-zero CO2 emissions across the value chain from a 2020 baseline, certain sustainability-related key performance indicators included in our financing arrangements, and the limits of any cap-and-trade systems to which Cemex is subject. Some of the initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions still need to be proved in terms of technical feasibility, viability, and scalability. In addition, the development of breakthrough technologies requires intensive capital expenditures. There is\n\nhigh competition to secure government funding and economic or regulatory incentives to develop and prove these technologies are not available in all geographies. The failure to e/ffectively select, develop and roll-out, or/and invest in, any necessary technologies, as well as the lack or late implementation of these new technologies, could lead Cemex to fail in achieving its 2050 net-zero CO2 emissions goal and the limits of any cap-and-trade systems to which Cemex is subject, as well as cause Cemex to fail to comply with the sustainability-related key performance indicators contained in its financial arrangements, as well as to meet with stakeholders expectations. Furthermore, deficient or delayed development or scale up of certain sustainability-related technologies may limit the range of eligible projects to which the proceeds of certain financings may be destined and/or may cause the application of proceeds to be less e/ffective than originally anticipated. We have established aggressive sustainability/climate change related goals and programs, which may increase our operational costs.  Additionally, failure to meet these goals could damage our business and reputation, decrease the demand for our goods and services, and/or increase our cost of capital under our sustainability-linked financing agreements.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nHigh capital investment in research and development, and the deployment of new and alternative technologies. Potential write-o/ffs and early retirement of existing assets, deficient capital allocation, reduced demand for our products and services, substantial penalties and/or an increase in our cost of capital, reputation damage, stakeholder activism and a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Markets-Transition Risk\n\n## Description\n\nMore stringent construction and energy e/fficiency standards are likely to foster the development of new lower-carbon products and construction solutions. As consumer expectations continue evolving, there is a risk for Cemex of not meeting future market expectations in the form of new or alternative lower-carbon products and solutions. On the other side, the lack of regulatory incentives or regulations promoting the use of lower-carbon products could fail to incentivize their adoption as customers could not be willing to pay the cost resulting from the necessary investment to transition to a low-carbon industry which could also compromise our roadmap to net zero by 2050. As industry participants embark on decarbonizing strategies, the competition for raw materials with lower-carbon footprint increases, which exerts pressure on their price and availability.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nReduced demand for our products and solutions, increased production costs due to more competition for lower carbon or alternative raw materials, increased capital expenses to adjust our production processes and technology to incorporate lower carbon or alternative raw materials, and/or renewable energy, reputation damage, stakeholder activism, among other things, which could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Reputation-Transition Risk\n\n## Description\n\nAccording to the GCCA, the cement industry is the source of about 5% - 8% of the world's CO2 emissions. Cement could be perceived as a relevant contributor to CO2 global emissions.\n\nNegative company reputation or stigmatization of our industry related to CO2 and stakeholder activism could have a negative impact on our stakeholders' preferences regarding Cemex, which in turn could potentially a/ffect the demand for our products and solutions, our ability to attract and retain talent, capital availability or cost, and business continuity.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nNegative disposition towards Cemex and the cement industry which could reduce the demand for our products and solutions, di/fficult our ability to attract and retain talent, reduce capital availability and/or increase our cost of capital, increase stakeholder's activism, and disrupt our business operations. All these events could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies for the outlined Transition Risks (Carbon Regulation, Technology, Markets and Reputation)\n\n- l Participate actively in decarbonizing the construction materials industry through the definition of ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets and the execution of our Future in Action program.\n\n## Physical Risks (Acute and Chronic)\n\n## Description\n\nClimate change will intensify the severity and frequency of natural disasters already experienced in most geographies and bring new environmental changes that will impact people's lives and economic activities. Our operations and business are exposed to the event-driven acute physical risks and the chronic physical risks associated with longer-term shifts in climate patterns. As part of Cemex's global strategy to manage climate change-related risks and opportunities, during 2023 we executed a pilot project to enhance physical",

The assessment was carried out employing the technical and analytical capabilities of Risilience, a third-party expert in climate science, risk management, business, and technology. This assessment allows us to determine the financial impact, in the medium and long-term, of eight physical hazards under five emission scenarios and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): (SSP1-1.9), Paris limit (SSP1-2.6), Stated policy (SSP2- 4.5), Current policy (SSP3-7.0), and No policy (SSP5-8.5). Initial results suggest that drought and heatwaves represent the most material risks to revenue across the twenty sample facilities. Heatwaves are the hazard event with the highest increase in probability due to climate change. Additional findings indicate that some of our operations in Mexico, Africa and the Middle East could be exposed to water stress due to their geographic location. Likewise, we identified assets mainly in the U.S., Philippines, Mexico, and the Caribbean with a likelihood of su/ffering flash floods.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nAsset damage, business disruption, loss of sales, cost increase and even reputation damage or possible litigation. The decrease in sales volume caused by physical hazard events is usually counterbalanced by the increase in the demand for our products and solutions during the reconstruction phases. Chronic physical risks could result also in supply chain disruptions as is the case of shipping capacity restrictions in the Panama Canal due to low water levels. Recent reports suggest that the Panama Canal authority could reduce the number of ships crossing daily due to low water levels. Supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact on the product delivery time and the cost to serve our markets.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Identify and manage climate risks through a comprehensive risk management strategy.\n- l Adhere to crisis management and business continuity plans in place.\n- l Review and adjust insurance policies to cover the most exposed assets as much as possible.\n- l Set 2030 targets on freshwater withdrawal reduction by shifting to non-freshwater and implement Water Action Plans (WAPs) which include a customized set of response actions to mitigate water risks.\n- l Expand physical and transition climate risk assessment and quantification to our most relevant assets in all geographies where we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory and Compliance Requirements\n\n\u00a5\n\nCC, EG\n\n## Description\n\nAs a global company, Cemex is subject to the laws and regulations of the countries where we operate. Some of these laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, areas such as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-boycott, economic sanctions, trade embargoes, export control laws, environmental (e.g., CO2, air emissions, circular economy and waste management, biodiversity, water), social (e.g. labor, human rights, diversity), information security, mining, transportation, taxes, among others. Furthermore, we are involved in various significant legal proceedings, including taxes, antitrust and regulatory matters which depend on the application and interpretation of law by local and national government authorities. For more information, please refer to the Regulatory\n\nMatters and Legal Proceedings section of our annual report on Form 20-F.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nAny non-compliance with laws and regulations, and/or any significant delay in adapting to changes may result in potential cost increase, investigations, fines, and penalties, restrictions on production facilities, among others, which could have a material adverse e/ffect on reputation, business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Strive to comply with applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n- l Enhance and enforce our Ethics and Compliance program, which addresses antitrust, anti-bribery, health and safety, international sanctions, human rights, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, financial controls, and third-party risk management, among other matters.\n- l Improve internal controls through continuous internal audits and other methods.\n- l Set accounting reserves for legal proceedings when it is probable that they will be adversely resolved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial Risks\n\n\u00a5\n\nEG, I\n\n## Description\n\nAs a global company we are exposed to several financial risks, including but not limited to foreign currency fluctuation, changing interest rates, liquidity, refinancing terms, credit ratings, counterparty risks, debt level adjustments, and possible\n\nnon-compliance with covenants and restrictions, among others.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nAll these factors have the capacity to a/ffect, including but not limited to, our capacity to generate cash to service our debt and to comply with covenants and restrictions, our outstanding indebtedness, the cost to service our debt, our liquidity, our consolidated reported results, our credit rating, our solvency, our ability to satisfy our commercial obligations and our capacity to access funds or capital, among others. All these events could materially and adversely a/ffect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Strengthen our capital structure.\n- l Execute liability management strategy; extend and diversify funding sources.\n- l Continue with leverage reduction, achieving and maintaining investment grade.\n- l Maintain a strong liquidity profile.\n- l Implement foreign exchange, interest rate and energy hedging strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Price Volatility Including Alternative Fuels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a5 CC, EG, S\n\n## Description\n\nElectricity and fuel costs represent an important part of our overall production cost structure.

Governments in some countries where we operate are in the process of modifying certain energy market regulations, reducing energy subsidies, introducing clean energy obligations, or imposing new taxes. Our commitment to the energy transition by increasing the use of cleaner energy sources, including renewable electricity and alternative fuels, may limit our flexibility to use established energy sources and fuels that may be more cost-e/ffective and could require more capital expenditures and investments than planned. Conversely, if our e/fforts to increase the use of alternative fuels are unsuccessful, due to their limited availability, price volatility, reduced availability of long-term contracts, or otherwise, we would be required to use traditional fuels, which may increase our energy and fuel costs. In addition, transition to a net-zero economy has increased the competition for renewable electricity projects. All these factors may result in di/fficulties to achieve the targets we have set in our Future in Action program and certain key performance indicators provided for in our sustainability-linked financing arrangements, which, among other adverse e/ffects, would damage our reputation and increase our cost of capital. This may result in a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nIncreased production costs, energy supply disruption causing reduced materials production, increases in capital spending and investment, delay in achieving clean energy goals, and impact on operating results. Our pricing strategy aims to transfer energy cost increases to our customers, but if the strategy does not penetrate at the rate\n\nwe expect, it has the potential to impact our sales volumes. If we are unable to comply with sustainability-linked financing arrangements, it can result in damage to our reputation and increase our cost of capital. All of this could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Negotiate energy contracts to provide certainty on future energy cost, including entering into long-term renewable supply contracts for energy and fuels that provide cleaner energy.\n- l Increase use of alternative fuels.\n- l Develop processes and products to reduce heat consumption in our kilns and optimize power consumption.\n- l Execute hedging for coal, diesel, electricity, and natural gas in the financial markets to reduce volatility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lower Availability or Increased Cost of Raw Materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCC, EG, S\n\n## Description\n\nWe still use certain byproducts of industrial processes produced by third parties, such as pet-coke, fly ash, slag, and synthetic gypsum, among others, as well as natural resources such as aggregates, limestone, water, and other materials. While we are not dependent on any supplier and we actively seek to secure the supply of our required materials, products, and resources through long-term renewable contracts and framework agreements, short-term contracts are entered into in certain countries where we operate to guarantee our required supply of materials.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nShould existing suppliers cease operations, or reduce, or eliminate the production of these byproducts and materials, or should any suppliers for any reason not be able to deliver contractual quantities to us, or should laws and/or regulations in any region or country limit access to these materials, our sourcing costs could increase significantly or require us to find alternative sources. These type of events could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, scarcity and quality of natural resources (such as water and aggregates reserves) in some of the countries where we operate could have a material adverse e/ffect on our operations, costs and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Enter long-term renewable contracts for the supply of the required materials.\n- l Monitor global aggregates, limestone, and natural resources reserves, identify critical levels, and secure reserves in attractive markets.\n- l Monitor and anticipate permitting processes and regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cyberthreats and Information Technology Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a5\n\nCC, EG, I\n\n## Description\n\nWe increasingly rely on a variety of information technology, cloud services, and automated operating systems to manage and support our operations as well as to o/ffer our products to our customers. Our systems and technologies (as well as those provided by our third parties), including but not limited to our platforms such\n\nas Cemex Go, may be vulnerable to intrusion, disruption, or damage caused by circumstances beyond our control, (e.g., physical or electronic break-ins, catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, security breaches, computer viruses and cyberattacks, including malicious codes, worms, ransomware, phishing, denial of service attacks and unauthorized access).\n\nFurthermore, as we continue to advance our Working Smarter digital transformation initiative, we expect a deeper integration of digital technologies into our operations. We believe this progression is likely to assist us in fulfilling our strategic priorities. However, these integration e/fforts and the engagement of additional technology service providers and systems in our operations as part of Working Smarter could increase our exposure to these risks. The ongoing digitalization of global supply chains introduces new risks, given their growing reliance on technology and third parties.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nSome cybersecurity incidents could cause operational disruptions, failure to serve our clients, leaks of information, among others. These events could negatively impact our financials and reputation, and/or make us subject to regulatory fines that would damage our relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers. All of this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Adhere to Information Security Policies and implement and enhance cybersecurity controls and processes.\n- l Increase awareness on cybersecurity culture among employees and third parties through incident response playbooks and drills.",

These conflicting points of view have been more common with respect to environmental and social issues. Despite agreement on the importance of addressing climate change, our industry is usually perceived as more polluting than others. Human rights are also a source of potential allegations. Di/fferent interests from stakeholders have led them to implement public actions, protests or campaigns against our industry or company. All these actions have the capacity to disrupt our operations, damage our assets and/or reputation, and di/fficult the process to obtain or renew permits. In addition, the increase in social protests derived from causes like discontent with governments, unions' demands related to working conditions, among others, have had and may continue having a negative impact on our business operation and capacity to serve our clients e/fficiently and on time.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nStakeholders with di/fferent, or conflicting interests could result in delays in legal or administrative proceedings, stakeholder activism, negative media coverage, asset damage, business disruption as well as in requests for the government to revoke or deny our concessions, licenses, or other permits. Any such events could impact our people, could a/ffect our business continuity or reputation, or could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Implement sustainable community engagement plans.\n- l Cooperate and engage with governments, regulators, and legislators through business associations to focus on providing solutions for key government priorities (e.g. Regenera, our global waste management business, as a solution for contributing to a more circular society).\n- l Implement business continuity plans and RRTs to safeguard the lives of our people and minimize operational disruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description\n\nActivities in our business that are not executed responsibly might be dangerous and lead to an injury, illness, or even fatality to our employees, third parties, and contractors. In a similar way, accidents might end up damaging our people, property or community environments.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nAny given accident that occurs within our facilities or as a result of our operations, may lead to injuries, illness or fatality. These accidents could cause both operative disruptions and/or legal and regulatory consequences. Additionally, we may also be required to assume costs and liabilities to compensate a/ffected personnel or repair or replace damaged property. This could materially and adversely a/ffect our reputation, business, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Aim for zero recordable injuries, job-related illnesses, preventable vehicular incidents, and environmental events.\n- l Prioritize the safety of our people (employees, contractors, and the communities) where we operate.\n- l Reinforce Health and Safety Protocols (Behaviors that Save Lives, Pandemic Endurance & Rapid Response Teams).\n- l Adhere to high health and safety standards, monitor, prepare, and comply with health and safety recommendations.\n\n## Talent Attraction and Retention \u00a5 HS, CC, EG, I, S\n\n## Description\n\nAttracting and retaining a specialized workforce, e/ffectively planning leadership succession, and evolving to adapt to changing workplace demands and environments across our operations are key elements to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities.

While we have developed or are developing new technologies, businesses, partnerships, products and solutions through our Research & Development (R&D), Cemex Ventures, Urbanization Solutions, and Innovation and Sustainability strategy, other industry innovations from internal or external players, including but not limited to digitalization, automatization, new\n\nconstruction methods, new products, materials or manufacturing processes, sustainable practices, or other emerging technologies or solutions could potentially impact the industry's competitive landscape, the construction value, and our capacity to compete and/or keep our industry position.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nFailure to identify and/or adapt our business model to potential industry disruptors and e/ffectively adopt the technology and resources required to stay on top of our industry's evolution could a/ffect our competitive advantage and have a material adverse e/ffect on our business financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Continue to improve our R&D strategy related to new materials, products, and technologies.\n- l Detect, develop, and commercialize disruptive, revolutionary, and sustainable construction projects through Cemex Ventures.\n- l Promote internal and external innovation (e.g., Smart Innovation Program, partner with innovative and sustainable companies).\n- l Deliver superior customer experience enabled by digital technologies (e.g., Cemex Go)\n- l Enhance our digital technology strategy (e.g., Digital Commercial Strategy, CX 4.0 Operations, Working Smarter).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJust Transition: Collateral Impacts from Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy \u00a5 HS, EG, S\n\n## Description\n\nAs we strive towards achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, it is crucial to address the broader impacts that transitioning to a low-carbon economy may have on society. Our commitment to a Just Transition toward net-zero emissions and climate resilience is grounded in social dialogue, stakeholder engagement and respect for labor and human rights. Just Transition guides an inclusive process which seeks that all stakeholders are included and not left behind. One significant obstacle we face is the lack of readiness among various stakeholders (e.g., governments, suppliers, employees, and communities) to adapt to the necessary changes at the required pace. Within our supply chain, the adoption of more environmentally and socially responsible practices by our third parties plays an important role. The workforce and communities represent both challenges and opportunities in this transition. There is a need to provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities to avoid potential job losses, work displacements, involuntary migration, and loss of livelihoods.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nIf we fail to incorporate just transition guidelines into our climate action strategy, we may not be prepared to comply with potential ESG requirements. Moreover, there is increasing scrutiny from investors, policymakers, and NGOs, posing a potential risk of reputation damage, legal or administrative actions, and heightened activism. In countries with leading ESG practices and regulations, ensuring a just transition is a paramount element for accessing government funds\n\nand grants designated to facilitate the transition towards a green economy. If policymakers and governments do not enable the right measures and incentives to support the upstream and downstream supply chain, it could impact business continuity and a/ffect our results of operations. This, in turn, could significantly a/ffect the members of communities engaged in any of the employment sources within our value chain. Lastly, without ensuring a climate transition plan for our workforce and communities, there is a risk of skills and capabilities lag, making it challenging to integrate them into the new labor system.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Raise awareness about just transition among internal and external stakeholders, promoting the adoption of environmentally and socially responsible practices.\n- l Collaborate with relevant organizations, such as BSR and the UN Global Compact, to actively incorporate just transition principles into our company processes.\n- l Support companies in our supply chain, especially Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to develop e/ffective adaptation strategies for a low-carbon economy and participate in initiatives like the Cemex UNGC Supply Chain Program.\n- l Advocate for policies and regulations that align with principles of decent work, social inclusion, and environmental protection.",

AI technology advancements are changing how companies operate and how humans interact; From chatbots to engage with customers and employees in human-sounding ways, or models that optimize how marketing, controllership, legal, manufacturing, supply chain and logistics processes are managed, to enabling researchers and developers to better understand large amounts of data and ease complex engineering development processes. These advancements will likely enhance and improve the e/fficiency of business processes overall, but sources of risk remain as these systems require adequate governance and secure implementation environments which are still being discussed or developed by governments and implemented by companies or organizations. Risks arise in several ways, and probably, as of the date of this report, some of them remain unknown. If the data from AI technology is of low quality, biased, unrepresentative or inappropriate, it creates risks to the accuracy and reliability of model outputs. The use of AI can also expose us to compliance and legal risks with respect to existing laws and regulations. Additionally, new and proposed regulations on AI are emerging and vary across jurisdictions, and penalties for non-compliance are expected to be significant. The large amount of data required to train AI applications can also create information\n\nsecurity risks. Web-based AI applications substantially increase the risks of employees submitting sensitive or proprietary data. Cyberthreats by adversarial actors to access AI models or alter data could have negative business consequences as conventional cybersecurity controls do not adequately address these new forms of AI risk. Data breaches, privacy and inaccurate or unreliable output from AI Models also creates reputation risks. Misuse of AI models represent another risk. AI models could be misused to create and spread falsified information and influence electoral campaigns, stoke division, exacerbate polarization, and create social chaos which in turn could endanger political systems, economic markets and global security and stability. Uncertainty and risk increase as breakthroughs in AI outpace governance e/fforts.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nAs AI will continue to improve quickly and become exponentially more capable, failure from policy makers, governments, authorities, and companies to develop and implement adequate frameworks, standards, procedures, and controls to integrate it in a secure and controlled environment, could create numerous potential risks, including data privacy, compliance, legal, ethical, reputation and security risks. Misuse of AI could also have a negative impact on the political, economic and social environments. All these events could have negative economic, legal, and reputation consequences and in turn materially and adversely impact our business, financial performance and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Implement institutional guidelines and controls to ensure responsible usage of AI.\n- l Monitor AI technology developments and comply with regulatory frameworks.\n- l Foster partnership and collaborations and investing in AI research and development.\n- l Strengthen risk prevention and cybersecurity culture among employees and third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Intensification of Cost-of-Living Concerns\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a5 H&S, CC, EG\n\n## Description\n\nCompanies' costs and people's costs of living have been gradually driven up by disruptions in global supply chains, caused by extreme weather events due to climate change (e.g., severe heatwaves, droughts, floods), geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia's invasion of Ukraine, incursions by Houthi forces in the Red Sea region) and macroeconomic factors (e.g., China's slower economic growth). These events have exacerbated energy and food shortages, migration flows, social and security risks. Although global food and energy prices have fallen from their peak levels in mid2022, domestic prices and the risks to food production remain elevated in many economies. Also, even when inflation has been declining in response to central banks' monetary policy, headline and core inflation remain elevated. Additionally, several countries maintain high indebtedness levels which limits their capacity to maneuver through fiscal policy. Furthermore, wages have not risen at the same level as inflation in most countries (e.g., European Union), adding more pressure to the capacity of households to\n\npurchase basic goods. All these factors could lead to heightened social pressures with potential cost increases for companies in the form of salary increases, social protests, deterioration of security levels with a high toll in some countries, increasing demands for private sector to contribute to the solution of social problems, among others. Conversely, companies could be unable to transfer cost increases through prices as costof-living concerns could lead to government intervention to regulate commodity prices or prices of products considered essential for living.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\nCost increases, business disruption caused by increasing protests (e.g., US automotive industry, UK healthcare, ports and railways services), insecurity events a/ffecting stakeholders and business operations, labor shortages and increasing salary demands, assets divestments, among others. These events could have a material adverse e/ffect on our reputation, business, and results of operations.\n\n## Treatment Strategies\n\n- l Cooperate and engage with governments, and legislators through business associations to support households (e.g., housing initiatives).\n- l Implement business continuity plans and Rapid Response Teams to safeguard the lives of our people and minimize operational disruption.\n- l Strive to comply with applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.",

Our commitment includes e/fforts to engage with stakeholders through dialogues designed to identify and address concerns.\n\nCemex places great importance on the insights and concerns of stakeholders, including employees, local communities, customers, suppliers, and investors. We believe cultivating meaningful dialogue with these stakeholders is essential to understand their perspectives, address concerns, and foster enduring, sustainable relationships.\n\n## Our Human Rights Due Diligence Process\n\nWe continue to work on improving our Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) process, working towards aligning with international guidelines and standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. We continue to embed these guidelines and standards in all company areas and work on monitoring adherence throughout our operations and our value chain.\n\nOur HRDD aims to incorporate a human rights risk management system designed to embed, identify, assess, respond, remediate, monitor, and communicate human rights risks and impacts resulting from our operations, activities, and relationships.\n\nOur HRDD encourages continuous communication with our stakeholder groups and allows access to e/ffective grievance mechanisms for rightsholders to voice their concerns, complaints, and suggestions.\n\n## Our HRDD was designed to focus on five key elements:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. Embed: Focuses on incorporating our commitments into our governance, practices, policies, guidelines, and processes.\n- 2. Identify and Assess: Involves identifying human rights and their rightsholders who may be adversely a/ffected by our operations, activities, and relationships. We aim to identify risks and adverse impacts with the objective of analyzing and addressing them in accordance with their corresponding level of risk or adverse impact.\n- 3. Respond and Remediate: Includes developing and implementing measures to address and mitigate human rights risks and prevent or remedy adverse impacts.\n\nRespond and Remediate\n\n- 4. Monitor: Aims for our processes, measures, and actions to address and mitigate human rights risks and prevent or remedy adverse impacts.

APPENDIX\n\n## 100 %\n\nof available targeted countries implemented a Human Rights SelfAssessment in 2023.\n\n## An Important Year for Human Rights at Cemex\n\nIn 2023, we redesigned our approach to human rights due diligence, integrating human rights principles in the way we do business, further reinforcing Cemex's core value to Act with Integrity. We held regular working sessions with our Global Human Rights Taskforce. We presented the quarterly results to our Human Rights Steering Committee, which is comprised of global leaders from relevant functional areas of the company. Particularly, in 2023, the Human Rights Taskforce worked on designing and implementing proposals for improving our human rights practices in accordance with the results from the gap analysis made in 2022 against industry best practices and EU regulations related to human rights.\n\n## Human Rights Self-Assessment\n\nIn 2023, Cemex worked on enhancing and updating its global Human Rights Self-Assessment (HRSA) to include a wider scope of evaluated human rights-related aspects compared to the assessments made in previous years. As a result, our updated global HRSA allows us to identify and map human rights risks across our operations and countries where we operate through a comprehensive questionnaire that inquires about human rights practices. In 2023, almost 500 Cemex leaders in 25 countries across all our regions completed the updated HRSA. With more data available, we have designed a new digital dashboard to monitor the HRSA results and track subsequently designed steps and action plans to mitigate human rights risks and impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human Rights Self-Assessment Survey Dimensions\n\nThe HRSA includes 72 questions on 17 human rights dimensions. Survey inquiries portray best practices on human rights and are aligned with the UNGC's Guiding Principles. Participants answer the inquiries by ranking, to the best of their knowledge, Cemex's compliance with each statement as high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, low, or indicate lack of knowledge on the topic.\n\nBased on the results of the HRSA, additional assessments are available to support the design of mitigation action plans. Furthermore, increasing the frequency of assessments in countries determined 'high-risk' is recommended.\n\n- l Health & Safety\n- l Working hours\n- l Wages\n- l Leave\n- l Employment status\n- l Non-harassment\n- l Privacy\n- l Land & property\n- l Security arrangements\n- l Community engagement\n- l Product stewardship\n- l Human rights awareness\n- l Association & bargaining\n- l Forced labor\n- l Child labor\n- l Discrimination\n- l Sustainability",

APPENDIX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human Rights Risk Assessments\n\nIn addition to our HRSA, we have designed Human Rights Risk Assessments (HRRAs) that consist of additional and subsequent evaluations for locations as a result of a 'high risk' classification as per human rights risk indexes and HRSA results. The HRRAs support us in further exploring risk situations and better understanding the origin of the identified risks through engagements with relevant stakeholders. The ultimate objective of our HRRAs is to design adequate measures to mitigate and address any potential human rights risk.\n\nETHOS is Cemex's o/fficial global grievance program. It is available to all our stakeholders and linked to all our management systems. See our Governance > Ethics & Compliance section on page 102 of this report.\n\n## Human Rights Salient Issues\n\nThrough our human rights due diligence process and the assessments conducted in the countries where we operate, we have identified specific risks that require prioritized e/fforts. These risks are associated with the following areas:\n\n- l Working Hours\n- l Data Privacy\n- l Security Arrangements\n- l Community Engagement\n- l Human Rights Awareness\n\nThese areas represent focal points where we must concentrate our e/fforts to address and mitigate potential human rights challenges. Our management systems and processes enable us to prioritize mitigation actions, allocate resources e/fficiently, and assess key performance indicators (KPIs) internally, facilitating transparent reporting on our progress.\n\nA description of our key 2023 initiatives and achievements addressing the top five salient Human Rights (Work-Life Balance, Data Privacy, Security Arrangements, Community Engagement, Human Rights Awareness) is included in the Appendix on page 223 of this report.\n\nWe are committed to continue strengthening our approach to respecting human rights. To achieve this, we have outlined the following steps we plan to undertake in upcoming years:\n\n- l Creating specialized human rights trainings designed to generate awareness and strengthen risk mitigation\n- l Train the responsible departments on conducting HRRAs for additional countries\n- l Issue our Human Rights Guidelines\n- l Enhance our Human Rights Policy\n\n## Human Rights Training for Board of Directors\n\nRespecting and promoting human rights is a company commitment that starts at the top with our Cemex Essentials course for our Board of Directors. This resource provides insights into commitments, strategies, priorities, processes, and outcomes, including our progress on human rights. The course curriculum includes our Human Rights Commitment, human rights due diligence process, policies and steps, and additional human rights learning resources. This voluntary training course generates awareness among our Board Members on how Cemex operationalizes the UN Guiding principles and implements its human rights due diligence.\n\n## Partnership with UNGC\n\nAs an active participant in the UNGC Business & Human Rights Accelerator, we had access to expert guidance and support from UNGC sta/ff and partners. Cemex networked and shared best practices with other companies in this tailored learning and development program.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each CPO represents two series 'A' shares and one series 'B' share of common stock of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. In addition, Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.'s shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') as American Depositary Shares ('ADSs') under the symbol 'CX.' Each ADS represents ten CPOs.\n\nThe terms 'Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.' and/or the 'Parent Company' used in these accompanying notes to the financial statements refer to Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. without its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms 'Company' or 'Cemex' refer to Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe issuance of these consolidated financial statements was authorized by the Board of Directors of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. on February 7, 2024 considering the favorable recommendation of its Audit Committee. These financial statements will be submitted for approval to the annual general ordinary shareholders' meeting of the Parent Company on March 22, 2024.\n\n## 2) Basis of Presentation and Disclosure\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\n\nCemex adopted Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1) starting January 1, 2023. The amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements. See note 28 for Cemex's material accounting policies.\n\n## Presentation currency and definition of terms\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are presented in Dollars of the United States of America (the 'United States'), except when specific reference is made to a di/fferent currency. When reference is made to 'U.S. Dollar,' 'Dollar,' 'Dollars' or '$' it means Dollars of the United States. All amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes are stated in millions, except when references are made to earnings per share and/or prices per share. When reference is made to 'Ps' or 'Pesos,' it means Mexican Pesos. When reference is made to '\u20ac' or 'Euros,' it means the currency in circulation in a significant number of European Union ('EU') countries. When reference is made to '\u00a3' or 'Pounds,' it means British Pounds sterling. Previously reported Dollar amounts of prior years are restated when the underlying transactions in other currencies remain unsettled using the closing exchange rates as of the reporting date. Amounts reported in Dollars should not be construed as representations that such amounts represented those Dollars or could be converted into Dollars at the rate indicated.\n\nAmounts disclosed in the notes in connection with outstanding tax and/or legal proceedings (notes 20.4 and 25), which are originated in jurisdictions where currencies are di/fferent from the Dollar, are presented in Dollar equivalents as of the closing of the most recent year presented. Consequently, without any change in the original currency, such Dollar amounts will fluctuate over time due to changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Discontinued operations (note 4.2)\n\nCemex reports as discontinued operations the disposal of entire geographical reportable operating segments regardless of size, the sale of a considerable portion of a significant reportable operating segment, as well as the sale of a major line of business.",

The line item of 'Operating earnings before other expenses, net' allows for easy reconciliation of the amount in these financial statements under IFRS to the non-IFRS measure of Operating EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization. The line item 'Other expenses, net' consists primarily of revenues and expenses not directly related to Cemex's main activities or which are of a non-recurring nature, including impairment losses of long-lived assets, non-recurring sales of emission allowances (note 28.13), results on disposal of assets and restructuring costs, among others (note 7). Under current IFRS, the inclusion of certain subtotals such as 'Operating earnings before other expenses, net' and the display of the statement of income vary significantly by industry and company according to specific needs.\n\nAlthough Operating EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance, an alternative to cash flows or a measure of financial position under IFRS, Operating EBITDA is the financial measure used by Cemex's chief executive o/fficer to review operating performance and profitability, for decision-making purposes and to allocate resources. Moreover, Operating EBITDA is a measure used by Cemex's creditors to review its ability to internally fund capital expenditures, to review its ability to service or incur debt and to comply with financial covenants under its financing agreements. Cemex presents 'Operating EBITDA' in notes 4.3 (selected financial information by reportable segment and line of business) and 17.1 (Financial instruments-Financial covenants). Cemex's Operating EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n## Statements of cash flows\n\nThe statements of cash flows exclude the following transactions that did not represent sources or uses of cash:\n\n## Financing activities:\n\n- \u00b7  In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the increases in other financing obligations in connection with lease contracts negotiated during the year for $341, $296 and $227, respectively (note 17.2); and\n\n## Investing activities:\n\n- \u00b7  In 2023, 2022 and 2021, in connection with the leases negotiated during the year, the increases in assets for the right-of-use related to lease contracts for $341, $296 and $227, respectively (note 15.2).\n\n## Other newly issued IFRS adopted in the reported periods\n\n## IFRS 17, Insurance contracts ('IFRS 17')\n\nBeginning January 1, 2023, IFRS 17 replaced IFRS 4, Insurance contracts , which sets forth accounting requirements for all contracts in which an entity (the 'Issuer') accepts significant insurance risks from another entity (the 'Policyholder') by agreeing to compensate the Policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely a/ffects the Policyholder. IFRS 17 may apply to any contract in which an entity assumes a risk position similar to an Issuer, to the extent that is not being accounted for under other IFRS, such as warranties or residual value guarantees, covered by IFRS 15, Revenues from contracts with customers ('IFRS 15') and IFRS 16, Leases ('IFRS 16'), respectively, among others. IFRS 17 does not apply to acquired insurance policies.\n\nConcurrent with the adoption of IFRS 17, Cemex analyzed its several contracts and concluded that: a) it has not issued insurance policies to third-parties; and b) all obligations and contingent obligations arising from another type of contracts are accounted under the relevant IFRS, such as IFRS 15, IFRS 16, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments ('IFRS 9') or IAS 19, Employee benefits ('IAS 19'), as applicable.",

Changes in accounting policies must be  applied retrospectively, while changes in accounting estimates are accounted for prospectively.                                                                      |\n| Amendments to IAS 12,  Income Taxes  -      Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities      arising from a Single Transaction | The amendment clarifies that companies should account for deferred tax assets and liabilities on   transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. Cemex has always applied these   criteria.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Amendments to IFRS 16,  Leases  - Lease      Liability in a Sale and Leaseback                                                    | The amendments mentioned that on initial recognition, the seller-lessee would include variable   payments when it measures a lease liability arising from a sale-and-leaseback transaction. In   addition, the amendments established that the seller-lessee could not recognize gains or losses   relating to the right of use it retains after initial recognition. |\n\n## 3) Revenues\n\nCemex's revenues are mainly originated from the sale and distribution of cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates and other construction materials and services, including urbanization solutions, and are recognized at a point in time or over time in the amount of the price, before tax on sales, expected to be received for goods and services supplied due to ordinary activities, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled, and control of goods and services passes to the customer. Cemex grants credit for terms ranging from 15 to 90 days depending on the type and risk of each customer. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenues were as follows:\n\n|                                                                 | 2023      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| From the sale of goods associated to Cemex's main activities  1 | $  16,904 | 15,137 | 14,009 |\n| From the sale of other goods and services  2                    | 484       | 440    | 370    |\n|                                                                 | $  17,388 | 15,577 | 14,379 |\n\nInformation on revenues by reportable segment and line of business for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is presented in note 4.3.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounts receivable for progress billings and advances received from customers of construction contracts were not significant. Moreover, for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenues and costs related to construction contracts in progress were not significant.\n\nCertain promotions and/or discounts and rebates o/ffered as part of the sale transaction, result in a portion of the transaction price should be allocated to such commercial incentives as separate performance obligations, recognized as contract liabilities with customers, and deferred to the statement of income during the period in which the incentive is exercised by the customer or until it expires. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 changes in the balance of contract liabilities with customers are as follows:\n\n|                                                                     | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Opening balance of contract liabilities with customers              | $  293  | 257     | 201     |\n| Increase during the period for new transactions                     | 1,603   | 1,493   | 1,626   |\n| Decrease during the period for exercise or expiration of incentives | (1,519) | (1,458) | (1,574) |\n| Currency translation e/ffects                                       | 7       | 1       | 4       |\n| Closing balance of contract liabilities with customers              | $  384  | 293     | 257     |\n\nFor the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, any costs capitalized as contract fulfillment assets and released over the contract life according to IFRS 15, Revenues from contracts with customers were not significant.",

Under IFRS, the Company's operating segments represent the components of Cemex that engage in business activities from which Cemex may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are reviewed by the entity's top management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. A reportable segment represents an operating segment or an aggregation of operating segments considering certain thresholds, under which entities must report separately any operating segments which account for 10% or more of combined revenues, both internal and external, 10% or more of combined net profit or loss, depending on the individual result of the operating segment, and/or 10% or more of the combined assets of all operating segments. In addition, despite the described 10% threshold not being met individually, entities must report as many individual operating segments as needed to cover at least 75% of the entity's revenue. Cemex operates by geography and line of business. Cemex discloses its segment information presenting 15 reportable segments. For the reported periods, Cemex's operations were organized in four regions, each under the supervision of a regional president, as follows: 1) Mexico, comprised of one operating and reportable segment, 2) United States, comprised of one operating and reportable segment, 3) Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia ('EMEAA'), comprised of 11 operating segments, of which four were aggregated into a single reportable operating segment as described below, and 4) South, Central America and the Caribbean ('SCA&C'), comprised of 12 operating segments, of which nine were aggregated into two reportable operating segments as described below. The Company's regional presidents, who are part of Cemex's Executive Committee, report to Cemex's Chief Executive O/fficer or CEO. In addition, for those regions comprising several operating segments, such as EMEAA and SCA&C, each operating segment is supervised by a country manager whom in turn reports to the regional president.\n\nThe material accounting policies applied to determine the financial information by reportable segment are consistent with those described in note 28.",

These reportable segments are as follows: a) the 'Rest of EMEAA' reportable segment refers to Cemex's operating segments in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates; b) the 'Rest of SCA&C' reportable segment refers to Cemex's operating segments in Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Jamaica, the Caribbean and Guatemala, excluding the operations of Trinidad Cement Limited ('TCL'); and c) the 'Caribbean TCL' reportable segment refers to the operating segments of TCL and subsidiaries in Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana and Barbados. The line item 'Other activities,' included to reconcile the total of reportable segments with the consolidated amounts from continuing operations, refers to the following combined transactions: 1) cement trade maritime operations, 2) the Parent Company, other corporate entities and finance subsidiaries, and 3) other minor subsidiaries with di/fferent lines of business.\n\nSelected information of the consolidated statements of income by reportable segment for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, excluding the share of profits of equity accounted investees by reportable segment that is included in note 14.1, was as follows:\n\n| 2023                | SALES  (INCLUDING  INTRAGROUP  TRANSACTIONS)   | LESS:  INTRAGROUP  TRANSACTIONS   | EXTERNAL  REVENUES   | OPERATING EBITDA   | LESS:  DEPRECIATION AND  AMORTIZATION   | OPERATING EARNINGS (LOSS) BEFORE OTHER EXPENSES, NET   | OTHER  EXPENSES,  NET   | FINANCIAL  EXPENSE   | OTHER  FINANCING  ITEMS, NET   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Mexico              | $  5,060                                       | (205)                             | 4,855                | 1,488              | 221                                     | 1,267                                                  | (59)                    | (39)                 | 105                            |\n| United States       | 5,338                                          | -

From the previously reported amounts for the years 2022 and 2021, Cemex reclassified from the caption of 'Financial expense' to the line item of 'Financial income and other items, net', an income of $104 and an expense of $82, respectively, corresponding to results associated with the early redemption of debt during those years (note 17.1), considering it contributes to an improved analysis of the financial expense and to conform with the classification of these e/ffects in 2023.\n\n## 8.2) Financial Income and Other Items, Net\n\nThe detail of financial income and other items, net in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\n\n|                                                                  | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Foreign exchange results                                         | $  144 | 73     | (35)   |\n| Financial income                                                 | 40     | 27     | 22     |\n| Results from financial instruments, net (notes 14.2 and 17.4)  1 | (65)   | 99     | (88)   |\n| Net interest cost of defined benefit liabilities (note 19)       | (44)   | (29)   | (31)   |\n| E/ffects of amortized cost on assets and liabilities             | (42)   | (32)   | (28)   |\n| Others                                                           | -      | 13     | (1)    |\n|                                                                  | $  33  | 151    | (161)  |\n\n## 9) Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe balance in this caption is comprised of available amounts of cash and cash equivalents, represented by low-risk, highly liquid short-term investments readily convertible into known amounts of cash, including overnight investments, which yield fixed returns and have maturities of less than three months from the investment date.

Therefore, the trade accounts receivable sold were not derecognized from the statement of financial position and the funded amounts to Cemex as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $678 in both years, were recognized within the line item of 'Other financial obligations' (note 17.2).\n\nThe discount granted to the acquirers of the trade accounts receivable is recorded as financial expense and amounted to $52 in 2023, $24 in 2022 and $11 in 2021. Cemex's securitization programs are usually negotiated for periods of one to two years and are usually renewed at their maturity.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the balances of trade accounts receivable and the allowance for Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') were as follows:\n\n|               | ACCOUNTS   RECEIVABLE   | ECL  ALLOWANCE   | ECL  AVERAGE RATE   |\n|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Mexico        | $  457                  | 31               | 6.8%                |\n| United States | 536                     | 8                | 1.5%                |\n| EMEAA         | 745                     | 41               | 5.5%                |\n| SCA&C         | 96                      | 10               | 10.4%               |\n| Others        | 7                       | -                | -                   |\n|               | $  1,841                | 90               |                     |\n\nChanges in the allowance for ECL in 2023, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:\n\n|                                                              | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Allowances for expected credit losses at beginning of period | $  91  | 101    | 121    |\n| Charged to selling expenses                                  | 11     | 9      | 1      |\n| Deductions                                                   | (15)   | (21)   | (16)   |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale                     | -      | -      | (2)    |\n| Foreign currency translation e/ffects                        | 3      | 2      | (3)    |\n| Allowances for expected credit losses at end of period       | $  90  | 91     | 101    |\n\n## 11) Other Accounts Receivable\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, consolidated other accounts receivable consisted of:\n\n|                                                                              |    |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|--------|\n| Advances of income taxes and other refundable taxes                          | $  |    335 |\n| Non-trade accounts receivable  1                                             |    |    119 |\n| Interest and notes receivable                                                |    |     41 |\n| Loans to employees and others                                                |    |     15 |\n| Current portion of assets from valuation of derivative financial instruments |    |     25 |\n|                                                                              | $  |    535 |",

The weighted average cost of inventories includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Inventory balances are subject to impairment. When an impairment situation arises, the inventory balance is adjusted to its net realizable value against 'Cost of sales.' Advances to suppliers of inventory are presented as part of other current assets.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the consolidated balances of inventories were summarized as follows:\n\n|                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Materials and spare parts | 537    | 563    |\n| Finished goods            | 461    | 406    |\n| Raw materials             | 370    | 329    |\n| Work-in-process           | 330    | 284    |\n| Inventory in transit      | 91     | 87     |\n|                           | 1,789  | 1,669  |\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, Cemex recognized within 'Cost of sales' in the statements of income, inventory impairment losses of $7, $10 and $4, respectively.\n\n## 13) Other Current Assets\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, assets held for sale and other current assets were detailed as follows:\n\n|                      |   2023 |   2022 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Other current assets |    142 |    115 |\n| Assets held for sale |     49 |     68 |\n|                      |    191 |    183 |\n\nAssets held for sale are measured at the lower of their estimated realizable value, less costs to sell, and their carrying amounts.\n\nOther current assets presented above are mainly comprised of advance payments to suppliers.\n\n## 14) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, Other Investments and Non-Current Accounts Receivable\n\n14.1) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the investments in common shares of associates and joint ventures, which are accounted under the equity method, were as follows:\n\n|                                     | ACTIVITY   | COUNTRY         | %    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Associates                          |            |                 |      |        |        |\n| Camcem, S.A. de C.V.                | Cement     | Mexico          | 40.1 | $  364 | 306    |\n| Concrete Supply Co.

In 2022 and 2021, those impairment losses were associated mainly with certain negative e/ffects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020, as a result of which, Cemex closed certain assets that will remain closed for the foreseeable future in relation to the estimated sales volumes and the Company's ability to supply demand by achieving e/fficiencies in other operating assets. In addition, during 2023, 2022 and 2021 there were no reversal of impairment charges.",

This analysis is made during the last quarter, or additionally on any interim date when impairment indicators exist, by means of determining the value in use of its groups of Cash Generating Units ('CGUs') to which goodwill balances have been allocated. The value in use represents the discounted cash flow projections of each CGU for the next five years plus a terminal value using risk adjusted discount rates.\n\nIn 2023, Cemex did not determine goodwill impairment losses considering the increase in the Company's projected cash flows linked to the improved generation of Operating EBITDA in the majority of the countries in which Cemex operates to which goodwill balances have been allocated and the positive outlook for the following years, partly o/ffset by the general increase in the applicable discount rates as compared to 2022, which on average increased 120 basis points or 1.2%.\n\nIn 2022, as part of the mandatory impairment tests during the fourth quarter, Cemex recognized within 'Other expenses, net' (note 7), non-cash goodwill impairment losses for an aggregate amount of $365, of which, $273 correspond to the operating segment in the United States and $92 correspond to the operating segment in Spain. In both cases, the related book value of the operating segment exceeded the corresponding value in use. The impairment losses in 2022 are mainly related to the significant increase in the discount rates as compared to 2021 and the resulting significant decrease in the Company's projected cash flows in these segments considering the global high inflationary environment, which increased the risk-free rates, and the material increase in the funding cost observed in the industry during the period. These negative e/ffects more than o/ffset the expected improvements in the estimated Operating EBITDA generation in both the United States and Spain.\n\nIn 2021, the Company recognized within 'Other expenses, net' (note 7) in the statement of income, non-cash goodwill impairment losses for an aggregate amount of $440, related to the operating segments in Spain of $317, United Arab Emirates ('UAE') of $96 as well as $27 related to Neoris due to reorganization. The impairment losses in Spain and UAE referred closely to disruptions in the supply chains that have generated increases in the estimated production and transportation costs that were considered to be sustained in the mid-term, which significantly reduced the projected Operating EBITDA as compared to the valuations determined as of December 31, 2020.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, goodwill balances allocated by Operating Segment after impairment adjustments were as follows:\n\n|                  | 2023     | 2022   |\n|------------------|----------|--------|\n| Mexico           | $  441   | 384    |\n| United States    | 6,176    | 6,176  |\n| EMEAA            |          |        |\n| United Kingdom   | 264      | 250    |\n| France           | 207      | 201    |\n| Spain            | 59       | 57     |\n| Philippines      | 82       | 82     |\n| Rest of EMEAA  1 | 50       | 38     |\n| SCA&C            |          |        |\n| Colombia         | 254      | 202    |\n| Caribbean TCL    | 83       | 83     |\n| Rest of SCA&C  2 | 58       | 65     |\n|                  | $  7,674 | 7,538  |",

This was partially o/ffset by the reduction in the public comparable companies' stock volatility (beta) which changed from 1.08 in 2022 to 1.07 in 2023. In 2023, the funding cost observed in the industry remained unchanged at 6.7% as compared to 2022, as well as other assumptions that remained relatively flat in 2023 as compared to 2022. As new economic data is available, these financial assumptions will be revised upwards or downwards again in the future. Cemex maintained certain reductions to the long-term growth rates used as of December 31, 2023, as compared to the IMF projections, mainly in Israel in 2.1%, Mexico in 1.0% and Egypt in 3.0%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the discount rates used by Cemex in its cash flows projections to determine the value in use of its operating segments or CGUs in which goodwill has been allocated, increased by a weighted average of 2.0% with respect to the discount rates determined at December 31, 2021, mainly considering the increase in the risk-free rate associated to Cemex which changed from 1.82% in 2021 to 3.58% in 2022, the significant increase in the funding cost observed in the industry which changed from 4.1% in 2021 to 6.7% in 2022, as well as the average increase of 1.7% in the cost of equity in 2022. The other variables remained relatively flat. As new economic data is available, these financial assumptions will be revised upwards or downwards again in the future. Cemex maintained certain reductions to the long-term growth rates used as of December 31, 2022, as compared to the IMF projections, mainly in Mexico in 1.0% and Egypt in 2.85%.\n\nMoreover, the discount rates used by Cemex as of December 31, 2021, changed slightly as compared to 2020 in a range of -0.1% up to 0.5%. The discount rates increased considering the weighing of debt in the calculation which decreased from 34.6% in 2020 to 26.9% in 2021 and the market risk premium which increased from 5.7% in 2020 to 5.8% in 2021. These increasing e/ffects were o/ffset by the decrease in the risk-free rate associated with Cemex which changed from 2.2% in 2020 to 1.8% in 2021 and the reduction in the public comparable companies' stock volatility (beta) that changed from 1.19 in 2020 to 1.12 in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the funding cost observed in the industry of 4.1% remained unchanged against 2020, while the specific risk rates of each country experienced mixed nonsignificant changes in 2021 compared to 2020 in most of the countries. In addition, as a preventive measure to continue considering the COVID-19 Pandemic's negative e/ffects, Cemex reduced in certain countries its long-term growth rates used in their cash flows projections as of December 31, 2021, as compared to the IMF projections such as in Mexico in 1.0% and Egypt in 2.8%.\n\nIn connection with the discount rates and long-term growth rates included in the table above, Cemex verified the reasonableness of its conclusions using sensitivity analyses to changes in assumptions, a/ffecting the value in use of all groups of CGUs with an independent reasonably possible increase of 1% in the pre-tax discount rate, an independent possible decrease of 1% in the long-term growth rate, as well as using multiples of Operating EBITDA, by means of which, Cemex determined a weighted-average multiple of Operating EBITDA to enterprise value observed in recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. The average multiple was then applied to a stabilized amount of Operating EBITDA and the result was compared to the corresponding carrying amount for each group of CGUs to which goodwill had been allocated. Cemex considered an industry average Operating EBITDA multiple of 10.9 times in 2023 and 11.3 times in 2022 and 11.5 times in 2021.",

The factors considered by the Company's management that could cause the hypothetical scenario of the previous sensitivity analysis in the United States are, in relation to the discount rate, an independent increase of 306 bps in the Company's funding cost observed as of December 31, 2023 of 6.67% or, an independent increase in the risk-free rate of 89 bps over the rate of 4.79% in the United States. Nonetheless, such assumptions did not seem reasonable as of December 31, 2023. Cemex continually monitors the evolution of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated that have presented relative goodwill impairment risk in any of the reported periods and if the relevant economic variables and the related value in use would be negatively a/ffected, it may result in a goodwill impairment loss in the future.\n\nImpairment tests are significantly sensitive to the estimation of future prices of Cemex's products, the development of operating expenses, local and international economic trends in the construction industry, the long-term growth expectations in the di/fferent markets, as well as the discount rates and the growth rates in perpetuity applied. For purposes of estimating future prices, Cemex uses, to the extent available, historical data; plus the expected increase or decrease according to information issued by trusted external sources, such as national construction or cement producer chambers and/or in governmental economic expectations. Operating expenses are normally measured as a constant proportion of revenues, following experience. However, such operating expenses are also reviewed considering external information sources in respect of inputs that behave according to international prices, such as oil and gas. Cemex uses specific pre-tax discount rates for each group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated, which are applied to discount pre-tax cash flows. The amounts of estimated undiscounted cash flows are significantly sensitive to the growth rate in perpetuity applied. The higher the growth rate in perpetuity applied, the higher the amount of undiscounted future cash flows by group of CGUs obtained. Moreover, the amounts of discounted estimated future cash flows are significantly sensitive to the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) applied. The higher the discount rate applied, the lower the amount of discounted estimated future cash flows by group of CGUs obtained.",

In addition, Transactional Costs pending for amortization related to extinguished debt instruments of $12 in 2023, $6 in 2022 and $27 in 2021 were also recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net.'\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, non-current notes payable for $3,535 and $4,160, respectively, were detailed as follows:\n\n| DESCRIPTION                   | DATE OF  ISSUANCE   | ISSUER  1             | CURRENCY   | PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT   | RATE             | MATURITY   DATE   | REDEEMED  AMOUNT  2 $   | OUTSTANDING  AMOUNT  2 $   | 2023     | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------|--------|\n| 2023 CEBURES variable rate  3 | 05/Oct/23           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Peso       |                     | 1,000  TIIE+.45% | 01/Oct/26         | -                       | 59                         | $  59    | -      |\n| 2023 CEBURES fixed rate  3    | 05/Oct/23           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Peso       | 5,000               | 11.48%           | 26/Sep/30         | -                       | 295                        | 292      | -      |\n| July 2031 Notes  4            | 12/Jan/21           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Dollar     | 1,750               | 3.875%           | 11/Jul/31         | (642)                   | 1,108                      | 1,102    | 1,102  |\n| September 2030 Notes  4       | 17/Sep/20           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Dollar     | 1,000               | 5.2%             | 17/Sep/30         | (283)                   | 717                        | 714      | 714    |\n| November 2029 Notes  4        | 19/Nov/19           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Dollar     | 1,000               | 5.45%            | 19/Nov/29         | (247)                   | 753                        | 749      | 749    |\n| June 2027 Notes  5            | 05/Jun/20           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Dollar     | 1,000               | 7.375%           | 05/Jun/27         | (1,000)                 | -                          | -        | 996    |\n| March 2026 Notes              | 19/Mar/19           | Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. | Euro       | 400                 | 3.125%           | 19/Mar/26         | -                       | 442                        | 441      | 427    |\n| July 2025 Notes               | 01/Apr/03           | Cemex Materials LLC   | Dollar     | 150                 | 7.70%            | 21/Jul/25         | -                       | 150                        | 151      | 152    |\n| Other notes payable           |                     |                       |            |                     |                  |                   |                         |                            | 27       | 20     |\n|                               |                     |                       |            |                     |                  |                   |                         |                            | $  3,535 | 4,160  |\n\nThe maturities of consolidated long-term debt as of December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n\n|                     | BANK LOANS   | NOTES PAYABLE   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|\n| 2025                | $  608       | 167             | 775     |\n| 2026                | 324          | 506             | 830     |\n| 2027                | 577          | 4               | 581     |\n| 2028                | 1,131        | -               | 1,131   |\n| 2029 and thereafter | 28           | 2,858           | 2,886   |\n|                     | $  2,668     | 3,535           | 6,203   |",

Under the 2023 Credit Agreement, the annual performance in respect to the metrics referenced in the 2023 SLFF may result in a total adjustment of the interest rate margin of plus or minus 5 bps 1 , in line with other sustainability-linked facilities from investment-grade rated borrowers.\n\nThe remainder of the debt balance under the SLFFs relates to the 2023 CEBURES. Of these, $59 or the variable rate leg is linked exclusively to one metric of the 2023 SLFF and may result in an increase of 20 bps in the nominal value at redemption. The remaining $292, or the fixed rate leg is also linked to only one metric of the 2023 SLFF and may result in a per annum increase of 25 bps to the interest rate applicable to the last four semi-annual coupon payments.\n\nAdditionally, Cemex's securitization programs (notes 10 and 17.2) are linked to the 2021 SLFFs, utilizing one or more metrics and may result in an annual fee payment equivalent to up to 5 bps of the total facilities amount.\n\n## 2023 Credit Agreement and 2021 Credit Agreement\n\nOn October 30, 2023, Cemex refinanced its 2021 Credit Agreement (as described below), extending the maturity to 2028. The refinanced 2021 Credit Agreement (the '2023 Credit Agreement') comprises a $1,000, 5-year amortizing term loan and a $2,000, 5-year committed revolving credit facility ('RCF'). The 2023 Credit Agreement represents a reduction of $500 in the term loan and an increase of $250 in the revolver of the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement, denominated exclusively in Dollars, maintains its previous interest rate margin and financial covenants, consistent with an investment-grade capital structure, which provide for a maximum ratio of Consolidated Net Debt (as defined below) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined below) ('Consolidated Leverage Ratio') of 3.75 times throughout the life of the loan and a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense ('Consolidated Coverage Ratio') of 2.75 times. As of December 31, 2023, the debt outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement amounted to $1,600, which includes amounts owed under the RCF of $600.\n\nAll tranches under the 2023 Credit Agreement include a margin over SOFR 1 from 100 bps 1 to 175 bps, depending on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio ranging from less than or equal to 2.25 times in the lower end to greater than 3.25 times in the higher end.\n\nOn November 8, 2021, Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. closed a Dollar-denominated $3,250 syndicated sustainability-linked credit agreement (the '2021 Credit Agreement'), which proceeds were mainly used to fully repay its previous syndicated facilities agreement entered in 2017. The 2021 Credit Agreement, which was the first debt instrument issued by Cemex under the 2021 SLFF, resulted in a stronger liquidity position for Cemex from a risk and credit rating perspective.\n\nThe balance of debt under the 2023 Credit Agreement, in which debtor is Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V., is guaranteed by Cemex Concretos, S.A. de C.V., Cemex Operaciones M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V., Cemex Innovation Holding Ltd. and Cemex Corp., same guarantor structure applicable in all senior notes of the Parent Company and the previous 2021 Credit Agreement.\n\nThe 2023 Credit Agreement contains ongoing representations, warranties, a/ffirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cemex was in compliance with all covenants contained in the 2023 Credit Agreement and the 2021 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Cemex cannot assure that in the future it will be able to comply with all such covenants, including any financial covenants, which non-compliance, if not remedied, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely a/ffect Cemex's business and financial condition.",

These financial ratios are calculated using the consolidated amounts under IFRS.\n\n## Consolidated Leverage Ratio\n\n- \u00b7  Under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the 2021 Credit Agreement, the ratio is calculated by dividing 'Consolidated Net Debt' by 'Consolidated EBITDA' for the last twelve months as of the calculation date. Consolidated Net Debt equals debt, as reported in the statement of financial position, net of cash and cash equivalents, excluding any existing or future obligations under any securitization program, and any subordinated debt of Cemex, adjusted for net mark-tomarket of all derivative instruments, as applicable, among other adjustments including in relation for business acquisitions or disposals.\n\nConsolidated EBITDA: Under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the 2021 Credit Agreement, represents Operating EBITDA for the last twelve months as of the calculation date, as adjusted for any discontinued EBITDA, and solely for the purpose of calculating the Consolidated Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis for any material disposition and/or material acquisition.\n\n## Consolidated Coverage Ratio\n\n- \u00b7  Under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the 2021 Credit Agreement, the ratio is calculated by dividing Consolidated EBITDA by the financial expense for the last twelve months as of the calculation date.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the 2021 Credit Agreement, as applicable, the main consolidated financial ratios were as follows:\n\n| CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RATIOS   |             | REFERS TO THE COMPLIANCE LIMITS AND CALCULATIONS THAT   WERE EFFECTIVE ON EACH DATE   | REFERS TO THE COMPLIANCE LIMITS AND CALCULATIONS THAT   WERE EFFECTIVE ON EACH DATE   | REFERS TO THE COMPLIANCE LIMITS AND CALCULATIONS THAT   WERE EFFECTIVE ON EACH DATE   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 |             | 2023                                                                                  | 2022                                                                                  | 2021                                                                                  |\n| Leverage ratio                  | Limit       | <=3.75                                                                                | <=3.75                                                                                | <=3.75                                                                                |\n|                                 | Calculation | 2.06                                                                                  | 2.84                                                                                  | 2.73                                                                                  |\n| Coverage ratio                  | Limit       | >=2.75                                                                                | >=2.75                                                                                | >=2.75                                                                                |\n|                                 | Calculation | 7.91                                                                                  | 6.27                                                                                  | 5.99                                                                                  |\n\nCemex's ability to comply with these ratios may be a/ffected by economic conditions, volatility in foreign exchange rates, as well as by overall conditions in the financial and capital markets or other factors.\n\nCemex will classify all of its non-current debt as current debt if: 1) as of any measurement date Cemex fails to comply with any covenants that would cause a default, including the aforementioned financial ratios; or 2) the cross default clause that is part of the 2023 Credit Agreement is triggered by the provisions contained therein; and/or 3) as of any date prior to a subsequent measurement date Cemex expects not to be in compliance with such financial ratios in the absence of: a) amendments and/or waivers covering the next succeeding 12 months; b) high probability that the violation will be cured during any agreed upon remediation period and be sustained for the next succeeding 12 months; and/or c) an agreement to refinance the relevant debt on a long-term basis. As a result of noncompliance with the agreed upon financial ratios or, in such event, the absence of a waiver of compliance or a negotiation thereof, after certain procedures followed upon Cemex's lenders' request, they may call for the acceleration of payments due under the 2023 Credit Agreement. That scenario would have a material adverse e/ffect on Cemex's operating results, liquidity or financial position.",

Leases (notes 8.1, 15.2, 24.1 and 28.4)\n\nCemex has several operating and administrative assets under lease contracts (note 15.2). As mentioned in note 28.4, Cemex applies the recognition exemption for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Changes in the balance of lease financial liabilities during 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n|                                                     | 2023     | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Lease financial liability at beginning of year      | $  1,176 | 1,176  | 1,260  |\n| Additions from new leases                           | 341      | 296    | 227    |\n| Reductions from payments                            | (256)    | (276)  | (313)  |\n| Cancellations and liability remeasurements          | (24)     | 7      | 27     |\n| Foreign currency translation and accretion e/ffects | 21       | (27)   | (25)   |\n| Lease financial liability at end of year            | $  1,258 | 1,176  | 1,176  |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of non-current lease financial liabilities are as follows:\n\n|                     | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------|---------|\n| 2025                | $  181  |\n| 2026                | 144     |\n| 2027                | 108     |\n| 2028                | 77      |\n| 2029 and thereafter | 476     |\n|                     | $  986  |\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, including the interest expense portion as disclosed at note 8.1, were $331, $342 and $381, respectively. Future payments associated with these contracts are presented in note 24.1.\n\n## II. Liabilities secured with accounts receivable\n\nAs mentioned in note 10, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the funded amounts of sale of trade accounts receivable under securitization programs and/or factoring programs with recourse of $678 in both years, were recognized within the line item 'Other financial obligations' in the statement of financial position. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the net cash flows generated by (used in) these securitization programs were $(18), $79 and $25, respectively.\n\nThe balances of the Company's other financial obligations associated with the programs for the sale of accounts receivable mentioned above are part of Cemex's total obligations under the 2021 SLFF, which are linked and aligned to Cemex's strategy of CO2 emissions reduction and its ultimate vision of a carbon-neutral economy (note 24.4).\n\n## 17.3) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder IFRS, fair value represents an 'Exit Value' which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, considering the counterparty's credit risk in the valuation. Exit Value is premised on the existence of a market and market participants for the specific asset or liability. When there are no market and/or market participants, IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements), inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, used mainly to determine the fair value of securities, investments or loans that are not actively traded (Level 2 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).",

There is no direct measure for the risk of Cemex or its counterparties in connection with such instruments. Therefore, the risk factors applied for Cemex's assets and liabilities originated by the valuation of such derivatives were extrapolated from publicly available risk discounts for other public debt instruments of Cemex or its counterparties.\n\nThe estimated fair value of derivative instruments fluctuates over time and is determined by measuring the e/ffect of future relevant economic variables according to the yield curves shown in the market as of the reporting date. These values should be analyzed in relation to the fair values of the underlying transactions and as part of Cemex's overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The notional amounts of derivative instruments do not represent amounts of cash exchanged by the parties, and consequently, there is no direct measure of Cemex's exposure to the use of these derivatives. The amounts exchanged are determined based on the notional amounts and other terms included in the derivative instruments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities and their respective fair values were as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | 2023              | 2023        | 2022             | 2022        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|\n|                                                                   | CARRYING   AMOUNT | FAIR  VALUE | CARRYING  AMOUNT | FAIR  VALUE |\n| Financial assets                                                  |                   |             |                  |             |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 14.2 and 17.4)            | $  64             | 64          | $  57            | 57          |\n| Other investments and non-current accounts receivable (note 14.2) | 276               | 266         | 236              | 229         |\n|                                                                   | $  340            | 330         | $  293           | 286         |\n| Financial liabilities                                             |                   |             |                  |             |\n| Long-term debt (note 17.1)                                        | $  6,203          | 6,030       | $  6,920         | 6,517       |\n| Other financial obligations (note 17.2)                           | 986               | 919         | 918              | 788         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 17.4 and 18.2)            | 15                | 15          | 2                | 2           |\n|                                                                   | $  7,204          | 6,964       | $  7,840         | 7,307       |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, assets and liabilities carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position are included in the following fair value hierarchy categories (note 28.4):\n\n| 2023                                                         | LEVEL 1   | LEVEL 2   | LEVEL 3   | TOTAL   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Assets measured at fair value                                |           |           |           |         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 14.2 and 17.4)       | $  -      | 64        | -         | 64      |\n| Investments in strategic equity securities (note 14.2)       | 3         | -         | -         | 3       |\n| Other investments at fair value through earnings (note 14.2) | -         | 1         | -         | 1       |\n|                                                              | $  3      | 65        | -         | 68      |\n| Liabilities measured at fair value                           |           |           |           |         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 17.4 and 18.2)       | $  -      | 15        | -         | 15      |\n| 2022                                                         | LEVEL 1   | LEVEL 2   | LEVEL 3   | TOTAL   |\n| Assets measured at fair value                                |           |           |           |         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 14.2 and 17.4)       | $  -      | 57        | -         | 57      |\n| Investments in strategic equity securities (note 14.2)       | 5         | -         | -         | 5       |\n| Other investments at fair value through earnings (note 14.2) | -         | 3         | -         | 3       |\n|                                                              | $  5      | 60        | -         | 65      |\n| Liabilities measured at fair value                           |           |           |           |         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (notes 17.4 and 18.2)       | $  -      | 2         | -         | 2       |",

During the reported periods, Cemex did not have derivatives designated as fair value hedges.\n\n## I. Net investment hedges\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there are Dollar/Peso foreign exchange forward contracts with target tenor ranging from 1 to 15 months for notional amounts of $518 and $738, respectively. Cemex has designated this program as a hedge of Cemex's net investment in Pesos, pursuant to which changes in the fair market value of these instruments are recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity. For the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, these contracts generated losses of $172, $96 and $4, respectively, which partially o/ffset currency translation gains in each year recognized in equity generated from Cemex's net assets denominated in Pesos. The losses generated from these derivatives relate to the appreciation of the Peso, mainly in 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, as part of Cemex's Peso net investment hedge strategy, there are additional Dollar/Peso capped forwards, structured with option contracts, for a notional amount of $458 and $99, respectively. These capped forwards contain limits on the upside that the instrument may generate. Changes in the fair market value of such capped forward contracts are also recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity. For the years 2023 and 2022, these contracts generated losses of $54 and $2, respectively, which partially o/ffset currency translation gains recognized in equity generated from Cemex's net assets denominated in Pesos due to the appreciation of the Peso in 2023 and 2022.\n\nMoreover, during the year 2022, Cemex unwound Dollar/Euro cross-currency swap contracts for a notional amount of $750, which resulted in a settlement gain of $80 in equity. Cemex designated the foreign exchange forward component of these instruments as a hedge of Cemex's net investment in Euros and changes in fair market were recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity, while changes in fair value of the interest rate swap component until settlement were recognized within the line item of 'Financial income and other items, net,' representing gains of $8 in 2022 and losses of $1 in 2021. For the years 2022 and 2021, the foreign exchange forward component generated gains of $70 and $10 recognized in equity, which partially o/ffset currency translation losses recognized in equity generated from Cemex's net assets denominated in Euros due to the depreciation of the Euro against the Dollar in 2022 and 2021, related to the exchange of interest rates in the statement of income.\n\n## II.Cross currency swaps\n\nDuring October 2023, Cemex entered into cross-currency swap contracts for a notional amount of $335 in connection with the issuances of the 2023 CEBURES as described in note 17.1, aiming to change the rate and currency risk profile of such 2023 CEBURES from the Peso to the Dollar. Cemex designated these contracts as cash flow hedges of interest rate payments in relation to an equivalent amount of variable and fixed interest rate debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts for the interest rate swap leg are initially recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity and are subsequently allocated through financial expense as interest expense on the related loans is accrued in the statement of income, while changes in fair value of the currency forward leg are recognized directly in the statement of income partially o/ffsetting the related Peso denominated debt's foreign exchange fluctuation. For the year 2023, changes in the fair value of these contracts generated gains of $23 recognized in other comprehensive income and gains of $5 recognized in the statement of income.",

Interest rate swap contracts\n\nFor accounting purposes under IFRS, Cemex designates interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges, to fix interest rate payments in relation to an equivalent amount of floating interest rate debt. As a result, changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially recognized as part of other comprehensive income in equity and are subsequently reclassified to financial expense as the interest expense of the related floating interest rate debt is accrued in the statement of income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cemex held interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $750, in both periods, with a fair market value representing assets of $30 in 2023 and $39 in 2022, negotiated in June 2018 to fix interest payments of existing bank loans bearing Dollar floating rates. During November 2021, Cemex unwound a portion of its then outstanding interest rate swaps, resulting in a settlement loss of $5, recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statement of income, and extended the remaining contracts until November 2026. For the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, changes in the fair value of these contracts generated losses of $9 and gains of $69 and $23, respectively, recognized in other comprehensive income. Moreover, during the same periods, Cemex reclassified results from equity to the line item 'Financial expenses' representing income of $22 in 2023 and expenses of $2 in 2022 and $22 in 2021.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2022, Cemex held interest rate swaps for a notional of $268 negotiated to fix interest payments of existing bank loans referenced to Peso floating rates that matured in November 2023, which fair value represented an asset of $15 in 2022. During December 2021, Cemex partially unwound its interest rate swap receiving, $3 recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statement of income. For the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 until their settlement, changes in the fair value of these contracts generated losses of $15 and gains of $3 and $15, respectively, recognized in other comprehensive income. Moreover, during the same periods, Cemex recycled results from equity to the 'Financial expenses' line item representing gains of $18 in 2023, $7 in 2022 and expenses of $0.3 in 2021.\n\n## IV. Fuel price hedging\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cemex maintained swap and option contracts negotiated to hedge the price of certain fuels in several operations, primarily diesel and gas, for aggregate notional amounts of $110 and $136, respectively, with an estimated aggregate fair value representing assets of $1 in 2023 and of $8 in 2022. By means of these contracts, for its own consumption only, Cemex either fixed the price of these fuels, or entered into option contracts to limit the prices to be paid for these fuels, over certain volumes representing a portion of the estimated consumption of such fuels in several operations. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of diesel or gas consumption, and as such, changes in fair value are recognized temporarily through other comprehensive income and are recycled to operating expenses as the related fuel volumes are consumed. For the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, changes in fair value of these contracts recognized in other comprehensive income represented losses of $6, losses of $25 and gains of $22, respectively. Moreover, during the same periods, Cemex recycled results from equity to the line items of 'Cost of sales' and 'Operating expenses,' as applicable, representing losses of $7 in 2023, gains of $88 in 2022 and $36 in 2021.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, Cemex held Brent Oil call spreads with a notional of $122, intended economically to mitigate the exposure over a portion of the diesel cost implicit in Cemex's distribution expense. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized directly in the statement of income as part of 'Financial income and other items, net' which resulted in losses of $1 in 2023.\n\n## V. Foreign exchange options\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cemex held Dollar/Peso call spread option contracts for a notional amount of $300 and $500, respectively. Such contracts mature between June 2025 and December 2025 and were negotiated to maintain the value in Dollars over an equivalent amount of revenue generated in Pesos. Changes in the fair value of these instruments generated losses of $18 in 2023, $13 in 2022 and $5 in 2021, recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' in the statement of income.\n\n## 17.5) Risk Management\n\nEnterprise risks may arise from any of the following situations: i) the potential change in the value of assets owned or reasonably anticipated to be owned, ii) the potential change in value of liabilities incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, iii) the potential change in value of services provided, purchase or reasonably anticipated to be provided or purchased in the ordinary course of business, iv) the potential change in the value of assets, services, inputs, products or commodities owned, produced, manufactured, processed, merchandised, leased or sold or reasonably anticipated to be owned, produced, manufactured, processed, merchandised, leased or sold in the ordinary course of business, or v) any potential change in the value arising from interest rate or foreign exchange rate exposures arising from current or anticipated assets or liabilities.",

To manage this and other risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and liquidity risk, considering the guidelines set forth by the Parent Company's Board of Directors, which represent Cemex's risk management framework and that are supervised by several Committees, Cemex's management establishes specific policies that determine strategies oriented to obtain natural hedges to the extent possible, such as avoiding customer concentration on a determined market or aligning the currencies portfolio in which Cemex incurred its debt, with those in which Cemex generates its cash flows.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, these strategies are sometimes complemented with the use of derivative financial instruments as mentioned in note 17.4, such as the commodity forward contracts on fuels negotiated to fix the price of these underlying commodities.\n\nThe main risk categories are mentioned below:\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss faced by Cemex if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument does not meet its contractual obligations and originates mainly from trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the balance of financial assets. Management has developed policies for the authorization of credit to customers. Exposure to credit risk is monitored constantly according to the payment behavior of debtors. Credit is assigned on a customer-by-customer basis and is subject to assessments which consider the customers' payment capacity, as well as past behavior regarding due dates, balances past due and delinquent accounts. In cases deemed necessary, Cemex's management requires guarantees from its customers and financial counterparties regarding financial assets.\n\nThe Company's management has established a policy of low risk tolerance that analyzes the creditworthiness of each new client individually before o/ffering the general conditions of payment terms and delivery. The review includes external ratings, when references are available, and in, some cases, bank references. Thresholds of purchase limits are established for each client, which represent the maximum purchase amounts that require di/fferent levels of approval. Customers who do not meet the levels of solvency requirements imposed by Cemex can only carry out transactions by paying cash in advance. As of December 31, 2023, considering Cemex's best estimate of potential expected losses based on the ECL model developed by Cemex (note 10), the allowance for expected credit losses was $90.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that a financial instrument's fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates, which only a/ffects Cemex's results if the fixed-rate long-term debt is measured at fair value. Cemex's fixed-rate long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and therefore is not subject to interest rate risk. Cemex's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates, which, if such rates were to increase, may adversely a/ffect its financing cost and the results for the period.\n\nAdditionally, there is an opportunity cost for continuing to pay a determined fixed interest rate when the market rates have decreased, and the entity may obtain improved interest rate conditions in a new loan or debt issuance. Cemex manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and floating rates while attempting to reduce its interest costs. Cemex could renegotiate the conditions or repurchase the debt, particularly when the net present value ('NPV') of the estimated future benefits from the interest rate reduction is expected to exceed the cost and commissions that would have to be paid in such renegotiation or repurchase of debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 26% and 21%, respectively, of Cemex's long-term debt was denominated in floating rates at a weighted-average interest rate of SOFR plus 95 basis points in 2023 and LIBOR plus 148 basis points in 2022. These figures reflect the e/ffect of interest rate swaps held by Cemex during 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, if interest rates at that date had been 0.5% higher, with all other variables held constant, Cemex's net income for 2023 and 2022 would have reduced by $14 and $13, respectively, because of higher interest expense on variable rate denominated debt. This analysis does not include the e/ffect of interest rate swaps held by Cemex during 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Management of interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn connection with the global reform of major interest rate benchmarks, which included the replacement of interbank o/ffered rates (IBORs) with alternative secured rates (referred to as the 'IBOR reform'), during the first half of 2023 Cemex completed the migration of applicable financial instruments, derivatives and loans previously linked to Dollar LIBOR rates.\n\nCemex's financial risk management committee monitored and managed the Company's transition to alternative secured rates.",

Cemex's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to its operating activities. Due to its geographic diversification, Cemex's revenues and costs are generated and settled in various countries and di/fferent currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 29% of Cemex's revenues, before eliminations resulting from consolidation, were generated in Mexico, 31% in the United States, 6% in the United Kingdom, 5% in France, 3% in Germany, 3% in Poland, 3% in Spain, 2% in the Philippines, 5% in Israel and 4% in the Rest of EMEAA region, 3% in Colombia, 1% in Panama, 2% in Dominican Republic, 2% in Caribbean TCL and 1% in the Rest of SCA&C.\n\nForeign exchange results incurred through monetary assets or liabilities in a currency di/fferent from its functional currency are recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Exchange fluctuations associated with foreign currency indebtedness directly related to the acquisition of foreign entities and exchange fluctuations in related parties' long-term balances denominated in foreign currency that are not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future, are recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2023, excluding from the sensitivity analysis the impact of translating the net assets denominated in currencies di/fferent from Cemex's presentation currency, considering a hypothetic 10% strengthening of the Dollar against the Peso, with all other variables held constant, Cemex's net income for 2023 would have decreased by $160, as a result of higher foreign exchange losses on Cemex's Dollardenominated net monetary liabilities held in consolidated entities with other functional currencies. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% weakening of the Dollar against the Peso would have the opposite e/ffect.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, 70% of Cemex's financial debt was Dollar-denominated, 16% was Euro-denominated, 11% was Peso-denominated, 2% was Philippine Peso-denominated and 1% was in other currencies. Therefore, Cemex had a foreign currency exposure arising mainly from the Dollar-denominated debt versus the several currencies in which Cemex's revenues are settled in most countries in which it operates. Cemex cannot guarantee that it will generate su/fficient revenues in Dollars from its operations to service these obligations. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex had implemented a derivative financing hedging strategy using foreign exchange options for a notional amount of $300 to hedge the value in Dollar terms of revenues generated in Pesos to partially address this foreign currency risk (note 17.4). Complementarily, Cemex may negotiate other derivative financing hedging strategies in the future if either of its debt portfolio currency mix, interest rate mix, market conditions and/or expectations changes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cemex's consolidated net monetary assets (liabilities) by currency are as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2023     | 2023          | 2023    | 2023   | 2023      | 2023     |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|\n|                                   | MEXICO   | UNITED STATES | EMEAA   | SCA&C  | OTHERS  1 | TOTAL    |\n| Monetary assets                   | $  1,627 | 651           | 1,491   | 274    | (241)     | 3,802    |\n| Monetary liabilities              | 2,184    | 2,679         | 3,087   | 730    | 7,179     | 15,859   |\n| Net monetary assets (liabilities) | $  (557) | (2,028)       | (1,596) | (456)  | (7,420)   | (12,057) |\n| Out of which:                     |          |               |         |        |           |          |\n| Dollars                           | $  (157) | (2,030)       | (5)     | (61)   | (4,780)   | (7,033)  |\n| Pesos                             | (400)    | -             | -       | -      | (524)     | (924)    |\n| Euros                             | -        | -             | (660)   | -      | (1,563)   | (2,223)  |\n| Pounds                            | -        | -             | (710)   | -      | 97        | (613)    |\n| Other currencies                  | -        | 2             | (221)   | (395)  | (650)     | (1,264)  |\n|                                   | $  (557) | (2,028)       | (1,596) | (456)  | (7,420)   | (12,057) |",

When the Dollar appreciates, the value of these net assets denominated in other currencies decreases in terms of Dollars, generating negative foreign currency translation and reducing stockholders' equity. Conversely, when the Dollar depreciates, the value of such net assets denominated in other currencies would increase in terms of Dollars generating the opposite e/ffect. Cemex has implemented a Dollar/Peso foreign exchange forward contracts program to hedge foreign currency translation in connection with its net assets denominated in Pesos (note 17.4).\n\n## Equity risk\n\nEquity risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in the market price of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.'s and/or third party's shares. Cemex has negotiated equity forward contracts on third-party shares. Under these equity derivative instruments, there is a direct relationship between the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in price of the underlying share. All changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are recognized in the statement of income as part of 'Financial income and other items, net.' During the reported periods e/ffects were not significant. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex does not have derivative financial instruments based on the price of the Parent Company's shares or any third-party's shares.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Cemex will not have su/fficient funds available to meet its obligations. In addition to cash flows provided by its operating activities, to meet Cemex's overall liquidity needs for operations, servicing debt and funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, Cemex relies on cost-cutting and operating improvements to optimize capacity utilization and maximize profitability, as well as borrowing under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity o/fferings, and proceeds from asset sales. Cemex is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, prices and currency controls, interest rates, inflation, governmental spending, social instability and other political, economic and/or social developments in the countries in which it operates, any one of which may materially a/ffect Cemex's results and reduce cash from operations. The maturities of Cemex's contractual obligations are included in note 24.1.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, current liabilities, which included $975 of current debt and other financial obligations, exceed current assets by $1,781. It is noted that as part of its operating strategy implemented by management, the Company operates with a negative working capital balance. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Cemex generated net cash flows from operating activities of $2,159. The Company's management considers that Cemex will generate su/fficient cash flows from operations in the following twelve months to meet its current obligations. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, Cemex has a committed line of credit under the RCF for $2,000. As of December 31, 2023, the withdrawn amount is $600.",

Cemex contributes periodically the amounts o/ffered by the pension plan to the employee's individual accounts, not retaining any remaining liability as of the financial statements' date.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans\n\nMost of Cemex's defined benefit plans have been closed to new participants for several years.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the projected benefits obligation related to these benefits was $57 and $60, respectively, included within other benefits liability. The medical inflation rates used to determine the projected benefits obligation of these benefits in 2023 and 2022 for Mexico were 8% in both years, for Puerto Rico 6.6% and 5.4%, respectively, for the United Kingdom were 6.6% and 6.8%, respectively, and for TCL was a rate range between 5.0% and 9.0% and 5.0% and 13.0%, respectively.\n\n## Significant events of settlements or curtailments related to employees' pension benefits and other post-employment benefits during the reported periods\n\nIn 2023, as a result of an extension in the retirement age for the Company's operations in Mexico, there was a reduction of $11 in the retirement obligations recognized against the statement of income for the period. Additionally, in France, there was a pension reform that increased the legal minimum retirement age, resulting in a total past service amendment of $1 in its pension plan recognized in the statement of income for the period.\n\nDuring 2022, there were no significant settlements or curtailments related to employees' pension benefits and other post-employment benefits.\n\nIn 2021, as an e/ffect of a sale of assets in France (note 4.2), there was a curtailment gain of $1 in its pension plan recognized in the statement of income for the period. In addition, one of the participating companies in other postretirement benefits of TCL ceased operations in February 2021, resulting in a curtailment gain in other postretirement benefits of $1 reflected in the statement of income for the period.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of pension and other post-employment benefits\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Cemex performed sensitivity analyses on the most significant assumptions that a/ffect the PBO, considering reasonable independent changes of plus or minus 50 basis points in each of these assumptions. The increase (decrease) that would have resulted in the PBO of pensions and other postemployment benefits are shown below:\n\n|                                   | PENSIONS   | PENSIONS   | OTHER BENEFITS   | OTHER BENEFITS   | TOTAL   | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------|\n| ASSUMPTIONS:                      | +50 BPS    | -50 BPS    | +50 BPS          | -50 BPS          | +50 BPS | -50 BPS |\n| Discount Rate Sensitivity         | $  (95)    | 104        | (4)              | 4                | (99)    | 108     |\n| Salary Increase Rate Sensitivity  | 4          | (4)        | 1                | (1)              | 5       | (5)     |\n| Pension Increase Rate Sensitivity | 73         | (68)       | -                | -                | 73      | (68)    |\n\n## Multiemployer defined benefit pension plans\n\nIn addition to the Company's sponsored plans, Cemex contributes to union-sponsored multiemployer retirement defined benefit pension plans (the 'Multiemployer Plans') under the terms of collective bargaining agreements for certain union employees in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Company's main risks of participating in Multiemployer Plans are di/fferent from its single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\n- a) Assets contributed to the Multiemployer Plans by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;\n- b) If a participating employer stops contributing to the Multiemployer Plans, the unfunded obligations of the Multiemployer Plans may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and\n- c) If Cemex chooses to stop participating in the Multiemployer Plans, the Company may be required to pay the Multiemployer Plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the Multiemployer Plans, referred to as a withdrawal liability.",

The combined amounts contributed to the Multiemployer Plans were $20 in 2023, $21 in 2022 and $17 in 2021. The Company expects to contribute $21 to the Multiemployer Plans in 2024.\n\nAmong other factors, Multiemployers Plans in the red zone (critical) are generally less than 65% funded, Multiemployers Plans in the yellow zone (endangered) are less than 80% funded and Multiemployers Plans in the green zone (neither critical and declining, critical, or endangered) are at least 80% funded. Over 99% of Cemex's obligations and contributions under the Multiemployer Plans are related to the United States where 422 former employees are beneficiaries and where, according to data obtained from Multiemployer Plans actuary, most of the plans are considered to be in the green zone and one plan is in the yellow zone. As a result, the Company's risk of increasing contributions is considered low. In the United Kingdom, the Multiemployer Plan, which covers only two of Cemex's former employees, is in the green zone. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, Cemex is a very small participant in the applicable Multiemployer Plans.\n\n## 20) Income Taxes\n\n## 20.1) Income Taxes for the Period\n\nThe amounts of income tax expense in the statements of income for 2023, 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows:\n\n|                                       | 2023     |   2022 | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Current income tax expense            | $  1,147 |    170 | 172    |\n| Deferred income tax expense (benefit) | 103      |     39 | (35)   |\n|                                       | $  1,250 |    209 | 137    |\n\n## 20.2) Deferred Income Taxes\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the main temporary di/fferences that generated the consolidated deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\n\n|                                                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Deferred tax assets:                                                       |         |         |\n| Tax loss carryforwards and other tax credits                               | $  445  | 561     |\n| Accounts payable and accrued expenses                                      | 883     | 734     |\n| Intangible assets, net                                                     | 192     | 140     |\n| Others                                                                     | 11      | 20      |\n| Total deferred tax assets, gross                                           | 1,531   | 1,455   |\n| Presentation of net position by same legal entity                          | (1,168) | (1,044) |\n|                                                                            | 363     | 411     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities:                                                  |         |         |\n| Property, machinery and equipment and right-of-use asset, net              | (1,470) | (1,406) |\n| Investments and other assets                                               | (141)   | (32)    |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities, gross                                      | (1,611) | (1,438) |\n| Presentation of net position by same legal entity                          | 1,168   | 1,044   |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities, net in the statement of financial position | (443)   | (394)   |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities )                                     | $  (80) | 17      |\n| Out of which:                                                              |         |         |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) in Mexican entities                  | $  67   | (17)    |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) in foreign entities                  | (147)   | 34      |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities )                                     | $  (80) | 17      |",

Based on the same forecasts of future cash flows and operating results used by Cemex's management to allocate resources and evaluate performance in the countries in which Cemex operates, along with the implementation of feasible tax strategies, Cemex believes that it will recover the balance of its tax loss carryforwards that have been recognized before their expiration. In addition, Cemex concluded that the deferred tax liabilities considered in the analysis of recoverability of its deferred tax assets will reverse in the same period and tax jurisdiction of the related recognized deferred tax assets. Moreover, a certain amount of Cemex's deferred tax assets refers to operating segments and tax jurisdictions in which Cemex is currently generating taxable income or in which, according to Cemex's management cash flow projections, will generate taxable income in the relevant periods before the expiration of the deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Parent Company does not recognize a deferred income tax liability related to its investments in subsidiaries considering that Cemex controls the reversal of the temporary di/fferences arising from these investments and management is satisfied that such temporary di/fferences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

As of December 31, 2023, the tax returns submitted by some subsidiaries of Cemex located in several countries are under review by the respective tax authorities in the ordinary course of business. Cemex cannot anticipate if such reviews will result in new tax assessments, which would, should any arise, be appropriately disclosed and/or recognized in the financial statements.\n\nA summary of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:\n\n|                                                                       | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Balance of tax positions at beginning of the period                   | $  41  | 48     | 27     |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior periods                          | 34     | 5      | 4      |\n| Additions for tax positions of current period                         | 3      | 5      | 27     |\n| Reductions for tax positions related to prior periods and other items | (1)    | (11)   | (2)    |\n| Settlements and reclassifications                                     | -      | (4)    | (5)    |\n| Expiration of the statute of limitations                              | (2)    | (2)    | (2)    |\n| Foreign currency translation e/ffects                                 | 3      | -      | (1)    |\n| Balance of tax positions at end of the period                         | $  78  | 41     | 48     |\n\nTax examinations can involve complex issues, and the resolution of issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation. Although Cemex believes its estimates of the total unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable, uncertainties regarding the final determination of income tax audit settlements and any related litigation could a/ffect the amount of total unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. It is di/fficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to uncertain tax positions, as finalizing audits with the tax authorities may involve formal administrative and legal proceedings. Accordingly, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected changes to the total unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months, although any settlements or statute of limitations expirations may result in a significant increase or decrease in the total unrecognized tax benefits, including those positions related to tax examinations being currently conducted.\n\n## Significant tax proceedings\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's most significant tax proceedings are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  The tax authorities in Spain ('the Spanish Tax Authorities') challenged part of the tax loss carryforwards reported by Cemex Espa\u00f1a, S.A. ('Cemex Espa\u00f1a') covering the tax years from and including 2006 to 2009. During 2013, the Spanish Tax Authorities notified Cemex Espa\u00f1a of fines for an aggregate amount of $503 as of December 31, 2023, even though Cemex Espa\u00f1a did not utilize these losses, and since 2012, were not recognized in the financial statements of Cemex Espa\u00f1a. After several processes, reviews and appeals with a variety of authorities over the years, on November 13, 2023, the Supreme Court of Spain resolved a cassation appeal against Cemex Espa\u00f1a. As a result, once Cemex Espa\u00f1a is formally notified about the payment obligation, Cemex Espa\u00f1a will have to pay the described fines. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex Espa\u00f1a expects to pay the fines during 2024. Cemex Espa\u00f1a disagrees with the resolution and is evaluating the next steps, including the potential filing of an appeal with the Constitutional Court in Spain. For the year 2023, Cemex recognized an income tax expense and accrued a provision for $503, based on its estimate, and expects to settle the liability during the first half of 2024. Cemex has liquidity sources available to meet this obligation.\n- \u00b7  On March 26, 2021, the Spanish Tax Authorities notified Cemex Espa\u00f1a of an assessment for income taxes in an amount in Euros equivalent to $53 as of December 31, 2023, plus late interest, derived from a tax audit process covering the tax years 2010 to 2014. This assessment was appealed before the Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico Administrativo Central ('TEAC'). For the suspension of the payment of the tax assessment to be granted, Cemex Espa\u00f1a provided a payment guarantee which was approved by such tax authorities. Moreover, on December 3, 2021, the Spanish Tax Authorities notified Cemex Espa\u00f1a of a penalty for an amount in Euros equivalent to $75, derived from the tax audit process covering the same period from 2010 to 2014. This assessment was appealed before the TEAC. On December 11, 2023, Cemex Espa\u00f1a received a partial resolution from the TEAC and is evaluating whether or not to file an appeal before Audiencia Nacional. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex recognized an additional tax expense and accrued a liability of $117, based on its estimate.",

('Cemex Colombia') and imposed an inaccuracy penalty for amounts in Colombian Pesos equivalent to $32 of income tax and $32 of penalty. After several procedures and appeals, in July, 2021, Cemex Colombia filed an appeal in the Administrative Court of Cundinamarca. If the proceeding is adversely resolved in the final stage, Cemex Colombia must pay the amounts determined in the o/fficial settlement plus interest accrued on the amount of the income tax adjustment until the payment date. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex considers that an adverse resolution in this proceeding after the conclusion of all available defense procedures is not probable, however, it is di/fficult to assess with certainty the likelihood of an adverse result in the proceeding. If adversely resolved, Cemex believes this proceeding could have a material adverse impact on the operating results, liquidity or financial position of Cemex.\n- \u00b7  In connection with the tax return for the year 2011, the Colombian Tax Authority notified Cemex Colombia of a proceeding in which it rejected certain deductions and determined an increase in the income tax payable and imposed a penalty for amounts in Colombian Pesos equivalent to $22 of income tax and $22 of penalty. After several procedures and appeals, in 2020, the Colombian Tax Authority confirmed the claims of the o/fficial liquidation, and this was then appealed in the Administrative Court of Cundinamarca. If the proceeding is adversely resolved in its final stage, Cemex Colombia would have to pay the amounts determined in the o/fficial settlement plus interest accrued on the amount of the income tax adjustment until the date of payment. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex considers that an adverse resolution in this proceeding after the conclusion of all available defense procedures is not probable, however, it is di/fficult to assess with certainty the likelihood of an adverse result in the proceeding. If adversely resolved, Cemex believes this proceeding could have a material adverse impact on the operating results, liquidity or financial position of Cemex.\n\n## 21) Stockholders' Equity\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Dollars based on IAS 21, The E/ffects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates ('IAS 21'), while the reporting currency of the Parent Company is the Peso. As a result, for the consolidated entity, transactions of common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings are translated and accrued using historical exchange rates of the dates on which the transactions occurred. As a result, although the amounts of total non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements and total stockholders' equity of the Parent Company are the same, IAS 21 methodology results in di/fferences between line-by-line items within Cemex's controlling interest and the Parent Company's stockholders' equity. The o/fficial stockholders' equity for statutory purposes is that of the Parent Company as expressed in Pesos. As of December 31, 2023, the line-by-line reconciliation between Cemex's controlling interest, as reported using the Dollar as presentation currency, and the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, using a convenience translation of the balances in Pesos translated using the exchange rate of 16.97 Pesos per Dollar as of December 31, 2023, is as follows:\n\n|                                                | AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023   | AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                | CONSOLIDATED              | PARENT COMPANY            |\n| Common stock and additional paid-in capital  1 | $  7,699                  | 6,086                     |\n| Other equity reserves  1, 2                    | (363)                     | 1,576                     |\n| Retained earnings  2                           | 4,428                     | 4,102                     |\n| Total controlling interest                     | $  11,764                 | 11,764                    |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, stockholders' equity excludes investments in CPOs of the Parent Company held by subsidiaries of $16 (20,541,277 CPOs) and $8 (20,541,277 CPOs), respectively, which were eliminated within 'Other equity reserves.'\n\n## 21.1) Common Stock and Additional Paid-In Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the breakdown of consolidated common stock and additional paid-in capital was as follows:\n\n|                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Common stock               | 318    | 318    |\n| Additional paid-in capital | 7,381  | 7,492  |\n|                            | 7,699  | 7,810  |",

After issuance costs, the Parent Company received $992. The 2023 Subordinated Notes are aligned with the GFF and the net proceeds obtained in the issuance should be applied to finance, in whole or in part, one or more new or existing Eligible Green Projects ('EGPs') under its use-of-proceeds Green Financing Framework (the 'GFF'). EGPs include those related to pollution prevention and control, renewable energy, energy e/fficiency, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, and eco-e/fficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, the Parent Company issued $1,000 of its 5.125% subordinated notes (the '2021 Subordinated Notes'). After issuance costs, the Parent Company received $994. The net proceeds obtained were used to repurchase in full the balance then outstanding of perpetual debentures issued by subsidiaries (note 21.4) and the repayment of debt.\n\nUnder the 2023 Subordinated Notes and the 2021 Subordinated Notes (jointly the 'Subordinated Notes'), which do not have a maturity or repayment date or mandatory redemption date, interest may be deferred indefinitely at the sole discretion of the Parent Company. In addition, the Subordinated Notes: (i) are not redeemable at the option of the holders of the Subordinated Notes (the 'Noteholders'), (ii) do not have the benefit of standard debt covenants, and (iii) do not include an event of default relating to a payment or covenant default with respect to any indebtedness of Cemex. Moreover, the Parent Company is in control of all instances that may lead to the repayment of the Subordinated Notes, including Cemex's repurchase option on the fifth anniversary of each issuance, the specific redemption events as well as those under a reorganization or bankruptcy event under the applicable laws. In the hypothetical event of liquidation of the Parent Company, the Noteholders would have a claim on any residual net assets available after all liabilities have been settled; therefore, the Noteholders have no assurance of collecting the principal amounts of the Subordinated Notes or any deferred accrued interest, if any.",

The classification as equity of the Subordinated Notes can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  The Subordinated Notes do not meet the definition of financial liability under IAS 32 considering that they include no contractual obligation: (i) to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or (ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavorable to the issuer. This is because:\n- \u00b7 The Noteholders have agreed to the deferral of interest and principal, given that, the Parent Company has the unilateral and unconditional right to perpetually defer the payment of principal and interest;\n- \u00b7  The Parent Company controls at all times any payments to be made to the Noteholders, even in the event of bankruptcy under either the laws of Mexico ( Ley de Concursos Mercantiles ) or U.S. bankruptcy laws (Chapter 11); and\n- \u00b7 The Subordinated Notes contractually evidence a residual interest in the assets of the Parent Company after deducting all of its liabilities. The only requirement to settle the Notes would be in liquidation, which is akin to an equity instrument under IAS 32.\n\nCoupon payments on the Subordinated Notes were included within 'Other equity reserves' and amounted to $120 in 2023, $54 in 2022 and $30 in 2021.\n\n## 21.3) Retained Earnings\n\nThe Parent Company's net income for the year is subject to a 5% allocation toward a legal reserve until such reserve equals one-fifth of the common stock. As of December 31, 2023, the legal reserve amounted to $106.\n\n## 21.4) Non-Controlling Interest and Perpetual Debentures\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interest represents the share of non-controlling stockholders in the equity and results of consolidated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, non-controlling interest in equity amounted to $351 and $408, respectively. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, non-controlling interests in consolidated net income were $17, $27 and $25, respectively. These non-controlling interests arise mainly from the following Cemex's subsidiaries:\n\n- \u00b7  In February 2017, Cemex acquired a controlling interest in TCL, whose shares trade in the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there is a non-controlling interest in TCL of 30.17% of its common shares (see note 4.3 for certain relevant condensed financial information).\n- \u00b7  As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was a non-controlling interest in CHP of 10.14% and 22.10% of its ordinary shares, respectively. CHP's assets consist primarily of Cemex's cement manufacturing assets in the Philippines. In 2023, by means of a voluntary tender o/ffer, Cemex Asian South East Corporation ('CASEC'), an indirect subsidiary of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V., acquired 1,614 million shares of CHP.\n- \u00b7  Until June 2023, after the conclusion of a tender o/ffer and delisting process, Cemex Latam Holdings, S.A. ('CLH'), traded its ordinary shares on the Colombian Stock Exchange. CLH is the indirect holding company of Cemex's operations in Colombia, Panama, Guatemala and Nicaragua, and until August 31, 2022, of the operations in Costa Rica and El Salvador. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was a non-controlling interest in CLH of 0.50% and 4.70% of its ordinary shares, respectively, excluding shares held in CLH's treasury.\n\n## Perpetual debentures\n\nIn June 2021, considering the issuance of the 2021 Subordinated Notes described above, Cemex repurchased its then outstanding perpetual debentures of $449. Cemex's perpetual debentures had no fixed maturity date and there were no contractual obligations for Cemex to exchange any series of its outstanding perpetual debentures for financial assets or financial liabilities. As a result, these debentures, issued by consolidated entities, qualified as equity instruments under IAS 32 and were classified within non-controlling interest. Cemex had the unilateral right to defer indefinitely the payment of interest due on the debentures.\n\nUntil their repurchase, coupon payments on the perpetual debentures were included within 'Other equity reserves' and amounted to $11 in 2021.",

The cost of these equity instruments represents their estimated fair value at the grant date of each plan and is recognized in the statement of income during the periods in which the executives render services and vest the exercise rights.\n\nCemex, S.A.B. de C.V. sponsors di/fferent long-term restricted share-based compensation programs for a wide range of executives. For eligible executives, stockbased compensation represents a fixed percentage of such executive's annual compensation (the 'Stock Bonus'). This Stock Bonus was paid in the Parent Company's CPOs until December 31, 2023 and will be paid in the Parent Company's ADSs beginning January 1, 2024, considering certain management improvements that do not a/ffect employees, and which number is determined on the award date by reference to the Stock Bonus amount and the stock market price of such award date (i.e., once the number of shares is determined, such number is fixed and will not change as a result of changes in the stock market price).\n\nUnder our long-term share-based compensation programs, the Company sponsors a program oriented to our top management, which is subject to internal and external performance metrics and rendering of services over a three-year period (the 'Performance Plan'), and another program for key executives and key performers, which is subject only to the passage of time and rendering of services over a four-year period (the 'Ordinary Plan' together with the Performance Plan, the 'Share-Based Compensation Programs'). Shares awarded under the Ordinary Plan are initially restricted for sale and are proportionately released to the executives as services are rendered at the end of each year at a 25% rate over a four-year period, to the extent they remain in the Company at each settlement date. Once the executive is no longer employed by the Company, any shares awarded under the Ordinary Plan are forfeited. The Performance Plan, depending on their weighted achievement, may result in a final payout at the end of the third year between 0% and 200% of the target for each award. The fair value of the awards under the Performance Plan is determined using an option pricing model.\n\nFor the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the changes in connection with the Share-Based Compensation Programs were as follows:\n\n## ADSs EQUIVALENTS DELIVERED (THOUSANDS)\n\n| PLAN              | TARGET  NUMBER  OF ADSs  (THOUSANDS)   | ADS PRICE  AT AWARD'S  DATE  1   | FAIR VALUE  (%)   | FAIR VALUE  (MILLIONS)   | 2023     | 2022     | 2021    | ADSs  FORFEITED  (THOUSANDS)   | ADSs  OUTSTANDING  (THOUSANDS)  2   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Performance Plans |                                        |                                  |                   |                          |          |          |         |                                |                                     |\n| 2018              | 1,521.9                                | $  6.3                           | 149%              | 14.3                     | -

During 2023, 2022 and 2021, executives received 1,516,657, 19,177,703 and 16,511,882 CHP's shares, respectively, corresponding to shares without restriction for sale.\n\nThe combined compensation expense related to the Share-Based Compensation Programs described above as determined considering the fair value of the awards at the date of grant in 2023, 2022 and 2021, was recognized in the operating results of each subsidiary where the executives render services against other equity reserves and amounted to $61 in 2023, $52 in 2022 and $42 in 2021. The required Parent Company's CPOs delivered to the executives to meet the Company's awards are either newly issued or purchased, at the Company's election. For these purposes, an external trust in which the executives are beneficiaries may receive funding from Cemex to incur these purchases from time to time. Upon issuance of newly issued CPOs, the Parent Company recycles the fair value of the stock from other equity reserves to additional paid-in capital within equity. When the Parent Company funds the executives, it recognizes a decrease in other equity reserves against cash. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no options or commitments to make payments in cash to the executives based on changes in the market price of the Parent Company's ADSs, CLH's shares and/or CHP's shares.\n\n## 23) Earnings (Loss) per Share\n\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent Company (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Shares that would be issued depending only on the passage of time should be included in the determination of the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share should reflect in both the numerator and denominator the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, to the extent that such assumption would lead to a reduction in basic earnings per share or an increase in basic loss per share. Otherwise, the e/ffects of potential shares are not considered because they generate anti-dilution.\n\nThe amounts considered for calculations of earnings (loss) per share in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023       | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| DENOMINATOR (THOUSANDS OF SHARES)                                                   |            |            |            |\n| Weighted-average number of shares outstanding - basic                               | 43,510,758 | 43,554,921 | 44,123,654 |\n| E/ffect of dilutive instruments - share-based compensation (note 22)  1             | 599,229    | 793,322    | 729,292    |\n| Weighted-average number of shares - diluted                                         | 44,109,987 | 44,348,243 | 44,852,946 |\n| NUMERATOR                                                                           |            |            |            |\n| Net income from continuing operations                                               | $  199     | 561        | 817        |\n| Less: non-controlling interest net income                                           | 17         | 27         | 25         |\n| Controlling interest net income from continuing operations                          | $  182     | 534        | 792        |\n| Net income (loss) from discontinued operations                                      | $  -       | 324        | (39)       |\n| CONTROLLING INTEREST BASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE                                |            |            |            |\n| Controlling interest basic earnings per share                                       | $  0.0042  | 0.0197     | 0.0171     |\n| Controlling interest basic earnings per share from continuing operations            | 0.0042     | 0.0123     | 0.0180     |\n| Controlling interest basic earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations   | -          | 0.0074     | (0.0009)   |\n| CONTROLLING INTEREST DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE                              |            |            |            |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings per share                                     | $  0.0041  | 0.0193     | 0.0168     |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings per share from continuing operations          | 0.0041     | 0.0120     | 0.0177     |\n| Controlling interest diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations | -          | 0.0073     | (0.0009)   |",

A description of the most significant contracts is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  On February 8, 2022, Cemex renewed or entered into new agreements with six service providers in the fields of data processing services (back o/ffice) in finance, accounting and human resources; as well as Information Technology ('IT') infrastructure services, support and maintenance of IT applications in the countries in which Cemex operates, for a tenure of five to seven years at an average annual cost of $60. These contracts replaced the agreements Cemex maintained with IBM, which expired on August 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7  Beginning in April 2016, in connection with the Ventika S.A.P.I. de C.V. and the Ventika II S.A.P.I. de C.V. wind farms (jointly 'Ventikas') located in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon with a combined generation capacity of 252 Megawatts ('MW'), Cemex agreed to acquire a portion of the energy generated by Ventikas for its overall electricity needs in Mexico for a period of 20 years. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $26 if Cemex receives all its energy allocation. Nonetheless, energy supply from wind is variable in nature and final amounts are determined considering the final MW per hour ('MWh') e/ffectively received at the agreed prices per unit.\n- \u00b7  Beginning in February 2010, for its overall electricity needs in Mexico, Cemex agreed with EURUS to purchase a portion of the electric energy generated for no less than 20 years. EURUS is a wind farm with an installed capacity of 250 MW operated by ACCIONA in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $78 if Cemex receives all its energy allocation. Nonetheless, energy supply from wind sources is variable in nature and final amounts will be determined considering the final MWh e/ffectively received at the agreed prices per unit.\n- \u00b7  Cemex maintains a commitment initiated in April 2004 to purchase the energy generated by Termoel\u00e9ctrica del Golfo ('TEG') until 2027 for its overall electricity needs in Mexico. The estimated annual cost of this agreement is $183 if Cemex receives all its energy allocation. Nonetheless, final amounts will be determined considering the final MWh e/ffectively received at the agreed prices per unit.",

Cemex covers its commitments under this agreement acquiring the volume of fuel from sources in the international markets and Mexico.\n- \u00b7  On October 24, 2018, Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. entered into an energy financial hedge agreement in Mexico, commencing October 1, 2019 and for a period of 20 years. Through the contract, the Company fixed the megawatt hour cost over an electric energy volume of 400 thousand megawatts hour per year, through the payment of 25.375 Dollars per megawatt hour of electric power in exchange for a market price. The committed price to pay will increase by 1.5% annually. The di/fferential between the agreed price and the market price is settled monthly. Cemex considers this agreement as a hedge for a portion of its aggregate consumption of electric energy in Mexico and recognizes the result of the exchange of price di/fferentials described previously in the statements of income as a part of the costs of energy. During 2023, the Company received $3. Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. does not record this agreement at fair value since there is no deep market for electric power in Mexico that would e/ffectively allow for its valuation.\n\n## 24.3) Commitments from Employee Benefits\n\nIn some countries, Cemex has self-insured health care benefits plans for its active employees, which are managed on cost-plus fee arrangements with major insurance companies or provided through health maintenance organizations. As of December 31, 2023, in particular plans, Cemex has established stop-loss limits for continued medical assistance derived from a specific cause (e.g., an automobile accident, illness, etc.) ranging for a total limit of 550 thousand Dollars. In other plans, Cemex has established stop-loss limits per employee regardless of the number of events for a total cost of 2.5 million Dollars. The contingency for Cemex if all employees qualifying for health care benefits required medical services simultaneously is significant. However, Cemex believes this scenario is remote. The amount expensed through self-insured health care benefits was $72 in 2023, $64 in 2022 and $59 in 2021.\n\n## 24.4) Climate Change and Commitments for the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide ('CO 2 ') Emissions (unaudited)\n\nThe cement industry releases CO2 as part of the production process, mainly during the calcination of limestone, as well as CO2 released through the use of fossil fuels in the kilns. Currently, it is estimated that the whole cement industry releases between 5% to 8% of global CO2 emissions per year. In Cemex, from an estimated 57 million tons of gross CO2 emissions per year, 63% are directly related to the production process (Scope 1), 5% are indirect emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 2) and the remaining 32% arise from activities related to the rest of the supply chain which includes supply and transportation (Scope 3).\n\nCemex has an agenda of medium-term and long-term initiatives aiming at significantly reducing its CO2 emissions in order to align the Company's e/fforts with the Paris Agreement objectives of limiting global warming to 1.5 o C above pre-industrial levels. Cemex has defined its medium-term and long-term targets, which are mainly: 1) a greater than 47% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, compared to its 1990 baseline in Scope 1 emissions; 2) achieve a 58% reduction in Scope 2 emissions by 2030 compared to a 2020 baseline; 3) achieve reductions by 2030 compared to a 2020 baseline, of 25% in CO2 emissions per ton of purchased clinker and cement, 30% in transport emissions, 40% of Scope 3 emissions per ton of purchased fuels and 42% in absolute Scope 3 emissions from the use of traded fuels; and 4) reach net zero CO2 emissions across the Company by 2050. Cemex's 2030 targets for its cement business were verified by the Science-Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') to be in line with the 1.5 o C scenario. Also, Cemex's 2050 net-zero roadmap was validated by SBTi. SBTi, the foremost entity on sciencebased climate action goals, drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set science-based emissions reduction targets.\n\nTo meet Cemex's 2030 targets, the objectives have an impact that ranges from -10% to +10% in the total cash payout of the annual executive variable compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer, the top senior management, and 4,500 employees, eligible for executive variable compensation. Moreover, Cemex has detailed yearly CO2 roadmaps developed for each cement plant which include, among other factors: a) the increasing use of alternative fuels and electricity from clean sources as well as combustion enhancers such as hydrogen, b) the increasing use of decarbonated or lower carbon raw materials and cementitious materials to reduce the clinker factor, as well as c) a roll-out of other proven CO2 reduction technologies and the investments required for their implementation.\n\nFurthermore, to achieve the net-zero CO2 emissions target globally by 2050, Cemex is working through an open innovation platform in which it partners and collaborates with start-ups, universities, other industry players and entities from other industries along with the capabilities of Cemex's Global Research and Development, Cemex Ventures, and the internal 'Smart Innovation' process, Cemex is developing a robust research and development portfolio of projects aimed at identifying the most promising technologies to capture, store and utilize CO2. These new technologies should contribute beyond 2030 to fully decarbonize Cemex's operations. To build this portfolio, Cemex is tapping into and expects to continue to tap government funding in Europe and the United States, where there are well established programs to foster innovation in the green technologies of the future. Cemex continues to pursue its strategy in the di/fferent markets where it operates.",

For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company's other expenses, net, in the statement of income, include expenses and losses associated with severe weather conditions of $3, $1 and $5, respectively, mainly related with winter storms in the United States in 2023, Hurricane Ian in 2022 and storms in Texas in 2021. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex does not expect additional investments, expenses, or losses in connection with these events of nature.\n\n## 25) Legal Proceedings\n\n## 25.1) Provisions Resulting from Legal Proceedings\n\nCemex is involved in various significant legal proceedings, the adverse resolutions are deemed probable and imply the incurrence of losses and/or cash outflows or the delivery of other resources owned by Cemex. As a result, certain provisions and/or losses have been recognized in the financial statements, representing the best estimate of cash outflows. Cemex believes that it will not make significant expenditures over the amounts recorded. As of December 31, 2023, the details of the most significant events giving e/ffect to provisions or losses are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  As of December 31, 2023, Cemex accrued environmental remediation liabilities through its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom pertaining to closed and current landfill sites for the confinement of waste, representing the NPV of such obligations for an amount in Pounds sterling equivalent to $208. Expenditure was assessed and quantified over the period in which the sites have the potential to cause environmental harm, which is generally consistent with the views taken by the regulator as being up to 60 years from the date of closure. The assessed expenditure included the costs of monitoring the sites and the installation, repair and renewal of environmental infrastructure.\n- \u00b7  As of December 31, 2023, Cemex accrued environmental remediation liabilities through its subsidiaries in the United States for $45, related to: a) the disposal of various materials in accordance with past industry practice, which might currently be categorized as hazardous substances or wastes; and b) the cleanup of sites used or operated by Cemex, including discontinued operations, regarding the disposal of hazardous substances or waste, either individually or jointly with other parties. Most of the proceedings are in the preliminary stages and a final resolution might take several years. Cemex does not believe that it will be required to spend significant sums on these matters more than the amounts previously recorded. The ultimate cost that may be incurred to resolve these environmental issues cannot be assured until all environmental studies, investigations, remediation work and negotiations with, or litigation against, potential sources of recovery have been completed.\n- \u00b7  In 2012, in connection with a contract entered into in 1990 (the 'Quarry Contract') by Cemex Granulats Rh\u00f4ne M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e ('Cemex GRM'), one of Cemex's subsidiaries in France, with SCI La Quinoniere ('SCI') pursuant to which Cemex GRM had drilling rights to extract reserves and do quarry remediation at a quarry in the Rh\u00f4ne region of France, SCI filed a claim against Cemex GRM for breach of the Quarry Contract, requesting the rescission of such contract and damages plus interest for a revised amount in Euros equivalent to $61, arguing that Cemex GRM partially filled the quarry allegedly in breach of the terms of the Quarry Contract. After many hearings, resolutions and appeals over the years, on November 25, 2020, the expert appointed by the court of appeals determined a loss of profits of $0.70 and a cost of backfilling the quarry of $14 and stated that the damages su/ffered by SCI could only be set based on the loss of profits.\n- \u00b7  In 2020, Cemex had accrued a provision through its subsidiaries in France for $1 in connection with the best estimate of the remediation costs resulting from this claim. On November 23, 2022, the court handed down its decision to confirm the final report issued by the expert and determined that the damages of SCI were set at $0.70. SCI filed a notice of appeal before the Court of Cassation on February 20, 2023 and the Court of Cassation's decision is expected to be issued in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, although the final amount may di/ffer, Cemex considers that any such amount should not have a material adverse impact on Cemex's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## 25.2) Contingencies from Legal Proceedings\n\nCemex is involved in various legal proceedings, which have not required the recognition of accruals, considering that the probability of loss is less than probable. Nonetheless, until all stages in the procedures are exhausted in each proceeding, Cemex cannot assure the achievement of a final favorable resolution.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the most significant contingencies with a quantification of the potential loss, when it is determinable and would not impair the outcome of the relevant proceeding, were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  The European Commission has inspected Cemex's o/ffices in France and requested certain information relating to the business in France in the construction chemicals sector, which includes chemical admixtures and additives for use in concrete, cement and related construction products. Cemex is fully cooperating with the authorities conducting this investigation. The fact that this investigation is being conducted does not mean that the European Commission has concluded that Cemex has violated the law. As of December 31, 2023, due to the early stages of this investigation, Cemex is not able to assess the likely outcome of the investigation as it relates to us or whether it would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.",

Cemex is fully cooperating with the authorities conducting this investigation. The fact that this investigation is being conducted does not mean that the DOJ has concluded that Cemex has violated the law. As of December 31, 2023, due to the early stages of this investigation, we are not able to assess the likely outcome of the investigation as it relates to us or whether it would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n- \u00b7  In August 2020, an individual filed a class action lawsuit ( Acci\u00f3n de Grupo ) with a Circuit Civil Court in Colombia against Cemex Colombia and two other gray Portland cement market participants (the 'Colombian Class Action Defendants'). The lawsuit seeks compensation for damages arising from alleged cartel actions for which the Colombian Class Action Defendants were fined in December 2017. The complaint claims that the Colombian Class Action Defendants caused damages to all consumers of gray Portland cement in Colombia from 2010 to 2012. According to the plainti/ff's claims, the Colombian Class Action Defendants should be ordered to pay damages due to the higher price set on gray Portland cement in an amount in Colombian Pesos equivalent to $342 determined considering the sales of the three market participants in such period. After several procedures, the Circuit Civil Court ruled in favor of Cemex Colombia, dismissing the proceeding. The plainti/ff appealed this decision on May 16, 2022, and, on July 11, 2022, the Circuit Civil Court ratified its decision to dismiss the case. The Superior Court of Bogota confirmed the dismissal on August 24, 2022. The plainti/ff failed to challenge the dismissal, and therefore, the procedure has concluded.\n- \u00b7  On October 1, 2019, SEMARNAT published the basis for a trial emissions trading program. The pilot phase of the trial program concluded on December 31, 2021, and was followed by a 12-month period ending on December 31, 2022 to transition to the operative stage. The Mexican Emissions Trading System ('Mexican ETS') is expected to enter its Phase I starting January 1, 2024 and conclude on December 31, 2026, followed by its Phase II, is expected to last from January 1, 2027 to December 31, 2030. The operating rules for Phase I of the Mexican ETS are under review by the SEMARNAT and are expected to be issued in June 2024. For Phase I, the SEMARNAT will publish growth projections factors and corresponding free allocations of allowances for the cement, steel, energy, and chemical sectors which, as of December 31, 2023, are still being drafted. As of December 31, 2023, we are unable to determine if Phase I of the Mexican ETS will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n- \u00b7  As of December 31, 2023, levies in e/ffect in several Mexican states on the extraction of raw materials range from an amount to $0.67 Dollars to $9.17 Dollars per m3 and levies on GHG emissions range from $2.5 Dollars to $34.2 Dollars per ton. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex has filed constitutional challenges against these levies. If Cemex is unable to obtain favorable resolutions relating to these constitutional challenges, Cemex expects that the aggregate impact of these levies would have a material adverse impact on Cemex's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\n- \u00b7  On September 20, 2018, triggered by heavy rainfall, a landslide causing damages and fatalities (the 'Landslide') occurred in a site located within an area covered by mining rights of APO Land & Quarry Corporation ('ALQC') in Naga City, Cebu, Philippines. ALQC is a principal raw material supplier of APO Cement Corporation ('APO'), a wholly owned subsidiary of CHP. Cemex indirectly owns a minority 40% stake in ALQC. On November 19, 2018, 40 individuals and one legal entity (on behalf of 8,000 individuals allegedly a/ffected by the Landslide) filed an environmental class action lawsuit at the Regional Trial Court (the 'Court') of Talisay, Cebu, against CHP, ALQC, APO, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the City Government of Naga, and the Province of Cebu. Plainti/ffs claim that the Landslide occurred because of the defendants' gross negligence and seek, among other relief, (a) damages for an amount in Philippine Pesos equivalent to $78, (b) a rehabilitation fund for an amount in Philippine Pesos equivalent to $9, and (c) the issuance of a Temporary Environment Protection Order against ALQC aiming to prevent ALQC from performing further quarrying activities while the case is still pending. This last request was rejected by the Court on August 16, 2019, and after reconsideration, the resolution became final on December 5, 2020. Moreover, on September 30, 2019, the Court dismissed the case against CHP and APO and this resolution became final on May 4, 2023 when the Court issued a certificate of finality confirming the dismissal. This certificate of finality deems the Court's order partially granting CHP's, APO's and ALQC's a/ffirmative defenses as final and executory, and dismisses the case against APO, CHP, and all public defendants, and the damage claims against ALQC. As of December 31, 2023, only ALQC remains as a private defendant in the case regarding the environmental aspect of ALQC's supposed violation of the Philippine Mining Act which purportedly caused damage to the environment and allegedly made ALQC liable for clean-up and rehabilitation.",

These subpoenas do not mean that the SEC has concluded that the Parent Company or any of its a/ffiliates violated the law. On March 12, 2018, the DOJ issued a grand jury subpoena to the Parent Company relating to its operations in Colombia and other jurisdictions. In 2020, the Company delivered all of the information and documentation that had been requested and has not received any more requests since then. The Parent Company intends to continue to cooperate fully with the SEC, the DOJ and any other investigate entity. As of December 31, 2023, the Parent Company is unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of either the SEC investigation or the DOJ investigation, or any other investigation that may arise, or, because of the current status of the SEC investigation and the preliminary nature of the DOJ investigation, the potential sanctions which could be borne by the Parent Company, or if such sanctions, if any, would have a material adverse impact on Cemex results of operations, liquidity or financial position.\n- \u00b7  In September 2012, in connection with a lawsuit submitted to a first instance court in Assiut, Egypt in 2011, the first instance court of Assiut issued a resolution to nullify the Share Purchase Agreement (the 'SPA') pursuant to which Cemex acquired in 1999 a controlling interest in Assiut Cement Company ('ACC'). In addition, during 2011 and 2012, lawsuits seeking, among other things, the annulment of the SPA were filed by di/fferent plainti/ffs, including 25 former employees of ACC, before Cairo's State Council. After several appeals, hearings and resolutions over the years, the cases were pending in Cairo's 7 th Circuit State Council Administrative Judiciary Court. On January 14, 2023, the High Constitutional Court determined that the Law 32/2014, pursuant to which the validity of the SPA is recognized, and which protects Cemex's investments in Egypt, is constitutional. Following this resolution, the 7 th Circuit of Cairo' State Council Administrative Judiciary Court dismissed the claims due to the lack of legal standing of the plainti/ffs in the application of Law 32/2014 on February 25, 2023. As the plainti/ffs failed to challenge this dismissal within the legally prescribed term of 60 days, the resolution is final and definitive, and these proceedings are considered closed.\n\nIn addition to the legal proceedings described above in notes 25.1 and 25.2, as of December 31, 2023, Cemex is involved in various legal proceedings of lesser impact that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings involve: 1) product warranty claims; 2) claims for environmental damages; 3) indemnification claims relating to acquisitions or divestitures; 4) claims to revoke permits and/or concessions; and 5) other diverse civil, administrative, commercial and lawless actions. Cemex considers that in those instances in which obligations have been incurred, Cemex has accrued adequate provisions to cover the related risks. Cemex believes these matters will be resolved without any significant e/ffect on its business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, in relation to certain ongoing legal proceedings, Cemex is sometimes able to make and disclose reasonable estimates of the expected loss or range of possible loss, as well as disclose any provision accrued for such loss, but for a limited number of ongoing legal proceedings, Cemex may not be able to make a reasonable estimate of the expected loss or range of possible loss or may be able to do so but believes that disclosure of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice Cemex's position in the ongoing legal proceedings or any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in these cases, Cemex has disclosed qualitative information with respect to the nature and characteristics of the contingency but has not disclosed the estimate of the range of potential loss.\n\n## 25.3) Other Significant Processes\n\nIn connection with the integrated cement plant located in the municipality of Maceo, Colombia (the 'Maceo Plant'), as described in note 15.1, as of December 31, 2023, the Maceo Plant has not initiated commercial operations considering several significant administrative processes and legal proceedings. The evolution and status of the main issues related to the Maceo Plant are described as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  As of December 31, 2023, the land over which the Maceo Plant was constructed, the mining concession, the environmental license and the shares of Zona Franca Especial Cementera del Magdalena Medio S.A.S. ('Zomam') (holder of the free trade zone concession), acquired in 2012 from CI Calizas y Minerales S.A. ('CI Calizas'), are held under a domain extinction proceeding that was linked to a former shareholder of CI Calizas by Colombia's Attorney General (the 'Attorney General') in which, among other measures, suspended CI Calizas' ability to transfer certain assets (land, mining concession, environmental license, shares of Zomam with the corresponding free trade zone benefits and other related assets required to build a cement plant) to Cemex Colombia that Cemex Colombia had acquired from CI Calizas in 2012 as mentioned above.\n- \u00b7  As of the financial statements date, although Cemex Colombia acted in good faith and free of guilt in the acquisition process in 2012, pursuant to the domain extinction proceeding initiated in December 2012, which has not finalized and which may still take several more years, Cemex Colombia does not have the legal representation of Zomam, is not the rightful owner of the land over which the Maceo Plant was constructed and is not the assigned beneficiary of the corresponding mining concession.\n- \u00b7  In December 2020, Cemex Colombia presented to the Business Superintendency of Colombia ( Superintendencia de Sociedades de Colombia or the 'Business Superintendency'), a recourse seeking the invalidity and, alternatively, the nullity or the inexistence of the equity contribution in-kind carried out by Cemex Colombia to Zomam in December 2015 by means of which a portion of the Maceo Plant's assets were contributed to this entity. On December 6, 2022, the Business Superintendency issued an adverse resolution to Cemex Colombia in relation to this recourse; and, as of December 31, 2023, this resolution is under review by the Colombian Supreme Court.",

(the 'SAE') and CI Calizas before the Attorney General's O/ffice and signed jointly with CI Calizas and Zomam, with the authorization of the SAE as delegate of these last two companies on behalf of the State, a contract of Mining Operation, Manufacturing and Delivery Services and Leasing of Properties for Cement Production (the 'Operation Contract'), which allows Cemex Colombia to continue using the assets for an initial term of 21 years that can be extended for ten additional years under certain conditions. The Operation Contract includes the following payments:\n- \u00b7  Once the Maceo Plant begins commercial operations, Cemex Colombia and/or a subsidiary will pay on a quarterly basis: a) 0.9% of the net sales resulting from the cement produced in the plant as compensation to CI Calizas for the right of Cemex Colombia to extract and use the mineral reserves; and b) 0.8% of the net sales resulting from the cement produced in the plant as payment to Zomam for cement manufacturing and delivery services, as long as Zomam maintains the free trade zone benefit, or, 0.3% in case that Zomam losses such benefit.\n- \u00b7  The Operation Contract will continue in force regardless of the result in the domain extinction proceeding, except if the applicable criminal judge recognizes ownership rights of the assets under the domain extinction proceeding to Cemex Colombia and one of its a/ffiliates, in which case the Operation Contract would no longer be needed and would be terminated, considering that Cemex Colombia and its a/ffiliate would be the owners of the corresponding assets.\n- \u00b7  As of December 31, 2023, Cemex believes that it would be able to keep ownership of the Maceo Plant. Nevertheless, if the domain extinction proceeding over the assets is ordered in favor of the Colombian State, and if the assets were adjudicated to a third party in a public tender o/ffer, by virtue of the Operation Contract, such third party would have to subrogate to such contract. As of December 31, 2023, Cemex is not able to estimate whether the domain extinction proceeding over the assets will be ordered in favor of the Colombian State, or, if applicable, if the assets would be adjudicated to a third party in a public tender o/ffer.\n- \u00b7  To begin operations under the Operation Contract, the following mandatory conditions must be completed: (a) extend the environmental license to permit the extraction of the required minerals to produce at least 950 thousand tons of cement; (b) permit for the extraction of limestone and other minerals under the mining concession to achieve the minimum production of 950 thousand tons of cement under the environmental license, once the environmental license would be extended; (c) the partial and definitive subtraction of a portion of the plant from the Integrated Management District of the Canyon of the Alicante River ('IMD') required to extract minerals to produce at least 950 thousand tons of cement; (d) obtaining all environmental permits and authorizations, including the release of any lockdown; (e) any permits required to conclude the access road and the plant's employees housing; and (f) any applicable urban permits and authorizations. These conditions have been evolving, presenting the following progress:\n- \u00b7 In September 2019, Corantioquia's Directive Council, the regional environmental authority ('Corantioquia'), approved the subtraction of a portion of the plant from the IMD. In addition, in February 2021, Corantioquia notified CI Calizas of the modification of the environmental license allowing the extraction of up to 990 thousand tons of minerals (clay and limestone) to produce up to 1.5 million metric tons of cement annually and in April 2023, the Secretary of Mines of the Antioquia's Government granted the permit for the extraction of limestone and other minerals above the 950 thousand tons of cement. As of the date of the financial statements, the Company is working with the authorities to expand the environmental extraction license mentioned above that would allow the production of up to 1.5 million tons from Maceo Plant's quarry without the need to bring minerals from other locations.\n- \u00b7  Regarding the permits to conclude the construction of several sections of the access road, in December 2020, Maceo's municipality issued a decree establishing the public utility of the access road, required for both, to obtain the permits to acquire the required land and build the remainder of the road. In respect to the modification of the permitted land use where the project is located, Cemex Colombia received favorable criteria from Corantioquia regarding the change of land use because of the approval for the subtraction from the IMD, which was endorsed by the municipality of Maceo in August 2020, which allows for an industrial and mining use compatible with the project.\n- \u00b7  In addition, in June 2022, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism granted Zomam the extension of the free trade zone area, which now covers the full area of the Maceo Plant.\n- \u00b7  In spite of the developments above, which represent significant progress for the commissioning of the Maceo Plant, the beginning of commercial operations remains subject mainly to the conclusion of the access road and the authorization required from the owners of land plots adjacent to the Maceo Plant, as well as the extension of the environmental extraction permit that would allow the production of up to 1.5 million tons from Maceo Plant's quarry. As of the date of these financial statements the estimated conclusion of the mandatory conditions cannot be established. Cemex Colombia continues working to resolve these matters as soon as possible.",

These balances with related parties resulted primarily from: (i) the sale and purchase of goods between group entities; (ii) the sale and/or acquisition of subsidiaries' shares within Cemex; (iii) the invoicing of administrative services, rentals, trademarks and commercial name rights, royalties and other services rendered between group entities; and (iv) loans between related parties. When market prices and/or market conditions are not readily available, Cemex conducts transfer pricing studies in the countries in which it operates to comply with regulations applicable to transactions between related parties.\n\nThe definition of related parties includes entities or individuals outside Cemex, who, may take advantage of being in a privileged situation due to their relationship with Cemex. Likewise, this applies to cases where Cemex may take advantage of such relationships and benefit from its financial position or operating results.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, in the ordinary course of business, Cemex has entered into transactions with related parties for the sale and/or purchase of products, the sale and/or purchase of services or the lease of assets, all of which are not significant for Cemex and, except for the transactions mentioned below, to the best of Cemex's knowledge are not significant to the related party, are incurred for non-significant amounts for Cemex and are executed under conditions following the same authorizations applied to other third parties. These identified transactions, which involved members of the Parent Company's Board of Directors and senior management, as applicable, are reviewed by the Parent Company's Board of Directors Corporate Practices and Finance Committee and approved or ratified at least annually by the Parent Company's Board of Directors, as per Cemex's applicable policies on conflicts of interest and related person transactions. These transactions with related parties also include transactions with subsidiaries with significant non-controlling interests, such as TCL, Caribbean Cement Company Limited and CHP; with other companies in which Cemex has a non-controlling position, such as Neoris, GCC and Lehigh White Cement Company; with companies in which the Parent Company's Board of Director members are members of such company's board of directors, like FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V., Carza, S.A.P.I. de C.V., Nemak, S.A.B. de C.V., NEG Natural, S.A. de C.V.; and with companies at which members of Cemex's senior management have family members such as Cementos Espa\u00f1oles de Bombeo, S. de R.L. ('CEB'), all of which are also reviewed by the Parent Company's Board of Directors Corporate Practices and Finance Committee and approved or ratified at least annually by the Parent Company's Board of Directors.\n\nFor Cemex, except as set forth below, none of these transactions executed in 2023 are material to be disclosed separately. In addition, during the same periods, no member of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.'s senior management or Board of Directors had any outstanding loans with Cemex.\n\nThe most important transactions with related parties during 2023 included in Cemex's financial statements were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Cemex has a Master Services Agreement pursuant to which Cemex receives information technology services and solutions globally from Neoris. For the year 2023, Cemex incurred in consulting services from Neoris for $94. Cemex holds a 35% equity interest in Neoris and some of Cemex's employees are members of the board of directors of Neoris.\n- \u00b7  For the year 2023, Cemex incurred services from CEB, a provider of ready-mix pumping services to Cemex's customers in Mexico for $55.\n\nFor the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate compensation paid to members of Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V.' Board of Directors, including alternate directors, and Cemex's senior management was $71, $44 and $50, respectively. Of these amounts, $24 in 2023, $29 in 2022, $26 in 2021, were paid as base compensation plus performance bonuses, including pension and post-employment benefits. In addition, $47 in 2023, $15 in 2022 and $24 in 2021 of the aggregate amounts in each year, corresponded to allocations of ADSs under Cemex's executive share-based compensation programs.",

Balances and operations between related parties are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint controlled entities are accounted for by the equity method. The equity method reflects the investee's original cost and Cemex's share of the investee's equity and earnings after acquisition.\n\n## 28.2) Use of Estimates and Critical Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. These assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis using available information. Actual results could di/ffer from these estimates. The main items subject to significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairment tests of long-lived assets, recognition of deferred income tax assets, the recognition of uncertain tax positions, the measurement of asset retirement obligations, as well as provisions regarding legal proceedings and environmental liabilities, among others. Significant judgment is required by management to appropriately assess the amounts of these concepts.\n\n## 28.3) Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency of each consolidated entity at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of their execution. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of each consolidated entity at the exchange rates prevailing at the statement of financial position date, and the resulting foreign exchange fluctuations are recognized in earnings, except for exchange fluctuations arising from: 1) foreign currency indebtedness associated with the acquisition of foreign entities; and 2) fluctuations associated with related parties' balances denominated in foreign currency, whose settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and as a result, such balances are of a permanent investment nature. These fluctuations are recorded against 'Other equity reserves,' as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment (note 21.2) until the disposal of the foreign net investment, at which time, the accumulated amount in equity is recycled through the statement of income as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated entities, as determined using their respective functional currency, are translated to Dollars at the closing exchange rate for the statement of financial position and at the closing exchange rates of each month within the period for the statements of income. The functional currency is that in which each consolidated entity primarily generates and expends cash. The corresponding translation e/ffect is included within 'Other equity reserves' and is presented in the statement of other comprehensive income for the period as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment (note 21.2) until the disposal of the net investment in the consolidated entity.\n\nConsidering its integrated activities, for purposes of functional currency, the Parent Company deemed to have two divisions, one related with its financial and holding company activities, in which the functional currency is the Dollar for all assets, liabilities and transactions associated with these activities, and another division related with the Parent Company's operating activities in Mexico, in which the functional currency is the Peso for all assets, liabilities and transactions associated with these activities.\n\nThe most significant closing exchange rates for the statement of financial position and the approximate average exchange rates (as determined using the closing exchange rates of each month within the period) for the statements of income with respect Cemex's main functional currencies to the Dollar as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:\n\n|                        | 2023    | 2023    | 2022    | 2022    | 2021    | 2021    |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| CURRENCY               | CLOSING | AVERAGE | CLOSING | AVERAGE | CLOSING | AVERAGE |\n| Peso                   | 16.9700 | 17.6300 | 19.5000 | 20.0274 | 20.5000 | 20.4266 |\n| Euro                   | 0.9059  | 0.9227  | 0.9344  | 0.9522  | 0.8789  | 0.8467  |\n| British Pound Sterling | 0.7852  | 0.8019  | 0.8266  | 0.8139  | 0.7395  | 0.7262  |\n| Colombian Peso         | 3,822   | 4,272   | 4,810   | 4,277   | 3,981   | 3,783   |",

Amortized cost represents the NPV of the consideration receivable or payable as of the transaction date. This classification of financial assets comprises the following captions:\n\n- \u00b7  Cash and cash equivalents (note 9).\n- \u00b7  Trade accounts receivable, other current accounts receivable and other current assets (notes 10 and 11). Due to their short-term nature, Cemex initially recognizes these assets at the original invoiced or transaction amount less expected credit losses, as explained below.\n- \u00b7  Trade accounts receivable sold under securitization programs, in which certain residual interest in the trade accounts receivable sold in case of recovery failure and continued involvement in such assets is maintained, do not qualify for derecognition and are maintained in the statement of financial position (notes 10 and 17.2).\n- \u00b7  Investments and non-current accounts receivable (note 14.2). Subsequent changes in e/ffects from amortized cost are recognized in the statement of income as part of 'Financial income and other items, net.'\n\nCertain strategic investments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income within 'Other equity reserves' (note 14.2). Cemex does not maintain financial assets 'Held to collect and sell' whose business model has the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and then selling those financial assets.\n\nThe financial assets that are not classified as 'Held to collect' or that do not have strategic characteristics fall into the residual category of held at fair value through the statement of income as part of 'Financial income and other items, net' (note 14.2).\n\nDebt instruments and other financial obligations are classified as 'Loans' and measured at amortized cost (notes 17.1 and 17.2). Interest accrued on financial instruments is recognized within 'Other accounts payable and accrued expenses' against financial expense. During the reported periods, Cemex did not have financial liabilities voluntarily recognized at fair value or associated with fair value hedge strategies with derivative financial instruments.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at their estimated fair values, and the changes in such fair values are recognized in the statement of income within 'Financial income and other items, net' for the period in which they occur, except in the case of hedging instruments as described below.\n\n## Hedging instruments (note 17.4)\n\nA hedging relationship is established to the extent the entity considers, based on the analysis of the overall characteristics of the hedging and hedged items, that the hedge will be highly e/ffective in the future and the hedge relationship at inception is aligned with the entity's reported risk management strategy (note 17.5). The accounting categories of hedging instruments are: a) cash flow hedge; b) fair value hedge of an asset or forecasted transaction; and c) hedge of a net investment in a subsidiary.\n\nIn cash flow hedges, the e/ffective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in stockholders' equity within other equity reserves and are reclassified to earnings as the interest expense of the related debt is accrued, in the case of interest rate swaps, or when the underlying products are consumed in the case of contracts on the price of raw materials and commodities. In hedges of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in fair value are recognized in stockholders' equity as part of the foreign currency translation result within 'Other equity reserves' (note 28.3), whose reversal to earnings would take place upon disposal of the foreign investment. Derivative instruments are negotiated with institutions with significant financial capacity; therefore, Cemex believes the risk of non-performance of the obligations agreed to by such counterparties to be minimal.",

APPENDIX\n\nOur Performance in Detail\n\nSelected Consolidated Financial Information\n\n- Financial Information\n\nNon-Financial Information\n\nScope and Boundaries of This Report\n\nCemex's Materiality Assessment\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nGovernance and Policies\n\nEU Taxonomy\n\nGRI Content Index\n\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board Response (SASB)\n\n- Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure Response (TCFD)\n\nTerms We Use\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Investor, Media, and\n\nSustainability Info\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nImpairment losses of financial assets, including trade accounts receivable, are recognized using the Expected Credit Loss model ('ECL') for the entire lifetime of such financial assets on initial recognition, and at each subsequent reporting period, even in the absence of a credit event or if a loss has not yet been incurred, considering for their measurement past events and current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts a/ffecting collectability. For purposes of the ECL model of trade accounts receivable, on a country-by-country basis, Cemex segments its accounts receivable by type of client, homogeneous credit risk and days past due and determines for each segment an average rate of ECL, considering actual credit loss experience generally over the last 12 months and analyses of future delinquency, that is applied to the balance of the accounts receivable. The average ECL rate increases in each segment of days past due until the rate is 100% for the segment of 365 days or more past due.\n\n## Costs incurred in the issuance of debt or borrowings\n\nDirect costs incurred in debt issuances or borrowings, as well as debt refinancing or non-substantial modifications to debt agreements that did not represent an extinguishment of debt by considering that the holders and the relevant economic terms of the new instrument are not substantially di/fferent to the replaced instrument, adjust the carrying amount of the related debt and are amortized as interest expense as part of the e/ffective interest rate of each instrument over its maturity. These costs include commissions and professional fees. Costs incurred in the extinguishment of debt, as well as debt refinancing or modifications to debt agreements, when the new instrument is substantially di/fferent from the old instrument according to a qualitative and quantitative analysis, are recognized in the statement of income as incurred.\n\n## Leases (notes 15 and 17.2)\n\nAt the inception of a contract, Cemex assesses whether a contract is or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains a lease, if at the inception of the contract, it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for consideration. Pursuant to IFRS 16, leases are recognized as financial liabilities against assets for the right-of-use, measured at their commencement date as the NPV of the future contractual fixed payments, using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, Cemex's incremental borrowing rate. Cemex determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from its external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the term of the lease, the type of the asset leased and the economic environment in which the asset is leased.\n\nCemex does not separate the non-lease component from the lease component included in the same contract. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise contractual rental fixed payments, less incentives, fixed payments of non-lease components and the value of a purchase option, to the extent that option is highly probable to be exercised or is considered a bargain purchase option. Interest incurred under the financial obligations related to lease contracts is recognized as part of the 'Interest expense' line item in the statement of income.\n\nAt the commencement date or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, Cemex allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on their relative stand-alone prices. Cemex applies the recognition exception for lease terms of 12 months or less and contracts of low-value assets and recognizes the lease payment of these leases as rental expense in the statement of income over the lease term. Cemex defined the lease contracts for o/ffice and computer equipment as low-value assets.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the e/ffective interest method as payments are incurred and is remeasured when: a) there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, b) if there is a change in the amount expected to be payable under a residual guarantee, c) if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option, or d) if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the asset for the right-of-use or is recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net' if such asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n## Embedded derivative financial instruments\n\nCemex reviews its contracts to identify the existence of embedded derivatives. Identified embedded derivatives are analyzed to determine if they need to be separated from the host contract and recognized in the statement of financial position as assets or liabilities, applying the same valuation rules used for other derivative instruments.",

Depreciation of fixed assets is recognized as part of cost and operating expenses (notes 5 and 6) and is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, except for mineral reserves, which are depleted using the units-of-production method. Periodic maintenance of fixed assets is expensed as incurred. Advances to suppliers of fixed assets are presented as part of other long-term accounts receivable.\n\nAssets for the right-of-use related to leases are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted by any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle, remove or restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentives received. Assets for the right-of-use are generally depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. Assets for the right-of-use may be reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nCemex capitalizes, as part of the related cost of fixed assets, interest expense from existing debt during the construction or installation period of qualifying fixed assets, considering Cemex's corporate average interest rate and the average balance of investments in process for the period.\n\n## 28.6) Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (notes 4.1 and 16)\n\nThe consideration transferred in business combinations is allocated to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any unallocated portion of the consideration transferred represents goodwill, which is not amortized and is subject to periodic impairment tests (note 28.7). Costs associated with the acquisition are expensed in the statement of income as incurred.\n\nIntangible assets are recognized at their acquisition or development cost, as applicable, when probable future economic benefits are identified and there is evidence of control over such benefits. Definite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or using the units-of-production method, as applicable, as part of operating costs and expenses (notes 5 and 6). Direct costs incurred in the development stage of computer software for internal use are capitalized and amortized through the operating results over the useful life of the software, which, on average is five years.\n\nCemex's extraction rights have a weighted average useful life of 83 years, depending on the sector and the expected life of the related reserves. Except for extraction rights which are amortized using the units-of-production method and/or as otherwise indicated, Cemex's intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives that range on average from 3 to 20 years.\n\n## 28.7) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (notes 15 and 16)\n\n## Property, machinery and equipment, assets for the right-of-use, intangible assets of definite life and other investments\n\nThese assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of internal or external impairment indicators. Impairment losses, corresponding to the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its recoverable amount, are recorded within 'Other expenses, net.' Recoverable amounts, which include the NPV of future projected cash flows arising from the asset over its useful life (value in use), are determined considering market economic assumptions.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment when required upon the occurrence of internal or external indicators of impairment or at least once a year, during the last quarter of such year, at the level of the group of cash-generating units ('CGUs') to which goodwill balances were allocated by determining the recoverable amount of such group of CGUs, corresponding to the NPV of estimated future cash flows to be generated by such CGUs over periods of 5 years plus terminal value (value in use). An impairment loss is recognized within 'Other expenses, net' when the recoverable amount is lower than the net book value of the group of CGUs. Impairment charges recognized on goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nThe reportable segments reported by Cemex (note 4.3), represent Cemex's groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment and represent the lowest level within Cemex at which goodwill is monitored internally by management.",

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, some significant proceedings that gave rise to a portion of the carrying amount of Cemex's other current and non-current liabilities and provisions are detailed in note 25.1.\n\nObligations or losses related to contingencies are qualitatively disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The e/ffects of long-term commitments established with third parties, such as supply contracts with suppliers or customers, are recognized in the financial statements on an incurred or accrued basis, after taking into consideration the substance of the agreements. Relevant commitments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## 28.9) Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits (note 19)\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nThe costs of defined contribution pension plans are recognized in the operating results as they are incurred. Liabilities arising from such plans are settled through cash transfers to the employees' retirement accounts, without generating future obligations.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits\n\nThe costs associated with defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits, generally comprised of health care benefits, life insurance and seniority premiums, are recognized services are rendered by the employees based on actuarial estimations of the benefits' present value considering the advice of external actuaries. For certain pension plans, Cemex has created irrevocable trust funds to cover future benefit payments ('plan assets'). These plan assets are valued at their estimated fair value at the statement of financial position date. All actuarial gains and losses for the period, related to di/fferences between the projected and real actuarial assumptions at the end of the period, as well as the di/fference between the expected and actual return on plan assets, are recognized as part of 'Other items of comprehensive income, net' within stockholders' equity.\n\nThe service cost, corresponding to the increase in the obligation for additional benefits earned by employees during the period, is recognized within operating costs and expenses. The net interest cost, resulting from the increase in obligations for changes in NPV and the change during the period in the estimated fair value of plan assets, is recognized within 'Financial income and other items, net.'\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits, not associated with a restructuring event, which mainly represent severance payments by law, are recognized in the operating results for the period in which they are incurred. In the event of restructuring it is recognized within 'Other expenses, net.'\n\n## 28.10) Income Taxes (note 20)\n\nThe income taxes reflected in the statement of income include the amounts incurred during the period and the amounts of deferred income taxes, determined according to the income tax law applicable to each subsidiary, reflecting any uncertainty in income tax treatments and include the e/ffects measured in each subsidiary by applying the enacted statutory income tax rate at the end of the reporting period. According to IFRS, all items charged or credited directly in stockholders' equity or as part of other comprehensive income or loss for the period are recognized net of their current and deferred income tax e/ffects. The e/ffect of a change in enacted statutory tax rates is recognized in the period in which the change is o/fficially enacted.\n\n## Deferred income taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are derecognized when it is not deemed probable that the related tax benefit will be realized, considering the aggregate amount of self-determined tax loss carryforwards that Cemex believes will not be rejected by the tax authorities based on available evidence and the likelihood of recovering them prior to their expiration through an analysis of estimated future taxable income. To determine whether it is probable that deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered, Cemex takes into consideration all available positive and negative evidence, including factors such as market conditions, industry analysis, expansion plans, projected taxable income, carryforward periods, current tax structure, potential changes or adjustments in tax structure, tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary di/fferences. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities relating to di/fferent tax jurisdictions are not o/ffset.",

APPENDIX\n\n- Our Performance in Detail Selected Consolidated Financial Information\n- Financial Information\n\nNon-Financial Information\n\nScope and Boundaries of This\n\nReport\n\nCemex's Materiality Assessment\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nGovernance and Policies\n\nEU Taxonomy\n\nGRI Content Index\n\nSustainability Accounting\n\nStandards Board Response (SASB)\n\nTask Force on Climate-related\n\nFinancial Disclosure Response\n\n(TCFD)\n\nTerms We Use\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nInvestor, Media, and\n\nSustainability Info\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe income tax e/ffects of uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and assuming that the tax authorities will examine each position with full knowledge of all relevant information. For each position, Cemex considers its probability, regardless of its relation to any broader tax settlement. The probability threshold represents a positive assertion by management that Cemex is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position. If a tax position is considered not probable to be sustained, no benefits of the position are recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as part of the income tax in the statements of income based on the Company's analysis of the nature of such interest and penalties, considering recent IFRS Interpretations Committee guidance.\n\n## E/ffective income tax rate\n\nThe e/ffective income tax rate is determined by dividing the line item 'Income tax' by the line item 'Earnings before income tax.' This e/ffective tax rate is further reconciled to Cemex's statutory tax rate applicable in Mexico (note 20.3). A significant e/ffect on Cemex's e/ffective tax rate and consequently on the reconciliation of Cemex's e/ffective tax rate, relates to the di/fference between the statutory income tax rate in Mexico of 30% and the applicable income tax rates of each country where Cemex operates.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the statutory tax rates in Cemex's main operations were as follows:\n\n| COUNTRY        | 2023         | 2022         | 2021         |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Mexico         | 30.0%        | 30.0%        | 30.0%        |\n| United States  | 21.0%        | 21.0%        | 21.0%        |\n| United Kingdom | 23.5%        | 19.0%        | 19.0%        |\n| France         | 25.8%        | 25.8%        | 28.4%        |\n| Germany        | 28.2%        | 28.2%        | 28.2%        |\n| Spain          | 25.0%        | 25.0%        | 25.0%        |\n| Philippines    | 25.0%        | 25.0%        | 25.0%        |\n| Israel         | 23.0%        | 23.0%        | 23.0%        |\n| Colombia       | 35.0%        | 35.0%        | 31.0%        |\n| Others         | 5.5% - 30.0% | 5.5% - 30.0% | 5.5% - 30.0% |\n\nCemex's current and deferred income tax amounts included in the statement of income for the period are highly variable, and are subject, among other factors, to taxable income determined in each jurisdiction in which Cemex operates. Such amounts of taxable income depend on factors such as sale volumes and prices, costs and expenses, exchange rate fluctuations and interest on debt, among others, as well as the estimated tax assets at the end of the period due to the expected future generation of taxable gains in each jurisdiction.\n\n## Global minimum tax\n\nOn July 10, 2021, the intergovernmental international group promoting economic and financial cooperation known as G20 endorsed the key components of the Pillar Two tax reform that was agreed by 132 countries and jurisdictions (Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or the 'Inclusive Framework'). The key components of Pillar Two, which are commonly referred to as the 'global minimum tax' introduce a minimum e/ffective tax rate of at least 15%, calculated based on a specific rule set, known as 'GloBE model rules', which was published on December 20, 2021, by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), as approved by the Inclusive Framework. Groups with an e/ffective tax rate below the minimum in any particular jurisdiction would be required to pay top-up tax at the level of the ultimate parent entity or the intermediate parent entities, as applicable, based on the Income Inclusion Rule. The global minimum tax would be applied to groups with annual revenue of at least 750 million Euros. Among the countries in which Cemex operates, the minimum tax rules, which are e/ffective January 1, 2024, have been endorsed by Switzerland and the EU, and consequently, they will start to apply at the level of Cemex's Swiss and Spanish intermediate parent entities, each considering all their corresponding subsidiaries. For instance, if the e/ffective tax rate of a jurisdiction where subsidiaries of Cemex Espa\u00f1a operate as determined using each individual entity's financial statements (considering certain adjustments) is below 15% on a combined basis, Cemex Espa\u00f1a would then need to pay in Spain the di/fference between the implied e/ffective tax rate and the minimum tax rate of 15%, unless a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax is in e/ffect, in which case, any top-up tax would be paid in such jurisdiction. Cemex is currently analyzing Pillar Two implementation and preliminarily considers that e/ffects will not be significant.",

Considering that the Parent Company's subordinated notes have no fixed maturity date, there is no contractual obligation for the Parent Company to deliver cash or any other financial assets, the payment of principal and interest may be deferred indefinitely at the sole discretion of Cemex and specific redemption events, are entirely under the Parent Company's control, under applicable IFRS, the Subordinated Notes qualify as equity instruments and are classified within controlling interest stockholders' equity. In addition, this line item includes the accrued interest under Subordinated Notes.\n\nThe most significant items within 'Other equity reserves and subordinated notes' during the reported periods are as follows:\n\n## Items of 'Other equity reserves and subordinated notes' included within other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7  Currency translation e/ffects from the translation of foreign subsidiaries, net of: a) exchange results from foreign currency debt directly related to the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries; and b) exchange results from foreign currency related parties' balances that are of a non-current investment class (note 28.3);\n- \u00b7  The e/ffective portion of the valuation and liquidation e/ffects from derivative financial instruments under cash flow hedging relationships, which are recorded temporarily in stockholders' equity (note 28.4);\n- \u00b7  Changes in fair value of other investments in strategic securities (note 28.4); and\n- \u00b7  Current and deferred income taxes during the period arising from items whose e/ffects are directly recognized in stockholders' equity.\n\n## Items of 'Other equity reserves and subordinated notes' not included in comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7  E/ffects related to controlling stockholders' equity for changes or transactions a/ffecting non-controlling interest stockholders in Cemex's consolidated subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7  E/ffects attributable to controlling stockholders' equity for financial instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries that qualify for accounting purposes as equity instruments, such as the interest expense paid on perpetual debentures;\n- \u00b7  The balance of Subordinated Notes with no fixed maturity and any interest accrued thereof; and\n- \u00b7  The cancellation of the Parent Company's shares held by consolidated entities.\n\n## 28.12) Executive Share-Based Compensation (note 22)\n\nShare-based payments to executives are defined as equity instruments when services received from employees are settled by delivering shares of the Parent Company and/or a subsidiary; or as liability instruments when Cemex commits to make cash payments to the executives upon exercise of the awards based on changes in the Parent Company and/or the subsidiary's stock (intrinsic value). The cost of equity instruments represents their estimated fair value at the date of grant and is recognized in the operating results during the periods in which the executives release any restriction. Cemex does not grant liability instruments.",

Entities in turn, must submit to such environmental authorities at the end of the compliance period, Allowances for a volume equivalent to the tons of CO2 released. Companies must buy additional Allowances to meet deficits between actual CO2 emissions during the compliance period and Allowances received. Entities may also dispose of any surplus of Allowances in the market. In general, failure to meet the emissions caps is subject to significant monetary penalties. The trend is that Allowances received free of cost will be reduced over time so that entities are compelled to act and gradually reduce the aggregate volume of emissions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, according to management estimates (unaudited), Cemex held excess Allowances received for no consideration in prior years su/fficient to allow the Company o/ffsetting CO2 costs in the EU and the United Kingdom operations until 2026. Moreover, the increasing use of decarbonated or lower carbon raw materials, although far more expensive than traditional raw materials, among other strategies to reduce CO2 emissions such as the use of alternative fuels and decarbonated or lower carbon cementitious materials, may allow Cemex, according to internal estimates, to extend its consolidated surplus of Allowances beyond 2026.\n\nCemex accounts for the e/ffects associated with CO2 emission reduction mechanisms as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Certificates received through government grants for no consideration paid are recognized at zero cost in the statement of financial position.\n- \u00b7  Revenues received from the sale of excess Allowances are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they occur.\n- \u00b7  Allowances that would be acquired to hedge exceeding CO2 emissions would be recognized as intangible assets at cost and would be further amortized to the cost of sales during the compliance period.\n- \u00b7  Cemex would accrue a provision at market value against the cost of sales when current emissions of CO2 would exceed the number of emission rights on hand and the required additional Allowances would not be yet acquired in the market.\n- \u00b7  In addition, in certain countries, the environmental authorities impose levies per ton of CO2 or other greenhouse gases released. Such expenses are recognized as part of the cost of sales as incurred.\n\n## 28.14) Concentration of Credit\n\nCemex sells its products primarily to distributors in the construction industry, with no specific geographic concentration within the countries in which Cemex operates. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, no single customer individually accounted for a significant amount of the reported amounts of sales or in the balances of trade accounts receivable. In addition, there is no significant concentration of a specific supplier relating to the purchase of raw materials.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Mexico, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The goodwill balance represents 27% of the Group's total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2023. Goodwill is tested for impairment upon the occurrence of internal or external indicators of impairment or at least once a year.\n\nWe have identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for the group of CGUs as a key audit matter because the estimated value in use involved a high degree of subjectivity. Specifically, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate used to calculate the value in use of the group of CGUs were challenging and changes to these assumptions had a significant impact on the value in use amount.\n\n## EVALUATION OF A TAX PROCEEDING IN SPAIN\n\n## The key audit matter\n\nAs discussed in notes 20.4 and 28.10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group is involved in a significant tax proceeding in Spain related to uncertain tax treatments. The Group recognizes the e/ffect of an uncertain tax treatment when it is probable that it would be accepted by the tax authorities. If an uncertain tax treatment is considered not probable of being accepted, the Group recognizes the e/ffect of such uncertainties in its tax liabilities.\n\nWe have identified the evaluation of a tax proceeding in Spain and the related disclosures made as a key audit matter because it requires challenging auditor judgment and significant audit e/ffort, due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions, including judgment about the amounts that would be paid in the event of loss.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included, among others, the following:\n\nWe performed sensitivity analyses over the discount rate and the long-term growth rate assumptions to assess their impact on the determination of the value in use of the group of CGUs.\n\nWe evaluated the Group's forecasted long-term growth rates for the group of CGUs by comparing the growth assumptions to publicly available data.\n\nWe compared the Group's historical cash flow forecasts to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately forecast.\n\nTo assess the overall reasonableness of the resulting value in use determination, we evaluated the implied multiples of earnings resulting from the value in use determination against publicly available information of multiples of earnings in market transactions.\n\nIn addition, we involved our valuation specialists, who assisted in:\n\n- -Evaluating the discount rate for the group of CGUs, by comparing it with a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available data for comparable entities and evaluating the long-term growth rate by comparing it against publicly available data; and\n- -  Developing an estimate of the value in use of  the group of CGUs using the Group's cash flow forecasts and determining an independently developed discount rate and comparing the results of our estimates to the Group's estimates of value in use.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included, among others, the following:\n\nWe evaluated the competence and capabilities of the external tax advisers of the Group that assessed the estimate of the outflow of resources.\n\nIn addition, together with our tax specialists, we assessed the amounts disclosed by:\n\n- -  Inspecting letters received directly from the Group's external tax advisers that assessed the amounts that would be paid in the event of loss, comparing these assessments and estimates to those made by the Group; and\n- -  Inspecting the latest correspondence between the Group and the various involved authorities, as applicable.\n\nWe assessed that the disclosures reflect the underlying facts and circumstances of the tax proceeding.",

The Group records provisions for legal proceedings when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle a present obligation and when the outflow can be reliably estimated. The Group discloses a contingency for legal proceedings whenever the likelihood of loss from the proceedings is considered possible or when it is considered probable, but it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of the outflow of resources.\n\nWe have identified the evaluation of certain of these legal proceedings in Colombia and the related disclosures made as a key audit matter because it requires challenging auditor judgment and significant audit e/ffort, due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions, including judgments about the likelihood of loss and the amounts that would be paid in the event of loss.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included, among others, the following:\n\nWe evaluated the competence and capabilities of the in-house and external lawyers of the Group that assessed the likelihood of loss and the estimate of the outflow of resources, when applicable.\n\nIn addition, together with our legal specialists, we assessed the amounts disclosed by:\n\n- -Inspecting letters received directly from the Group's external lawyers that assessed the likelihood of loss and the amounts that would be paid in the event of loss of these legal proceedings and comparing these assessments and estimates to those made by the Group; and\n- -Inspecting  the  latest  correspondence  between  the  Group  and  the  various  authorities,  as applicable.\n\nWe assessed that the disclosures reflect the underlying facts and circumstances of each relevant legal proceeding.\n\n## EVALUATION OF THE ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION OF SUBORDINATED NOTES ISSUED\n\n## The key audit matter\n\nAs discussed in notes 21.2 and 28.11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group has $1.0 billion principal amount of subordinated notes (the 'Notes') as of December 31, 2023 that were issued during 2023 and on which, in accordance with the indenture, payment of principal and interest may be deferred indefinitely at the sole discretion of the Group. The Group performed an analysis of the classification of these Notes as equity instruments or as financial liabilities and concluded that they should be classified as equity instruments and presented within stockholders' equity.\n\nWe have identified the evaluation of the accounting classification of the Notes as a key audit matter. The evaluation required challenging audit e/ffort and judgement, particularly in the assessment of (1) whether the Group has an obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets in the normal course of business and in certain other possible scenarios including a reorganization, and (2) whether the clauses in the Notes that permit the deferral of payments at the Group's discretion have economic substance and how they should be considered in the evaluation of their classification.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included, among others, the following:\n\n- -  Reading the indenture governing the Notes in order to identify the clauses relevant to the accounting classification and inspecting the Group's technical accounting analyses to evaluate their interpretation and application of the relevant accounting literature;\n- -  Inspecting correspondence received from the Group's external legal counsel that assessed whether the Group had an obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets in the event of a reorganization;\n- -Evaluating the competence and capabilities of the external legal counsel of the Group; and\n- -  Evaluating the economic substance of the payment deferral clauses by assessing the pricing and third-party credit rating of the Notes at issuance compared to other similar instruments without any payment deferral clauses and considering the historic payments made by the Group.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual report for the year ended December 31, 2023, to be filed with the National Banking and Securities Commission (Mexico) (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores) and the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores) ('the Annual Report') but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.  The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control.",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## KPMG C\u00e1rdenas Dosal, S.C.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nC.P.C.

Except as the context otherwise may require, references in this integrated report to 'Cemex', 'the company', 'we', 'us', or 'our' refer to Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V., and its consolidated entities.\n\n## Reporting Scope\n\nCemex began publishing Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) reports in 1996 and has annually published its Sustainable Development Reports since 2003, covering a broad range of issues related to economic, environmental, social, and governance performance. Since 2016, our Integrated Reports are intended to provide a holistic analysis of the company's strategic vision, performance, governance, and value creation, while fostering a more in-depth understanding of the financial and non-financial key performance indicators that the company uses to manage its business over the short, medium, and long term.\n\n## Boundary and Reporting Period\n\nIn preparation for this report, we consolidated information from all of our operations. It covers our global cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, and urbanization solutions business lines, presenting our financial and non-financial performance, progress, achievements, and challenges during the 2023 calendar year, which is also the company's fiscal year. Our materiality assessment guided our reporting process, and the issues included in this report particularly match those that Cemex and our stakeholders found of the highest importance, as reflected in our Materiality Matrix.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the information provided in this report is for the company as a whole. We have included information for the operations in which we have financial and operative control. If a plant is sold, its information is no longer included in our data or considered in our targets. We have clearly marked each case if we have restated certain data sets from previous years. Unless something else is explicitly indicated, all monetary amounts are reported in U.S. dollars. All references to 'tons' are to metric tons.\n\nThe information in our 2023 Integrated Report came from several sources, including internal management systems and performance databases, as well as annual surveys applied across all of our operations.\n\nWe continually aim to improve the transparency and completeness of each report we produce while streamlining our processes and how we provide information.\n\nTo this end, we include a limited assurance statement from KPMG. This independent organization verified the data and calculation process for our annual indicators associated with CO2 and other emissions, health and safety, circular economy, biodiversity, water, and environmental and social incidents.\n\n## Data Measurement Techniques\n\nWe employ the following protocols and techniques for measuring the sustainability key performance indicators (KPI) that we report:\n\nCO2 emissions: Cemex reports absolute and specific CO2 emissions following the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) Sustainability",

The measurement is based on the mass balance methodology, fully described in the CEN Standard on CO2 emission from the cement industry EN-19694-3 and applied through the spreadsheet of the Cement CO2 Protocol (previously known as WBCSD CSI Cement CO2 and Energy Protocol v. 3.1). It considers direct emissions occurring from sources that are owned or controlled by the company, excluding those from the combustion of biomass that are reported separately (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed in the company's owned or controlled equipment (Scope 2) and from the clinker purchased (Scope 3). For countries covered by the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), CO2 data considers the information validated by an independent verifier in accordance with the applicable Accreditation and Verification Regulation.\n\n## Particulate Matter, NOx, and SOx emissions:\n\nAbsolute and specific figures are calculated based on kiln measurements taken from Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMs) (in those sites where kilns are equipped with such technology) or spot analysis. These methods fully comply with GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of emissions from cement manufacturing (October 2019). All information is reported to Cemex databases,\n\nprocessed, calculated, and validated to provide a final group value. The values are calculated in Standard for 0\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere, and 10% Oxygen (O2) content at the measuring point.\n\nEnergy: Fuel consumption indicators are reported to internal Cemex databases in which 'conventional,' 'alternative,' and 'biomass fuels' are classified according to the Cement CO2 Protocol spreadsheet. Heat values are obtained from on-site analysis (where applicable), provided by suppliers or standards from recognized sources.\n\nClinker factor and alternative fuels: All material consumption is reported to internal Cemex databases in which 'alternative materials' are defined following the standards from the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for co-processing fuels and raw materials in cement manufacturing (October 2019). The 'clinker/cement factor' is calculated using the Basic Parameters set out in the GCCA Sustainability Framework Guidelines and according to the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing, procedures indicated in the Cement CO2 Protocol spreadsheet with information obtained from the databases.\n\nHealth and safety: Intelex, which feeds an internal database, collects all related health and safety information from each site and automatically provides the appropriate information to calculate the indicators. The database is configured using the GCCA definitions. Health and safety indicators are calculated according to the GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of safety in cement and concrete manufacturing, February 2020 version.\n\n## GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards\n\nTo enhance our sustainability communication to our stakeholders and comply with internationally\n\nagreed disclosures and metrics, Cemex uses the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards to prepare its Sustainable Development Reports. From 2008 to 2013, we met an application level of A+ using GRI-G3. From 2014 to 2016, we applied the GRI-G4 Guidelines.\n\nIn 2017 we migrated to the GRI Standards, and in 2023 we are reporting under GRI Universal Standards 2021.\n\nFurthermore, our GRI Content Index cross-references with the UN Global Compact Principles and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our 2023 GRI Content Index is located on pages 229245 of this report.\n\n## United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress\n\nThis report, together with the UN Global Compact Participant Dashboard, constitutes our Communication on Progress (CoP) toward the commitments of the UN Global Compact (UNGC). As a participant in the UNGC, we work to align our company's operations and strategies with its ten principles. As demonstrated within this report, we are also committed to helping the world meet the targets of the Paris Agreement and contribute to the achievement of the UN SDGs.\n\n## Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB)\n\nIn 2019, we started reporting aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) industry-specific requirements for the Construction Material Standard.  Our  SASB Index has been updated to the SASB Standards amended in December 2023 and is located on pages 246-247 of this report.",

This assessment is based on the principle of double materiality and is aligned with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and we have started the alignment with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\nIn 2023, we carried out a full update of our materiality assessment. The defined topics considered internal and external stakeholder views through an online survey, where respondents ranked the material topics based on the potential impact on\n\nsociety and the environment, and we received more than 2,500 responses. We also carried out an industry-level evaluation and researched economic, environmental, and major social trends and challenges, aligning the material topics to our Enterprise Risk Management agenda.\n\nMaterial topics are ranked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents low impact and 5 represents the highest impact. They are mapped according to the impact on stakeholders and the environment versus the financial impact on Cemex.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the material topics and their potential impacts on our stakeholders and our company's financial and sustainability performance, identifying opportunities to act on the changing social, environmental, and economic concerns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Materiality Assessment Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentification of relevant assessment topics and alignment of topics to our Global Risk Management Agenda.\n\nDefinition of stakeholders to participate in the analysis.\n\nPrioritization of the topics by gathering stakeholder groups' opinions and concerns.

Talent Attraction and Retention\n\nRelation to the Board of Directors' Skillset: A specialized workforce is an invaluable asset for companies around the globe, and therefore attracting, hiring, and retaining talent is a significantly relevant task for Cemex. The members of our Board of Directors may provide key insights in human resources programs with the expertise gathered in Business Strategy, Human Resources, Labor Matters, Executive Compensation Structures and Transparency, Health and Safety, ESG Mattersfocused training and education, Human Rights in Supply Chain Due Diligence, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and Ethics and Compliance, to attract a specialized workforce and retain their talent.\n\n## 15. Pandemic, Epidemic, or any Other Public Health Threat\n\nRelation to the Board of Directors' Skillset: As the global population grows, new public health threats pose a risk to the Company's employees and operations. Our Board of Directors' members can analyze and react to new public health threats as some of the members have previous background experience in Global A/ffairs, Corporate Risk Management Operation and Supervision, Supply Chain, Logistics, Procurement, Health and Safety, and Healthcare. The foregoing also allows them to design and implement, as well as to adhere to or adapt, contingency plans that allow for business continuity.\n\n## 16. Industry Disruptions by Emerging Technologies or Alternative Solutions\n\nRelation to the Board of Directors' Skillset: Amidst a rapidly changing industry marked by emerging technologies, failure to adapt our business model to potential industry disruptors could pose a risk to our capacity to compete and our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results\n\nof operations. In this environment, the ability of our Board of Directors to seek resilient and alternative solutions to potential disruptions is an indispensable skill. To do so, in addition to experience on other boards of directors, some of the most relevant areas of expertise of our Board of Directors include Administration, Corporate Risk Management Operation and Supervision, Business Strategy, Entrepreneurship, Research and Development, Construction and Building Materials, Energy, Media and Communication, Telecommunications, Green Technologies, Renewable Energy Solutions and/or Circular Economy, and Cybersecurity and/or Risk Management Threats. This skillset allows them to address potential industry disruptions and seek the implementation of new technologies, processes, materials, and solutions in our Company.\n\n## 17. Just Transition: Collateral Impacts from Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy\n\nRelation to the Board of Directors' Skillset: As society transitions towards a low carbon economy, the adoption of more environmentally and socially responsible practices by all stakeholders has become crucial. The members of our Board of Directors, through their experience in other boards of directors, as well as their expertise in Business Strategy, Mergers and Acquisitions, Entrepreneurship, Research and Development, Construction and Building Materials, Supply System, Supply Chain, Logistics, Energy, Climate Change Risk Assessment, Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies, CO2 Emissions Reduction Targets and Programs, and Green Technologies, Renewable Energy Solutions, and Circular Economy, possess the necessary skillset to drive further Cemex's commitment to become a net-zero CO2  company by 2050.\n\n## 18. Inadequate Governance and Implementation of AI\n\nRelation to the Board of Directors' Skillset: The increasing extent to which AI can develop, limited AI-governance e/fforts, the potential misuse of AI by bad actors and other AI-related issues can pose several risks to our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, many of which we may not have identified yet due to the recent breakthroughs in AI. Skills such as Global A/ffairs, Corporate Risk Management Operation and Supervision, Research and Development, Media and Communications, Telecommunications, and in Cybersecurity and risk management threats allow the Board of Directors to discern the implications and better position the Company to face risks posed by AI.\n\n## 19. Intensification of Cost-of-Living Concerns\n\nRelation to the Board of Directors' Skillset: Social unrest, higher business expenses and other issues that may result from increased cost-of-living in the places where we operate could potentially a/ffect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The Board of Directors contributes to mitigate this risk with skills such as Administration, Global A/ffairs, Public A/ffairs, Business Strategy, Investor Relations, Sales, Supply Chain, Logistics, Manufacturing, Procurement, Media and Communication, Green Technologies, renewable energy solutions, and circular economy, and Community Engagement and social impact projects. The Board of Directors also aims to allow the Company to provide fair compensation to employees and maintain competitive prices for its products and services through strategies and structured plans.",

It is a tool to help channel private investment towards the transition to a more sustainable economy.\n\nThe Taxonomy is based on six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nFor an economic activity to be considered environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy, it must contribute substantially to one or more of these six objectives, not significantly harm any of the other objectives, and meet minimum social safeguards.  Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) have been developed in order to set out how these requirements are to be applied in detail, pursuant to various Commission Delegated Regulations (Delegated Acts) adopted under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation requires non-financial undertakings that are required to report under the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive to disclose how and to what extent the undertaking's activities are associated with economic activities that are environmentally sustainable and in particular the proportion of their turnover which is derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable and the proportion of their capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) which is related to assets or processes associated with economic activities that are environmentally sustainable.\n\nAlthough Cemex is currently not legally required to report under the Taxonomy Regulation or the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, Cemex entered into an agreement with a third-party advisor in 2022 to work on providing Taxonomy-related disclosures, aiming to ensure that our stakeholders understand the extent to which Cemex's activities are aligned with the Taxonomy.\n\nCemex has identified its core activity 'manufacture of cement', as well as 'material recovery from non-hazardous waste', as Taxonomy-eligible under the climate change mitigation objective. 'Material recovery from non-hazardous waste' relates to construction and operation of facilities for the sorting and processing of separately collected non-hazardous waste streams into secondary raw materials. Additionally, for the objective of 'transition to a circular economy', Cemex engages in 'sorting and material recovery of non-hazardous waste'. Other economic activities that Cemex carries out, such\n\nas the production of aggregates and ready-mixed concrete and certain other businesses, do not fall within activities that are currently eligible under the Taxonomy. Finally, we have reported on certain other Cemex activities in respect of the climate change mitigation objective, but only in respect of their contribution to Cemex CapEx. These activities are primarily 'electricity generation from renewable power' and 'freight transport services by road'.\n\n## Turnover\n\nTurnover is defined as the sales generated by all activities of the company, as shown in Cemex's Financial Statements (referred to in the relevant Delegated Act as the denominator). The turnover generated by the eligible and aligned activities is then calculated for the reporting year (referred to in the relevant Delegated Act as the numerator).\n\nThe total Cemex turnover under the Taxonomy stands at US$17,388 million, with the proportion of turnover eligible under the Taxonomy being US$7,678 million (44.16%) for the cement business, US$34 million (0.19%) for circular activities embedded in our aggregates business, and US$4 million (0.02%) for urbanization solutions. The proportion of turnover aligned with the Taxonomy is US$702 million (4.04%) for cement, and US$3 million (0.02%) for aggregates, and US$2 million (0.01%) for urbanization solutions.\n\n|                                            | In Million US Dollars   | Percentage (%)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Taxonomy Non-eligible Turnover             | 9,672                   | 55.63%           |\n| Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned Turnover | 7,008                   | 40.30%           |\n| Taxonomy-eligible and aligned Turnover     | 707                     | 4.07%            |\n| Total Turnover                             | 17,388                  | 100%             |\n\n## Capital Expenditure (CapEx)\n\nIn respect of CapEx, the Taxonomy (in overview) requires that Cemex reports the proportion of Taxonomy eligible and aligned CapEx (referred to in the relevant Delegated Act as the numerator) compared to general CapEx (referred to in the relevant Delegated Act as the denominator).\n\nThe definition of CapEx under the Taxonomy di/ffers from the definition of CapEx used by Cemex in its financial statements. CapEx pursuant to the Taxonomy is defined in the relevant Delegated Act as fixed assets plus intangible assets, which, in our case, include deferred charges in the financial statements",

The denominator corresponds to Cemex group's total CapEx, which includes investments in intangible assets, investments in property, machinery and equipment, and investments in right-of-use assets. CapEx includes the work carried out by the company for its fixed assets and capitalized financial expenses. The numerator comprises the portion of CapEx included in the denominator that pertains to assets or processes associated with eligible economic activities. This also includes assets that are part of a plan to expand the economic activities aligned with the Taxonomy or to facilitate the alignment of economic activities eligible under the Taxonomy in the future, in this case by 2030 even though a ten-year period is justified on the CapEx plan conditions set forth in the relevant Delegated Act.\n\nTotal CapEx calculated pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation amounts to US$1,689 million. Within this amount, US$647 million (38.29%) is allocated to Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for our cement business -including US$7 million (0.41%) for the CapEx plan-, US$13 million (0.78%) for circular activities in our urbanization solutions business -including US$1 million (0.04%) for the CapEx plan-, and US$1 million (0.04%) for electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology and freight transport services by road. The portion of CapEx aligned with the Taxonomy constitutes US$61 million (3.60%) for cement, US$13 million (0.78%) for urbanization solutions, and US$1 million (0.04%) for the other activities previously mentioned. These aligned CapEx figures encompass US$75 million from property, machinery, and equipment additions, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets incurred during the fiscal year prior to depreciation, amortization, and any new valuations, including those arising from revaluations and impairments, for the fiscal year, excluding fair value changes. Leases not leading to the recognition of a right-of-use asset are not classified as CapEx under the Taxonomy.\n\n|                                         | In Million US Dollars   | Percentage (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Taxonomy Non-eligible CapEx             | 1,028                   | 60.89%           |\n| Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned CapEx | 586                     | 34.69%           |\n| Taxonomy-eligible and aligned CapEx     | 75                      | 4.42%            |\n| Total CapEx Pursuant to Taxonomy        | 1,689                   | 100%             |\n\n## Operational Expenditure (OpEx)\n\nIn respect of OpEx, the Taxonomy (in overview) requires that Cemex reports the proportion of Taxonomy eligible and aligned OpEx (referred to in the relevant Delegated Act as the numerator) compared to general OpEx (referred to in the relevant Delegated Act as the denominator).\n\nOpEx, as defined under the Taxonomy, also has a di/fferent definition to OpEx in respect of Cemex's financial statements. Under the Taxonomy, OpEx is defined as non-capitalized direct costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, as well as other direct expenditures related to the day-to-day maintenance of property, machinery, and equipment, by the company or a third party to whom activities are outsourced, and which are necessary to ensure the continuous and e/ffective functioning of those assets.\n\nFor 2023, the total OpEx calculated pursuant to the Taxonomy amounted to US$1,206 million. Within this figure, Taxonomy-eligible OpEx was identified as US$620 million (51.41%) for cement.\n\nRegarding the Taxonomy-eligible research and development expenditure in the cement sector, direct allocation to specific Taxonomy-aligned plants was not feasible. Therefore, such expenditure was allocated proportionally among all plants using a metric based on total cement production. Furthermore, OpEx figures are not available for all Construction, Demolition and Excavation Waste (CDEW) sites, so the information regarding these sites has not been considered.\n\nIn summary, US$54 million (4.45%) of OpEx for our cement business, was aligned with the Taxonomy. These aligned expenditures consist of research and development costs, maintenance and repair expenses (internal & external), and short-term leases.\n\n|                                        | In Million US Dollars   | Percentage (%)   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Taxonomy Non-eligible OpEx             | 586                     | 48.59%           |\n| Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned OpEx | 566                     | 46.96%           |\n| Taxonomy-eligible and aligned OpEx     | 54                      | 4.45%            |\n| Total OEx Pursuant to Taxonomy         | 1,206                   | 100%             |\n\n## Cemex methodology and progress\n\nDisclosures were prepared on a consolidated level for the entire Group, and activities outside the EU were evaluated in the same way as activities within the EU. Turnover, CapEx, and OpEx were gathered at the site level and then distributed proportionally to product-level production for the relevant activity. We excluded white cement/clinker production, as there are no applicable TSC. We also excluded trading activities and grinding facilities producing cement with external clinker. Additionally, OpEx figures are not available for all Construction, Demolition and Excavation Waste (CDEW) facilities, so the information on these sites has not been considered.\n\nThe stringency of the Taxonomy means that we expect further Taxonomy alignment of our activities gradually over time.  We envisage that the outcome of our initial Taxonomy reporting will reflect the fact that some operations in regions outside of Europe will face challenges due to the lack of strong regulatory frameworks in those jurisdictions.",

EL - Taxonomy-eligible activity for the relevant objective N/EL - Taxonomy-non-eligible activity for the relevant objective.\n- 3. Enabling activities: Activities that enable other activities to make a substantial contribution to one or more of the objectives, and where that activity; and a) does not lead to a lock-in in assets that undermine long-term environmental goals, considering the economic lifetime of those assets;and b) has a substantial positive environmental impact on the basis of lifecycle considerations.\n- 4. Transitional activities must contribute to climate change mitigation and a pathway to keeping global warming in line with Paris Agreement commitments. Transitional activities only qualify where the following criteria are met: a) There are no technologically or economically feasible low-carbon alternatives; b) Green House Gas emission levels correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry; and c)The activity does not lead to carbon lock-in or hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives.",

As a public company in Mexico and in the U.S., on March 26, 2020, Cemex, S.A.B. de C.V. held an ordinary general shareholders' meeting in which the shareholders for the first time approved the appointment of the members of the Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact and Diversity Committee; that is, we have elevated the appointment of the members of the Committee from Board of Directors level to shareholder level. The responsibilities of the President of the Committee are set forth in the Committee role. Examples of the type of decisions the President makes are the implementation of Cemex's Future in Action program and the revision and resources assurance of the CO2 Reduction Roadmap initiatives.\n\nOur Future in Action program is our plan going forward that focuses on achieving sustainable excellence through climate action, circularity, and natural resource management, with the primary objective of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions across the company by 2050. As part of this program, Cemex is leveraging on the CO2 Reduction Roadmap, developed, and launched across all our cement sites to model and assess the carbon mitigation potential at each site, considering di/fferent factors. In 2022, Cemex validated its 2050 net-zero CO2 roadmap and its 2030 decarbonization goals under the Science-Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) 1.5 o C Scenario, becoming one of the first companies in the industry to do so.\n\n- To know more about our Future in Action program and CO2 Roadmap, please refer to pages 27-57 in our 2023 Integrated Report or go to cemex.com\n\nIn 2023, the Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact and Diversity Committee meetings included the following climate change related topics:\n\n- l Review of key sustainability performance indicators (e.g., climate action, reduction of CO2 emissions, H&S, water and biodiversity, circular economy, social impact), of benchmarking with industry peers, and of Cemex's ESG rankings and ratings.\n- l Review of the 2023-2024 sustainability risk agenda.\n- l Review of Cemex's Future in Action performance during 2023 against updated 2025 and 2030 targets and improvement plans.\n- l Definition of action plans focused on the development of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact and Diversity Committee discussions in 2023 were enriching and led to valuable outcomes related to climate change, such as:\n\n- l Record-breaking CO2 reduction in the last three years since the launch of the Future in Action program.\n- l Historical company records in our use of alternative fuels and reduction in clinker factor.\n- l First limited verification process by a third-party of our Scope 3 emissions targets.\n- l Future in Action program and targets enhancement.\n- l Deeper analysis of ESG risks and opportunities-especially climate-related.\n- l Continued focus on disclosure compliance in respect of ESG-related matters.\n- l Increase of clean electricity consumption.\n- l Over 1,000 heavy-duty trucks powered with lower-carbon fuels as part of the transition strategy seeking to decarbonize the global fleet.\n- l Become the first company in the cement industry to provide environmental impact information, including CO2 emissions, for its core products.\n- l Update of our Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework and Green Financing Framework.\n- l Construction of major air emissions online visualization tool.\n- l Issued US$1 billion of our green subordinated notes with no fixed maturity, the net proceeds of which will be used to finance or refinance eligible green projects as per our Green Financing Framework. Some of these green projects involve climate-related initiatives.\n- To know more about our climate-related achievements in 2023, please refer to page 14 in our 2023 Integrated Report.\n\n## b) Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nAt the executive level, our CEO and members of our Executive Committee (ExCo) oversee the day-today operation of our company. They direct the implementation of our business strategy. On a monthly basis, the ExCo reviews progress and performance of our Future in Action program which includes our global climate action strategy and is focused on developing products and solutions with sustainable attributes such as products manufactured with less carbon emissions, and processes to become a netzero CO2 company by 2050.\n\nThe Vice President of Global Sustainability, reporting directly to Cemex's CEO, coordinates with the rest of the company and with departments directly related to the sustainability and climate change strategy and their contribution to the integration and completion of all the climate-related initiatives.\n\nIn addition, the Vice President of Global Sustainability coordinates the Sustainability function of the company, which includes the regional sustainability coordinators. The Vice President specifically oversees all cross-functions of the company (all business and all departments), and directly manages sustainability topics that are embedded throughout the organization.\n\nThe responsibilities of the management with respect to climate change include:\n\n- l Monitoring the company's performance in terms of CO2 emissions and related KPIs.\n- l Monitoring of the company's CO2 roadmap implementation and resources assurance for the execution of the reduction initiatives and presentation to the ExCo and Board for approval.\n- l Coordination of the Future in Action program.",

These targets are a mandatory part of the performance evaluation for the CEO, Executive Committee members (regional level), and Country Managers (business unit level) and are transmitted in a top-to-bottom manner across the organization.\n\nAs part of this e/ffort, all regional cement operations leaders and cement plant heads are required to assign at least 20% of their individual performance results weighting to the achievement of their specific CO2 emissions target as part of their variable compensation\n\nSince 2022, and to strive for progress of our 2030 target, Cemex's variable compensation plan includes a CO2 emissions component related to carbon reduction goals that could have an impact ranging from -10% to +10% in the total cash payout of the annual variable compensation plan. Furthermore, in March 2022, the variable compensation plan was expanded to cover more than 4,500 executives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Enterprise Risk Management is included in the Vice Presidency of Corporate A/ffairs, Enterprise Risk Management and Social Impact",

These guidelines define five levels of financial risk impact (very low, low, medium, high and very high). 'High and very high' impacts are defined as follows:\n\n- l 'High impact' a/ffects between 4% and 6% of global EBITDA, and 'Very high impact' a/ffects more than 6% of global EBITDA. These risk impact levels are also defined for our business units based on the EBITDA or Operating Cash Flow (OCF) each business unit generates in relation to Cemex's global EBITDA.\n- l The ERM guidelines also define what a 'high and very high' risk impact means for other types of impacts (other than financial impacts, such as health & safety, operational, reputational, legal & compliance, and other strategic risks).\n- l A/ffects a whole Region, regardless of its financial or strategic impact; or as per shareholder or Executive Committee request.\n\nAs part of our risk identification process, we evaluate their significance to be included in our risk type assessment.\n\nThe following is a brief description of some of the main short, medium, and long-term risk types faced by Cemex and mitigation strategies:\n\n| Risk Type            | Time Horizon     | Risk Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Risk Management, Mitigation And Adaptation Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Transition Risks     | Transition Risks | Transition Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Transition Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Current  regulation  | Short            | Several jurisdictions where Cemex have operations are currently subject to climate  change-related legislation, including emissions trading systems (e.g., European Union,  Mexico and California) and carbon taxes (e.g., Colombia, Mexico). Even small changes to  e.g., free allocation of carbon allowances to our installations or overall scarcity of allow- ances or the level of taxes can have significant implications for Cemex.                                                                       | We closely follow current developments and update our risk adjustment and strategy ac- cordingly. On a quarterly basis, the Cemex 'CO2 Regulation Focus Group', which is comprised of  Public A/ffairs, Operations, and Sustainability members in each region, shares the insights  from government relations teams and identifies risks in emerging regulations.                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Emerging  regulation | Short            | Cemex fully supports the implementation of the Paris Agreement and collaborates with  governments worldwide to define and implement Nationally Determined Contributions  (NDCs). However, whether driven by such NDCs or otherwise, there is an increasing amount of  climate-related regulation across the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, the  new Emissions Trading System (ETS) in Mexico has started in 2024, and it could have a  material cost and administrative impact on our operations | For example, in Mexico, we were in close collaboration with the Mexican government  through CANACEM (a Mexican Cement Association) on the revision of the new ETS reg- ulation during its trial period. We have adopted the same approach in all countries in our  SCA&C region; carbon tax regulation vs. ETS has been analyzed in terms of emissions and  economic impact of each scenario, and we are evaluating the impact of the potential ETS  implementation in Colombia in the next 2-years.                                          |\n| Litigation           | Short            | Cemex is currently not subject to any climate change-related litigation, but the increasing  attention and commitment of governments to implement climate-related policies and  regulation, including in order to comply with NDCs, could evolve into more robust legis- lation and compliance requirements, meaning an increase in litigation or penalties risk.                                                                                                                                                 | The Cemex Legal department monitors on a quarterly basis all regulatory matters and legal  proceedings that may pose a material risk to the company, including all those that may re- late to climate change. After these regulatory matters and legal proceedings are identified,  mitigation measures are taken to address material risks that may arise therefrom, and the  Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is informed on a quarterly basis on develop- ments relating to such matters and the progress of mitigation measures. |",

Based on the resulting map, a 2030  target has been set to implement a Water Action Plan (WAP) in all those priority sites where  high-risk water stress was identified. Additionally, water stress scenarios mapping has been  developed for 2030 and 2040, and during 2021 Cemex implemented 2030 targets for  freshwater withdrawals reduction in cement, aggregates, and ready-mix businesses. |\n\nAfter evaluating the di/fferent types of risks and opportunities, we perform a prioritization process according to their potential financial impact. In the following tables we provide a more detailed description of some of these specific risks and opportunities.\n\n## Climate-Related Risks\n\n## Description\n\nRisk Type:\n\nCurrent Regulation\n\nPrimary Climate-Related Risk Driver:\n\nCarbon pricing\n\nmechanisms\n\nTime Horizon:\n\nShort-term\n\nMagnitude of Impact:\n\nHigh\n\nPrimary Potential Financial Impact:\n\nIncreased direct costs\n\nLikelihood:\n\nLikely\n\nCemex supports carbon pricing, particularly in the form of cap-and-trade, as the most e/ffective and e/fficient means to combat climate change. However, it is essential that a pricing system is well designed, maintaining fair competition preserving both the industry and the climate e/ffects if a carbon-leakage occurs; competition does not refer only to regulated and unregulated geographies, but also among potential substitute products (e.g., concrete vs. asphalt, timber, or steel). Cemex evaluates the risk of the transition to a carbon pricing regulation in those jurisdictions with a regulation already in place that could possibly evolve to a next phase/taxation scheme or those that have announced new regulation in the short-term. The current a/ffected jurisdictions are (1) California (one cement plant within the scope) with a CCA carbon price average (2022-2030) of 45 USD/t. (2) All EU cement Operations (EUA 2023: 83.5 EUR/t - EUA 2030: 142 EUR/t - 2050: 200 EUR/t; UKA 2023: 53.6 GBP/ton - 2030 and 2050 aligned with EUA prices). (3) Colombia: tax on liquid and gas fossil fuels (Carbon tax Colombia 2023: 20,500 COP/ton of CO2 contained in liquid and gas fuels (e.g., gasoline: 169 COP/gallon). (4) Mexico: tax on fossil fuels in place (Petcoke tax 2023: 23.5827 MXN/petcoke ton). (5) Other geographies are monitored yearly.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of increasing the operating cost derived from strengthening the GHG (CO2) regulation and increasing the GHG pricing, in Cemex, we have our cement plant-by-plant CO2 Roadmap, which includes all the initiatives to reduce CO2 and needed to accomplish our 2030 targets. We have identified, evaluated, and prioritized close to 300 initiatives to be executed during this decade. In addition, Cemex also actively participates in developing CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) technologies as a long-term solution.",

Cement and concrete already provide several important characteristics for a low-carbon transition, such as longevity,\n\nresistance, wide availability, among others. Nonetheless, there is still a significant potential for further developments to, e.g., decrease its embodied carbon, improve the insulating properties of concrete, further increase its strength, or implement smart functions to increase maintenance intervals and technical lifetimes. As one of the industry leaders, Cemex aims to continue to be at the forefront of these developments with the help of the company's R&D department. Our Vertua \u00ae portfolio of products, such as our lower-carbon concrete, the industry-first net zero concrete, our lower-carbon cement, and other products with sustainability attributes such as energy e/fficiency, resource e/fficiency, and water conservation, were rapidly adopted by our customers across di/fferent geographies.

Cemex  also o/ffers the customers the compensation of the remaining emissions, partnering with Climate  Impact Partners in Europe and getting a Carbon Neutral Product certification. |\n|             | Result tend the scope of Vertua  to include products and solutions developed by Cemex and with selected  sustainability attributes already available in our portfolio. To this end we have set the goal of having                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Supply chain and/or value chain\n\nClimate change plays an increasingly important role in selecting suppliers, particularly for electrical energy, impacting Cemex's short- and medium-term strategies. As a result, we have reduced our Scope 2 emissions in the last decade by sourcing electricity from renewable sources, getting 36% of our cement operations electricity consumption from clean electricity sources in 2023. The most prominent example was the development of the Eurus and Ventika I and II wind farms in Mexico with a combined capacity of more than 500 MW. In 2022, we enhanced our commitment by setting a target of reducing Scope 2 GHG emissions by 58% per ton of cementitious material by 2030 from a 2020 baseline. Additionally, we are also working on reducing our transport and logistics emissions through piloting electric vehicles into our ready-mix fleet, using renewable diesel, and implementing electromobility solutions. Please refer to page 37 of our 2023 Integrated Report for more information about these e/fforts.\n\n| Situation Cemex analyzed the cement electricity supplies in late 2018 and evaluated the options to reduce our  intensity and the cost-e/ffectiveness of the alternatives.                                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Task for Scope 2. Our goal is to reduce our Scope 2 emissions by 58% from our 2020 baseline, emitting                                                                                                                                          |\n| Action renewable sources.  Additionally, Cemex Poland entered into a long-term contract with Statkraft, a  Norwegian-originated, largest producer of renewable energy in Europe, for the supply of green elec- tricity from renewable sources. |\n| Result years. In Poland, the operations have reduced their CO2 emissions by around 200,000 tons/year                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## Investment in R&D\n\nCemex aims achieve net-zero CO2 emissions across the company by 2050, and R&D investment is a key player in the company's short, medium, and long-term strategies for all our cement and concrete operations worldwide.\n\nAccording to di/fferent studies, like the IEA-CSI Technology Roadmap 2018 and IEA Net-Zero by 2050, one of the major contributors for reducing our emissions and achieving carbon neutrality will be the capture and storage or utilization of CO2 emitted from our processes. The role and relevance of Cemex's Global R&D department working through an open innovation platform in which it partners and collaborates with start-ups, universities, other industry players and entities from other industries is now essential, as well as the participation of Cemex Ventures in the research of low-carbon solutions o/ffered by companies and start-ups, like the agreement we signed with Carbon Clean, a global leader in low-cost CO2 amine-based capture technology. As a result, Cemex is now participating in more than 220 innovation projects. Additionally, to build this portfolio, Cemex is tapping into and expects to continue to tap government funding in Europe and the United States, where there are well established programs to foster innovation in the green technologies of the future. Cemex continues to pursue its strategy in the di/fferent markets where we operate.\n\nTo know more about our engagement in these innovation projects, please refer to pages 47-51 in our 2023 Integrated Report.",

We have developed a detailed roadmap site by site with specific actions to achieve our 2030 Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets by implementing di/fferent technical measures, like increasing the use of alternative fuels, particularly biomass, upgrading technology assets like our a new kiln in Poland, increasing the use of clinker substitutes or changing portfolio products to more added cements mainly in SCA&C (South-Central America and the Caribbean), Mexico and USA, where the swap to Type I-L cements has been deployed during the past three years. Cemex also adopted some organizational measures such as awareness-raising, monitoring, and reporting of emissions, and an extensive use of our proprietary carbon footprint tool. To reinforce this commitment, all the operations set an annual emissions reduction goal and a portion of their compensation is linked to the achievement of this goal. Since 2022, Cemex's variable compensation plan has a new CO2 emissions component related to carbon reduction goals that could have an impact ranging from -10% to +10% in the total cash payout of the annual variable compensation plan. Our CEO, senior management, and approximately 4,500 executives are eligible for the variable compensation plan.\n\n## Internal Carbon Pricing\n\nSince 2020, Cemex designed a methodology to implement an internal carbon price as a shadow price with the primary objective of driving low-carbon investments and changing internal behaviors, reflecting a cost for CO2 emissions that simulates a scenario in which all our sites in the world operate under an emission trading system (ETS). Every year, we update the price of carbon according to the latest EU ETS average price forecast from a ten analysts' report (83.5 EUR/t for 2023 and 142 EUR/t for 2030; UKA 2023: 53.6 GBP/ton), which also includes UK ETS price forecast. California market price increased based on Analyst's Best Estimate used for California operation (33 USD/t in 2023, 28 USD/t in 2022 and 48 USD/t in 2030).  A carbon floor price is used for non-regulated countries outside EU and California (22 USD/ton in 2023, 20 USD/ton in 2022 and 36 USD/t in 2030). These forecasts are used in all our business units, allowing managers to make operational and investment decisions taking into consideration the impact of CO2 emissions on their present and future financial performance.\n\n## Influence on different areas of financial planning:\n\n| Influenced Financial   Planning Element   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                  | Revenues are mainly a/ffected by the increase in sales expected for the new resilient and lower carbon products. The impact on our revenues has already  been noted. However, we notice that as soon as our customers understand the magnitude and importance of having a lower carbon footprint and prod- uct life cycle assessment, the opportunity could be even more significant. Therefore, our R&D is constantly adapting our product portfolio to meet cus- tomer and society's needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Revenues                                  | To factor these opportunities into our financial planning process, we consider that our Vertua \u00ae  portfolio of products has a medium impact. We estimate  the sales increase expected annually and calculate the associated revenues. The operating cost (direct and indirect) is already being impacted by changes in regulations that increase operating production costs, mainly in European                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Direct and indirect costs                 | Year Business Plan) and moreover, considering the OCF impact in the middle term by simulating the already known rules of Phase IV (in EU and California)  and the mitigation actions we are carrying out to reduce the impact (CO2 Roadmap). Another impact on the financial planning costs is the Alternative Fuels strategy when the price lowers or is expected to lower. We find new alternative fuel  opportunities in very specific areas (UK) with a 5% cost decrease compared to previous contracts. The impact of this lever is still low, and it is just a/ffecting  some EU operations (mainly UK and Poland), but we are including the potential e/ffect in the middle term financial planning process (5 Year Business Plan, |",

While climate change-related risks and opportunities are relevant for all kinds of capital, the main areas where they factor  into the Cemex planning process are the following: l   Financial capital: Systematic consideration of costs induced by GHG regulation (e.g., taxes, the cost for purchase of allowances) in the evaluation of  investment projects; general stress testing of our mid-term financial planning by applying an internal carbon price according to the latest projection on  the market price in Europe per metric ton of CO2 (average price) and a sensitivity analysis with di/fferent prices to evaluate the robustness of the invest- ment. l   Human capital: Increasingly stronger focus on climate change-related topics (e.g., R&D into low-carbon technologies and products); further develop- |\n| Acquisitions and divestments              | Relevant climate-related risks and opportunities are analytically integrated into the evaluation of acquisitions and divestments. The impact depends on  the size of the transaction but may range from low impact to being a substantial part of the overall value; as a systematic approach, climate-related risk is  generally considered in our acquisition and divestment planning process, factored with a high impact magnitude. For instance, we announced the tem- porary closure of two operations in Spain in 2018 and one in the UK in 2020. One of the drivers to take this decision was the higher specific emissions of  these operations, as there was a production cost increase expected there in the long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Access to capital                         | The access to capital is an opportunity that is already a/ffecting our operations with a medium impact, and we have foreseen a potential to become a high  impact risk. Investors, particularly institutional ones, increasingly consider climate-related risks and opportunities in the evaluation of their portfolios. Ce- mex maintains an open and transparent dialogue with all interested investors, informing them about the company's strategy and performance. Addition- ally, during 2023, Cemex updated the Green Financing Framework, and the Sustainability-linked Framework, in line with ambitious 2030 decarbonization  targets and aligns our corporate sustainability commitments to our financial strategy as part of our Future in Action Program. Additionally, we get subsidies  in the context of the EU 'Innovation Funds' to support our new R&D technologies, and we were granted too with DOE (US) funding for innovation.                                                                                  |\n\nc) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration di/fferent climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nCemex assesses the resilience of its medium and long-term climate strategy with di/fferent climate scenarios. Until 2020, we used as reference the RCPIPCC (RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5, RCP 2.6, RCP 1.9); the 2DS (IEA-CSI Cement LowCarbon Technology Roadmap 2018); and B2DS of the IEA-Energy Technology Perspectives 2017 (ETP2017) climate-related scenarios.\n\nIn early 2021, we updated the reference scenarios to the latest ones developed by IEA, the World Energy Outlook 2020, and revisited them in October 2021, when the World Energy Outlook 2021 was published and the underlying assumptions on macro-drivers, policies and techno-economic inputs were adjusted.\n\nThe transition scenarios included in the evaluation of our strategy resiliency are the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), and the Net Zero emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE).\n\nThe worst-case temperature scenario considered is the RCP 8.5, which assumes that current trends in greenhouse gas emissions will continue without any major mitigation e/fforts, as it considers high population growth, an intensive use of fossil-fuels and a limited technological change without significant global climate policy e/fforts. The SDS and NZE are also considered to evaluate the resiliency of our strategy, as more restrictive transitional scenario.",

Cemex is aware that climate action is the biggest challenge of our times. With the Future in Action program, we remain committed to becoming a net-zero CO2 company by 2050. However, we acknowledge the societal and environmental challenges, risks, and opportunities that could potentially arise based in the di/fferent climate-scenarios assessed. Our climate strategy remains aligned with the most ambitious NZE scenario and the relevant parameters considered for this assessment, such as the increase in demand for lower-carbon products and services and access to competitive energy sources which contribute to our carbon reduction strategy. Cemex remains committed to providing products and services that address sustainability-related concerns to our customers and to maintaining an alignment to the most ambitious e/fforts related to a net-zero scenario by 2050.\n\nWe will continue working to achieve 2030 target of reducing our net specific CO2 emissions by 47% compared to our 1990 baseline.\n\nIn 2022, Cemex validated its 2050 net-zero CO2 roadmap and its 2030 decarbonization goals under the Science-Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) recently announced 1.5\u00baC Scenario.\n\nAlso, Cemex expects to continue investing in research and development to deliver innovative building materials and solutions to build climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings, and climate-resilient infrastructures, while capitalizing on CX Ventures, Urbanization Solutions, and strategic partnerships.\n\nWe remain committed to identifying and investing in new technologies needed to achieve our 2050 target, and we expect it will be strengthened in the most carbon-constrained scenarios.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses and manages climaterelated risks.\n\n- a) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing  climaterelated risks.\n- b) Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks. c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climaterelated risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management.\n\n## Cemex's Risk Management Process\n\nAt Cemex, identifying, assessing, discussing, mitigating, and monitoring risks and opportunities is part of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system,\n\nan integral process that considers all types of potential risks and opportunities, including climate-related ones that could impact the company's strategic objectives. The ERM and the Sustainability functions have primary responsibility for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur ERM system is established at country, regional and global levels following a 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' strategy that allows information flow across the organization and supports better and informed decision making. An Enterprise Risk & Opportunity Agenda is developed at least twice a year, and it is presented to the Executive Committee and to the Board of Directors for its insight and approval. This agenda includes Sustainability, ESG, and climate-related risks and opportunities also managed within the ERM system.\n\nA sustainability specialist focuses on regulatory and other risks (such as reputational or market), whereas physical risks related to climate change (e.g., increased probability of flooding, potential interruptions of the supply chain) are covered by regional and local representatives. In addition, the Sustainability expert in the ERM network collaborates with regional and local sustainability sta/ff to monitor and analyze corresponding developments.\n\nThrough its Sustainability, Climate Action, Social Impact and Diversity Committee, the Board of Directors oversees and discusses in detail the climate-related risks and opportunities previously identified in the Global Risk Agenda. These risks and opportunities are included in the Sustainability Risk & Opportunity Agenda.\n\nThe following is an example of how this process is applied to a transitional risk. One of the most important risks identified is the transition to a new carbon regulation or an update of an existing carbon regulation.\n\n- 1.  Risk Identification: Sustainability and ERM monitor the status of each country regarding carbon regulation. Di/fferent situations exist: some countries are already regulated, and the regulation could evolve in the short-term (e.g., European Union and California); in other countries, there is a short-term plan to implement a new carbon regulation (e.g., Mexico); and in some other countries, there is no short-term risk, but a medium or long-term is considered.\n- 2.  Risk Assessment: The financial impact of the transitional risk is evaluated in terms of CO2 and cost, and the goal is to minimize this impact.\n- 3.  Risk Discussion: Cemex launched Future in Action program to address climate action and has developed the cement site-by-site plan 'Cemex CO2 Roadmap', to identify and list all of the carbon reduction initiatives specific for each site regardless of carbon regulation in place. The plan has to be tracked, and the resources ensured for full implementation.",

Risk Mitigation: After the implementation of all the identified initiatives, the financial impact can be significantly reduced by close to 20% and we achieved a 33% reduction in CO2 emissions vs our 1990 baseline.\n\nThe following is an example of how the described process is applied to a physical risk, which is the increase of extreme storm events that can disrupt the supply of crucial inputs.\n\n- 1.  Risk Identification: Increased frequency and strength of tropical storms and hurricanes can cause a disruption in supply to our operations. The ERM function selects those operations with a higher probability of an extreme event happening, based mainly on historical events derived from climate change patterns.\n- 2.  Risk Assessment: The physical risk is evaluated to identify all potential impacts that could limit Cemex from achieving strategic objectives.\n- 3.  Risk Discussion: To manage the risk, the ERM function takes a structured and homogeneous global approach by requesting a Business Continuity & Crisis Management (BC&CM) to minimize the potential impact of a disruptive event in our businesses. Under the scope of the BC&CM, a business recovery plan is implemented in each identified site, and it enables the continuity and recovery of operations. ERM develops recovery strategies for PREPSI (People, Resources, Equipment, Premises, Suppliers, and Information). The loss of PREPSI is considered in two stages: operational continuity (by temporarily continuing to provide the goods or services agreed with our customers) and a return to business as usual (recovering business back to normal levels of operation).\n- 4.  Risk Mitigation: The result of the implementation of BC&CMP is the reduction of the impact of an extreme event, as we decrease the recovery time of the a/ffected operation by, for instance, increasing the supplies inventories or identifying a backup supply.\n\n## Risk and Opportunity Management Process at Cemex\n\nOur risk and opportunity management process is an ongoing systematic approach present in corporate, regions, countries, and operational business units. It is a proactive, preventive, and corrective approach to address all potential risks and identify opportunities. There is coordination with the Sustainability function and the climate action strategy of the company.\n\nOur risk management process adheres to international best practices from the Risk Management Society (RIMS) and Business Continuity Institute (BCI) and is compliant with ISO 31000:2018-Risk management standards and ISO 22300:2018-Business continuity management systems.\n\n## Risk & Opportunities Management Process\n\n## Identification\n\nFollowing a bottom-up and a top-down strategy, we employ risk interviews, online risk surveys, risk workshops, and external experts' insights, among other techniques, to identify strategic and operational events that could impact Cemex in the short, medium, or long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assessment\n\nRisks and opportunities are evaluated and prioritized employing qualitative and quantitative methods to determine their potential impact and likelihood of materialization in a specific timeframe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Treatment\n\nWe define a risk owner as responsible for the risk treatment, and ERM representatives follow up on risk treatment actions, in some cases acting as coordinators of ad-hoc task forces focused to mitigate specific risks or capitalize on identified opportunities.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nWe constantly monitor the business environment in which we operate to e/ffectively report risks and opportunities to decision-makers.\n\n## Reporting\n\nMain risks and opportunities are integrated into the enterprise risk and opportunity agenda, which is discussed by senior management at global, regional, and country levels. Relevant changes in the status of identified risks, opportunities and treatment measures are promptly communicated to decision makers through several reports.\n\nRisk Oversight at Board and Executive Committee\n\n- For more information on Cemex's Risk Management Process, please refer to pages 107-109 in our 2023 Integrated Report.",

A means for nonU.S.-based corporations to list their ordinary equity on an American stock exchange. Denominated in U.S. dollars, they confer full rights of ownership to the corporation's underlying shares, which are held on deposit by a custodian bank in the company's home country or territory. In relation to Cemex, Citibank, N.A. is the depositary of Cemex's ADSs and each ADS represents 10 CPOs. The Cemex ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nEBITDA. Means Operating EBITDA: Operating earnings before other expenses, net plus depreciation and operating amortization.\n\nFree cash flow. Cemex defines it as Operating EBITDA minus net interest expense, maintenance and expansion capital expenditures, change in working capital, taxes paid, and other cash items (net other expenses less proceeds from the disposal of obsolete and/or substantially depleted operating fixed assets that are no longer in operation and coupon payments on our perpetual notes).\n\nIFRS. International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nMaintenance capital expenditures. Investments incurred with the purpose of ensuring the company's operational continuity. These include capital expenditures on projects required to replace obsolete assets or maintain current operational levels, and mandatory capital expenditures, which are projects required to comply with governmental regulations or company policies.\n\nNet debt. Total debt (debt plus financial leases) minus cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOrdinary Participation Certificates (CPOs). Issued under the terms of a CPO Trust Agreement governed by Mexican law and represent two of Cemex's series A\n\nshares and one of Cemex's series B shares. This instrument is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange.\n\npp. Percentage points.\n\nPrices. All reference to pricing initiatives, price increases or decreases, refer to our prices for our products\n\nSales: When referring to reportable segment sales, revenues are presented before eliminations of intragroup transactions. When referring to Consolidated Sales, these represent the total revenues of the company as reported in the financial statements.\n\nSG&A expenses. Selling and administrative expenses.\n\nStrategic capital expenditures. Investments incurred to increase the company's profitability. These include capital expenditures on projects designed to increase profitability by expanding capacity, and margin improvement capital expenditures, which are projects designed to increase profitability by reducing costs.\n\nTotal debt plus other financial obligations. Cemex defines it as current and non-current debt plus liabilities secured with account receivables and leases. It is not a GAAP measure.\n\nWorking capital equals operating accounts receivable (including other current assets received as payment in kind) plus historical inventories minus operating accounts payable.\n\n## Industry\n\nAggregates. are inert granular materials, such as stone, sand, and gravel, which are obtained from land-based sources (mainly quarries) or by dredging marine deposits. They give ready-mix concrete its necessary volume and add to its overall strength. Under normal circumstances, one cubic meter of fresh concrete contains two metric tons of gravel and sand.\n\nBlended cement Blended types of cement (or blended cements) are composed of a reduced amount of clinker blended with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that have the same strength, resilience, and durability performance as traditional cement and the subsequently produced concrete.\n\nClinker is an intermediate cement product made by sintering limestone, clay, and iron oxide in a kiln at around 1,450 degrees Celsius. One metric ton of clinker is used to make approximately 1.1 metric tons of gray Portland cement.\n\nFly ash is a combustion residue from power plants that can be used as a non-clinker cementitious material.\n\nGray Portland cement is a hydraulic binding agent with a composition by weight of at least 95% clinker and up to 5% of minor component (usually calcium sulfate). Blended Portland cement has lower clinker factor, usually below 90% which results in lower carbon emissions. Both traditional and blended Portland cement, when mixed with aggregates and water, produces concrete or mortar.\n\nInstalled capacity is the theoretical annual production capacity of a plant; whereas e/ffective capacity is a plant's actual optimal annual production capacity, which can be 10-20% less than installed capacity.\n\nMetric ton is the equivalent of 1.102 short tons.\n\nPetroleum coke (pet coke) is a byproduct of the oil refining process that can be incorporated into the cement production process as fuel, in substitution of fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal.\n\nPozzolana is a fine, sandy volcanic ash.\n\nReady-mix concrete is a mixture of cement, aggregates, and water.\n\nSlag is the byproduct of smelting ore to purify metals.",

We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the 'safe harbor' provisions for forward-looking statements within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, these statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as 'will,' 'may,' 'assume,' 'might,' 'should,' 'could,' 'continue,' 'would,' 'can,' 'consider,' 'anticipate,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'envision,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'foresee,' 'predict,' 'potential,' 'target,' 'strategy,' 'intend,' 'aimed' or other forward-looking words. These forward-looking statements reflect, as of the date such forward-looking statements are made, unless otherwise indicated, Cemex's expectations and projections about future events based on Cemex's knowledge of present facts and circumstances, and assumptions about future events. These forward-looking statements and information are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including but not limited to statements related to Cemex's plans, objectives, and expectations (financial or otherwise). Although Cemex believes that its expectations are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct, and actual results may vary materially from historical results or results anticipated by forward-looking statements due to various factors. Some of the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors that could cause results to di/ffer, or that otherwise could have an impact on us or our consolidated entities include those discussed in Cemex's most recent annual report and those detailed from time to time in Cemex's\n\nother filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), which factors are incorporated herein by reference. Such factors also include, but are not limited to:\n\n- l changes in Mexico's or other countries', in which we operate, general economic, political and social conditions, including new governments, elections, changes in inflation, interest and foreign exchange rates, employment levels, population growth, consumer confidence and the liquidity of the financial and capital markets;\n- l the cyclical activity of the construction sector and reduced construction activity in our end markets;\n- l our exposure to sectors that impact our and our clients' businesses, particularly those operating in the commercial and residential construction sectors, and the infrastructure and energy sectors;\n- l volatility in pension plan asset values and liabilities, which may require cash contributions to the pension plans;\n- l changes in spending levels for residential and commercial construction;\n- l the availability of short-term credit lines or working capital facilities, which can assist us in connection with market cycles;\n- l any impact of not maintaining investment grade debt rating on our cost of capital and on the cost of the products and services we purchase;\n- l availability of raw materials and related fluctuating prices of raw materials, as well as of goods and services in general, in particular increases in prices as a result of inflation;\n- l our ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and maintain favorable relationships with third parties who supply us with equipment and essential suppliers;\n- l competition in the markets in which we o/ffer our products and services;\n- l the impact of environmental cleanup costs and other remedial actions, and other liabilities relating to existing and/or divested businesses;\n- l our ability to secure and permit aggregates reserves in strategically located areas;\n- l the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure;\n- l changes in our e/ffective tax rate;\n- l our ability to comply and implement technologies that aim to reduce CO2 emissions in jurisdictions with carbon regulations in place;\n- l the legal and regulatory environment, including environmental, energy, tax, antitrust, human rights and labor welfare, acquisition-related rules and regulations;\n- l the e/ffects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and financial conditions;",

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from historical results, performance, or achievements and/or results, performance or achievements expressly or implicitly anticipated by the\n\nforward-looking statements, or otherwise could have an impact on us or our consolidated entities. Forwardlooking statements should not be considered guarantees of future performance, nor the results or developments are indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Actual results of Cemex's operations and the development of market conditions in which Cemex operates, or other circumstances or assumptions suggested by such statements may di/ffer materially from those described in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained herein. Any or all of Cemex's forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate and the factors identified above are not exhaustive. Accordingly, undue reliance on forward-looking statements should not be placed, as such forward-looking statements speak only as of the dates in which they are made. You should read this report and carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may a/ffect our business and operations. The information contained in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and is subject to change without notice, and except to the extent legally required, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements in this report, whether to reflect any change in our expectations regarding those forward-looking statements, any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, or otherwise. You should review future reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores). This report also includes statistical data, including, but not limited to, data regarding the production, distribution, marketing, and sale of cement, ready-mix concrete, clinker, aggregates, and Urbanization Solutions. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to pricing initiatives, price increases or decreases refer to Cemex's prices for its products. We generated some of this data internally, and some were obtained from independent industry publications and reports that we believe to be reliable sources that were available as of the date of this report. We have not independently verified this data nor sought the consent of any organizations to refer to their reports in this report.\n\nThis report includes certain non-IFRS financial measures that di/ffer from financial information presented by Cemex in accordance with IFRS in its financial statements and reports containing financial information. The\n\naforementioned non-IFRS financial measures include 'Operating EBITDA (operating earnings before other expenses, net plus depreciation and amortization)' and 'Operating EBITDA Margin'. The closest IFRS financial measure to Operating EBITDA is 'Operating earnings before other expenses, net', as Operating EBITDA adds depreciation and amortization to the IFRS financial measure. Our Operating EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing our Operating EBITDA for the period by our revenues as reported in our financial statements. We believe there is no close IFRS financial measure to compare Operating EBITDA Margin. These non-IFRS financial measures are designed to complement and should not be considered superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Although Operating EBITDA and Operating EBITDA Margin are not measures of operating performance, an alternative to cash flows or a measure of financial position under IFRS, Operating EBITDA is the financial measure used by Cemex's management to review operating performance and profitability, for decision-making purposes and to allocate resources. Moreover, our Operating EBITDA is a measure used by Cemex's creditors to review our ability to internally fund capital expenditures, service or incur debt and comply with financial covenants under our financing agreements. Furthermore, Cemex's management regularly reviews our Operating EBITDA Margin by reportable segment and on a consolidated basis as a measure of performance and profitability. These non-IFRS financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Non-IFRS financial measures presented in this report are being provided for informative purposes only and shall not be construed as investment, financial, or other advice.\n\n## Important Notice\n\nCaution about environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability related data, metrics, and methodologies .\n\nThe information in this report includes non-financial metrics, estimates or other information that are subject to significant measurement uncertainties, which may include the methodology, collection and verification of data, various estimates and assumptions, and/or underlying data that is obtained from third parties, some of which cannot be independently verified.",

There is a risk that these judgments, estimates or assumptions may subsequently prove to be incorrect and/ or may need to be restated or changed.\n\nSustainability reporting is not yet subject to the same globally recognized or accepted reporting or accounting principles and rules as traditional financial reporting. Accordingly, there is a lack of commonly accepted reporting practices for us to follow or align to and ESG measures between organizations in our industry may be non-comparable.\n\nIn addition, the maturity of underlying data, systems and controls that support non-financial reporting is generally considerably less sophisticated than the systems and internal controls for financial reporting and it also includes manual processes. This may result in non-comparable information between organizations and between reporting periods within organizations as methodologies develop. The further development of accounting and/or reporting standards could materially impact the performance metrics, data points and targets contained in this report and the reader may therefore not be able to compare performance metrics, data points or targets from one reporting period to another, on a direct like-for-like basis.\n\nWe plan to continue to enhance our methodology and processes to improve the robustness of our ESG reporting over time.\n\n## Caution about the lack of definitions or standards.\n\nThere is currently no single globally recognized or accepted, consistent and comparable set of definitions or standards (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor widespread cross-market consensus (a) as to what constitutes, a 'green', 'social' or 'sustainable' or having equivalent-labelled activity, product or asset; or (b) as to what precise attributes are required for a particular activity, product or asset to be defined as 'green', 'social' or 'sustainable' or such other equivalent label; or (c) as to climate and sustainable activities and their classification and reporting.\n\nTherefore, there is little certainty, and no assurance or representation is given that such activities and / or reporting of those activities will meet any present or future expectations or requirements for describing or classifying our activities as 'green', 'social' or 'sustainable' or attributing similar labels.\n\nWe expect policies, regulatory requirements, standards, and definitions to be developed and continuously evolve over time.\n\n## Caution about forward-looking ESG or sustainability statements in this report.\n\nCertain sections in this report contain ESG or sustainability related forward-looking statements, such as aims, ambitions, estimates, forecasts, plans, projections and targets and other metrics, including but not limited to:\n\nclimate and emissions, Business and Human Rights (BHR), corporate governance, R&D and partnerships, development of products and services that intend to address sustainability-related concerns and sustainability related targets/ ambitions when finalized.\n\nThere are many significant uncertainties, assumptions, judgements, opinions, estimates, forecasts and statements made of future expectations underlying these forward-looking statements which could cause actual results, performance, outcomes or events to di/ffer materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: (a) the extent and pace of climate change, including the timing and manifestation of physical and transition risks, (b) the macroeconomic environment; (c) uncertainty around future climate-related policy, including the timely implementation and integration of adequate government policies; (d) the e/ffectiveness of actions of governments, legislators, regulators, businesses, investors, customers and other stakeholders to mitigate the impact of climate and sustainability-related risks; (e) changes in customer behavior and demand, changes in the available technology for mitigation; (f) the roll-out of low carbon infrastructure; (g) the availability of accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent and comparable climate-related data; (h) lack of transparency and comparability of climate-related forward-looking methodologies; (i) variation in approaches and outcomes - variations in methodologies may lead to under or overestimates, and consequently\n\npresent exaggerated indication of climate-related risk;  and (j) reliance on assumptions and future uncertainty (calculations of forward-looking metrics are complex and require many methodological choices and assumptions).\n\nAccordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Furthermore, changing national and international standards, industry and scientific practices, regulatory requirements and market expectations regarding climate change, which remain under continuous development, are subject to di/fferent interpretations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that these standards, practices, requirements and expectations will not be interpreted di/fferently than our understanding when defining its sustainability related ambitions and targets or change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or e/ffort for us to achieve such ambitions and targets.\n\n## No o/ffer of securities or investment.\n\nThe information, statements and opinions contained in this report do not constitute a public o/ffer under any applicable legislation, an o/ffer to sell or solicitation of any o/ffer to buy any securities or financial instruments, or any advice or recommendation with respect to such securities or other financial instruments.
