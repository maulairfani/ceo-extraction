Imparting meaningful and consistent information builds trust and contributes to being a credible corporate citizen.\n\nOur Integrated Report is prepared following a groupwide structured content-gathering process led by the Sustainability and Reporting team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe robust integrated reporting process is continuous and underpinned by engaging with an extensive range of stakeholders to recognise what they consider as important and is part of our materiality assessment. This is complemented with benchmarking and the consideration of applicable reporting standards and frameworks we adhere to. Our process is further enhanced by ongoing risk and opportunity assessment, analysis of our operating context and determination of our material matters as outlined on page 39.\n\nThe relevant information is compiled and validated through our internal reporting and combined assurance model, reviewed and signed off by the Group Executive Committee (GEC) with ultimate approval by the Sasol Limited Board of Directors (Board).

The loss of one life is one too many. We undertake to ensure that all our employees and service providers return to their loved ones safely every day.\n\n## Resetting for resilience\n\nTo deliver Future Sasol, we need a robust foundation. This means we need to get the basics right. We appreciate the 'new world' in which we operate but know how our business needs to respond, thereby ensuring that as we transform, we will be resilient into the future.\n\n## Sustainably decarbonising for Future Sasol\n\nTo transition to Future Sasol, we must act collectively and decisively as our coal value chain is unsustainable and needs to be decarbonised. We will sustainably decarbonise by embracing suitable low-carbon alternatives as well as by implementing energy and process efficiencies.\n\n## Environmental stewardship\n\nIn pursuit of Future Sasol, our current business must operate within regulatory and policy frameworks and maintain our licence to operate. This will improve our investment attractiveness and our ability to pursue opportunities.\n\n## Strengthening relationships with stakeholders and regulators\n\nStrengthening relationships with all our stakeholders is an indispensable requirement to build credibility and trust. It is imperative that we say what we do and do what we say.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detail refer to our Material Matters on page 39\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GROUP TOP PRIORITIES\n\n## PURSUE ZERO HARM AND IMPROVE OUR CULTURE\n\n- \u00b7  Continue to strengthen our Values, culture and enhance our Employee Value Proposition\n- \u00b7  Promote diversity, equity, inclusion and a sense of belonging in the workplace\n- \u00b7  Deliver on our capability-building, inclusive of leadership development programmes\n- \u00b7  Strengthen stakeholder trust through continued delivery on community, regulatory and shareholder promises\n\n## ADVANCE SUSTAINABILITY\n\n- \u00b7  Deliver on our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction programme and environmental compliance commitments\n- \u00b7  Progress opportunities to enable sustainable growth by strengthening our innovation, technology, partnering and sustainability solutions\n\n## DELIVER AND MAXIMISE VALUE\n\n- \u00b7  Deliver Sasol 2.0 'Reset' commitments\n- \u00b7  Deliver coal deployment and quality remediation plans\n- \u00b7  Enhance operational and functional performance, efficiency and effectiveness\n- \u00b7  Maintain balance sheet flexibility, improve cash flow optimisation while driving selective growth\n- \u00b7  Continuously improve our service delivery and customer experience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Prioritised SDGs - aligning with our sustainability focus areas\n\n## Prioritised SDGs - aligning with our sustainability focus areas\n\nPrioritised SDGs - aligning with our sustainability focus areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

First, vertically - as we not only turn coal, oil and gas into refined fuels, but we also source a notable proportion of our coal and gas feedstock needs from our own mines and gas fields. Second, horizontally - in that we not only produce refined fuels, but also more specialised chemicals in multiple jurisdictions worldwide.\n\nWe are a customer-centric organisation, providing chemical and energy solutions based on our unique proprietary technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10",

By transforming the stocks of capital through our business activities, we are also able to deliver on our strategy and advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). While building and operating facilities to convert hydrocarbon feedstock into a range of high-value products, we seek to be inclusive, responsible and sustainable.

We operate in a complex environment and balancing demands of the various capitals is sometimes hindered by unpredictable changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PEOPLE\n\n## Our people focus is unwavering and we remain committed to continuous improvement and tackling areas of concern diligently.\n\n## DRIVER: Safety\n\nWe recorded two tragic workplace fatalities in the year. We have to maintain an uncompromising dedication to safety and we must keep safety at the centre of everyone's focus.\n\nSafety remains a priority in everything we do. We will continue to strengthen ways to foster a safe and caring workplace in pursuit of Zero Harm, review leading indicators and revise asset management practices to reduce risks. With fewer safety incidents, there are fewer worker stoppages, which supports improved productivity.\n\n## DRIVER: Care and wellbeing\n\nSince the pandemic, across the world there has been a marked deterioration in people's mental health. Amid sluggish economic growth and high interest rates and inflation, unemployment is on the rise and consumers are under pressure. This is taking an added toll on people's emotional, mental, physical and financial wellbeing.\n\nEnsuring people's physical, emotional, mental and financial wellbeing will remain important.\n\nThe health and wellbeing of all our people promotes prosperity. We will play our role in contributing to:\n\n- A workforce that is productive and stable.\n- Communities that promote social development.\n- Customers having predictable purchasing power.\n\n## DRIVER: Culture\n\nIn recent years we experienced the importance of organisational culture. We continue to transform our culture to establish a diverse and high-performing workforce that experiences equity, inclusion and a sense of belonging, as well as embracing innovation and collaboration.\n\nStrengthening the right Sasol culture - anchored in our Purpose, Values and Code of Conduct, with high levels of engagement will remain essential as we work to deliver on our strategy.\n\n## DRIVER: Accountability and performance\n\nTo build credibility and trust with our stakeholders we need to deliver on our People, Planet, Profit commitments. We all need to take personal responsibility to get things done and own our results.\n\n- Accountability and improved productivity will continue to be essential to our success.\n\n## DRIVER: Talent and skills attraction and retention\n\nIn many of our markets, specialist skills have become increasingly scarce. In South Africa, this has been exacerbated by a growing trend in emigration.\n\nRecognised as a key influence on all our material matters, we will continue to focus on attracting and retaining talent and the skills required to deliver on our reset and Future Sasol strategy including key engineering and technology skills. This will be supported by the delivery of our People Promise through a compelling Employee Value Proposition and competitive remuneration.\n\n## DRIVER: Caring and inspiring leaders\n\nIt is clear that caring and inspirational leaders motivate employees to act in a way that promotes growth and development - both for the organisation and personally. In 2021, we introduced a new operating model aimed at greater levels of agility, responsiveness, teamwork and collaboration.\n\nTo support addressing our material matters we will continue to develop caring and inspiring leaders who set the tone from the top as they act as role models for the Group's Values in creating our inclusive, innovative and high-performing work environment. Our 'Investing in the Sasol Leader of the Future' programme and revised Leadership Capability framework will guide our development actions. Deliberately bedding down the new operating model will help improve teamwork and collaboration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DRIVER: Flexible work practices\n\nSince the pandemic, the world of work has changed. More people work remotely, using digital tools to interact with their colleagues and other stakeholders. Hybrid work arrangements have been formalised.\n\nWe continue to engage our employees to ensure a great and flexible workplace.\n\n## DRIVER: Just transition\n\nThere have been real concerns among our workforce - especially those in Mining - of the future impact on their jobs as we transition to a low-carbon future. A 'just transition' refers to a shared value proposition comprising an inclusive transformation of our business, people and society, as we decarbonise and transition to a thriving Future Sasol.\n\nWe have established a Just Transition Office and the Centre for Shared Value Management which will play a key role in integrating and coordinating activities to support initiatives. A just transition roadmap was developed and approved by the Board in May 2023.\n\n## DRIVER: Human rights\n\nThe world's focus on the need to protect human rights has received greater consideration over the past years. However, there are still widespread abuses of human rights and these are aggravated by rising levels of poverty.\n\n- We have identified our salient human rights issues and will continue to stand against any injustices. At Sasol, we remain committed to being a catalyst for change and a force for good.",

Our approach and methodology is to identify, know and monitor our exposure on all material metrics with the aim of managing our impact, meeting our sustainability intentions and benefit from opportunities.\n\n## DRIVER: Transitioning to a circular economy\n\nThe world faces a series of interdependent environmental challenges that are defining and complex due to the linear consumption of resources. Current trends indicate a decrease in global circularity with the need for urgent action to bridge the circular economy gap.\n\nThe ultimate goal of circulating resources, materials and products is to enable renewable and optimal reuse.\n\nIn February 2022 the United Nations Environment Assembly adopted a resolution to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution (the Treaty). Global trends indicate that the demand for virgin polymers will remain robust driven by societal benefits combined with growth in population, urbanisation and the expansion of the global middle-class. We will continue to monitor developments and engage appropriately to foster multistakeholder participation in the development\n\nof the Treaty and support of its effective implementation. Through application, plastics have provided many sectors with the means to significantly improve the quality of life for communities globally while also making meaningful contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n## DRIVER: Climate change\n\nDecarbonisation: is a pressing ongoing challenge of our time. As an organisation with a significant greenhouse gas emissions profile, we are placing considerable efforts on reducing our emissions and transitioning to a sustainable Future Sasol.\n\nWe applied a science-based target setting approach and are implementing measures taking into account mitigation potential and our fair share responsibility.\n\nWe recognise that business has a key role to play in managing climate change risks, as well as realising opportunities that the energy transition could unlock.\n\nGeopolitics: The Russia/Ukraine war has disrupted the energy ecosystem and is impacting the pace and scale at which the energy transition is being undertaken.\n\nThe war will likely continue to impact the world's ability to meet committed Paris Agreement goals and push for efforts to limit temperature increase to 1,5 degrees.\n\nSupply  chain: The energy transition is being hampered, by supply chain disruptions slowing access to key components required in the energy transition. Renewable energy markets, for example, are experiencing high volatility because of fluctuations in the supply and cost of raw materials, as well as changes in regulations.\n\nDelays and price increases in United States virtual power purchase agreements due to global supply chain challenges are affecting renewable energy rollout.\n\nPrice of carbon: Several countries are implementing carbon pricing regulatory reforms through higher taxes, stringent emission trading schemes and border taxes to encourage decarbonisation.\n\nCarbon pricing continues to vary from region to region given the divergence in affordability and incentives. Carbon border adjustment taxes are signalling negative impacts for emerging economies still reliant on fossil fuels and could result in key sectors becoming uncompetitive sooner.\n\nTechnology: With the overall objective of achieving climate change goals, advancement in low-carbon technologies is progressing, albeit slower than anticipated.\n\nLow-carbon technology development requires greater application. Collaboration and partnerships are crucial for technology development and implementation. Accelerating mitigation solutions for hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation, steel and others is vital for achieving Paris climate goals.\n\nStakeholders'  expectations: Stakeholders' with competing mandates continued to advocate for science-based approaches, accelerated climate action, as well as a just and equitable transition.\n\n- We expect continued pressure from stakeholders to decarbonise in a responsible, swift manner while remaining cognisant of national circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs water supply is a finite resource, its scarcity continues to be an increasing problem globally. As a result of demand exceeding supply, exacerbated by unsatisfactory water use practices, inadequate infrastructure or institutions failing to balance everyone's needs, depletion persists. Impact of climate change is compounding the issue as water held in soil, snow and ice continued to diminish.\n\n- We have approved short-term targets as part of our contribution but it is acknowledged that an integrated, longer-term and inclusive approach must be taken to control this finite resource. We will play our role in catalysing a collaborative water stewardship approach - including managing and monitoring water risks, setting meaningful savings targets and improving usage disclosure.\n\n## DRIVER: Protecting biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on earth, including humans. Without a wide range of animals, plants and microorganisms, we cannot have healthy ecosystems. Without biodiversity, our entire support system for human, as well as animal life, would collapse. The threat to biodiversity persists.\n\nAppreciating the interconnectedness of climate change and biodiversity we have undertaken 'Biodiversity Footprint Assessments' at our Secunda and Sasolburg facilities with the objective of protecting, maintaining and enhancing established biodiversity.",

Domestic factors such as electricity curtailments caused by loadshedding, and fears that South Africa could lose access to the US African Growth and Opportunities Act also weighed on the currency.\n\nConsidering domestic and international risks, the currency is expected to remain volatile.\n\n## Average exchange rate (R/US$)\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost of our turnover is denominated in US dollars or significantly influenced by the rand/US dollar exchange rate. This turnover is derived from exports from South Africa, businesses outside of South Africa or sales in South Africa, which comprise mainly petroleum and chemical products based on global commodity and benchmark prices quoted in US dollars. Therefore, the average exchange rate significantly impacts our turnover and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).\n\nFor forecasting purposes, we estimate that a 10c change in the annual average rand/US dollar exchange rate will impact EBIT by approximately R630 million (US$35 million) in 2024. This excludes the effect of our hedging programme and is based on an average Brent crude oil price assumption of US$79/barrel.\n\n## DRIVER: Inflation\n\nFollowing very high levels of inflation in the first half of the 2023, inflation in most countries is easing.\n\nWe expect inflation to ease modestly, but it may take time before it falls within central bank targets.\n\n## DRIVER: Crude oil price\n\nFor forecasting purposes, a US$1/barrel change in the average annual crude oil price will impact EBIT by approximately R840 million (US$46 million) in 2024. This is based on an average rand/US dollar exchange rate assumption of R18,17.\n\nThe Brent crude oil price declined from an average of US$92/bbl in 2022 to $87/bbl in 2023 as muted economic conditions limited demand growth, while Russian oil exports remained resilient despite Western sanctions. Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cuts provided some price support. Disruptions to established product trade flows supported refining margins during 2023.\n\n- Continued OPEC supply management amid a sluggish world economy, increased non-OPEC supply and disruptive geopolitical events, could lead to large swings in the oil price.\n\n## Average Brent crude oil price (US$/bbl)\n\nSource: S&P Global\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n14\n\n## DRIVER: Chemicals price\n\nWeak demand, inflationary pressures and high energy costs in an over-supplied polyolefins market resulted in lower margins during 2023.\n\n- We expect commodity chemical margins to remain under pressure during 2024, with available supply likely to outpace demand growth.\n\n## DRIVER: Gas price\n\nAfter a spike in European gas prices due to the Russia/Ukraine war, prices eased on a milder-than-expected winter and sufficient inventories. The US gas market was well supplied on robust production, favourable weather and pipeline debottlenecking. The lower Henry Hub gas prices contributed to lower ethane prices.\n\n- Healthy storage levels are expected to keep prices low during the weak demand season. However, prices are expected to rise after that to ensure sufficient stock building for the northern hemisphere winter.\n\n## DRIVER: Coal price\n\nFollowing the 2022 price spike in the wake of the collapse of coal exports from Russia to Europe due to sanctions, global coal prices followed natural gas prices to below the level they were before the Russia/Ukraine war.\n\n- Coal prices will likely be supported in the first half of 2024 owing to demand strength, but increased supply could eventually lead to lower prices.",

It is for this reason we are giving increased attention to ensuring that we bring stability to the business by focusing on resetting our business for resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear stakeholders\n\nAcross the world, the past year was one of significant volatility. Apart from the devastating humanitarian toll, the Russia/Ukraine war contributed to stubborn inflation and high interest rates, subdued economic growth, and disruption to the energy ecosystem and the pace and scale of the energy transition. There is no doubt that the challenge of our time is to reshape the sector while maintaining the supply of affordable and sustainable energy to meet the needs of people, while safeguarding the planet from environmental degradation.\n\nIn addition to the impact of global developments on South Africa's economy, its weak performance was exacerbated by intensifying power shortages, deteriorating logistics, and political and socioeconomic upheaval.\n\nSasol was not immune to the impact of these challenges, many of which informed the material matters for our integrated reporting which were identified and approved in the year. In support of integrated thinking and integrated reporting, the Board considered these material matters, as each has the potential to affect our ability to create and preserve value over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detail on our Material Matters refer to page 39\n\nInternally, we recorded two tragic workplace fatalities, highlighting the critical necessity to keep safety at the centre of everyone's focus. In the aftermath of the pandemic, people's mental health deteriorated, aggravated by rising unemployment and increased poverty.\n\nInvestor sentiment towards South Africa worsened, hit by the country's recent grey listing by the Financial Action Task Force, the global intergovernmental body enabling the combatting of money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Investor sentiment was also affected by questions on the efficacy and prudence of South Africa's non-aligned stance on the Russia/Ukraine war. These factors accelerated capital outflows and put at risk a significant portion of export revenue from trading partners as a response to the decisions by the South African government.\n\n19\n\n## DIRECTORS' APPROVAL OF INTEGRATED REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough the perseverance and diligence of Team Sasol, a stronger platform has been shaped to deliver our Future Sasol ambitions.\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring the integrity of Sasol's integrated reporting. The Board gave attention to management's evaluation of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures. Other than the material weakness and other internal financial control deficiencies reported in the Form 20-F, we believe Sasol has designed such internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nNotwithstanding the deficiencies in internal financial control we confirm that the 2023 Integrated Report addresses all material issues and matters which affect the Group's ability to preserve and create value and fairly represents the Group's integrated performance. This report and its publication was approved on 31 August 2023.\n\nThe Board confirms that Sasol is in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 71 of 2008 relating to its incorporation and is operating in conformity with its Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI).\n\n## Board review and approval\n\nVuyo Kahla Executive Director\n\nManuel Cuambe Independent non-Executive Director\n\nMuriel Dube Independent non-Executive Director\n\n## Stanley Subramoney\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\nStephen Westwell\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\n## Katherine Harper\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\n## Beatrix Kennealy\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\n## Martina Fl\u00f6el\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\n## Andreas Schierenbeck\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\n## Nomgando Matyumza\n\nIndependent non-Executive Director\n\nMpho Nkeli Independent non-Executive Director\n\nSipho Nkosi Chairman of the Board\n\n## Fleetwood Grobler\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Hanr\u00e9 Rossouw\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n- Returning value to shareholders\n- Attracting investment",

These contributed to lower overall production, which impacted profitability for the year. Plans are in place to address these challenges.\n\nOur immediate priority in 2023 was therefore to reset our foundation and build a resilient company. We continued to do this by delivering on the Sasol 2.0 transformation programme, which will enable us to transition and ultimately reinvent the organisation to decarbonise and achieve our net zero ambition by 2050.\n\n## Ethical and effective leadership\n\nIn circumstances where we constantly observe a continued decline in ethical and moral leadership worldwide, the Board has remained committed to fostering an ethical and higher purpose focus within the Sasol Group. We commissioned an independent ethics assessment, the results of which will show the maturity of our ethics programme, as well as identify opportunities for improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detail on ethics refer to page 22\n\nWe strengthened our Board capabilities by appointing Andreas Schierenbeck as an Independent non-Executive Director effective 1 January 2023. We are confident that Andreas's appointment will bolster our decarbonisation efforts, and that Sasol will benefit from his experience of the green hydrogen value chain in particular.\n\nThe Board also oversaw changes to the Group Executive Committee, with Hanr\u00e9 Rossouw assuming the role of Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer on 1 July 2022 and Marius Brand retiring on 30 June 2023 as Executive Vice President for Sasol 2.0 Transformation programme. We thank Marius for his contribution to Sasol over many years and wish him well.\n\n## Delivering to society\n\nAt Sasol, we have always recognised the critical role, of social capital in our success, therefore we value our partnerships with customers, suppliers, business and research peers as well as our relationships with communities, governments, regulators and civil society.\n\nIn the year under review, we committed R857,3 million in social investment, compared with R743,3 million in 2022. Recognising that our\n\nDuring the year, the Board provided an active oversight role in supporting management in ensuring:\n\n- the safety of our people;\n- transforming our business for resilience;\n- managing our impact on the planet; and\n- strengthening relationships with stakeholders and regulators.\n\nstrength lies in our diversity; we made good progress towards our diversity and inclusion targets and maintained our level 3 B-BBEE contributor status.\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of maintaining our strong and established brand, which underpins our reputation. In contributing to Sasol becoming an investment priority, not just for our shareholders but also for our broader stakeholder community, we undertook a stakeholder perception survey. While we maintain a solid reputation of performance across most stakeholder groups, there are areas that require improvement. These learnings will become focus areas for the next year and beyond.\n\n## Appreciation and outlook\n\nAs we look ahead to Sasol's new financial year, there is no doubt that the world and South Africa face significant headwinds. Now is the time for us all to collaborate: to roll up our sleeves, deliver on our plans and contribute meaningfully. We will achieve our commitments with the right people and by leveraging partnerships.\n\nWe are confident that we are on the correct path and are encouraged by the endorsement of our shareholders at our December 2022 Annual General Meeting of our climate change management approach.\n\nI would like to acknowledge Sasol people everywhere for their determination and hard work to overcome the challenges of the past year. I would like to thank them for their diligence in ensuring that we deliver on our commitments ahead.\n\nSipho Nkosi\n\nChairman\n\n31 August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This, we envisage to deliver over three horizons where we will Reset, Transition and Reinvent our business. Over the past financial year we had several headwinds stalling our progress on resetting our business. For this reason, our internal focus will remain on activities relating to successfully resetting our business and enabling the successful execution of the last two horizons. We will undertake this within the framework of People, Planet and Profit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTRANSITION\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nCan you provide highlights of Sasol's safety performance for the year?\n\n- Safety remains close to the hearts of all at Sasol and is an area we will never stop working to improve, so that we eliminate workplace fatalities while striving towards Zero Harm.\n\nFor 18 months, between November 2021 and March 2023, we did not experience any workplace fatalities. Regrettably, this changed with the tragic passing of Mr Kgauta Mahlaba (Secunda Operations) and Mr Stiffi Ndlovu (Mining), in April and May 2023 respectively.\n\nThis is a stark reminder of remaining vigilant under all circumstances. We are however, experiencing a positive trend in other aspects of our safety performance. The high-severity incident (HSI) programme we implemented in 2017 and refined in 2020 had a positive impact with our HSI-severity rate decreasing from 16,00 to 9,96 and our HSIs decreased from seven to five when compared to the previous year.\n\nUnfortunately, our fires, explosions, and releases increased from 13 to 15, when compared to the previous year. However, our recordable case rate, remained flat for the period at 0,27.\n\n## FOCUS STORY // SAFETY\n\nAny loss of life or harm is unacceptable as safety is our top priority. We remain resolute in our commitment to creating a caring, sustainable and Zero Harm workplace.\n\nFocused efforts on our safety, health and environment (SHE) programme: The high-severity incident (HSI) programme, has resulted in an improvement in our HSI-severity rate in FY23. This programme remains the backbone for improving our SHE performance and we have now shifted our focus on further maturing this programme.\n\nEmbracing our Sasol 2.0 operating model, we have strengthened our collaboration efforts and are leveraging every opportunity to learn from each other and ensure that we are implementing best practices with regards to SHE.\n\nEmbedding fit-for-purpose leading indicators monitoring and reporting, anchored on the key elements of our HSI programme, as a predictive lever to manage our SHE risks, is paramount.\n\nWe continue to enforce our risk-based approach to managing our top SHE risks (Key Undesirable Events), while strengthening our combined SHE assurance processes.\n\nThrough our humanising safety initiative, focus remains on showing care through every layer of influence.\n\nWe remain committed to improving our safety performance and constantly adapting and streamlining our approach to align with evolving reporting requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREINVENT\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "ABOUT SASOL\n\n## PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT CONTINUED\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nWhat key interventions are you driving to improve safety?\n\n- Our goal is Zero Harm, and there are a few key areas to highlight in our journey.\n\nWe have made good progress in embedding our safety principles across operations, but we all recognise the critical need for ongoing, diligent focus on our HSI programme.\n\nTwo key imperatives being ingrained as part of operational discipline:\n\n- we always strive to carry out each task the right way every time; and\n- we always adhere to standards and procedures.\n\nOur people know these imperatives are vital to ensuring a safe workplace, and in doing so, we continue to promote humanising safety. We have for some time already shifted from leading safety through compliance, to leading safety with care. Demonstrating care is something we should all display, more especially our leaders. This is where it starts.\n\nThe ultimate aim with our humanising safety approach is for us to look beyond the statistics and focus on the person, his or her working environment, as well as the surrounding circumstances. This is being reinforced by a fair and accountable safety culture where consequences for transgressions are applied equitably, appropriately, and consistently across teams and the organisation.\n\nWe are actively embedding fit-for-purpose leading indicator monitoring and reporting, to further enhance our safety measures.\n\nSafety also remains a key component of our short-term incentives where financial penalties apply for missed targets.\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nIs the 'full potential' programme at your mining operations starting to deliver results?\n\n- Coal quality and productivity are among the key challenges we face in our South African value chain, and our 'full potential' programme has been designed to provide a sustainable improvement across all the collieries.\n\nFocus areas to improve productivity include prioritised training initiatives, improving the cutting time for each shift, and reducing equipment breakdown times. This will be assisted by onboarding peripheral support teams to make our efforts well-coordinated.\n\nThis programme is being rolled out in a phased approach at our Secunda collieries, with the roll-out at the first colliery nearing completion. The next roll-out will be at the Shondoni and Thubelisha collieries in the first half of FY24, where learnings from the previous roll-out will be implemented.\n\nWe have seen incremental improvements in productivity rates since the implementation of the programme, with a slight improvement between the third and fourth quarters of FY23. Our FY23 productivity was 3% lower than the prior year due to unplanned safety stoppages and operational challenges experienced in the earlier part of the year, but notable improvements have been seen in the second half of the year, which is in line with expectations.\n\nSupported by our external coal purchasing programme, we have also successfully maintained the coal stockpile within targeted levels, ensuring a stable supply of feedstock to the Secunda facility, while also improving coal quality through optimal blending.\n\n## FOCUS STORY // ETHICS\n\nAcross the world, ethical standards are slipping, people in positions of power openly and unapologetically behave in ways that infringe the rights of others or condone unethical or corrupt practices. This means that we as individuals are all likely to face - on a daily basis - unethical behaviour by others; conflicts of interest; questions around the appropriateness of extravagant gifts or entertainment; and tough ethical dilemmas.\n\nHow then does one ensure that Team Sasol lives up to its intention of always doing the right thing?\n\nSasol's Code of Conduct clearly sets out the Values to which we expect our employees to live. It is action-based, ensuring that in this complex world employees know what is expected of them on-site at our facilities and offices, as well as at home. The Code of Conduct provides details of how employees and other stakeholders can seek assistance with their day-to-day concerns, including where and how to register an ethics call to report behaviour that they consider to be unethical. This is complemented by annual awareness and training initiatives that further equip our employees to do what is right.\n\nOur Board of Directors sets the tone from the top: Sasol's leadership is committed to nurturing an ethical culture, one of inclusivity and support, where employees and stakeholders feel free to speak up without fear of victimisation or retaliation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a world where many have lost their moral compass, Sasol endeavours to ensure that we are an ethical company; that we not only do things right, but we do the right things.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur ethical culture informs the way we conduct ourselves both at an individual and Group level: how we treat each other, our customers and stakeholders; how we manage our impact on society; and how we manage our impact on the environment. It steers our Purpose of 'Innovating for a better world'.\n\nWe have commissioned an independent ethics risk and opportunity assessment across the Sasol Group. Currently underway, this is evaluating the maturity of our ethics programme as well as identifying opportunities to close any gaps. Through constantly improving our ethical processes, driving an ethical culture, and living the Sasol Values, we strive to ensure Sasol's success, as well as supporting a regeneration of ethics in the communities in which we work.\n\nI personally commit to abiding by the Sasol Code of Conduct and to holding myself accountable in terms of it. In their personal capacity, each member of the executive team and all Sasol employees also commits to the Code of Conduct, as we individually and collectively take responsibility for the impact of our actions globally.\n\nSR WWW For more detail refer to our Sustainability Report available on our website, www.sasol.com For the ethics line, see www.sasol.com/sustainability/ ethics/sasol-ethics",

        "page_content": "ABOUT SASOL\n\n## PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT CONTINUED\n\n## QUESTION:\n\n## SUPPORTING SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT\n\nIn June 2023 it was announced that the South African government and organised business agreed to urgently work together in partnership, with appropriate engagement and oversight structures, to remove obstacles to inclusive economic growth and job creation.\n\nThree immediate priority interventions agreed are:\n\n- \u00b7  energy;\n- \u00b7  transport and logistics; and\n- \u00b7  crime and corruption.\n\nSasol is one of two Business Sponsors for the 'energy' priority area where the focus is to support Eskom and the country's efforts to end loadshedding, with efforts being coordinated via the government-led National Energy Crisis Committee and the Energy Council of South Africa.\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nHow are you addressing the deterioration of coal quality over the longer term?\n\n- On coal quality, our understanding of the issues has evolved significantly over the past year because of the work we are doing, and we believe there is potential to turn this around with the right solutions implemented.\n\nWe are focusing on the several levers to address this over the short to medium term.\n\nFirstly, ensure that the right quality coal is targeted at the mining coalface to get the optimal blend as feedstock to the Secunda facility.\n\nSecondly, to improve coal blending by maintaining a high stockpile which minimises variation of quality of coal to the Secunda facility; and\n\nThirdly, we are actively progressing further technical work on the technology solution to reduce sinks in the coal. We aim to make a final investment decision during FY24.\n\nIn the longer term, to address the issues, we have a robust pipeline of studies and projects which are at different engineering stages and will provide more clarity when milestones are reached.\n\nWe are optimistic that by implementing the appropriate solutions and upholding our pledge to prioritise safety, there is potential to turn this around.\n\nIs Sasol still on track with its decarbonisation journey and broader sustainability efforts?\n\n- This year, we faced a range of challenges underscored by a volatile global economy that was aggravated by internal feedstock reliability and operational challenges. This contributed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, achieving an approximate 5% improvement equivalent to 3,5 Mt CO 2 e ton reduction off the 2017 baseline, albeit at a lower production volume. We have signed more renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), now totalling more than 600MW towards the 2030 target of 1 200MW. In support of the green hydrogen ambition in Sasolburg, we commissioned approximately 3MW solar photovoltaic renewable energy on the Sasolburg site for the project, enabling production of the first green hydrogen from the facility.\n\nWe have expanded our sustainability focus beyond just addressing climate change, and this shift has been yielding positive results.\n\nWe have already set and are actively working towards meeting our short-term water targets. Moreover, we have conducted biodiversity assessments at both Secunda and Sasolburg sites, which has allowed us to better understand and address our impact on the environment. As a result, our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings are steadily improving year-on-year.\n\n## ESG RATING\n\nS&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (Dow Jones Sustainability Indices)\n\nOur rating\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n54%\n\n62%\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges we face, our commitment to sustainability and proactive approach to addressing environmental concerns have positioned us on a path of continuous progress and improvement.\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nWhat is your view of what a just transition entails and what role does Sasol play in South Africa?\n\n- Our interpretation of a just transition is founded on a shared value approach that considers our business, our employees, and the economic landscape in which we operate. Sasol has looked to South Africa's Presidential Climate Change Commission for guidance on what a just transition entails, and we have also detailed our own definition taking our specific context into account.\n\nWe recognise the significant role Sasol plays not only in contributing to the country's gross domestic product, but also in providing direct and indirect employment to a substantial number of people. This awareness underscores the importance of our approach.\n\nTo ensure that our just transition is well-executed, we have established a Just Transition Office guided by a clear decision-making framework. The primary focus of this office is to facilitate engagement at various levels, allowing stakeholders to participate in the process and have their voices heard. By implementing this approach, we aim to navigate the transition in a fair and inclusive manner.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Decarbonising air transport through more sustainable ways to fly is of the utmost importance and has been called for worldwide by both the industry and regulators.\n\nThe Topsoe JV will focus on developing, building, owning, and operating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants, and marketing SAF. The fuels will be derived primarily from non-fossil feedstock, utilising green hydrogen, sustainable sources of carbon and/or biomass with a specific focus on Sasol's Fischer-Tropsch and Topsoe's related technologies.\n\nThis JV, still under consideration by the relevant competition authorities, will see us combine our unique technologies, capabilities and deep industry experience with Topsoe to lay the foundation to deliver SAF at scale.\n\nFor Sasol, the JV not only furthers our global SAF aspiration, but is also an important milestone in advancing our long-term strategy to achieve our net zero ambition by 2050.\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nHow has the Company performed financially?\n\n- Our financial results for the year are reflective of various mixed factors. We continue to face macro challenges with headwinds on demand and pricing, particularly in chemicals alongside persistent inflation with elevated feedstock and energy costs.\n\nWe are also encountering specific challenges in our operating environment, notably in South Africa where we have been impacted by the performance of state-owned enterprises. However, we have benefitted from an elevated oil price and a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate, and we have seen real progress in the mitigating actions that we have taken in many of the areas within our control. This is driving better performance in important areas like the Mining business, more resilience with the ability to reset to more aggressive targets on Sasol 2.0 following recent outperformance, and progress towards the longer term goals of Future Sasol.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIR For more detail on our financial performance refer to CFO's Statement on page 26\n\nMore broadly, the cost and operating challenges we have faced have required us to re-assess the steps we need to take to ensure Sasol remains a\n\nsustainably profitable organisation in the medium term. We are forging ahead with renewed vigour to reset and lay the groundwork to ensure this. Despite continued volatility over the period, the Board declared a final dividend of R10,00 per share, in line with our dividend policy.\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nHow do employees perceive Sasol's culture?\n\n- Our most recent employee survey reflected a participation response rate of 75%, a 7% improvement from 2019; with overall employee engagement at 74% favourability, reflecting an engaged, enabled, and energised workforce.\n\nOverall, the survey showed several significant improvements against past survey themes and focus areas. Notable improvements were reflected in areas such as living the Values, safety to speak up, goal clarity and employee optimism about Sasol's future and strategy.\n\nThe survey also highlighted areas for improvement including process and system efficiency, strengthening our Employee Value Proposition to allow our people to feel a stronger sense of belonging, recognition, work-life balance and opportunities to learn and grow. These learnings have been integrated into our culture journey plans for the businesses.\n\nBy acknowledging both our strengths and areas for growth, we remain committed to creating an even more fulfilling work environment for our employees and building a thriving workplace culture at Sasol.\n\nThe Reset of Sasol will only be successful with the efforts of Team Sasol.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuilding a thriving workplace culture with all our people having a sense of belonging and opportunities to learn and collaborate, will enable shared value creation.\n\n## QUESTION:\n\nWhat are the focus areas for the next year?\n\n- My mantra as Chief Executive Officer has been REALISM, FOCUS, and DELIVERY. We must be REALISTIC about our challenges and opportunities, FOCUS on what will take us forward, and DELIVER against targets and market promise. Applying these principles on a foundation of safety, compliance, operational discipline and care for our people will enable us to stabilise our foundation business through the Reset activities enabling the last two horizons of the Future Sasol strategy. This will be done through focusing and progressing the following focus areas:\n- Business performance improvement - coal quality and productivity stability improvement at Sasol Mining, maintaining volume recovery of our South African value chain and commercial ramp-up of the Lake Charles Chemicals Complex.\n- Ongoing delivery on transformation - Sasol 2.0 Reset targets, customer experience and service delivery.\n- Review and align targets and progress on GHG reduction targets, considering our means and a just transition roadmap.\n- The implementation of an integrated air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction solution is an imperative for us. This is dependent on SO 2 emissions from the boilers at the steam plants at our Secunda Operations being regulated on an alternative load-based emission limit from 1 April 2025 onwards.\n\nResetting our business through these focus areas will only be successful with the efforts of Team Sasol. We have navigated complex situations before and I have no doubt that through the commitment and hard work of Sasol's people, we will do so again.\n\nFleetwood Grobler\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n31 August 2023",

We faced various operational challenges as well as a volatile global landscape that impacted on macroeconomic conditions and market dynamics. Business performance was further affected by the underperformance of state-owned enterprises in South Africa, which constrained our supply chains and sales volumes and placed further pressure on our operations. However, our Sasol 2.0 transformation programme (Sasol 2.0) yielded positive results, countering the impacts of some of these challenges.\n\nIn the first half of the financial year, we benefitted from the rising oil price. In the second half, however, Sasol was negatively impacted by a 16% softening in the oil price which led to an overall decrease for the year of 5%. The impact of this was offset by a 17% weakening in the rand/US dollar exchange rate to an average of R17,77 for the year. Our commodity chemical prices decreased on poor demand. Polyethylene prices declined by 29% compared to the previous year. Lower ethane and energy prices in the latter part of the year contributed positively to margins in our Chemicals Business, however overall chemical margins and global demand remained depressed, negatively impacting this business, particularly in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn the second half, we made notable improvements in operational performance, underpinned by focused mitigation plans to address the production instabilities earlier in the year. We remain committed to improving the coal quality of our Mining business and restoring volumes at our Secunda Operations, as well as improving overall productivity at our operations.\n\nWe continue to engage with Transnet to address those hurdles that impact our ability to transport certain chemical products. The challenging macroeconomic environment affecting our Eurasia operations is expected to continue into the next financial year. While the net margin and demand remain constrained, we will continue to manage our production rates in response to the lower demand and to avoid a build-up in inventory.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER'S STATEMENT CONTINUED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MIXED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) decreased by 8% to R66,3 billion. Cash fixed costs of R68,8 billion were R6,7 billion (11%) up on the prior year. R6,3 billion (10%) of the increase in cost relates to inflation and exchange rates. Excluding inflation and exchange rates, costs increased by R0,4 billion (1%), led by higher labour cost, study costs and maintenance costs. The higher costs were offset by savings from Sasol 2.0 initiatives and the impact of business disposals in FY22.\n\nCash generated by operating activities increased by 15% compared to the prior year and was largely driven by a year-on-year decrease in working capital, the latter achieved through focused management intervention to conserve cash. We will continue to monitor working capital to ensure that it remains below or within our target of 15,5% to 16,5% on a 12-month rolling average basis.\n\nMaintaining the flexibility of the balance sheet to navigate the evolving global financial landscape remained a key focus. During FY23, we worked to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing a convertible bond of US$750 million in November 2022 and executing several debt refinancing transactions to address our 2024 maturities.\n\nOur liquidity headroom was R109,6 billion (US$5,8 billion) - well above our target of maintaining liquidity of more than US$1 billion.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, our total debt excluding leases increased to R124,3 billion from R105,1 billion. This was largely driven by the weaker rand/US dollar closing rate (R18,83 compared to R16,28 in FY22) which had an impact of increasing net debt by R16,2 billion. Our net debt (excluding leases) at 30 June 2023 was US$3,8 billion and remained unchanged from FY22, and included payments in FY23 of the FY22 final dividend and hedges that expired. Net debt to EBITDA increased to 1,3 times and gearing increased to 44,7%. Both were negatively impacted by the significantly weaker rand/US dollar closing rate. Gearing was also negatively impacted by the full impairment of our Secunda liquid fuels refinery cash generating unit (CGU).\n\nWe continue to protect the downside risk of the balance sheet, given that net debt has not reduced significantly since FY22. The hedging programme remains in place to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in the oil price and the rand/US dollar exchange rate. The hedging programme did well to manage our price risk during the 2023 financial year. We update it regularly to address changes in our commodity and currency exposure and will continue to reduce the hedge cover ratio as our balance sheet strengthens.\n\nMaintaining the flexibility of the balance sheet to navigate the evolving global financial landscape remained a key focus.\n\nDuring FY23, we worked to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing a convertible bond of US$750 million in November 2022 and executing several debt refinancing transactions to address our 2024 maturities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Turnover (Rand billion) and gross margin (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net debt (US$ billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net debt to shareholders' equity (%)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER'S STATEMENT CONTINUED\n\n## Sasol 2.0 transformation programme and Reset\n\nThe Sasol 2.0 transformation programme's objectives are to enable the business to be more competitive, cash generative and able to deliver attractive and sustainable returns even in a low oil price environment. The EBITDA contribution of our Sasol 2.0 transformation programme to date is R13,5 billion versus a target of R8,5 billion by FY23. This has given us some headroom to withstand the impact of the volatile economic landscape and higher inflation and was mainly achieved through the implementation and continuous assessment and refinement of the operating model as well as embedding market-driven strategies to improve customer experience and increase the profitability of our products.\n\nGiven the impact of the external operating environment, we acknowledge the need to intensify our efforts to remain resilient and profitable.\n\n## We therefore revise our Reset targets\n\nGross margin\n\nR8 billion - R10 billion\n\n(previously R6 billion - R8 billion)\n\nCash fixed cost\n\nR10 billion - R12 billion\n\nto be delivered by financial year 2025\n\n(previously R8 billion - R10 billion)\n\nThis amounts to an additional R4 billion in EBITDA\u00a0contribution by financial year 2025 as\u00a0Sasol\u00a02.0 Reset\n\nThe increased targets will require innovation and focused delivery. Our focus for Sasol 2.0 remains to bolster the strength and maturity of initiatives and we are confident that we will maintain momentum in achieving the targets for the coming financial years.\n\n## Continued refinement of emission reduction roadmap\n\nWe remain committed to the decarbonisation of our current assets and have made good progress in the further development of our 2030 greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction roadmap. For our Energy Business, we have selected a fine coal solution briquetting - as a potential key enabler for the main reduction lever of coal-fired boiler turndown resulting in more efficient use of our feedstock.\n\nWe have progressed our ambition to integrate 1 200MW of renewable energy into our operations by 2030 by signing more than 600MW of power purchase agreements which will progressively come online by 2026 or earlier. We have also narrowed down the options to reduce our steam demand and increase our waste heat recovery to produce more steam to close the steam gap resulting from the boiler turndown.\n\nRemeasurement items increased significantly in FY23 to a loss of R33,9 billion compared to a gain of R9,9 billion in the prior year. This is mainly due to the full impairment of the Secunda liquid fuels refinery cash generating unit (CGU) at year end. The main drivers resulting in the impairment were the higher weighted average cost of capital rate on the back of higher global interest rates and its associated impact on the cost of debt, higher feedstock cost assumptions and the revised production profile based on the updated emission reduction roadmap.\n\nMacroeconomic conditions have led to a sharp increase in liquid natural gas (LNG) commodity prices, and we therefore deem LNG unaffordable as a substitute for coal in our process. As a result, we have placed on hold the expenditure on additional gas reforming capacity and are exploring a number of technology and feedstock solutions to partially recover volume post FY30, estimated at 6,7mt/a (FY22: 7,5 mt/a). However, the maturity thereof needs to be progressed before it can be incorporated in the impairment evaluation of our Secunda liquid fuels refinery CGU, thus a full impairment of the CGU was recognised. Although the chemical CGUs in the Secunda complex were also negatively impacted, their respective recoverable amounts remained above carrying values given the products' higher derivative value.\n\n## Continued capital returns to shareholders\n\nWe remain committed to delivering sustainable shareholder returns and stepping up cash returns as we reach our net debt targets. In FY22, we reinstated dividends to shareholders and continued in FY23 with an interim dividend of R7,00 per ordinary share. We are pleased to declare a final dividend of R10,00 per ordinary share for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\nWe continue to look at further deleveraging the balance sheet in support of a sustainable dividend of between 2,8 to 2,5 times cover of core headline earnings per share.\n\n## DISCIPLINED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND LAUNCH OF SASOL VENTURES\n\nAt our Capital Markets Day in 2021, we communicated an updated capital allocation framework and governance structure to give clarity on our approach to optimising risk-weighted returns for the long term.\n\nWe remain on track to keep the level of capital spending to maintain and transform the business within a R26 billion - R32 billion per annum range (in FY23 real terms). At these levels, we continue to safeguard capital investment to ensure safe and reliable operations and meet our self-funded 2030 GHG reduction targets.\n\nThe capital required for our 30% GHG emission reduction is a cumulative R15 billion - R25 billion (in FY23 real terms) up to 2030 and is included in the R26 billion - R32 billion annual capital targets. There was very limited capital spend in this category in FY23. 'Transform' capital spend of R0,5 billion is planned for FY24, with peak transform capital spending forecast for FY26 to FY28. Discretionary cash flow generation will start to build steadily over the next few years as we further de-lever the balance sheet and realise the incremental benefits of Sasol 2.0.\n\nIn our second order of allocation, our approach to discretionary growth capital will revolve around prioritising delivery of competitive and sustainable quality earnings through long-term growth initiatives in collaboration with partners, such as through our proposed joint venture with Topsoe JV (subject to approval by relevant authorities), and other smaller high yield growth projects. A further capital efficient manner in which we will support the Transition and Reinvent horizons of our strategy is through Sasol Ventures, which we launched in February 2023. Sasol Ventures is aimed at investment in new and emerging technologies aligned to Sasol's sustainability journey. The activities of Sasol Ventures will complement and support the internal Research and Technology function, and we look forward to strong synergistic and strategic benefits from this integration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting\n\nWe are progressing with the evaluation of our ESG reporting framework in relation to the future requirements of various standard-setting bodies including the International Sustainability Standards Board and the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. In this way, we continue to drive compliance and the integration of sustainability in our reporting. We are required to commence reporting in this respect from the 2025 financial year end.",

These include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSasol Khanyisa was implemented on 1 June 2018. Sasol Khanyisa has been designed to comply with the revised B-BBEE legislation in South Africa and seeks to ensure ongoing and sustainable Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) ownership credentials for Sasol Limited.\n\nSasol Khanyisa contains a number of elements structured at both a Sasol Limited and at a subsidiary level, Sasol South Africa Limited (SSA) which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sasol Limited and houses the majority of the Group's South African operations. Sasol Khanyisa Tier 1 was concluded in 2021. At the end of 10 years, or earlier if the underlying funding has been settled, the participants in Khanyisa Tier 2, will exchange their SSA shareholding on a fair value-for-value basis for Sasol BEE ordinary shares to the extent that value was created during the transaction term.\n\nSasol BEE ordinary shares can only be traded between Black Persons on the Empowerment Segment of the JSE. This transaction will therefore ensure evergreen B-BBEE ownership credentials for Sasol Limited.\n\n## 20314567751890208 53fl08fi35%()\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Ixia Coal transaction, which became effective on 29 September 2010, is a B-BBEE transaction, in line with Sasol Mining's empowerment strategy and its commitment to comply with the objectives of legislation in South Africa.\n\nThe members of Ixia Coal, through WipCoal (Pty) Ltd and Sasol Mining Holdings (Pty) Ltd, subscribed to a 20% share in Sasol Mining. The members contributed in cash in their respective shareholding of 51% and 49% to Ixia Coal, while the balance of the contribution was funded through preference share debt. The transaction resulted in WipCoal effectively owning 10,2% of the equity in Sasol Mining.\n\nThe Tshwarisano B-BBEE transaction came into effect on 1 July 2006. In terms of the agreement, Tshwarisano LFB Investment (Pty) Limited (Tshwarisano), an independent third party which does not form part of the Sasol Group, acquired a 25% shareholding in Sasol Oil (Pty) Limited. Sasol provided considerable facilitation and support for Tshwarisano's financing requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the year was challenging, we remain positive that the progress we achieved in improving operations in the second half will extend and be further improved in the next financial year.\n\nOur capital allocation framework serves as the foundation for our investment decisions. This framework ensures a well-rounded strategy for addressing our capital requirements across competing priorities. We continue to prioritise our 'Maintain' capital to ensure we have stable and reliable operations well into the future. As we progress our emission reduction roadmap, our pathways are becoming increasingly defined. We continuously evaluate and enhance our 'Transform' capital spend towards our roadmap, ensuring that we make the most cost-effective decisions.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect the uncertain global economic environment to continue weighing on prices and demand in the short to medium term, with continued volatility in oil prices and weak margins for refined products and chemicals. We anticipate ongoing high inflation, which requires careful management of costs and capital strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUTLOOK FOR FY24\n\nENERGY BUSINESS MINING PRODUCTIVITY 975 - 1 100 t/cm/s ongoing full potential roll-out\n\nMOZAMBIQUE GAS PRODUCTION\n\n113 - 119 bscf NG investments delivering positive results\n\nSECUNDA OPERATIONS PRODUCTION 7,0 - 7,3 mt focused management interventions\n\n## LIQUID FUELS SALES\n\n- 51 - 54 mm bbl consistent fuels demand\n\n29\n\nOur strategic response is based on three pillars to navigate the challenging landscape and ensure our resilience.\n\n- Adaptability to market dynamics: Our ability to swiftly adjust our strategies and operations in response to changing market conditions is critical.

This involves progressing towards a sustainable future using our Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology, which may also entail closure of certain facilities. As a result, close collaboration and strong relationships with our stakeholders and regulators are critical.\n\nSasol ecoFT is one of our springboards to sustainability. Based on partnerships, it has the potential to be a strong technology platform for the future. We are also pursuing other opportunities and solutions to produce sustainable products and ultimately deliver a more sustainable future. This requires significant investment and is not without risk. The alternative is to meet our climate change commitments by closing down our FT facilities over time.\n\n## CAPITALS IMPACTED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MATERIAL MATTER: Environmental stewardship\n\nOur capital allocation priorities allow for maintenance capital that is specifically directed to ensure that our operations are safe and protect our licence to operate.

Lower demand, high feedstock and energy costs and increased competition as supply chain constraints eased post the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in the average sales basket price decreasing by 12% and lower overall unit margins compared to the prior year. Sales volumes were 4% lower than the prior year. After normalising for the European Wax disposal in the third quarter of 2022, sales volumes for 2022 were 1% lower, with lower Eurasia volumes offset by higher sales volumes in America and South Africa. EBIT for the Chemicals Business decreased by 51% to R15,9 billion, compared to the EBIT of R32,6 billion in the prior year.\n\nTurnover (Rm)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                        | 2023            | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Turnover (Rm)                                                          | 67 772          | 64 054        |\n| Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) (Rm)                           | 17 669          | 24 072        |\n| Total assets (Rm)                                                      | 64 912          | 60 901        |\n| Number of employees                                                    | 6 351           | 6 396         |\n| Turnover (Rm) (Loss)/earnings before interest and tax (LBIT/EBIT) (Rm) | 47 577  (1 188) | 55 011  7 552 |\n| Total assets (Rm)                                                      | 38 608          | 36 402        |\n| Number of employees                                                    | 2 865           | 2 808         |\n| Turnover (Rm)                                                          | 44 492          | 41 496        |\n| (Loss)/earnings before interest and tax (LBIT/EBIT) (Rm)               | (543)           | 981           |\n| Total assets (Rm)                                                      | 158 237  1 327  | 139 685       |\n| Number of employees                                                    |                 | 1 271         |\n\n## Sasol Energy performance summary\n\nThe Energy Business continued to benefit from higher oil prices, refining margins and a weaker exchange rate and per barrel oil prices and fuel differentials. This benefit was partly offset by significant challenges with coal quality and plant reliability issues during the first half of the year. We saw a notable improvement in operational reliability in the second half of the year and have progressed with the external coal purchasing programme to meet the coal demand for our Secunda Operations (SO). We also made available additional natural gas to SO which contributed to the higher production in the second half. An impairment of R35,3 billion was recognised on the Secunda liquid fuels refinery CGU. Accordingly, the Energy Business EBIT decreased by 96% to R1,9 billion compared to the prior year of R46,0 billion which included gains on the disposal of assets.\n\nTurnover (Rm)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate Centre\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|       |                                                          | 2023    | 2022     |\n|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| FUELS | Turnover (Rm)                                            | 116 235 | 97 996   |\n| FUELS | (Loss)/earnings before interest and tax (LBIT/EBIT) (Rm) | (7 128) | 27 959   |\n| FUELS | Total assets (Rm)                                        | 39 098  | 56 418   |\n| FUELS | Number of employees                                      | 4 611   | 4 610    |\n|       | Turnover (Rm)                                            | 7 234   | 7 789    |\n|       | Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) (Rm)             | 6 432   | 14 622   |\n|       | Total assets (Rm)                                        | 23 090  | 18 330   |\n|       | Number of employees                                      | 612     | 513      |\n|       | Turnover (Rm)                                            | 6 386   | 6 370    |\n|       | Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) (Rm)             | 2 580   | 3 456    |\n|       | Number of employees                                      | 8 768   | 8 520    |\n|       |                                                          | 2023    | 2022     |\n|       |                                                          | 3 698   | (17 225) |\n|       | Earnings/(loss) before interest and tax (EBIT/LBIT)*     |         |          |\n|       | Total assets (Rm)                                        | 53 335  | 43 356   |\n|       | Number of employees                                      | 4 539   | 4 512    |\n\n- *   LBIT for the prior year mainly as a result of losses on the valuation of financial instruments and derivative contracts",

We are keenly aware that the process of becoming sustainable will not be overnight and will require additional effort .\n\nAt grassroots level in our communities we have environmental programmes dealing with education, street clean-up, waste collections and recycling in Govan Mbeki and Metsimaholo Local Municipalities. In so doing we have reached 3 769 households through house-to-house education and awareness. In the same vein, we have educated and raised awareness about waste management, water conservation, air quality, biodiversity and sustainable food system at five schools in eMbalenhle, Secunda and Lebohang.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions\n\nApproximately\n\n5%\n\noff 2017 baseline\n\nFor combined Sasol Energy and Sasol Chemicals baseline and largely due to lower production and operational issues\n\nElectricity from renewable sources\n\n## 342 000 gigajoules\n\nEnergy efficiency improvement\n\n## 13,4% for Sasol Group\n\noff 2005 baseline\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                      | 2023      | 2022      | Level of Assurance   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Planet                                                               |           |           |                      |\n| Total GHG CO2 equivalents (kilotons)                                 | 64 392    | 63 891    | Reasonable           |\n| Direct CO2 scope 1 (CO2 equivalents)  (kilotons)                     | 58 644    | 57 284    |                      |\n| Indirect CO2 scope 2 (kilotons)                                      | 5 748     | 6 607     | Reasonable           |\n| GHG CO2 equivalent scope 3 (kilotons)*                               | 36 664    | 37 557    |                      |\n| GHG intensity (CO2 equivalents/ton  product meant for external sale) | 4,12      | 3,86      | Reasonable           |\n| Total energy use (thousand gigajoules) \u2020                             | 384 669   | 380 475   | Reasonable           |\n| Total material use (kilotons)                                        | 26 662,57 | 27 774,50 | Reasonable           |\n| Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) (kilotons)                                   | 122,04    | 118,70    | Reasonable           |\n| Sulphur oxides (SO x ) (kilotons)                                    | 166,9     | 132 562   | Reasonable           |\n| Total water use (thousand cubic metres)                              | 114 122   | 104 589   | Limited              |\n| Water recycled (thousand cubic metres)                               | 100 810   | 169 965   | Limited              |\n| Total hazardous waste (kilotons)                                     | 277       | 255       | Limited              |\n| Total non-hazardous waste (kilotons)                                 | 207       | 223       | Limited              |\n| Recycled waste (kilotons)                                            | 139       | 131       | Limited              |\n\n- * Limited assurance on four of the scope 3 categories\n- \u2020 Baseline for energy efficiency is 2005\n\n## OUR LAND AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES\n\nIn carrying out our commitment to responsible use, preventing pollution and exercising a duty of care in respect of managing land and biodiversity in the areas we operate, we have in partnership with the Endangered Wildlife Trust, undertaken biodiversity footprint assessments at both our Secunda and Sasolburg facilities. While we are still in the process of analysing the results, it will provide good insights into what could be done to maintain or enhance biodiversity.\n\n49\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n49\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POSITION\n\n- \u00b7  Support the Paris Agreement and contribute to SDG 13.\n- \u00b7  Accept the mainstream climate science assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for net zero carbon dioxide emissions to be reached by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Acknowledge that business has a role to play in managing the risks of climate change, as well as realising opportunities in the transition to unlock societal value.\n- \u00b7  Recognise the importance of enabling a just and equitable transition that is appropriately paced and timed for the context within which we operate.\n- \u00b7  Recognise the importance of adaptation and resilience in a changing climate.\n\nIn line with this position, we are on a path to progressively reduce our emissions and improve performance.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\n\nWe follow a standardised approach to classifying, reporting and investigating environmental incidents.\n\nThe approach is a four-tier classification system\n\nLevel 1 (major)\n\nLevel 2 (significant)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLevel 3 (moderate)\n\nLevel 4 (minor)\n\nWhere applicable, incidents are reported to the relevant authorities in accordance with applicable statutory and licensing requirements. Incidents are investigated in accordance with the SHE Incident Management Procedure to identify the root cause which informs the necessary corrective and preventative measures to be adopted to mitigate against reoccurrence. We have not experienced major environmental incidents in the last six years.\n\n## WATER TARGETS FOR SASOL ENERGY BUSINESS\n\nAs we are committed to responsible use of natural resources such as water we are actively monitoring the achievement of the targets set. We rely heavily on water for our processes and consider it a precious resource.\n\n## WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nWe are focused on our landfill avoidance drive of hazardous waste. At Sasol Ekandustria Operations this was increased to 48% from 29%, compared to the previous year. Similarly, Secunda Operations diverted 40% from landfill, which is in line with the previous year's performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCCR SR WWW For more detail on our Planet refer to our Sustainability Report and Climate Change Report available on our website, www.sasol.com",

Asset impairments in 2023 amounted to R33,6 billion, including:\n\n- \u00b7  The full impairment of the South African wax CGU of R0,9 billion and the Essential Care Chemicals CGU in Sasol China of R0,9 billion, and the full reversal of impairment recognised in 2019 on the Tetramerisation CGU in Lake Charles of R3,6 billion; and\n- \u00b7  The Secunda liquid fuels refinery CGU impairment of R8,1 billion at 31 December 2022 after being negatively impacted by an update in macroeconomic price assumptions. An additional impairment of R27,2 billion was recognised for this CGU resulting in it now being fully impaired. Sasol continues to advance implementation of its emission reduction roadmap (ERR) in South Africa to achieve a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and comply with the requirements of the Air Quality Act. The ERR involves the turning down of boilers, implementing energy efficiency projects, reducing coal usage and integrating 1 200MW of renewable energy into our operations by 2030. With no significant additional gas to restore volumes back to historic levels, the ERR assumes lower production volumes post 2030 and also results in increased cost of coal and capital expenditure.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets increased by R6,5 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to our US Operations which saw an increase as a result of the weakening rand/US dollar exchange rate and tax loss carry-forwards. The deferred tax liability in South Africa decreased as a result of the Secunda liquid fuel refinery impairment.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nThe year-on-year decrease in trade and other receivables is mainly due to lower sales volumes and prices in June 2023 compared to June 2022, the receipt of a dividend from ORYX GTL Limited included in the 2022 receivable and the R2,6 billion Sasol Oil slate balance receivable in 2022 while it is a payable in the current year.\n\n## Long-term debt\n\nOur total debt was R124,3 billion compared to R105,1 billion at 30 June 2022, with approximately R120,5 billion (US$6,4 billion) denominated in US dollar. The weaker closing rand/US dollar exchange rate had a R16 billion impact on the debt balance. At 30 June 2023, gearing was 44,7% (30 June 2022: 41,8%).\n\n## Short-term debt\n\nShort-term debt includes the US$1,5 billion bond which is repayable in March 2024.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to the accrual in 2022 for crude oil derivatives that settled out of the money.\n\n## Short-term financial liabilities\n\nShort-term financial liabilities decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to Sasol reverting to the use of put options for crude oil, replacing crude oil zero cost collars, for which the balance at the end of June 2022 was R6,2 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Derivative instruments relate to our foreign currency exposure, crude oil hedging instruments, ethane swaps and the embedded derivatives in the long-term oxygen supply contracts with Air Liquide, as well as our convertible bond embedded derivative.\n\n## Remeasurement items\n\nRemeasurement items affecting operating profit includes net impairments of R33,6 billion. Refer to property, plant and equipment under the statement of financial position for detail of the impairments.\n\n## Earnings before interest and tax\n\nEarnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of R21,5 billion decreased by 65% compared to the prior year, driven by the inflationary impact on costs, the softening of the Brent crude oil price and refining margins in the latter part of the year. Chemicals basket prices were on a declining trend during 2023, and while we have seen some respite in lower feedstock and energy prices, gross margin and global demand remained depressed particularly in our American and Eurasian operations. In addition, EBIT was influenced by the remeasurement items mentioned above, while the remeasurement items in 2022 consisted mainly of profit on disposal of businesses of R8,5 billion.\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nFinance income increased with 121% mainly due to higher external cash balances and increased interest rates on fixed and overnight deposits.\n\nFinance costs increased with 34% due to higher global interest rates to counter inflation and the weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur effective corporate tax rate increased from 25,0% at 30 June 2022 to 35,7% at 30 June 2023. The increase was mainly as a result of the effect of the full impairment of the South African wax cash generating unit (CGU) of R0,9 billion, impairment of the Essential Care Chemicals CGU in Sasol China of R0,9 billion, reversal of impairment processed in 2019 on the Tetramerisation CGU in Lake Charles of R3,6 billion; as well as the full impairment of R35,3 billion of the Secunda liquid fuels refinery CGU, on our profit before tax. The adjusted effective tax rate, excluding equity accounted investments and remeasurements items, is 30,9% compared to 31,1% in the prior year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The inaugural paper to the value of R2,2 billion under the previous DMTN programme was repaid in August 2022 and the US$1 billion bond was repaid in November 2022. In April 2023 Sasol Financing International Limited and Sasol Financing USA LLC obtained a revolving credit facility (RCF) of US$1 987 million and a term loan of US$982 million respectively. The previous RCF and term loan were repaid. In May 2023, Sasol launched and priced a US$1 billion (R18,8 billion) bond, with a fixed interest rate of 8,75%, due in 2029.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nOur net cash on hand position increased from R43 billion as at 30 June 2022 to R54 billion mainly attributable to cash generated from operations and loans raised. This was partially negated by capital expenditure, loans repaid and dividends declared and paid.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first half of the year was particularly challenging, but we are encouraged by second half improvements in areas within our control, particularly in operational excellence and cash management.\n\nThe global external environment featured an economic slowdown, decreasing consumer tolerance for inflationary prices resulting in reduced demand, increased energy and feedstock prices, and lingering supply chain difficulties. Although overall demand and supply chain constraints began to improve in the last few months of the fiscal year, prices, unit margins and demand remained below historical levels.\n\nInternally, we also experienced operational issues in the United States and South Africa that impacted our ability to supply products to customers. These also improved in the last few months of the year.\n\nWhile the year was difficult, the value we have unlocked progressing our Sasol 2.0 initiatives has made us a more resilient business able to withstand volatile times and better positioned to deliver value to all of our stakeholders over the long term.\n\nBrad Griffith // Executive Vice President: Chemicals Business\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market demand in Eurasia however remained weak.\n\nThe average sales basket price was 4% higher than FY22 reflecting the higher energy costs in Europe because of the Russia/Ukraine war. Energy prices have subsequently decreased but remain volatile and above pre-conflict levels. Overall margins and associated profitability remained under pressure due to weak demand.\n\n## Safety\n\nSasol Chemicals had a solid safety performance, with all our lagging indicators improving and below targets, except for the fires, explosions and releases severity rate which ended slightly above target. We also implemented technology to enable reporting, risk assessment and incident management. The tracking of leading indicators and combined assurances has provided valuable insights to identify and fix potential issues early.\n\n## Operating context CHEMICALS AFRICA\n\nOur Southern Africa operations, hosted by Sasol Energy, remained the largest contributor to our profitability.\n\nSales volumes were 1% higher than previous year. This despite a planned total East factory shutdown at Secunda site compared to only a phase shutdown last year. The absence of the force majeure declaration on the export of certain chemical products following the flooding in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during the last quarter of FY22 further contributed to increased sales volumes although second quarter sales were negatively impacted by strike action at Transnet, South Africa's state-owned port and rail operator.\n\nWhile supply chain challenges eased in the latter part of the year, they remain a risk to our business, and close collaboration with Transnet continues. The average US$ sales basket price was 10% lower than FY22. This is largely attributable to lower polymer and solvents prices resulting from lower oil prices, weaker global demand, and associated inventory reduction by customers.\n\n## CHEMICALS AMERICA\n\nBoth operational and financial performance improved in the second half of the year after a very tough first half when record low margins led to a reduction in ethylene and derivative production rates and associated Base Chemicals' sales volumes. In addition, Essential Care Chemicals' volumes were negatively impacted by planned turnarounds as well as the impact of the fire that occurred at the Ziegler alcohol unit at the Lake Charles Chemicals Complex in October 2022 which led to a force majeure declaration on alcohols and derivatives.\n\nDuring the second half of the year the force majeure declaration on alcohols and derivatives was lifted after all sections of the Ziegler alcohol unit started up while ethylene and derivative margins improved allowing production rates to be increased and resulted in monthly production records being set across several units at our Lake Charles Chemicals Complex. The improved margins and production performance saw an improvement in overall profitability although still below levels seen in FY22.\n\nDespite tough conditions total sales volumes were 9% higher than FY22 mainly due to the planned ethylene cracker turnaround and improved production performance from the comonomers unit. The average sales basket price was 16% lower than FY22 due to the lower ethylene and derivative prices.\n\n## CHEMICALS EURASIA\n\nSales volumes within our Eurasia segment were 29% lower than FY22, partly due to the absence of wax volumes within our Performance Solutions division following the disposal of the European Wax business at the end of February 2022. After normalising for the wax transaction, sales volumes decreased by 19% compared to FY22 due to reduced demand and customer destocking across most of our business divisions, while competition increased as supply chain constraints eased post the pandemic. Production rates at several of our units were adjusted proactively in response to this lower demand and to avoid inventory build.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecause of the soft market and higher cost of capital experienced across our industry, we see future-proofing Sasol Chemicals by driving continuous improvement and efficiency as a key FY24 priority. While delivering on our Sasol 2.0 commitments, we have unlocked significant value, enhancing our operations and making our business more marketand customer-oriented.\n\nSasol Chemicals is led by an experienced team that has successfully managed through both up and down cycles in our business. Our focus on safety, operational excellence, capital discipline, cost management, customer service and continuous improvement will help ensure that we can deliver results regardless of the cycle and be ready to grow smartly when market conditions improve and opportunities present themselves.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "ABOUT SASOL\n\nFighting fires - while protecting the environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SASOL CHEMICALS AT A GLANCE // CONTINUED\n\nWith an approach centred on partnership - coupled with innovation derived from our talented employees, unique chemistry and proprietary technology - Sasol Chemicals solves our customers' biggest challenges and turns problems into opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Changing how the world flies\n\nSasol Chemicals is developing optimised catalysts to enable the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs).\n\nThe aviation industry accounts for about 3% of all human-made emissions. By 2050, emissions from air transportation are expected to grow to around 3,1 billion tons of CO 2 annually. Unlike other forms of transportation, however, commercial aviation, with its long-distance flights, cannot rely on electric power as a significant energy source.\n\nThat is why Sasol Chemicals - together with five German and South African partners is participating in a consortium known as CARE-O-SENE, collaborating to develop optimised catalysts to use in making green kerosene that can transform the aviation industry.\n\nAs a global leader in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts with more than 70 years of related expertise, Sasol Chemicals is ideally positioned to enable CARE-O-SENE to achieve its goal of significantly increasing the process yield of green kerosene by as much as 80% - producing more fuel with\n\nthe same resource input. The development of novel FT catalysts will be instrumental in converting green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into commercial-scale synthetic fuels such as SAFs.\n\nIn addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, SAFs derived from the FT-production process also lower harmful nitrogen oxides, soot and condensation trails from the jet engine combustion process, which also contribute to global warming. Importantly, the move to synthetic SAFs will require only minimal changes to the aviation industry's infrastructure.\n\nTransforming the fuel that airlines use every day to keep the world moving will require teamwork and innovation. Along with our partners in CARE-O-SENE, Sasol researchers and scientists in Brunsb\u00fcttel, Germany, and Sasolburg, South Africa, are working to make that goal a reality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROGRESSING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE SASOL\n\nThe traditional foam products firefighters use against industrial fires save lives and property. But these foams contain toxic, fluorinated surfactants that remain in the environment long after the fire has been extinguished - in fact, forever.\n\nNow, thanks to an innovative fluorine-free formulation developed by Sasol Chemicals' research and development team in Lake Charles, Louisiana, fire departments across the United States may soon be able to switch to a more sustainable and effective product.\n\nIn response to new rules phasing out older types of foam, Sasol's team developed a new product in less than 12 months, combining both nonionic and anionic surfactants to create a foam of equal quality and volume as the old fluorine-based options, without the lasting, harmful impacts to the environment. We collaborated with a major\n\ncustomer to demonstrate the product's effectiveness in a field test and the foam was pilot-tested by a fire department in California.\n\nFire protection foam is a new market for us and an example of how working together with customers to find innovative solutions to today's challenges can deliver benefits far beyond the bottom line.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market-based solutions for enhanced sustainability\n\nInnovation that enables customers to operate more sustainably is a key driver at Sasol Chemicals.\n\nFor example, Fischer-Tropsch waxes created by our Polymer Additives group are helping producers of building/construction products, automotive parts and packaging achieve faster production rates at lower temperatures, resulting in more sustainable operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPolyvinyl chloride, commonly known as PVC, is a key component of many building materials, including piping for potable water transport, vinyl siding and windows, and wiring and cable. Using SASOLWAX as a processing agent enables PVC manufacturers to improve production rates by 10% to 25% and reduce the amount of energy used in manufacturing. In addition, polyolefin manufacturers can lower processing temperatures by 20 to 40 degrees Celsius, depending on the end product, reducing energy usage.\n\nWe are now collaborating with customers on PVC-O, a new form of polyvinyl chloride that uses 50% less material to manufacture while being stronger, more flexible and easier to install and maintain than traditional PVC. PVC-O outperforms all piping materials for the delivery of potable water, and SASOLWAX B-52 is a key processing agent in the manufacture of this next-generation product.",

        "page_content": "ABOUT SASOL\n\n## SASOL ENERGY AT A GLANCE // Leading the energy transition in Southern Africa CONTINUED\n\n## STRATEGIC FOCUS\n\nSafety is a top priority for Sasol Energy. We are focusing on strengthening process safety in our operating facilities, embedding leading indicators in the business and promoting personal safety across the organisation. We believe that Zero Harm is possible.\n\nSince 2020, we have taken several steps to reset and position Sasol Energy for long-term success. This includes resizing the portfolio through the divestment of non-core assets; delivering on Sasol 2.0; growing the mobility and commercial businesses which will position us to extend our market leadership by 2030; and building key capabilities.\n\nThe success of this business is dependent on Mining. Our focus in FY24 therefore remains on improving the quality of coal from Mining. We are far advanced with a technological solution which will reduce the amount of sinks in existing coal supply. We aim to make a final investment decision later this calendar year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to Sasol Mining feature, page 61\n\nTo remain competitive, we are considering investing in a hybrid refinery at Natref that will bring the first hybrid fuel to the country and comply with Clean Fuels 2 at a low capital investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to Natref feature, page 60\n\nOur focus on the break-even cost at Secunda Operations (SO) remains undimmed and we are investigating options to improve our cost position.\n\n## OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE YEAR AHEAD REFLECT:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn immediate focus is on safe and reliable operations\n\nA reset of our business to maximise profitability in existing operations by increasing production volumes, unlocking cash through operational and commercial excellence and driving a lower cash break even\n\nAdvancing our decarbonisation ambition to 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% , integrating 1 200MW of renewable energy and low-carbon feedstocks into our operations and progressing our green hydrogen projects at a more measured pace\n\nBuilding a culture of diversity, inclusivity and belonging with a One Sasol mindset\n\n## Overview\n\nThe first half of the year was extremely challenging, marked by a combination of coal feedstock, plant reliability and regulatory challenges. We implemented a number of interventions and allocated our best resources to address the issues. As such, we are encouraged by the significant improvement across the business in the second half, particularly operational excellence, gas production, cost containment and cash management. We have exceeded our production, working capital and sales volume forecasts guided to the market across most areas. Our focus on customer centricity remains paramount as we transform the business to low-carbon solutions.\n\nThe global economic landscape remains volatile, including fluctuating oil and petrochemical prices, an unstable product demand environment and inflationary pressure. In South Africa, the underperformance of state-owned enterprises, loadshedding and socio-economic challenges continue to impact volumes, margins and resultant profitability. Despite this, we were able to increase our sales volumes to the higher yielding margin channels through our Sasol Rewards loyalty programme and improved customer convenience offerings.\n\n## Energy landscape\n\nEnergy markets are fundamentally shifting towards low-carbon and are impacted by ongoing supply chain challenges and geopolitical tensions. Crude oil prices and refining margins have declined from the highs of 2022 amid an easing of supply uncertainty. In South Africa, supply dynamics have fundamentally shifted with the shutdown of the South African Petroleum Refineries (SAPREF) and Engen Oil Refinery (ENREF), while energy demand has been impacted by frequent loadshedding.\n\nDiesel demand has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, driven by power demand and increased use of road freight transport due to constraints in rail logistics. Petrol demand remains weak, with a shift towards work-from-home, high prices and the improved efficiency in technology. The outlook for petrol is not encouraging as sales of smaller and more fuel-efficient passenger cars are likely to continue, exacerbated by hybrid and electric vehicles in the latter part of the decade. Electric vehicles will not require petrol but rather electricity from charging units. A significant part of our product slate is petrol, we are assessing various technological options to mitigate the risk of an oversupply of petrol to the country.\n\nThe global energy transition is gaining momentum with several partnerships announced. Gas is seen to be a transitionary feedstock and as such we continue with exploration and drilling activities in Mozambique to ensure a sustainable gas supply to external customers and our own operations.\n\n## Challenging legal and regulatory issues\n\nThe regulatory and legal landscape is very challenging particularly relating to the uncertainty on the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) Maximum Gas Price (MGP) regulation. Despite the impact of rising inflation, higher capital costs and commodity prices, we have charged R68,60/GJ for two years. Sasol submitted FY23 and FY24 MGP applications to NERSA, both of which were published for public comment. We await NERSA's approval of the MGP for both applications.\n\nOn 11 July 2023, the Competition Commission referred to the Competition Tribunal complaints regarding excessive pricing from certain Sasol Gas customers. Sasol launched review proceedings, currently before the Competition Appeal Court so that the Court may consider NERSA's jurisdiction to regulate  gas prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs communicated, Sasol's application in terms of Clause 12A of the Minimum Emission Standards (MES) for alternative emission load basis for sulphur dioxide from the SO boilers has recently been declined by the National Air Quality Officer (NAQO). Sasol appealed the decision to the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment and submitted its appeal to the Appeals Directorate on 31 July 2023 as provided for in Section 43(1) of the National Environmental Management Act, 107 of 1998.\n\n## Decarbonising and developing low-carbon energy solutions\n\nIn 2023, we made significant progress on the execution of our 2030 greenhouse gas roadmap. Notably, we signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) to procure renewables of more than 600MW for delivery in 2026 or earlier. We are also investing US$1 billion over the next few years in Mozambique to ensure a stable supply of gas to South Africa while also progressing with several energy efficiency projects.\n\nWe are shaping the development of South Africa's green hydrogen ecosystem, which includes applications in fuel cell hydrogen mobility studies to reigniting the steel industry and creating a global sustainable aviation hub at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. The re-purposing of existing assets presents opportunities to fulfil the growing demand for sustainable products.\n\nThe prefeasibility study on the Boegoebaai green hydrogen project in the Northern Cape Province has advanced and nearing completion as we await certainty on the port development from Transnet. An update on the port was provided by Transnet in July 2023, however further details are required before the prefeasibility study can be concluded. There has been good momentum by the South African government to develop a green hydrogen economy for South Africa and we are supporting this through various studies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to green hydrogen export - Boegoebaai feature, page 60",

        "page_content": "ABOUT SASOL\n\n## SASOL ENERGY AT A GLANCE // Leading the energy transition in Southern Africa CONTINUED\n\n## RESET ACTIVITIES //\n\n## Safety\n\nWe are relentless in our commitment to pursuing Zero Harm as an operational reality.\n\nRegrettably, we lost two colleagues in work-related incidents - one at Sasol Mining, one at Secunda Operations (SO).\n\n## Secunda Operations volume improvement plan\n\nOver the past 24 months, our production volumes at SO have been significantly impacted by the erratic quality and availability of coal as well as by issues of plant reliability. We implemented comprehensive plans to restore plant stability and have seen a significant improvement since January 2023. To increase productivity, we implemented a 'full potential' plan at Mining which - along with additional gas supply into the facility - enabled improved production volumes at SO.\n\n## Advancing Mozambique gas production\n\nWe made good progress at our operations in Mozambique where gas production is coming off its plateau in 2028. The drilling campaign was executed safely amid dire weather, including Cyclone Freddy. The team completed five new wells, bringing the total well count to 24. To ensure security of supply to South Africa, the drilling campaign will continue and\n\nwe will extend drilling to other areas adjacent to the existing fields. Our exploration also resulted in a positive gas discovery in PT5-C, which is in southern Mozambique with closer integration to our existing facility.\n\n## Delivery of Sasol 2.0\n\nCOST MANAGEMENT - We made progress in delivering on our Sasol 2.0 targets by focusing on efficiency, digitalisation and by challenging external spend through dedicated programmes using agile principles and global category benchmarks. We embedded Sasol 2.0 as a way of working and are on track to deliver on the FY25 full ambition target.\n\nGROSS MARGIN - We made very good progress in identifying opportunities that increase volumes and margins. These include a review of the product slate from SO as well as improving the operational performance of the production assets. We will continue our efforts and capture higher margins through improved customer offerings and improved yields, efficiencies and throughput.\n\nCAPITAL - Our Southern Africa business is capital intensive and in the year we continued to invest in statutory maintenance, a full shutdown at SO, compliance activities and advancing the drilling programme in Mozambique. As such, our capital spend was slightly higher than in prior years.\n\n## Performance\n\nOur EBITDA for the year of R43,1 billion is 2% higher than the prior year due to higher rand oil prices and product crack spreads. This benefit was partly offset by internal challenges that we faced in the first half of the year. We have responded to this difficult environment with decisive actions, unwinding inventories, sourcing additional gas to compensate for poor coal quality and implementing volume recovery plans. Accordingly, the improvement in our performance in the second half of the year was significant. We have seen a notable improvement in operational reliability and have progressed with the external coal purchasing programme to supplement Mining's production and meet the coal demand for our Secunda Operations (SO).\n\nSecunda Operation's production increased by 14% in the second half and we exceeded the volume targets communicated in December 2022. The volume recovery plan and demonstrated performance over the past six months confirms our ability to run complex plants efficiently and reliably consistent with our historical performance. This recovery gives us a clear path forward to consistently run our operations at maximum rates. Coal quality however remains a key variable and focus area.\n\nIn the year, the business recorded an impairment of R35,3 billion relating to the liquid fuels component of the Secunda refinery. The implementation of the emission reduction roadmap (ERR) to achieve a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and comply with the requirements of the Air Quality Act results in lower production volumes post 2030 and as such an impairment was recognised on the liquid fuels component of the Secunda complex. Further, the increasing cost of coal, capital investment to implement the ERR and cost of compliance was included in the impairment calculation. Optimisation of the ERR is ongoing and there are a number of technology and feedstock solutions underway to partially recover volume post 2030 however, the maturity thereof needs to be progressed before it can be incorporated in the impairment calculation. The chemical assets in the Secunda complex however remain resilient given the higher margin yielding products that are produced.\n\nIn our upstream gas operations in Mozambique, we delivered a strong production performance achieving the upper end of our market guidance range of 111 - 114 bscf. Production was 2% higher than the prior year, underpinned by additional wells being brought online. Construction on the gas supply infrastructure of the PSA project was completed, and we await third party verification to confirm volume estimates before beneficial operation is achieved. We have invested US$530 million in Mozambique in our plateau extension projects, securing future gas supply to South Africa. More recently we had a discovery in PT5-C in Mozambique close to our operations. This was the first discovery for Sasol since 2008. Natural gas and methane-rich gas sales volumes in South Africa were 3% and 1% lower respectively when compared to the prior year due to lower customer demand largely associated with loadshedding.\n\nIn marketing and sales, we continued to progress our work to place molecules in the highest yielding margin portfolios. Liquid fuels sales volumes for the year was 53,7 million barrels, which is within our market guidance range of 52 - 55 million barrels and 2% lower than previous year. The improved performance in the second half of this year was underpinned by the implementation of our approach to shift volumes to higher margin portfolios in mobility and commercial, and supported by improved customer convenience offerings and marketing\n\ninitiatives, in turn supported by higher production at SO. We continued to invest in enhancing customer offerings, scaling of the loyalty programme and driving the use of digitalisation.\n\nThe changing liquid fuels landscape - marked by a decline in demand for petrol and the rapid increase of new entrants into the market - continues to pose a risk to our inland refineries.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have demonstrated that our asset base in South Africa is strong and can deliver maximum proven volumes with the optimum coal quality. Our asset reliability issues have improved and the run-rates over the past six months demonstrated that the plants are capable of running at historically high production rates.\n\nHowever, we need to focus on fixing the coal quality and have made good progress with a technology solution on which we anticipate taking a final investment decision by the end of calendar 2023. We see the 'Reset' as a critical priority for FY24 to build resilience in the business. While delivering on our Sasol 2.0 commitments, we have unlocked significant value by enhancing our operations and making our business more market and customer oriented.\n\nWe have a highly experienced technical, commercial and marketing team who can navigate through the challenges associated with coal quality, free cash flow generation, legal and regulatory matters and progressing the emission reduction roadmap with technical solutions that are affordable. We see the potential in this business and are excited by the opportunity to reinvent and provide sustainable energy solutions to the country.\n\nOur focus in FY24 on safety, operational excellence, capital discipline, cost management, customer service and continuous improvement will help ensure that we can deliver results and be ready to grow smartly when market conditions improve and opportunities present themselves.",

        "page_content": "## SASOL ENERGY AT A GLANCE // CONTINUED\n\n## Progressing Sasol's renewable energy programme\n\nRenewable energy is a key lever for reducing Sasol's GHG emissions and moving towards producing products in a more sustainable manner in Southern Africa. In our effort to decarbonise our operations, we aim to procure up to approximately 1 200MW of renewable energy by 2030.\n\nIn January 2023, we signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for 69MW of wind-powered renewable power to our Sasolburg Operations. Financial close was achieved in March 2023. This is key to achieving the scaled production of green hydrogen from renewable energy sources at Sasolburg complex, progressing our ambition of a green hydrogen economy in Southern Africa.\n\nAs part of the decarbonisation of Sasol's South African value chain, Sasol and Air Liquide jointly signed PPAs for more than 600MW of renewable energy comprising of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind with deployment expected from 2025.\n\n## Natref hybrid refinery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatref is a joint venture between Sasol (64%) and TotalEnergies (36%). Our share out of the refinery is approximately 3 billion litres of fuels and related product s per annum. This refinery uses crude oil to produce liquid fuels. In response to the tighter Clean Fuel specifications (CF2) and high carbon intensity of the product, we are considering investing to convert the refinery to a hybrid (crude and biofuels) green facility. This provides an e-fuel solution for the country and will aid in reducing emissions while at the same time complying with CF2. Our customers, particularly in the mining sector, are demanding a low-carbon intensity fuel and this hybrid solution could address expectations. The initial investment was estimated to be R9 - 11 billion to meet the CF2 compliance requirements however, through innovation and technology, we are advancing with a low-carbon solution.\n\n## Green hydrogen export - Boegoebaai\n\nThe Boegoebaai Green Hydrogen Hub is part of South Africa's national Green Hydrogen programme to produce low-cost green hydrogen for the export market. Situated in the Northern Cape, the project is well-located for accessing export markets through a new deepwater port (to be developed by privatesector partners under a process initiated by Transnet in 2022) to serve the green hydrogen and mining industries. In 2021, Sasol signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Northern Cape provincial government to lead a prefeasibility study exploring the potential for the region to serve as an export hub for green hydrogen derivatives. It is expected that, initially, Boegoebaai exports will focus on green ammonia (a rapidly expanding global market as a wide range of value chains need to move away from the grey equivalent). The prefeasibility study on the Boegoebaai green hydrogen project has advanced and is nearing completion as we await certainty on the port development from Transnet. Sasol is supporting the Northern Cape government's masterplan to develop the region as a green hydrogen industrial cluster.\n\n## PROGRESSING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE SASOL\n\n## Sasolburg green hydrogen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are working to decarbonise and repurpose Sasolburg complex's grey assets to produce green hydrogen and derivatives. This entails producing first-to-market green hydrogen at scale to stimulate local demand and catalyse local industry value chains (including fuel cells).\n\n## We have three focus areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npilots and demonstrations;\n\ngreen hydrogen mobility; and\n\nstudies to repurposing Sasolburg Operations.\n\nWe produced the first green hydrogen from our Sasolburg assets in June 2023 by converting an existing chlor-alkali electrolyser, powered by greenfield renewable energy, to produce green hydrogen.\n\nFurther, while construction of the 69MW renewable energy wind farm (via the PPA) is under way, the team designed and implemented our own solar PV plant on site to be able to produce green hydrogen in June 2023. This demonstrates the innovation and skill of our people and ability to consider building our own solar PV renewables.\n\n## Focusing on customer experience to grow our mobility channel\n\nOur focus is to change the Sasol forecourt from a typical fuel station to an omni-channel customer experience. As customer demands are changing, we too need to innovate and offer our customers a differentiated service that focuses on convenience, loyalty to enable cash back with the customer and strategic partnerships where customers can benefit.\n\n## Sasol Rewards\n\nThe Sasol Rewards programme ended the year with 1,3 million registered customers. Since April 2022 launch, our customers earned points valued at R219 million.\n\n## Best forecourt and convenience stores\n\nSasol was awarded Best Convenience Store and Best Forecourt in the Petrol Station Industry category at the Ask Afrika Orange Index \u00ae 2022/23 Awards.\n\nThe Pantry by Marble was named Best Forecourt Store in the recent Best of Joburg Readers' Choice Awards to honour how Sasol and The Pantry have revolutionised the fuel-stop shopping experience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "ABOUT SASOL\n\n## SASOL ENERGY AT A GLANCE // Sasol Mining\n\nTo support the stability and resilience of our South African value chain, we will continue with initiatives to improve the performance of our Mining operations. We aim for the continuous supply of suitable coal so that Secunda Operations (SO) can achieve its production targets.\n\nMaintaining a healthy stockpile level and improving coal quality through operational controls and external coal purchases are key.\n\n## RESET ACTIVITIES //\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety remains our indisputable priority. After the tragic fatalities that occurred in the past few years, we are making good progress in implementing our safety remediation programme and addressing findings from high-severity incidents. The programme includes technical and cultural interventions, with a focus on humanising safety through a bottom-up employee engagement approach.\n\nWe are seeing a positive impact of the culture change towards high care and high standards with more employees taking ownership at the coalface and speaking up on safety issues. We are encouraged by the positive trend.\n\n## Long-term coal deployment\n\nWe are evaluating various alternatives to address coal supply when the Thungela coal sales agreement for Isibonelo Colliery comes to an end in June 2025. A decision on the best option will be taken during FY24.\n\nThe planned reduction in coal usage from 2030 has been incorporated into our long-term mining complex deployment and coal sourcing plans and production from existing mines is aligned with the long-term coal demand profile.\n\n## 'Full potential' programme\n\nTo improve productivity we implemented the first phase of our 'full potential' programme\n\n## PROGRESSING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE SASOL\n\nMining productivity in the year declined due to unplanned safety and operational stoppages in the first half. In the second half, productivity and coal quality delivered to SO improved, albeit at a slower pace than planned.\n\nNevertheless the coal stockpile remained above our target throughout the year, which supported consistency in coal blending and supply to SO. In the last quarter, the stockpile increased to end the year at 2,0 mt.\n\nTo supplement volumes from our Secunda collieries and improve overall coal quality, we increased external coal purchases by 9% compared to 2022. Export sales were lower mainly because of logistical challenges and the diversion of export coal to SO.\n\nat Syferfontein Colliery from January 2023, noting incremental improvements in productivity and the quality of the coal delivered. The programme's objective is to improve productivity and realise the potential of our mines and focus on optimising and embedding safe production processes, capability upliftment and prioritising basic mining process skills.\n\nThe initiative was prompted by a range of factors influencing productivity in the broader South African coal mining industry. These include coal resource depletion; mining progressing into geologically challenging areas; improved safety standards requiring a significant increase in roof support; and shortages in underground coal mining skills. We are on track with the phased roll-out. Implementation at our four remaining Secunda collieries will commence in the first half of the new financial year and is planned to be completed by the end of June 2024. In the meantime, we are continuing with complex-wide initiatives to improve cutting time and reduce production losses.\n\n## Coal quality\n\nSince 2020, there has been a structural shift of increased ash and sinks* in the coal we have delivered. We have an enhanced understanding of these coal-quality issues and are working to rectify them through a combination of interventions, namely improving in-section quality controls; securing better quality coal through\n\n- * 'Non-coal' or inorganic rock within Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal with a relative density >1.95\n\nexternal coal purchase contracts; and implementing technological solutions.\n\nTechnological solutions such as coal destoning have the potential to become major enablers for better value chain performance by reducing ash and sinks* content.\n\nWe will continue with operator training to improve quality awareness; implementing mechanical horizon control technologies on our in-section mining equipment; and improvements in our coal quality sampling processes.\n\nOur Integrated Quality Management centre will leverage digital and Artificial Intelligence technologies to influence the blending of coal at mine source and improve the quality of the overall blended product.\n\n## Cost management\n\nTo realise cost savings we have established a dedicated cost task team focusing on pinpointing and implementing cost management measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our operations\n\nSasol's Sigma Colliery was established at Sasolburg in 1950, initially producing 2 Mt a year, with production peaking at 7,4 Mt in 1991. Coal mining activities in Secunda started in 1975 and we currently produce approximately 32 Mt per annum at our five Secunda mines and 1,2 Mt at Sigma's Mooikraal Colliery - making us the third-largest coal producer in South Africa. To supplement our production volumes and improve the coal quality blend, we purchase coal from the neighbouring Isibonelo Colliery in Secunda, as well as from other coal producers.\n\n## Our customers\n\nCoal supplied to SO from our Secunda collieries is mainly used as gasification feedstock and to generate electricity. Our Sigma Mooikraal Colliery supplies coal to the Sasolburg complex for the generation of electricity and steam.\n\nCoal from our Thubelisha Colliery is beneficiated at our Twistdraai Export Plant in Secunda, generating high-value thermal coal which is exported to international power-generation customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sasol's Fischer-Tropsch technology can provide such SAF solutions based on our proven technology and wealth of project and operational experience.\n\nMarius Brand // Executive Vice President: Sasol 2.0 Transformation\n\n## Overview\n\nOur 70-year-old institutional knowledge in applying Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology to produce synthetic fuels and chemicals can provide sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions that have exceptional abatement characteristics as well as feedstock adaptability, and in the future can be produced from almost unlimited sustainable feedstocks as renewable energy costs are expected to become increasingly more competitive.\n\nThe global power-to-X (PtX) market, which is a combination of power-to-liquids and power-to-chemicals technology, is developing rapidly through increasing demand for SAF. It presents a global growth opportunity as power-to-liquids is likely to be one of the first and most attractive applications of our FT technology.\n\nOur FT technology has scalable potential as it provides solutions in hard-toabate sectors. Having led the industry in large-scale FT technology applications, we are well positioned to succeed in the emerging SAF market. We will do this by providing differentiated solutions across the globe and playing a key role in the defossilisation/decarbonisation of the aviation industry. This, as drop-in aviation fuels are deemed to be the preferred long-term energy solution for long-distance flights.\n\n## Operating context\n\nSustainable aviation fuel is seen as an essential lever in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Globally, considerable advances have been made in providing the enabling policy and regulatory environment for SAF.\n\nThe European Union is setting standards through its renewable energy directive (RED) and SAF-specific policies like ReFuelEU, which specifies SAF blending mandates and tax penalties for fossil jet fuel use.\n\nThese standards could influence global regulatory guidelines and mandates. Sasol participates in policy consultation platforms in the European Union, United States, United Kingdom and Canada. These advocate for a level playing field that will allow more SAF solution providers to participate in the fast developing global SAF market.\n\nIn the United States and European Union the level of ambition for the reduction of greenhouse gases in the aviation transport sector is favourable for Sasol ecoFT's feasibility project studies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC FOCUS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to accelerate our transition to a low-carbon world in support of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and our ambition to achieve net zero* emissions by 2050.\n\nWe are driving our intention to produce low-carbon fuels and chemicals globally through Sasol ecoFT. This will help us build sustainable businesses and leverage our advantaged FT technology.\n\nSasol ecoFT's focus is to develop, build and operate assets that produce SAF and market the products globally.\n\nWe are driving efforts to maximise catalyst yields and maintain operational efficiencies of our complex integrated facilities.\n\nBy reinforcing strong value chain partnerships, we aim to deliver value through licensing our FT technology.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nThe production costs for sustainable fuels and chemicals will remain higher than existing alternatives. As a result, financing will be a challenge and fuel producers will need public funding in the initial phase of developing the industry if they are to meet future demand. Initially, the emerging industry will rely on legislated blending mandates and grant funding from governments, although country-specific CO 2 commitments and regulatory frameworks are driving demand for both sustainable fuels and chemicals.\n\n- *  Net zero for Sasol is to significantly reduce emissions to the point where only hard-to-abate emissions remain or are zero. Any residual emissions will be neutralised using carbon dioxide removal offsets",

These included power-to-liquids and biomass power-to-liquids FT opportunities. The IRA lowers the costs of adopting clean technologies and accelerates the deployment of clean electricity generation, electric vehicles and several emerging technologies, including carbon capture and hydrogen. We are considering an early United States SAF market entry play, using hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe accelerated the exploration of new value pools to strengthen our competitive advantage. We also established several new key relationships with players across the value chain. Our focus is to create a diversified and resilient portfolio of SAF asset opportunities in attractive geographies with competitive feedstock offerings. These include abundant renewable energy and supportive regulatory dispensations. We are pursuing prefeasibility studies in the United States and feasibility studies in Europe to accelerate the development of SAF asset opportunities and to support our proprietary FT technology.

Directors are chosen by the Board with the support of the Nomination and Governance Committee for their corporate leadership skills, experience and expertise. A combination of different business, geographic and academic backgrounds as well as diversity in age, gender and race allow for robust debate and more considered decision-making, supporting the sustainable growth of the business.\n\nIt is the Board's policy that broader diversity at Board level is promoted; all facets of diversity are considered in determining the optimal composition of the Board and, where possible, are balanced appropriately. All Board appointments are made on merit, having due regard for the benefits of diversity, which the Board as a whole requires to be effective.\n\n## Tenure, independence and succession\n\n## All non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent.\n\nThe Board has determined that Directors may serve on the Board for up to nine years, extendable annually up to a maximum of 12 years. The Board's succession plans aim to achieve an optimal balance between independence and continuity on both the Board and its Committees. It is for this reason that the Board extended the terms of Mr S Westwell and Ms NNA Matyumza following a review and confirmation of their independence. Their experience,\n\nknowledge and independent judgement continue to benefit the Company.\n\n## The Nomination and Governance Committee is of the view that no Director is overcommitted.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee considers the other commitments of Directors when they are first appointed, as well as annually, or at any other time when a Director's circumstances change and warrant re-evaluation. This is done to determine whether a Director has sufficient time to discharge his/hers duties effectively and is free from conflicts that cannot be managed satisfactorily. Should the Nomination and Governance Committee be of the view that a Director is over-committed or has an unmanageable conflict, the Chairman will meet with that Director to discuss the resolution of the matter to the satisfaction of the Committee.\n\n## Focus areas of the Board and its Committees\n\nThe Board Charter and the terms of reference of its Committees are reviewed as and when required but at least every second year to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with all relevant regulatory requirements and governance best practices.\n\nThe Board uses its meetings to discharge its governance and regulatory responsibilities. Its work plan and those of its Committees outline the matters which should be dealt with at meetings and are aligned with the responsibilities and requirements\n\nset out in the Board Charter and the terms of reference of its Committees. Matters considered include safety, operational and financial performance, matters of strategy, risk and opportunity, ESG and compliance.\n\nThe Board has purposefully assumed direct responsibility for the governance of risk. To support the Board in ensuring effective risk management oversight, not only one Committee, but all Board Committees are responsible for ensuring the effective monitoring of risks within the ambit of each Committee's scope. In monitoring and providing oversight on Sasol's risks, each Committee will consider potential opportunities as appropriate.\n\nThere are seven Board meetings a year. The Board also meets twice a year to discuss strategy. For the reporting period, the Board held eight meetings, two strategy meetings and three additional special meetings.\n\n## MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE\n\n## 47 meetings\n\n## 286 attendance*\n\n- *   Due to prior commitments, Ms KC Harper, Ms NNA Matyumza, Mr SA Nkosi and Mr S Westwell could not attend certain of the additional meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n67\n\n## SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE OF OUR BOARD\n\nMaintaining an ethical culture and collective perspective are essential.

We apply a combined assurance model, which seeks to optimise the assurance obtained from management as well as internal and external assurance providers while fostering a strong ethical context and mechanisms to ensure compliance. Through the Risk Policy and strategic intent of risk management approved by the Board, management identifies key risks facing Sasol and implements the necessary internal controls.\n\n## OUR COMBINED ASSURANCE MODEL\n\nManagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal assurance providers\n\nExternal assurance providers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe process is monitored and evaluated under the direction of internal audit, while external audit teams cover key controls and accounting matters in the course of their audits. Other levels of external assurance are obtained as and when required.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period.\n\nHowever, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was ineffective due to the continued existence of the material weakness with respect to the South African Integrated Value Chain impairment process, identified during financial years 2020 and 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAFS Refer to the report from the Audit Committee in the Annual Financial Statements for more information in relation to the material weakness that was identified in financial year 2020.\n\n## Key issues the Board focused on in 2023 and remains invested in going forward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety of our people\n\nMaking sure our people return home safely is the top priority of the Board. Fatalities are unacceptable. Significant time is devoted to monitor processes implemented to ensure Zero Harm.\n\n## Transforming for resilience\n\nResilience, operational stability and performance and cash flow improvement remain essential, especially in view of continued market volatility, geopolitical uncertainty and disruptions, and the deepening global energy crisis. Progressing Sasol 2.0 is a priority. We are also re-focusing on Sasol Mining's performance and on improving the stability of our South African value chain.\n\n## Caring for our planet\n\nWe have invested significant time in implementing our air quality improvement plans, including the development of an integrated air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction solution, and plotting our path to deliver on our GHG emission-reduction targets. It is essential that we align with an integrated just transition programme and incorporate localisation and economic empowerment in our journey. We need to expand our growth opportunities through partnerships and source affordable feedstock; for this we need capital to invest in new technologies and attract suitable talent.\n\n## Strengthening relationships with stakeholders and regulators\n\nOur people are the cornerstone to realising our ambitions, thus capability retention is a key focus area. Strengthening our partnerships and co-developing sustainable solutions with our stakeholders for economic transformation and localisation remain crucial. Delivering on our commitments is essential and we are committed to maintain regular and transparent communication with our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PEOPLE\n\nPLANET\n\nPROFIT\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nNewly appointed Directors are apprised of Sasol's business and their duties and responsibilities as Directors. Our Directors are also given the opportunity to visit Sasol's plants and operations. The development of industry and Group knowledge is a continuous process and Directors are briefed on legal developments and changes in the risk and general business environment on an ongoing basis. The Board, its Committees and Directors are entitled to seek independent professional advice concerning the Company's affairs and to gain access to any information they may require in discharging their duties as Directors.\n\nThe Board formally evaluates its performance and effectiveness, and that of its Committees, Directors and the Chairman, every second year. A formal evaluation was conducted this year, firstly to assess whether there had been improvement in the areas identified during the evaluation conducted in 2021 and secondly, to identify any further areas to enhance.\n\nThe Board concluded that it is effective and the Directors are satisfied that the evaluation process is contributing to the improvement of the Board's performance and effectiveness.\n\n## Progress was made on the following key considerations identified to be addressed during the previous formal evaluation in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7  The quantity and focus of material being provided to the Board and its Committees were reviewed to ensure the material enables constructive dialogue and prioritisation during meetings. The number of meetings has also been increased to ensure that Directors are kept abreast of developments.\n- \u00b7  Key skills and competencies have been identified that would be required for Future Sasol. The succession plan takes into consideration these required skills and competencies. As a first step, Mr Andreas Schierenbeck has been appointed and we are comfortable that his past experience as a Chief Executive Officer in charge of an energy company's transition will greatly benefit the Board.\n- \u00b7  The Board determined that the maximum number of Directors will be 14 for the time being. The ideal size of the Board is an ongoing matter for consideration, especially given the key skillsets and competencies required, the composition of the Committees, as well as international footprint and complexity.\n- \u00b7  Respect and open and honest discussions enhance trust. Team dynamics and culture remain key focus areas for the Board. A number of engagements took place during the year to strengthen cohesion among Directors and promote engagement with executives.\n\n## Some key questions considered to ensure the Board remains effective and adds value included:\n\n- \u00b7  What can be done to ensure the success of our current and future leaders? The Board should ensure that there is focus not only on the succession of executives, but the level below them. Our people are the cornerstone to realising the Company's ambitions.\n- \u00b7  What are we missing? The Board will continue to focus on the nature and extent of risks faced by the organisation, the impact of these risks on the strategy, performance and sustainability of the Company and the effectiveness of the risk management process.\n- \u00b7  Are we agile enough and solutions driven? Adaptation of our strategic direction taking into consideration risks, opportunities, market dynamics and performance is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the Company.\n\n## Another key consideration identified to further enhance the value of the Board going forward was:\n\n- \u00b7  Further evolving the Board's role of overseeing the effective execution of strategy and ensuring that the strategy translates into adding value to shareholders and building a sustainable business. Enhancing data based strategic decision-making and the outside, diverse perspective provided by Directors to add value to management's integrated thinking is crucial to ensure resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A sustainable, high-performance and value-driven culture remains a key objective which underscores the policy. The policy's design strives to provide competitive, market-aligned rewards while balancing the need for cost containment, risk management and value creation for stakeholders.\n\n## In FY23 we made some changes which related to:\n\n- \u00b7  updates to the long-term incentive (LTI) plan, which were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in December 2022;\n- \u00b7  the introduction of post-cessation shareholding requirements for Executive Directors and Prescribed Officers;\n- \u00b7  revision of targets applicable to incentive awards to align with key priorities;\n- \u00b7  aligning the short-term incentive (STI) formulae for the President and CEO and the CFO; and\n- \u00b7  extending the notice period for newly appointed employees in the Group Leadership and Leadership role categories from one month to three months, aligned to the legislative framework of the jurisdictions within which we operate.\n\n## Our remuneration philosophy\n\nOur remuneration philosophy is to use internally equitable and externally competitive, affordable salary, benefits and incentive structures to attract, retain and motivate qualified, skilled and engaged employees to work towards achieving the Group's strategic objectives in a values-driven manner and to create stakeholder value responsibly and sustainably.",

Our minimum wage is higher than what is considered a living wage for each jurisdiction and is enhanced by benefits offered under our EmpVP.\n- \u00b7  The remuneration mix depends on the position in the organisational structure as well as geographical market practices.\n- \u00b7  Executive remuneration has a strong link to shareholder interests, particularly through the design of variable pay structures.\n- \u00b7  In setting incentive metrics, we consider value drivers which are mostly within management's control while ensuring financial performance meets predetermined targets and results in sufficient cash flow to afford incentive pay-outs.\n- \u00b7  Appropriate approval processes are in place to prevent conflicts of interest and to mitigate risks that may unintentionally result from our remuneration programmes.\n- \u00b7  The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is empowered to intervene in circumstances when formulaic outcomes appear to be inappropriate, not aligned with business performance, and those circumstances unduly influenced by factors outside of management's control.\n\n## Shareholder feedback\n\nWe are pleased with the feedback from shareholders on our Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report, and their increased support for these at our last AGM.\n\n## Non-binding advisory votes on the Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report\n\n## DECEMBER 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2022 | REMUNERATION POLICY 92,92%   | IMPLEMENTATION REPORT 94,89%   |\n|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|   2021 | 86,90%                       | 86,11%                         |\n|   2020 | 71,46%                       | 43,21%                         |\n\n## Remuneration overview\n\nApart from Mr HA Rossouw being appointed as the Group CFO effective 1 July 2022, there was no other change to the constitution of our Group Executive Committee (GEC), or to the target remuneration of their roles. Mr CF Rademan's initial 16 month contract to serve as the EVP: Sasol Mining, was extended to 31 October 2023.\n\nWe have again benchmarked the remuneration data and applied market adjustments to salaries where required. The following graph sets out the remuneration earned at threshold, target and potential maximum earnings at stretch level. A review of the quantum and mix have formed part of the benchmarking process.\n\nThe graph below indicates the threshold, target and stretch percentages as well as the actual remuneration earned for FY23.\n\n## Remuneration earned vs policy remuneration set at threshold, target and stretch levels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The percentages achieved for FY23 are reflected as an average percentage of base salary/TGP.\n- 2 Value for the non-SA GEC member was converted to rand using June 2023 average daily exchange rates.\n- 3 Average remuneration outcomes across all other Executive Directors and Prescribed Officers.\n\n71",

We are confident that the reward outcomes approved by the Committee for FY23, reflects the performance outcomes.\n\nMpho Nkeli // Chairman of Remuneration Committee\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\n- Reward outcomes aligned with Company performance.\n- Reward acts as an important anchor in the comprehensive EmpVP and people promise.\n- Pay gaps are reviewed and addressed as appropriate.\n- Executive and non-Executive remuneration benchmarked against a diverse group of peer companies reflecting the business model of Sasol.\n- Implemented the revised long-term incentive plan (LTIP) rules as approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM.\n- Executive Directors and Prescribed Officers progress positively to meeting the minimum shareholding requirements.\n\n## Dear stakeholders\n\n## Engaging with shareholders\n\n## An overview\n\nReward outcomes are assessed in consideration of business performance in the context of macroeconomic dynamics and factors outside and inside of management's control. The Committee takes its responsibility to ensure that management is fairly and appropriately rewarded very seriously, balancing this with the need to ensure that there is shareholder value creation over the same period.\n\nThe performance outcomes on the Group STI plan, aligned with the Group's performance over the period. The Committee was again very concerned with the plan outcomes being below target. Performance against safety, climate change, net working capital and the capital expenditure targets were satisfactory, but energy efficiency, sales volumes, cash fixed costs and free cash flow generation over turnover results were below target. Energy efficiency directly relates to the performance of our operations. The Committee will in FY24 further scrutinise the setting of targets and specifically whether these are too ambitious in the context of our daily realities.\n\nAt our AGM in December 2022, support for the policy increased to 92,92% from 86,90% in FY21 and 71,46% in FY20. There was also an increase in shareholder support for the Implementation Report, with 94,89% of votes in support of the non-binding advisory resolution, compared to 86,11% in FY21 and a low of 43,21% in FY20.\n\nThe consistent improvement in the level of support received over the past two years for our policy and the way it is implemented is encouraging; it shows that most shareholders believe that our approach to remuneration and the interests of our shareholders are now better aligned.\n\nThrough targeted engagements, Sasol continued to engage with investors, although not required, to discuss the policy, hear any concerns, and explain the rationale behind any policy decisions. In the year we engaged with shareholders representing approximately 44% of Sasol shares. We greatly appreciate this feedback which is duly considered by management and the Committee and plays an active role in the shaping of our decisions.\n\nThe Committee was pleased that performance improved against the LTI targets although the external factors which hamper our efforts to implement renewable energy projects remain concerning.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This included a review of the EmpVP; updates to Sasol's wellbeing programmes; a continued commitment to safety; and the adherence to our clearly defined remuneration principles. The feedback from our engagement survey, the 'Heartbeat survey' was considered by the Safety, Social and Ethics Committee. All decisions on people related policies and benefits are taken considering the holistic sustainability strategy of the Company. The Committee also annually reviews the status of all benefit plans offered in the Group ensuring well-governed plans enhancing the EmpVP.\n\n## Key Remuneration Committee decisions\n\n## FIXED PAY\n\nIn a year in which global inflation remained persistently high, increases awarded to employees were higher than in previous years. For employees outside collective bargaining sectors, the Committee approved annual salary increases mostly aligned with market increases. For those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, settlements were reached on salary increases higher than inflation. Additional budget was approved to address pay gaps, as well as adjustments for salaries which are uncompetitive, compared to similar key skill roles in the market.\n\n## SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES\n\nPerformance against the Group STI targets was mostly below target, with a total score of 71,5% of the 150% maximum on the Group STI scorecard. The Committee applied no discretion on the final score.

The STI score for Business EVPs, was calculated on a combination of the Group (60%)\n\nscore and the respective Businesses' (40%) score; the Corporate Centre EVPs' STI scores was a weighted average between the Group and the three Businesses' STI scores. The final approved score for Chemicals was 71,1%, for Energy 76,3% and for Mining was 59,7%.\n\nIndividual performance is assessed against a balanced scorecard, in the range of 0% - 150% which is a multiplier in the STI calculation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIR For more detail refer to the calculations provided in the Implementation Report on page 83\n\nThe Committee believes that these STI outcomes are a fair representation of the results achieved across all financial and non-financial metrics in FY23.\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVES\n\nFor GEC members, subject to performance and service criteria being met, LTIs granted will vest in FY24, at 67,34%. The performance period was from 1 July 2020 - 30 June 2023. As previously reported, among these CPTs was a target of implementing 200MW of renewable energy capacity by 30 November 2023. Despite, by 12 June 2023, having signed PPAs for nearly 775MW of renewable projects, Sasol's ability to deliver on this target is hampered by a number of factors which included the inclusion of Air Liquide as a partner in our Secunda renewable energy programme (post the sale of the air separation units), severely restricted grid capacity and being one of the largest RE procurers in the country, setting the benchmark for securing these type of transactions.\n\nAlthough the most recent relaxation of the NERSA licensing requirement benefitted the programme, the June 2023 Eskom announcement on the IGCAR\n\n## PROGRESSING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE SASOL\n\nIn FY23 the Committee devoted much time and energy to the Group's overall reward related initiatives and their role in addressing the material matters identified in the year.\n\nhas led to the Committee deciding to postpone an assessment of performance against the renewable energy target, until more clarity is available in this regard.\n\nThe Committee also considered that in light of the PPAs already signed, should grid access be available, Sasol should be in a position to exceed its 2025 energy emission reduction targets; however, there are many moving goal posts in this regard which hamper progress.\n\nThe Committee remains firmly committed to incentivising progress against our renewable energy and energy reduction targets; a key strategic priority.\n\nAs part of our role to determine vesting, the Committee also considered whether a windfall gain occurred for FY21 awards as a result of awards having been granted at a share price which was negatively impacted by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Committee noted that Sasol's share price experienced significant volatility in the periods before and after the awards were made in FY21; however, no awards were made when the share price dropped below R100 in this period.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee noted that Sasol's share price stabilised from 1 June 2020; for the rest of the year, it averaged R130,60; and all FY21 LTI grants were made when the share price was close to or above this level. As a result, supported by the independent assessment, the Committee is satisfied that a windfall gain did not occur for any of the LTI awards granted in FY21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM of the new LTI plan, Sasol took the lead in the South African market by introducing an 18-month post-termination shareholding requirement for members of the GEC to ensure longer-term exposure to the Sasol share price, even after service termination.\n\nThe Committee is pleased with the progress made towards meeting the minimum shareholding requirements for members of the GEC.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the portion of the LTIs which have both performance and continued employment conditions attached and approved changes in this regard for FY24, reducing the percentage allocation related to restricted shares.\n\n## BOARD FEES\n\nIn 2021, Sasol reduced Board remuneration after an extensive review of the structure and quantum of non-Executive Directors' (NED) fees. As approved, the fees were adjusted in line with inflation in January 2023. An inflationary adjustment to the Board fees will be proposed for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM. This increase follows a comprehensive review of the NED fees.\n\n## EXTENDED NOTICE PERIOD\n\nIn the year, the Committee extended the notice period for new appointees in Group leadership and leadership role categories from one month to three months. This was to ensure sufficient time for a smooth handover of responsibilities as well as longer lead times to appoint suitable external candidates.",

Line manager and employee training material on understanding how salaries are determined, and how salaries can be interpreted within pay bands, have been developed to ensure that educated discussions on pay can be held ahead of the pay gap information being reported publicly. We have also added the proposed pay gap methodology stated in the draft Companies Amendment Bill, 2023 to our existing assessments.\n\nThe Group top risk theme of 'People' IR refer to page 34, includes key risks relating to the retention of critical skills, emigration, labour instability due to socio-economic factors specifically in South Africa, and employee wellbeing with a specific emphasis on an increase in the number of mental health cases reported. Mitigating plans are in place and these risks are monitored on a continuous basis. One of the mitigating plans, is the introduction of a progressive pay and career model for our engineers, an enhanced employee wellbeing programme focusing on mental, financial and physical health and further enhancements to the EmpVP.\n\nThe historically low levels of unemployment in our northern hemisphere locations sometimes lead to difficulty in immediately finding suitable candidates to place in vacancies, as well as longer lead times. This has led to a decision to increase the notice period for our Leadership and Group Leadership categories to three months where the legislative framework permits.\n\nOn 1 July 2023, we were the first South African headquartered company that introduced a global cloud-based people management platform to enhance the delivery of our human resources services, enabling the business to make better data-driven decisions and improve the overall employee experience in digital HR solutions.\n\nMindful of employee feedback from our Heartbeat survey in 2022, in the year ahead we will remain focused on delivering on our People Promise.\n\n## The Group Executive Committee (GEC)\n\nThe initial 16 month contract period for Mr CF Rademan as EVP: Sasol Mining was extended to 31 October 2023 to allow sufficient time for handover to his successor and to use his experience over many decades to help stabilise the Mining business. Mr Rademan will continue to support Mining as a consultant on an ad hoc basis until June 2024.\n\nMr HC Brand retired effective 30 June 2023 and will continue to support the Sasol/Topsoe Joint Venture which is still subject to approval by the relevant authorities, as a consultant on an ad hoc basis until June 2024.\n\n## Independent advisors\n\nMr David Tuch, Managing Director at Alvarez & Marsal Taxand UK LLP (A&M), continued to act as an Independent External Advisor to the Committee in FY23. A&M provided information on global reward trends as well as market insights into discussions on executive reward matters. It did not provide any other services to Sasol and the Committee was satisfied with A&M's independence.\n\n## Looking forward FY23/FY24\n\nMindful of employee feedback from our Heartbeat survey in 2022, in the year ahead we will remain focused on delivering on our People Promise. We will ensure that our key performance indicators (KPIs) are aligned to our Group top priorities, strategic objectives and address our material matters.\n\nWe will continue to embed our Values, culture, enhance our EmpVP and promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace to ensure that we attract and retain the skills we need to deliver on our strategic objectives. Additionally, we will focus delivery on our targets by prioritising shareholder returns as we restore the foundation business and reset. Safety will continue to be positioned as the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfoundation across which all elements of the priorities are to be delivered.\n\nThe Committee continually strives to simplify reward practices in order to enhance the effectiveness thereof in our organisation.\n\n## In closing\n\nThe improved voting outcomes at the 2022 AGM regarding remuneration at Sasol indicated that a substantial majority of our shareholders are satisfied with the work of the Committee. We do not take this endorsement for granted and remain committed to ensuring that the policy and the implementation thereof is fair and responsible; supports the delivery of the Group's strategy; addresses material matters; and creates and preserves value for our stakeholders.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Policy meets the agreed objectives. It is also satisfied that the remuneration outcomes for FY23 reflect alignment between the 'pay for performance' requirements of both Sasol and our shareholders.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I would like to express appreciation to all Sasol's people for their dedication to create value under often trying conditions. I thank shareholders for their continued engagement and look forward to their endorsement of the advisory votes on our Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report at the 2023 AGM. I extend my thanks to the Committee members for their wise counsel in FY23. The Committee is grateful to management, and specifically the Reward team for their assistance.\n\nMpho Nkeli Chairman of Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n25 August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is similar to the methodology used in Form EEA4 which has to be submitted annually to the South African Department of Employment and Labour. Target remuneration rather than actual remuneration is used for year-on-year comparisons to exclude the impact of, in particular, macroeconomic factors that impact on the LTI awards.\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews the internal pay gaps to ensure that there are no systemic adverse practices. In FY23, a separate increase budget was made available to address salaries which are low in the pay range.\n\nAs an additional lens, the proposed methodology under the draft Companies Amendment Bill, 2023, was also applied and assessed.\n\nThe Committee committed to ensuring that the wages of our lowest-paid employees are sufficient to accommodate a decent standard of living. We will continue to track the pay gap from this perspective.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nOur reporting complies with:\n\n- \u00b7  South African Companies Act and other relevant statutory requirements;\n- \u00b7  Principles and recommended practices of King IV TM ;\n- \u00b7  Requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for foreign private issuers; and\n- \u00b7  The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Listings Requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration Committee Risk and Governance\n\nSasol complies with applicable remuneration governance codes and statutes that apply in the various jurisdictions within which it operates.\n\nThe Committee is appointed by the Board to assist in ensuring that the Group remunerates its employees fairly, responsibly and transparently by implementing affordable, competitive and fair reward practices to promote the achievement of strategic objectives and positive outcomes in the short, medium and long term. WWW The Committee's Terms of Reference and the Group Remuneration Policy are available at www.sasol.com/who-we-are/corporate-governance/board-charter\n\nAll incentive pay-outs and the vesting of performance LTIs are approved after due consideration of performance against the pre-approved targets that were set for the performance period.\n\nThe President and CEO, EVP: Human Resources and Stakeholder Relations, and VP: Group Reward and Human Resources Information System (HRIS) attend Committee meetings by invitation. Members of management are recused from meetings when matters impacting their own remuneration is discussed. In all meetings, the Committee discusses and confirms all decisions taken without management present. A&M Managing Director Mr D Tuch acts as an independent advisor for the Committee. The Committee is comfortable with Mr Tuch's independence. The contract with A&M has been extended for a further two years.\n\nAt the end of each financial year, the President and CEO tables the performance of all Prescribed Officers to inform the decisions on annual increases and incentive pay-outs. External market benchmark data is also provided to the Committee to ensure competitive reward practices. The Chairman of the Board tables the performance outcomes and proposed rewards for the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary. The Committee then recommends them for approval to the Board.\n\nCREATING VALUE\n\nThe Board (excluding the NEDs) considers and recommends for approval by shareholders any fee adjustments for the NEDs.\n\nThe Committee ensures effective risk management oversight in relation to material remuneration risks within its scope and will exercise its discretion within the Group's overall risk framework. The following processes mitigate against unintended outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7  The policy is transparent and made available to all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7  All executive reward policy exceptions are approved by the Committee or the Board, as appropriate.\n- \u00b7  Incentive plan design principles and targets as well as the reward mix are reviewed annually.\n- \u00b7  The vesting of LTI plans is subject to performance and/or time-based criteria and awards are never backdated.\n- \u00b7  Executives do not approve their own benefits or remuneration and are recused from all discussions relating to their own remuneration.\n- \u00b7  The maximum incentive awards, based on performance outcomes, are capped by a preapproved formula.\n- \u00b7  The Committee retains discretion to alter any reward outcome.\n- \u00b7  MSRs and post-cessation shareholding requirements are implemented for Executive Directors and Prescribed Officers.\n- \u00b7  A comprehensive Clawback and Malus Policy is in place.\n- \u00b7  Except in the case of death, there is no accelerated vesting of LTIs for executives at retirement, and the vesting periods of three and five years continue post the date of retirement allowing for continued exposure to the share price performance, as well as the application of the Clawback and Malus Policy if required.\n- \u00b7  The Committee considers reward-related risks on a quarterly basis which includes a five year forecast reward heat map.\n\n## The use and application of remuneration benchmarks\n\nOne of the Committee's key tasks is to preserve the relevance, integrity and consistency of benchmarking. Management also consults survey reports from various large remuneration firms.\n\nIn addition to survey data, we use benchmark data from the approved peer group to develop pay bands and incentive plans as well as for the comparison of employee benefits. For the remuneration of GEC members and the Chairman and NED fees, we select a peer group of companies which includes those with a broadly similar geographic footprint and/or product suite and/or size.\n\nThe peer group includes a balanced combination of companies that have a primary listing on the JSE Ltd and international chemicals and energy companies.\n\nThe following peer group was adopted for Executive and NED remuneration benchmarking effective 1 July 2021 and no changes were made for FY23.\n\n| JSE primary listed companies   | Chemicals companies   | Energy companies         |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Anglo American Platinum        | Albemarle Corp        | Continental Resources    |\n| AngloGold Ashanti              | Covestro AG           | Devon Energy Corporation |\n| Gold Fields                    | Eastman Chemicals Co  | Hess Corporation         |\n| Impala Platinum Holdings       | Evonik Industries AG  | Imperial Oil             |\n| MTN Group                      | Lanxess AG            | Origin Energy            |\n| Sibanye Stillwater             | Solvay SA             | Repsol                   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

After the vesting period, which varies between three and five years, participants may sell or retain the shares.\n\nIn jurisdictions where we do not offer an equity-settled award due to legislative restrictions, or where we choose not to make an equity-settled award, eligible employees may participate in a cash-settled LTI plan with the same conditions that are applicable to equity instruments, except that they are settled with cash.\n\nThe maximum number of shares to be made available for awards to eligible participants equated to approximately 5% of the issued shares of the Group at the time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndividual Performance Factor (0% - 150%) 2\n\n80\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Special retention awards and sign-on or buy-out awards\n\nThe Sign-on Payment and Retention Policy may be used in the recruitment and retention of candidates in specialised or scarce skill positions. Cash retention payments are linked to retention periods of at least two years. Retention shares may be granted under the LTI Plan.\n\n## Executive service contracts\n\n- \u00b7  Members of the GEC have permanent employment contracts with notice periods of three to six months.\n- \u00b7  The contracts provide for salary and benefits as well as participation in incentive plans based on Group, Business and individual performance as approved by the Board.\n- \u00b7  EVPs who are members of the South African Sasol Pension Fund are required to retire from the Group and as Directors from the Board at the age of 60, unless they are requested by the Board to extend their term.\n- \u00b7  Perquisites offered to the members of the GEC are disclosed in the Implementation Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, fees are set at levels to attract and retain the calibre of NEDs necessary to contribute to a highly effective board of a complex, multi-dimensional and multinational organisation. NEDs do not receive STIs and do not participate in LTI plans. No arrangement exists for compensation in respect of loss of office.\n\nNEDs are paid a fixed annual fee in respect of their Board membership and supplementary fees for Committee membership or Chairmanship. The annual fee is divided by four and a quarterly fee is paid at the end of every Board cycle regardless of the number of meetings held in that quarter.\n\nBoard fees tabled at the 2021 AGM were approved effective 1 January 2022. The approved fees will be effective until the 2021 resolution is replaced, but no longer than two years from the date that the resolution was passed.\n\nThe approved NED fees include a cost-of-living factor which is applied to the fees payable to NEDs who live outside of Europe, United Kingdom and North America. Furthermore, a fixed exchange rate is used to convert the US dollar fees to the denomination used for payment to eliminate significant exchange rate variances. In accordance with the resolution passed at the 2021 AGM, a 4,5% adjustment equal to an average consumer price index percentage was implemented effective 1 January 2023.\n\n|                                                       | JANUARY 2022 TO DECEMBER 2022                                                                  | JANUARY 2022 TO DECEMBER 2022                                                            | JANUARY 2023 TO DECEMBER 2023                                                                  | JANUARY 2023 TO DECEMBER 2023                                                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                       | A.

Incentives are calculated as a percentage of total guaranteed package/base salary as at 30 June 2023 x Group and BU STI achievement (as appropriate) x Individual Performance achievement.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n- Long-term incentives for FY23 represent the annual award made on 4 December 2020 and Ms Mabelane's on-appointment LTI award on 6 October 2020, at time of her appointment as EVP: Energy Business. The illustrative amount is calculated in terms of the number of LTIs x Corporate performance target achieved where relevant (67,34%) x June 2023 average share price. The vesting date is during FY24, 3 years after the award date in FY21, subject to the Company being in an open period. Dividend equivalents accrue at the end of the vesting period, to the extent that the LTIs vest. 50% of the vested LTIs and accrued dividends will be released on 4 December 2023 and the balance in 4 December 2025, subject to the rules of the LTI plan. As there are no further performance conditions attached to the balance of the 50%, the full amount is disclosed in the single figure table.\n- Other benefits for Mr Baloyi include the taxation gross up of the relocation allowance paid in terms of the Sasol Relocation policy, in the previous financial year and R150 000 toward reimbursement of property transfer fees per the Relocation policy.\n\n5\n\n- 6 Mr Klingenberg, stepped down from the position of EVP Energy Operations on 31 March 2022, but remained in service until his retirement on 31 August 2022. In the interest of transparency his remuneration was disclosed for the 2022 financial year.\n- 7 Other benefits for Ms Mabelane include her subsidised business transport (R8 299) and the final payment of her sign-on/buy-out award partially compensating for the loss of incentives and shares when she resigned from her previous employer (R1 000 000). Other benefits for Ms Mabelane in 2022 include her subsidised business transport (R2 150), sign-on/buy-out award partially compensating for the loss of incentives and shares when she resigned from her previous employer (R5 000 000).\n- 8 Other benefits for Mr Rademan in 2022 include a sign-on payment of R1 500 000 compensating for the incentive which he would have received from his previous employer if he did not resign.\n\n89\n\n<!-- image -->",

Progress against Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)\n\n- Change in intrinsic value for the year results from changes in share price. Intrinsic values at the beginning and end of the year have been determined using the closing price of:\n\n30 June 2023 R233,26 ($12,38)\n\n- 30 June 2022 R371,68 ($23,06)\n- 2 LTIs granted on 10 November 2022.\n- 3 LTIs settled represent long-term incentives that vested with reference to the Group results for FY22 that was settled in FY23. Difference between the long-term incentive gains disclosed in FY22 and the amount settled in FY23 is due to differences in actual share price at vesting date and the share price at date of disclosure.\n- 4 Mr Brand retired effective 30 June 2023. In terms of the 2022 LTI Plan rules, his 10 November 2022 award lapsed on 30 June 2023 as retirement was within 270 days of the award date. The balance of unvested awards at 30 June 2023 is 94 426 with an intrinsic value of R22 025 809.\n\n## Vested shares subject to continued employment only until (excluding accrued dividend equivalents, including RLTIs)\n\n| Beneficial Shareholding   | Minimum  Shareholding  Requirement  (MSR)  ($'000) (R'000)   | MSR  Achievement  period (CY)   | Units   | Beneficial  share- holding -

These statements may also relate to our future prospects, expectations, developments, and business strategies. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and measures taken in response, on Sasol's business, results of operations, markets, employees, financial condition and liquidity; the effectiveness of any actions taken by Sasol to address or limit any impact of COVID-19 on its business; the capital cost of our projects and the timing of project milestones; our ability to obtain financing to meet the funding requirements of our capital investment programme, as well as to fund our ongoing business activities and to pay dividends; statements regarding our future results of operations and financial condition, and regarding future economic performance including cost containment, cash conservation programmes and business optimisation initiatives; recent and proposed accounting pronouncements and their impact on our future results of operations and financial condition; our business strategy, performance outlook, plans, objectives or goals; statements regarding future competition, volume growth and changes in market share in the industries and markets for our products; our existing or anticipated investments, acquisitions of new businesses or the disposal of existing businesses, including estimates or projection of internal rates of return and future profitability; our estimated oil, gas and coal reserves; the probable future outcome of litigation, legislative, regulatory and fiscal developments, including statements regarding our ability to comply with future laws and regulations; future fluctuations in refining margins and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical product prices; the demand, pricing and cyclicality of oil, gas and petrochemical product prices; changes in the fuel and gas pricing mechanisms in South Africa and their effects on prices, our operating results and profitability; statements regarding future fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and changes in credit ratings; total shareholder return; our current or future products and anticipated customer demand for these products; assumptions relating to macroeconomics; climate change impacts and our climate change strategies, our development of sustainability within our Energy and Chemicals Businesses, our energy efficiency improvement, carbon and GHG emission reduction targets, our net zero carbon emissions ambition and future low-carbon initiatives, including relating to green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel; our estimated carbon tax liability; cyber security; and statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as 'believe', 'anticipate', 'expect', 'intend\", 'seek', 'will', 'plan', 'could', 'may', 'endeavour', 'target', 'forecast' and 'project' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and there are risks that the predictions, forecasts, projections, and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved. If one or more of these risks materialise, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. You should understand that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors and others are discussed more fully in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed on 1 September 2023 and in other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The list of factors discussed therein is not exhaustive; when relying on forward-looking statements to make investment decisions, you should carefully consider foregoing factors and other uncertainties and events, and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements apply only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nComprehensive additional information is available on our website: www.sasol.com\n\n## Photography\n\nPhotographs used in this report, have been sourced from our photographic library.\n\nPhotographs used from stock libraries have been sourced with relevant licences.\n\n## \u00a9Sasol Limited\n\nCopyright subsists in this work.
