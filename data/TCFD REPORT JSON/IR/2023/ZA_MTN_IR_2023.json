These reports go beyond traditional financial reporting by integrating sustainability and non-financial information.\n\n## Integrated Report\n\nOur primary communication to stakeholders aims to help them make informed assessments of our performance and prospects, strategic direction and the value we create through our activities. It provides a forward looking perspective on MTN's financial and non-financial performance, encompassing strategy, risks and opportunities, targets and governance.\n\nThese reports include an analysis of the Group's financial results, a five-year review, and MTN's approach to handling uncertain tax positions. They provide insight for current and prospective investors,  employees,  creditors,  analysts  and  other  stakeholders.  They  disclose  details  of MTN's income statement, financial position, cash flows, performance per share, as well as key non-financial information.\n\n## Sustainability reporting\n\nThe following suite of reports provides information on MTN's strategy and performance related to sustainability issues with potential impact on our organisation, society and the environment. The reports detail MTN's environmental and social policies, governance, strategies, risks and opportunities. The reports also provide detailed performance data on a wide range of ESG metrics and targets. MTN's sustainability disclosures are structured and informed by the voluntary Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS S1 and IFRS S2), which have fully integrated the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidance. The reports detail MTN's policies, governance strategies, risks and opportunities relating to sustainability considerations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESG Data Booklet\n\nTransparency Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory and reporting frameworks used: \u2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2020 For more details see page 05.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCR\n\nClimate Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESG Matrix\n\nfor Mobile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAFR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Financial Results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNotice of AGM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKing IV Assessment ReportFive-Year Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual Financial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information for shareholders\n\nThe Notice of AGM and form of proxy give information to shareholders who want to participate in the Group's Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\nThis provides a summary of the application of the King IV TM principles by MTN Group Limited and Mobile Telephone Networks Holdings Limited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nX\n\nTA\n\n## Financial reporting\n\n<!-- image -->",

It endeavours to enable readers to make an informed assessment of our performance, prospects and the value we seek to create and preserve through our activities.\n\n## Changes in reporting and enhancements\n\nFor this report, we made the following enhancements:\n\n- \u00b7 Additional context on our enhanced materiality determination process.\n- \u00b7 Further detail on our performance against the constituents of our strategic priorities.\n- \u00b7 More granular background of specific market context information on our three regions.\n- \u00b7 Our milestones over the last 30 years.\n- \u00b7 Streamlined the duplication and enhanced cross referencing throughout the reports, including embedding hyperlinks to the website.\n- \u00b7 Provided more information on how the Board transformed our refreshed values into action.\n\n## Basis for preparation\n\nOur report reflects integrated thinking at MTN: it is prepared by  the  Investor  Relations  team,  reporting  to  the  MTN Group Chief Financial Officer. In determining its content, we assess the annual business plan, Ambition 2025 , the issues that materially impact our ability to create and preserve value, as well as those that could erode value.\n\nWe also draw on monthly standardised reports prepared by management across the Group and submitted to the Board of Directors.

Financial data from our subsidiaries and non-financial data from  subsidiaries,  associates,  and  joint  ventures  are  fully consolidated.\n\nThe report gives commentary, performance and prospects for our material subsidiaries: MTN South Africa and MTN Nigeria , as well as for our three operating regions:\n\n- \u00b7 SEA - Southern and East Africa.\n- \u00b7 WECA - West and Central Africa.\n- \u00b7 MENA - Middle East and North Africa.\n\nDetails of listed operating companies (Opcos) MTN Nigeria, MTN  Ghana,  MTN  Uganda  and  MTN  Rwanda  are  in  their separate  integrated  reports  online .

Informed by recent developments in global disclosure standards and frameworks, we have adopted  'double  materiality'  across  our  suite  of annual reports.\n\nMaterial matters which meet the criteria for double materiality  are  those  that  fall  within  the  impact materiality and financial materiality. These matters are likely to influence the value, timing and certainty of MTN's future cash flows across the short, medium and  long  term.  Our also  unpacks  financially material  impacts  resulting  from  ESG  risks  and opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7 Impact materiality: refers to significant impacts on individuals, society and the environment.\n- \u00b7 Financial materiality: captures the impacts on the Group's value and cash flow, including events during the financial year and those that are integrated into prospective cash flow projections.\n\nWe have sought to ensure that all the information in this will help readers assess MTN's value creation.\n\nThe outcomes of our 2023 materiality determination process are on page 23.",

It was also a tough year from a macroeconomic perspective, with higher-than-forecast global inflation averaging an estimated 6.8% (2022: 8.7%) and a sharp depreciation of many of the currencies in our key markets, where foreign exchange (forex) availability remained a significant challenge. According to the IMF,  global  growth  slowed  to  an  estimated  3.1%  from  3.5% in 2022.\n\nThe cost and supply of energy remained a hot topic across the tech  and  telecoms  industry,  while  the  trend  of  greater regulatory scrutiny and interventions continued to impact our business. In addition, the global geopolitical landscape in 2023 was distinguished by fraught international relations, including conflicts  in  Ukraine,  Sudan,  parts  of  West  Africa,  and  the Middle East.\n\nPolitical instability is a feature of several countries on our continent, with the recent coups in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea-Conakry, Mali, Niger and Sudan disrupting life and discouraging investment. Although MTN only operates in two of these markets, the rest of these countries are neighbouring MTN markets. We monitor developments closely and work to ensure that our people and customers are safe and that our services are uninterrupted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFiscal  pressures  and  debt  tightening  have  added  to  the already-strained public finances of economies throughout our markets. In this environment, many African governments have sought  new  ways  to  generate  revenue,  among  them broadening the tax base and increasing tax types and rates. At MTN, we monitor these developments carefully, seeking to manage  the  associated  risks  carefully  and  continuing  to engage with revenue authorities and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nIn this context, it would be easy to feel overwhelmed; however, at MTN, we stayed focused on our strategic intent of 'leading digital solutions for Africa's progress' and on our belief that 'everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life' . These remained our guide as we continued to mitigate the risks and navigate the challenges of our operating context. We concentrated on the exciting opportunities present across the continent we call home. In this , you will read more about the operating environment in 2023 (pages  15 to 17), MTN's strategic delivery (pages 71 to 88), and the outlook (page 21) for the business. I also refer readers to the comprehensive material matters and risk sections on pages 22 to 33 and 46 to 57, respectively.\n\nSuffice to say, the business managed these circumstances well and recorded a solid performance in 2023, strategically, financially and by many other measures. The Q&A with the CEO (page 12) and the CFO (page 58) give details of this performance,  which  speaks  to  encouraging  underlying operational momentum and was produced under the careful guidance of the Board of Directors. The and the provide details for those readers who require more details on the Group's broader performance.\n\n## Continuing to invest in the socioeconomic development of our nation-states\n\nOur operating and financial performance was underpinned by substantial investments in our networks, as we increased our broadband network coverage to reach 89.2% - this equates to a population coverage of around 559 million people across our markets.  This  signified  meaningful  progress  toward  our objective of providing 95% broadband coverage by 2025. Given the importance of this priority, shareholders would note that we  have  linked  this  to  executive  remuneration  within  our ESG measures.\n\nThis  sets  important  context,  as  I  spend  much  of  my  time engaging with stakeholders from across our markets. In light of our strategic priority to 'create shared value', a key takeaway is the Group's determination to extend digital and financial inclusion  across  Africa,  working  closely  with  our  many partners. In this pursuit, we enabled approximately 150 million customers to access internet services in 2023, while nearly 73 million used our financial services.",

We work closely with our nation-state hosts to ensure that our role  is  relevant  to  economic  development,  including  as  a significant and compliant provider of tax revenue - our total tax contribution reached R61.7 billion LA in 2023. Beyond this, the Group's contribution to lives and livelihoods across our markets can be measured in our economic value added. In  2023  this  was  R159^  billion,  up  from  R149  billion  the year before.\n\n## Sustaining engagement and good governance\n\nAmong the key activities that stood out for me in 2023 were the governance roadshow with investors after annual results, as well as the Capital Markets Day (CMD) held in Johannesburg for the MTN Group. We are also pleased to have pioneered a CMD in Abuja, highlighting MTN Nigeria's strategic position and outlook.\n\nBy being out in the markets and meeting with stakeholders, my fellow directors and I are able to get a real feel for the issues on the ground. We also speak to regulators and the government about how we see the direction of policy that is supportive of economic  growth  and  development  (see  our  stakeholder section starting on page 34).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderpinning this, good governance is an important basis on which sustainable companies are built; therefore at the core of MTN's business is a commitment to governance that is not only robust, but also anchored in international best practice and applicable laws. We are cognisant of our responsibility to act as a good corporate citizen, uphold our company's values and be accountable, transparent, ethical and inclusive.\n\nIn November 2023, an evaluation of the Board was conducted by  Hoffmann  Reed  and  FluidRock.  It  focused  on  Board effectiveness,  dynamics  and  composition,  emphasising  the enhancement of MTN's strategic direction. Among the key\n\noutcomes (see page 96) of the exercise were recommendations to:\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to monitor the implementation of the refreshed decision-making framework and ensure that management is given sufficient latitude to move with execution while the Board provides adequate oversight.\n- \u00b7 Increase the fintech, banking and digital experience on the Board.\n- \u00b7 Continue to strengthen the strategic alignment between the Group Board and the boards of MTN's subsidiaries.\n\nAt the end of April 2023, we said farewell to Paul Hanratty, thanking  him  for  his  significant  contribution  to  Board deliberations over the years. In January 2023, we were pleased to have Nicky Newton-King join the Board. During the year, we also saw the term of the Independent Advisory Board (IAB) come to an end, although we have no doubt that we will still lean on its former members for their expertise in the years to come  as  the  IAB  structure  evolves  into  a  more open-architected stakeholder forum.\n\nOur  Executive  Committee  was  stable  in  the  year,  but  in April  2024 we saw the retirement of Group Chief Operating Officer Jens SchuIte-Bockum after seven years of inspirational leadership. We warmly welcome Selorm Adadevoh (previously MTN Ghana CEO), as our new Group Chief Commercial Officer, entrusted with continuing our purpose-driven growth.\n\nWe have strengthened our approach to screening director appointments to both the Group and its Opcos through a process conducted under the oversight of the Directors Affairs and Governance Committee, which I chair. This committee has spent much time on succession planning and looking to the future, particularly given the Group's strategic trajectory. The issue of 'overboarding' continues to be a topic that attracts stakeholder attention and in late 2023, the Board approved key principles regarding the number of directorships held by members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11\n\n## Looking ahead and appreciation\n\nIn June 2024, we will mark 30 years of connecting people and  creating  value.  As  we  continue  to  navigate  the macro-challenges in our trading environment, we reflect with both pride and humility on the progress of the business over the  past  three  decades.  This  has  been  powered  by  the dedication and resilience of MTNers, as well as the support of so many different people and institutions, including customers, governments  and  regulators,  investors,  suppliers  and  civil society. This embodies our ethos of cultivating partnerships for progress in our markets.\n\nIn the year ahead, among the key items that will inform Board deliberations are:\n\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical developments and impacts, including those from elections taking place across the world and in some of our markets. These will also inform our stakeholder engagements and partnerships with our nation-state hosts.\n- \u00b7 Progress against our commitments of Ambition 2025 , in particular the structural separation of our fintech and fibre businesses and our work to further develop our digital offerings.\n- \u00b7 Advancing our governance agenda, including improving subsidiary governance; succession planning; responding to the Board evaluation; and reviewing the Board appointment and vetting process.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank all stakeholders for their support and look forward to engaging with you in 2024. MTN will work to ensure that no one is left behind as we continue with the focused execution of the Ambition 2025 strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

How did this impact MTN?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe macroeconomic environment was challenging in 2023. There are a few factors worth highlighting in this regard particularly devaluation of the naira against the US dollar, which was the strongest headwind to our business. Despite these  effects,  we  are  encouraged  by  the  solid  underlying operational momentum and momentum of the business, as well as progress in key strategic initiatives. We believe we are well positioned to continue delivering on our growth ambitions over the medium term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  blended  inflation  rate  across  our  markets  remained elevated and averaging 16.7%, from 15.1% in 2022. This put pressure on our customers' spending power, which impacted demand for services. Higher inflation also directly impacted our business by increasing the cost of doing business, as well as higher interest rates - as central banks intervened to curb inflation - which increased our cost of debt (unpacked by the CFO  on  page  58).  Encouragingly,  we  noted  a  peak  in  the inflation cycle in some of our markets, such as South Africa, Ghana and Uganda. We expect slowing inflation to be more supportive of our medium-term outlook.\n\nCompounding the effects of inflation, local currencies were volatile, with limited availability of hard currency, especially in Nigeria. In 2023, the US dollar appreciated by 97% against the naira, resulting in a closing rate of N907/$ at the end of the year (December 2022: N461/$) - as mentioned, this had the biggest impact on our business in the year. This followed the liberalisation of exchange rates in the country in June 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand had a material impact on our profit and loss and balance sheet. Despite the short-term volatility and effects we are seeing, we are optimistic that the structural policy changes being implemented in Nigeria will be positive for the country and  our  business  in  the  medium  to  longer  term.  We  also navigated a paucity of foreign exchange in some key markets, which made it more challenging to upstream dividends and management fees (refer to page 58 for the Q&A with the CFO).\n\nFrom  a  geopolitical  standpoint,  we  saw  a  rise  in  tensions globally  and  within  the  African  continent.  In  addition  to conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and parts of West Africa, the crisis in Sudan also deepened, and we extend our deepest sympathy to those impacted by the conflict there. From a business perspective, this precipitated fuel shortages, power outages and disruptions to network availability in Sudan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this context, how did MTN perform in 2023?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Subscribers increased by 2.0% to 294.8m\n- + Active data subscribers increased by 9.3% to 149.7m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Data traffic increased by 26.3% to 14 737 petabytes. +\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoMo monthly active users increased by 5.0% to 72.5m\n\nFintech transaction volumes increased by 32.2% to 17.6bn\n\n+\n\nNotwithstanding  the  macro-volatility  and  challenges,  MTN maintained  a  resilient  performance  in  2023,  with  solid underlying operating momentum.

Data traffic on MTN's networks, excluding JVs, grew by more than a third (or by just over a quarter, including JVs). Usage improved to more than 6.1GB per user per month (or 8.6GB including JVs). To sustain this growth, as well as network coverage and quality, we deployed capex (excluding leases) of R41 billion.\n\nActive MoMo users increased by 5% to 72.5 million - a quarter of the total customer base. The volume of fintech transactions increased by around a third to 17.6 billion, with the value of transactions up 47.4%* to US$272 billion, driven by the growth of  advanced  services  including  payments,  BankTech  and remittance solutions.\n\nMTN's  financial  performance  is  detailed  by  the  CFO  on page 58, but among the key highlights, Group service revenue grew by 13.5%* to R210.1 billion and EBITDA was up by 9.8%* to R90.5 billion.\n\n- ^ Increased by 10.2% , excluding joint ventures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAgainst the challenging macroenvironment, what were the main highlights from MTN's execution of the Ambition 2025 strategy?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBefore delving into our broader strategic progress, it is worth highlighting the notable headway in 2023 made by MTN South Africa on its network resilience. As this was a key focus area of the business to improve network availability in the context of ongoing loadshedding in the country. By year-end, MTN SA had improved the availability of its network to 95% in even the higher stages of loadshedding, with availability up to around 98%  on  sites  where  resilience  was  implemented.  We  are pleased with this progress, which was ahead of schedule and supported  an  improvement  in  the  Opco's  operational performance in 2023.\n\nIn terms of our Group-wide strategic priorities more generally, these are detailed on pages 71 to 88; and among the highlights in 2023 were progress in building the largest and most valuable platforms. In fintech, we are excited about the partnership agreements  secured  with  Mastercard,  particularly the commercial  agreements,  which  we  expect  will  support  the\n\naccelerated  growth  of  the  business.  Early  in  2024,  we concluded the definitive agreements for Mastercard to invest up to US$200 million for a minority equity stake in MTN Group Fintech at a valuation of US$5.2 billion.\n\nWe also gained traction with the structural separation of the fibre  business  in  2023,  with  Bayobab,  securing  regulatory clearances and new fibre operating licences in markets like Uganda, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Central African Republic. Bayobab also acquired the fibre network of MTN Zambia in a sale-andleaseback arrangement, while the work to progress Project East2West was commenced in partnership with infrastructure investment platform Africa50.\n\nWhat was particularly pleasing in progressing our platform strategy was our ability to leverage partnerships to enable faster  scaling  of  these  growth  drivers  in  line  with  our philosophy ( partnerships for progress ). We will continue to look for strategic partnerships to accelerate the execution of Ambition 2025 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  our  priority  to  simplify  and  transform  the  portfolio,  we finalised the sale of MTN Afghanistan, which completed the Group's planned exit of consolidated subsidiaries in the Middle East.  We  also  accepted  an  unsolicited  offer,  subject  to conditions precedent, including regulatory approvals for  MTN's  equity  interests  in  MTN  Guinea-Bissau  and MTN Guinea-Conakry.\n\nWe  made  good  progress  in  advancing  key  sustainability initiatives and achieving our strategic priority to create shared value (see details on the next page). Overall we believe that the strides  we  continued  to  make  in  our  strategy  execution position the business well to weather the current volatility in the short term and deliver on our growth ambitions over the medium and long terms.\n\nMTN Group President and CEO Ralph Mupita receives the Corporate Social Responsibility Award on behalf of MTN at the Africa-America  Institute's 70 th Anniversary Gala and Awards Ceremony on the margins of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

What progress did MTN make in this regard?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs mentioned, creating shared value with ESG at the core is critical and is one of our four strategic priorities. On page 10, the Chairman covers much of the progress in this regard in 2023,  and  I  also  direct  readers  to  a  more  comprehensive review of our sustainability performance on page 86, including the improved scores with our focus ESG raters and rankers.\n\n## Doing for planet\n\nIn terms of our eco-responsibility priorities, we achieved a 13.1% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023. This is part of our environmental commitment to reach Net Zero emissions by 2040. We are also prioritising the reduction in  Scope  3  emissions,  with  a  fifth  of  our  suppliers  by expenditure already having committed to setting their own emission-reduction targets by 2026.\n\n## Doing for people\n\nDiversity and inclusion are fundamental to MTN's values, and we  continue  to  advance  gender  equality.  In  2023,  women represented 40% of our workforce, unchanged from 2022, but on track to meet our 2030 gender parity target. We also closely track women in leadership, which was 28% in 2023 vs our 2025 target of 30%, and women in technology, which at 24% in 2023 was ahead of our 2025 target of 21%. We remain focused on fostering  an  environment  where  women  are  meaningfully supported  to  thrive,  grow  and  contribute  to  our  collective success.\n\nWe are dedicated to advancing internet access in rural and remote areas to promote digital and financial inclusion. In 2023, we achieved broadband coverage of 89.2% (2022: 87.8%) against a target of 95% by 2025. This brought connectivity to an additional 8.4 million people in 2023 by deploying 6 600 sites in rural areas. Our social and economic contribution of approximately R159 billion in 2023 made a meaningful impact on lives and livelihoods in our markets. In aligning with national and continental priorities in the year, we invested more than R195 million in corporate social investment (CSI) programmes across communities in our host nations. Our flagship initiative is the MTN Skills Academy, which empowers individuals in eight markets to participate in their economies as producers, consumers and innovators in digital technologies.\n\n## Doing it right\n\nIn 2023, we once again exceeded our target for reputation, with a score of 79.5% in our annual Reputation Index Survey of stakeholders. This is above our target of 75% and outstrips most international reputation index benchmarks. To support the  widespread  adoption  of  the  new  IFRS  S1  and  S2 investor-focused standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board, MTN Group has pledged to begin adopting these standards. We see this as an opportunity to understand our sustainability-related risks and opportunities better and to streamline our sustainability reporting processes to meet the needs of our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are MTN's key focus areas ahead?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur  operating  context  -  detailed  on  pages  15  to  17  -  is expected to remain challenging and uncertain in the short term. As noted, we are starting to see inflation subside in key markets, which we believe will benefit the business. In addition, we believe the structural policy interventions implemented in Nigeria  bode  well  for  medium  to  longer-term  stability  and growth of that country.  In this context, we are encouraged by the resilience of our business to navigate the current macrovolatility  and  will  continue  to  execute  our  commercial  and strategic initiatives. To further safeguard our medium- and long-term prospects, we are focused on some key priorities that  underpin  the  execution  of  our  growth  outlook  and strategy.\n\nMTN  SA will  focus  on  completing  its  network  resilience programme in the short term to sustain improved network availability and quality that underpins the momentum we saw in 2023 and the medium-term recovery of the business. The Opco will, thus, explore avenues to drive further resilience and power efficiencies in its network. We will focus on commercial initiatives  in  MTN  SA  to  drive  growth,  including  sustaining prepaid momentum and acceleration of the device strategy to support  our  data  ambitions.  While  we  expect  the  latter  to temporarily slow the recovery profile of MTN SA's EBITDA margin in the short term, it will support medium-term growth and profitability. With a keen focus on efficiencies, MTN SA will prioritise returning top-line growth and the EBITDA margin to targeted medium-term ranges over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMTN  Nigeria remains  committed  to  accelerating  service revenue growth, improving profitability and strengthening its financial position, particularly the negative retained earnings and equity position reported as at 31 December 2023. To this end, the engagements with regulatory authorities on muchneeded tariff increases for the industry remain a key shortterm priority; and there is comprehensive work in progress to reduce and mitigate forex exposures impacting the business, including  tower  operating  costs.  MTN  Nigeria  will  unlock efficiencies to drive operating leverage, re-establish earnings growth, sustain strong free cash flow generation and restore its reserves and balance sheet position over the medium term.\n\nLed  by MTN  Ghana , we  will  work  to  capture  growth opportunities in our broader Markets portfolio by investing in connectivity and further developing platforms. For our fintech business,  our  priority  is  to  drive  the  expansion  of  the ecosystem  to  support  growth  in  usage  and  monetisation. Through  focused  commercial  interventions  and  leveraging our distribution, we will accelerate the scaling of the business. More  broadly  within  our  portfolio,  price  optimisation  and regulatory  discussions  regarding  tariff  increases  remain ongoing priorities.\n\nThe execution of our platform strategy has gained encouraging traction and momentum. Following the Mastercard agreement, we  will  continue  to  explore  opportunities  for  other  valueenhancing  partnerships  and  investments  in  our  platforms over the medium term. More broadly, we will accelerate the commercial  monetisation  within  our  platforms  as  they continue  to  scale.  The  ongoing  efforts  in  our  localisation programmes - particularly Ghana and Uganda - are also key to creating shared value.\n\nThe financial resilience of our business is another ongoing theme and priority; the CFO Q&A (page 58) provides further detail on our continued drive to realise expense efficiencies and maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity.\n\nWe are encouraged by our business's medium and long-term prospects and have, therefore, reiterated our overall mediumterm guidance framework. The only change is a simplification of the fintech measure (see page 21).\n\n<!-- image -->",

We evaluated how developments in the operating context impact our strategy execution in the short, medium and long term as well as the mitigations required and the opportunities presented. In addition to the broader global environment, we consider our operating context in terms of how we manage the Group: South Africa and Nigeria; as well as our Markets portfolio - spearheaded by Ghana - namely WECA, SEA and MENA:\n\n## South Africa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSouth Africa is an attractive, relatively stable and mature market that offers particular opportunities in data, network sharing and enterprise services despite prevailing economic and sociopolitical pressures.\n\n## Macroeconomic/sociopolitical\n\n- \u00b7 The economy grew by 0.6%. Inflation averaged 6.0% (2022: 6.8%), although the trend moderated in H2. The US dollar appreciated by an average of 12.5% against the rand, which impacted the cost of imports and also fed into inflation.\n- \u00b7 Power shortages continued to impact the economy, putting pressure on consumers and business. In 2023, there were 335 days of loadshedding, from 205 in 2022.\n- \u00b7 General elections in May 2024 could present some uncertainties.\n\n## Competitive/regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 MTN has the second-largest market share in an increasingly data-dominant market where prepaid growth in the market has been muted in the past five years in a highly competitive environment. Postpaid has remained relatively resilient, although MVNOs have continued to be a feature in the competitive and pricing environments.\n- \u00b7 Ability to increase prices - The regulatory environment largely enables operators to manage pricing, both to remain competitive and recover escalating opex and capex requirements.\n- \u00b7 5G remains an exciting and opportunity for growth, particularly FWA/ HBB. Industrial use cases show potential; handsets and coverage are the key dependency for consumer use cases.\n- \u00b7 Home - The sector relies on the infrastructure of two operators. Fixed wireless access (FWA) is popular among fixed operators, but fibre to the home (FTTH) connections are growing faster.\n- \u00b7 Fintech - The country's advanced banking sector poses challenges to more rapid scaling, however MTN is driving growth through compelling and niche offerings.\n- \u00b7 Network resilience has been a key focus of operators' network investments.

Challenges in the ST include the naira's depreciation, forex shortages and elevated inflation.\n\n## Macroeconomic/sociopolitical\n\n- \u00b7 Economic growth slowed to 2.7% in 2023 from 3.1% in 2022. The floating of the naira in June 2023 led to a 96.7% devaluation, severe forex liquidity constraints and higher inflation (28.9%) and interest rates. For 2024, the growth projection is seen at 3.2% and inflation at 26.3%. The naira is expected to stabilise as forex liquidity improves.\n- \u00b7 Oil supply challenges and commodity price volatility create uncertainty for fiscal revenue, and hence government debt and spending.\n- \u00b7 Unemployment and underemployment mean social stability is in focus.\n\n## Competitive/regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 MTN is the market leader, with credible competition from the next-largest operator. Customers continue to shift from conventional voice to data-rich services.

Given elevated inflation and energy prices and volatile exchange rates, an appropriate level of pricing is required for the and\n- sustainability of network investment and the industry. In the ST, tariff reviews will be necessary to help operators navigate the severe volatility playing out in the macro environment.\n- \u00b7 5G - MTN was the first operator to launch 5G network in Nigeria, providing coverage in key cities in the six geopolitical regions in all states.\n- \u00b7 Home - The FTTX market is nascent, however we have expanded our HBB penetration, leveraging our 5G fixed wireless access devices, mobile broadband solutions and FTTH connectivity.\n- \u00b7 Fintech - MTN faces competitive headwinds from telco and OTT operators, however is poised for robust and sustained growth over the MT and LT.

MTN Ghana is doing well to manage risks and drive growth given the macro challenges, including elevated inflation and FX volatility, headwinds to economic expansion as well as greater regulatory scrutiny since being designated as a significant market power (SMP).\n\n## Macroeconomic/sociopolitical\n\n- \u00b7 The economy faced several challenges, including elevated inflation, with an average monthly rate of 40.3% (2022: 31.5%). Higher utility costs along with the 38.5% depreciation of the cedi contributed to the challenges.\n- \u00b7 Economic growth slowed to 2.9% in 2023 from 3.1% in 2022. Unemployment and interest rates remain high. Wages are not keeping up with increase in prices, exacerbating poverty (27%).\n- \u00b7 A July 2023 by-election led to a hung parliament, likely slowing reforms.\n\n## Competitive/regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 MTN is the leader in the market, with strong growth in data and fintech services. MTN Ghana has been declared as an SMP, which attracts greater regulatory oversight and the requirement to implement remedies in line with regulatory directives. SIM re-registration - Completed in May 2023, this led to a decline in the overall subscriber base.\n- \u00b7 Consolidation - One competitor rebranded in 2023 and another smaller operator was acquired by a large competitor.\n- \u00b7 Ability to increase prices - Amid elevated inflation, MTN has been able to effect regular regulator-approved tariff adjustments to safeguard its sustainability amid elevated opex and capex burdens.\n- \u00b7 5G - Economic challenges have resulted in a decline in investment from smaller operators in the market, as well as a delay in the rollout of 5G.\n- \u00b7 Home - We see opportunity to leverage our network to partake in this segment of the market.\n- \u00b7 Fintech - The market leader, MTN MoMo's ecosystem and user numbers continue to grow with greater uptake of advanced services.\n\n## Relevant risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSources: National statistics offices; Fitch; Standard Bank; Carnegie; World Bank, IMF; AfDB; Reuters and Enterprise Risk Management Academy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WECA\n\nWECA is home to eight MTN operations, including Ghana (see separate commentary). Operations are impacted by political uncertainties and regional conflicts, although the WECA boasts comparatively well-established fintech businesses, supported by stable inflation and FX in some of the larger markets.\n\n## Macroeconomic/sociopolitical\n\n- \u00b7 Economic growth slowed in 2023. Unemployment remains high, as do budget deficits. In 2024, economic growth is expected to pick up, inflation is seen moderating and current account balances are forecast to improve.\n- \u00b7 Political instability is a feature of several countries in the region, with recent coups in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea-Conakry, Mali and Niger impacting livelihoods and investment. Although MTN operates in only one of these markets, the rest of these countries neighbour MTN markets, presenting regional geopolitical risks.\n\n## Competitive/regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 MTN is the leader in five of the eight WECA markets (and second in the others), where mobile uptake is strong and fintech services are popular, with a contribution of 27.7% to service revenue.\n- \u00b7 The regulatory environment for telecoms, digital and fintech is complex and dynamic, but governments are also intent on increasing connectivity and digitising societies. Data sovereignty and privacy are increasingly topical.\n- \u00b7 Ability to increase prices - Amid economic and regulatory pressure, increasing prices is difficult.\n- \u00b7 5G - Competitors are launching 5G in major cities in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Benin.\n- \u00b7 Home - Investment in fibre is increasing, driving penetration as data demand grows.\n- \u00b7 Fintech - Sector is growing, with increased adoption and investment and the entry of a new competitor leading to an evolution of fees by incumbents.\n\n## Relevant risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll material matters are relevant to all our markets\n\n\uf07d\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A\n\n+\n\n## Our market context continued\n\n## SEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSEA hosts six MTN operations, including equity-accounted Mascom and MTN eSwatini. The operations continue to deliver healthy operational and financial results in the context of increased regulatory scrutiny and competitive intensity, as well as the crisis in South Sudan. The region offers an exciting demographic opportunity, with a fast-growing, youthful population, with growing data and 4G coverage, fintech and digital adoption.\n\n## Macroeconomic/sociopolitical\n\n- \u00b7 Economic growth was slow in 2023. The annual blended inflation in SEA averaged 10.0%, compared to 14.3% in 2022. Consumer spending was limited by inflation and low consumer disposable incomes across the region. This was exacerbated in South Sudan by the displacement crisis and in Rwanda by currency depreciation and aggressive regulatory interventions.\n- \u00b7 Except for South Sudan, the SEA society is mostly stable, despite widespread unemployment and inequality as well as, in eSwatini, the risk of more anti-monarchy protests.\n- \u00b7 The removal of Uganda from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) after the passing of the Anti-Homosexuality Act may impact Ugandan exports and tourism.\n\n## Competitive/regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 We are the market leader in all our SEA Opcos. Regulations are increasing, with Uganda imposing a 5% tax on foreign companies providing digital communications and Rwanda considering levying VAT on online services.\n- \u00b7 Consolidation - This trend remains a feature in some of our SEA markets.\n- \u00b7 Ability to increase prices - While there is scope to engage regulators on price increases in some markets, competition pressures are a key consideration.\n- \u00b7 5G - MTN is rolling out 5G in Uganda and Zambia. In Zambia, a new operator has also launched 5G.\n- \u00b7 Home - The market is nascent, but strong data growth is seen driving demand for fibre networks.\n- \u00b7 Fintech - Ongoing regulatory obligations and interventions remain key factors being managed in SEA, with the growth outlook underpinned by rapidly increasing adoption and usage of fintech services.\n\n## Relevant risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MENA\n\nMTN operations in MENA are in Sudan, Afghanistan and Iran (minority-held joint venture). We announced the completion of our exit from Afghanistan with FY 2023 results. High inflation and rising food prices, as well as FX volatility, pose challenges to economies across the region, as do the risks of a spillover from the conflict in Gaza. The large youthful population and the growing middle class offer opportunities for growth.\n\n## Macroeconomic/sociopolitical\n\n- \u00b7 Since the coup in October 2021, the political environment in Sudan has been unstable and many services - including access to the internet - have been disrupted. In Iran, the sociopolitical and economic conditions have been tough, putting consumer spending under pressure. The risk of exposure to sanctions continues.\n- \u00b7 Economic growth slowed in 2023, and the economy of Sudan contracted. The economies of Iran and Sudan were assessed to be hyperinflationary.\n\n## Competitive/regulatory\n\n- \u00b7 The mobile market across these three MTN operations differs markedly, with penetration highest in Iran and lowest in Afghanistan. MTN is the market leader in Afghanistan, and the second-largest operator in the other two MENA markets. Early in 2024, MTN Group completed the disposal of MTN Afghanistan.\n- \u00b7 The regulatory environment for telecoms, digital and fintech is complex and dynamic, but governments are also intent on increasing connectivity and digitising societies. Data sovereignty and privacy are increasingly topical.\n- \u00b7 Ability to increase prices - Obtaining regulatory approval for pricing increases has been challenging in the current economic environment.\n- \u00b7 Home - Investment in fibre is driving penetration as data demand grows.\n- \u00b7 Fintech - Sector is growing by 20%, with increased adoption and investment.\n\n## Relevant risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nR\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details of the ways in which we are responding to and managing the factors in our operating context, see page 70 to 88.

Engagements with regulatory authorities on much-needed tariff increases for the industry remain ongoing and a priority, and there is comprehensive work in progress to reduce and mitigate the foreign exchange exposures impacting tower operating costs particularly.

In turn, the environment and society affect the Group and our performance ('outside-in'). These impacts may be positive or negative and vary with time. Our approach to 'double materiality' is to disclose the material 'outside-in' impacts in the Integrated Report and the 'inside-out' impacts in the Sustainability Report.\n\nOur materiality determination process, led by Investor Relations, is subject to Executive Committee and Board review. It identifies our key material matters and the collective themes under which they fall. In the course of this comprehensive process, we evaluated more than 150 individual matters potential impacting our business. Given the dynamic environment in which we operate, our top material matters can change.\n\n## Double materiality determination process\n\nTo identify material matters for inclusion in our annual reporting suite, each year we run an independently facilitated materiality survey. Informed by the survey data, members of our executive and senior management teams participate in a multi-disciplinary workshop to discuss and prioritise our material issues. Through this process, we identify all those matters that have a significant bearing on enterprise value (financial materiality), as well as our most significant impacts on people, society and the environment (impact materiality).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentification\n\nImpact evaluation\n\nPrioritisation\n\nStrategic integration\n\n22\n\n## Our materiality determination process is as follows:\n\n## Identify potentially relevant material topics for consideration.\n\nExtensive research to identify a wide range of material topics, considering:\n\n- \u00b7 Global and industry-specific sustainability matters identified by SASB, GSMA, GRI and the JSE.\n- \u00b7 Matters identified in our 2022 reporting suite.\n- \u00b7 Matters raised by stakeholders via Reputation Index Survey.\n- \u00b7 Internal documentation, including board packs and risk registers.\n- \u00b7 Matters disclosed in peers' reporting.\n- \u00b7 Emerging matters identified in the media.\n\n## Evaluate the extent to which good or bad management  affects internal and external outcomes.\n\nInternal stakeholders assess and score each potential material topic using a multifaceted ranking system that evaluates impacts from internal and external perspectives. Factors considered include:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial performance.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory compliance.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder expectations.\n- \u00b7 Innovation, growth and competitiveness.\n- \u00b7 Scale, scope and character of external impacts.\n\nThe resulting data is aggregated to ascertain which topics have the most significant financial and external impact ratings.\n\n## Prioritise matters based on the likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of impact.\n\nAt a special workshop, senior representatives of all key departments discuss and agree on the final rankings of material matters.\n\nThe final scores are submitted to the GCEO, GCFO, Exco and Board for review.\n\nThe  outcome  of  this  process  guides  the  content  of  our  integrated, sustainability and financial reporting.\n\n## Ensure alignment and integration with strategic priorities.\n\nWe respond to our material matters by putting in place:\n\n- \u00b7 Appropriate management actions to capitalise on factors that offer opportunity for greater value creation.\n- \u00b7 Interventions to mitigate those matters with potential to disrupt value creation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The survey sees  MTN  improving  its  association  score  relative  to competitors  in  10  of  15  markets.  Consequently,  our brand  has  either  extended  its  lead  over  its  main competitor or narrowed the gap.\n\n'MTN is a very innovative company. I love the outlook of the app.' - Ghana customer.\n\nIn taking a tier 1 and regional view, given the impact of geopolitics, economic slowdown, relative instability as well as policy and regulatory ambiguity, it is not surprising that the WECA region registered a marginal reputational decrease. The tier 1 markets (Nigeria and South Africa) both registered a reputational improvement, despite the global and local challenges confronted by the markets. The SEA markets experienced a stable year-on-year reputational score, despite some changes in the national executives and regulators in markets such as Zambia and South Sudan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholders  also  expressed  confidence  in  their relationship health with an above-target score of 77.5, which is also above the in general relationship health of between 65 and 70 which is deemed as adequate to good.  Although  we  have  significant  reserves  of relationship capital, we have lost ground with suppliers, the investment community, regulators and policymakers and  civil  society.  Thus,  going  forward,  engagement strategies will pay  particular attention to these categories of stakeholders with an added emphasis on some  markets.  Additionally,  we  shall  pay  particular attention  to  stakeholder  perceptions  of  how  well  we perform on material issues that they have identified as being the most important to them.\n\n'Achieving  revenue  growth  while  managing costs remains critically important. Telcos are capital intensive and therefore it is important to balance  capex  against  operating  cash  flow. Ideally we want to see further de-risking of the balance  sheet  and  paydown  of  dollar  debt. Continued rationalisation of the portfolio and monetisation of assets is also key to the Group's value unlock strategy.' - An MTN investor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These actions resulted in MTN receiving a Merit award in the Top 40 category at the 2023 CGISA/JSE Integrated Reporting Awards and maintaining an 'Excellent' rating at the EY Excellence in Integrated Reporting 2023 awards for the second year in a row. Lastly, The 2022 Integrated Report was also recognised by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as a leading example of good international practices in the field of integrated reporting. MTN was ranked in the top five in the 2023 Intellidex Investor Relations Survey.\n\nCapital market days in 2023, hosted by the MTN Group and MTN Nigeria, where we unpacked the progress made on our strategy, detailed our prospects and our plans for the MTN of tomorrow.\n\nOur annual governance roadshow gave investors the opportunity to engage with the Group Chairman, lead independent director and social, ethics and sustainability committee Chairman on remuneration, governance, ESG, strategy and risk.\n\nImproved and deepened stakeholder intelligence is being undertaken so as to better handle the perceived risks and instabilities in some African markets.\n\nAccelerated engagements are planned for our investor community to better align expectations and realities.\n\n## Survey Results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeetings, webcasts, roadshows, conferences.\n\nInterim and annual results presentations, quarterly trading updates and capital market days.\n\nAnnual governance roadshow.\n\nSENS announcements, our investor relations mailbox and investor website page.\n\nPerception audits and dipstick surveys.\n\nIntegrated annual report.\n\n76 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAssessment used\n\nRIS\n\nAffected SDGs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although African economies have been challenged by foreign currency availability, inflation and high debt, there was some cautious optimism with the African Development Bank (AfDB) projecting 4.1% growth for 2023/24 against a 2.6% global growth outlook.\n\nFrom an ICT sector perspective, the Congress noted the lack of digital literacy and access to technology had exacerbated existing disparities in education, healthcare, agriculture and economic development, thus perpetuating poverty and inequality.\n\nTechnology and innovation are critical ingredients to help Africa develop. The CEOs of six of Africa's largest MNOs and Smart Africa convened to consider opportunities and challenges for deeper partnerships with African governments to drive digital and financial inclusion.\n\nThe CEOs presented a communique to HE Paul Kagame, the President of the Republic of Rwanda, as a champion for AU reforms and Smart Africa. The CEOs called on African leaders and policymakers to partner on digital development with the mobile industry by reimagining existing structures and developing targeted new policies that accelerate the positive and inclusive impacts of mobile technologies to close the investment and usage gaps.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe three-pronged advocacy strategy and common platform focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 Tax rationalisation for the mobile industry through the development of targeted fiscal policy reforms that support economic growth and digital development, deepening digital and financial inclusion and aligned with national targets. (For example, removal of tax on low-cost smartphones and sector-specific tax).\n- \u00b7 Regulatory support to implement the recommendations of the UN Broadband Commission's '21st Century Financing Models for Bridging Broadband Connectivity Gaps' to promote investment models for digital infrastructure, which include all digital economy beneficiaries.\n- \u00b7 Climate action policies to improve access to renewable electricity for corporate buyers are essential for the mobile industry to achieve its climate targets.",

We prioritise risk management as a fundamental skill, fostering a risk-aware culture through top-down, bottom-up and emerging risk scanning methods. This approach guarantees comprehensive coverage, alignment with our business scale and the efficacy of our mitigation strategies, focusing on the most significant risks after considering potential event likelihoods, impacts and the strength of current mitigations and controls.\n\nThe MTN Board and its committees are committed to thorough oversight of our integrated risk management framework, engaging consistently with management to cover a broad range of activities and affirm risk management effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, Opco-level risks receive detailed attention at both the Opco executive committees and Opco audit and risk committees, ensuring local concerns are adequately addressed and integrated into our wider risk management strategy.\n\n## Our risk management approach\n\n## Top-down approach\n\n## Bottom-up approach\n\nIdentifies strategic-level risks\n\nand cascades these downwards Enables top management to make better risk-based decisions\n\nMTN Group principal risks\n\nIdentifies risks at a process, functional operational level\n\nDrives robust risk management across the enterprise\n\nMitigation actions\n\nStress testing + scenario planning\n\nMaintaining a stable risk profile across MTN GROUP through comprehensive and sound risk management\n\nPrincipal risk universe and risk appetite\n\nCompliance management\n\nCombined assurance\n\nBusiness resilience strategies\n\n+\n\n+\n\n## Emerging risk scanning\n\nSupports our proactive strategy focused on continuously identifying and assessing new risks before they fully materialise, helping MTN stay ahead of potential threats and adapt accordingly.\n\nBoard review and approval\n\nBased on risk appetite enabling informed riskbased review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A\n\nll about MTN\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\nS\n\ntrategic and financial review\n\n+\n\n## How we manage risk continued\n\n## Principal risk universe and risk appetite\n\nA critical aspect of ERM is employing a structured principal risk universe. Initially, this risk universe establishes a two-level categorisation  system,  facilitating  consistent  risk  mapping  across  all  Opcos  through  bottom-up  integration,  ensuring uniformity. Simultaneously, from a top-down viewpoint, it aids management in ensuring that risk identification is exhaustive. Being dynamic, the principal risk universe undergoes regular updates to align with shifts in strategy, structure and operations.\n\nMTN's risk appetite framework and related declarations are made actionable by assigning specific risk preferences to each principal risk. This process is crucial for defining mitigation strategies and allocating resources effectively. For each principal risk, we formulate KRIs and establish tolerance thresholds to actualise and implement the Board's risk appetite directives.\n\nFurthermore,  we  integrate  risk  appetite  and  tolerance  thresholds  within  our  business  planning  and  decision-making processes. This integration is vital for adapting to an ever-changing business landscape and ensuring our exposure to risk remains within our predetermined preferences, especially as we aim to achieve our Ambition 2025 objectives.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario planning\n\nBeyond categorising risks and identifying principal risks for thorough risk detection, our proactive risk management approach integrates stress testing, reverse stress testing, and catastrophic scenario analysis. We subject various budget aspects at both the Opco and MTN Group levels to stress testing, creating high-level response strategies for each potential situation. The catastrophic scenarios we examine include significant devaluation in a key market's currency, challenges in renewing licences or facing nationalisation in key markets, the collapse of a major network provider, a debilitating cyber-attack on extensive network sections, and swift technological shifts from traditional voice services to data/digital platforms. We also conduct reverse stress tests to identify conditions that could precipitate a severe liquidity crunch, reinforcing our commitment to robust and anticipatory risk management.\n\n## Compliance management\n\nOur dedication to a proactive compliance strategy led to enhancements in our compliance programme, ensuring adherence to obligations and anticipation of potential risks. We prioritised compliance monitoring and testing, assessing the robustness of our control environment. Our commitment was evident in the advancement of our internal control improvement programme. We also made significant progress in executing our data privacy initiative and augmenting data protection protocols. Moreover, we intensified efforts to verify trade partner compliance, emphasising the importance of maintaining high compliance standards across all partnerships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business resilience\n\nWe  dedicate  our  efforts  to  fostering  a  business continuity culture and enhancing resilience maturity across our markets, efforts that have been instrumental in  sustaining  our  ISO  22301  Business  Continuity Management certification in key markets. Our ongoing investment in various initiatives aimed at bolstering our recovery capabilities underscores our commitment to  preparedness  and  adaptability  throughout  MTN. Specifically, we have implemented a robust network resilience improvement plan in South Africa to augment network  availability  and  service  continuity  during loadshedding.  Additionally,  our  proactive  plan  to eliminate  single  points  of  failure  in  our  network infrastructure has significantly bolstered overall network  resilience,  minimising  vulnerabilities  and ensuring uninterrupted service delivery. In response to global  macroeconomic  fluctuations,  port  congestion and  supply  chain  vulnerabilities,  we  executed  a targeted supply chain resilience plan. We also engaged in comprehensive  executive  crisis  simulations  to evaluate  and  enhance  our  company's  response strategies, gleaning critical insights that informed the refinement  of  our  crisis  management  protocols. Furthermore, our intensified efforts in threat monitoring and risk intelligence, through external risk horizon  scanning,  have  enabled  us  to  detect  and forecast  emerging  trends  and  potential  threats, facilitating timely and effective risk mitigation.\n\n## Combined assurance\n\nMTN adopts a combined assurance approach to improve and maximise the effectiveness of risk, governance and control oversight in risk management. This guarantees that the range of assurance services, offered by both internal  and  external  entities,  effectively  covers  the significant risks the Group confronts. It also aims to confirm that appropriate controls are in place to mitigate these key risks within established risk thresholds.",

In 2023, these challenges included elevated inflation, rising interest rates significant forex volatility and rising energy expenditure. These were intensified by South Africa's power grid issues and the sharp depreciation of the Nigerian naira, adversely impacting investor confidence through currency devaluation, growing debt service burdens, and increased regulatory scrutiny. Foreign currency denominated capex commitments and Holdco debt in foreign currencies introduce further financial challenge. Moreover, forex shortage, particularly in Nigeria, impacts cash upstreaming planning.\n\nGeopolitically, MTN's operational context is influenced by conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East tensions, which bear consequential risks for global diplomacy and commerce, potentially driving up energy prices and disrupting global supply chains. The prospect of national elections across several MTN markets in 2024 raises concerns over physical security and social stability, essential for the protection of employees and customers and the achievement of strategic aims. In addition, regional instability poses direct and indirect challenges. The anticipated further depreciation of the naira in 2024 is likely to trigger another inflationary wave, underscoring the critical impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks on MTN's strategic objectives to deliver services, drive growth and maintain financial health.\n\n## Doing through mitigation and controls\n\n- \u00b7 Continued monitoring of political and economic shifts in high-risk markets, employing scenario planning and sensitivity analysis to bolster our strategic responses.\n- \u00b7 Establish and uphold robust business continuity strategies to safeguard operational resilience.\n- \u00b7 Leverage available foreign exchange strategies to mitigate currency exposure risks.\n- \u00b7 Secure ample committed financing facilities, ensuring each Opco can independently withstand market volatilities and sustain self-funding principles.\n- \u00b7 Prioritise the safety of our workforce and the security of our assets, ensuring uninterrupted business activities through stringent continuity management.\n- \u00b7 Adhere rigorously to global sanctions regulations, ensuring all operations remain within legal and ethical boundaries.\n- \u00b7 Conduct regular stress testing of our business plans against currency fluctuations to gauge potential impacts on profitability and shape informed strategic adjustments.\n- \u00b7 Increase the proportion of local currency obligations within Opcos to minimise vulnerabilities associated with exchange rate fluctuations.\n- \u00b7 Where feasible and judicious, transition significant contractual agreements to local currency denominations to lessen forex risks.\n- \u00b7 Facilitate the repatriation of dividends whenever conditions are favourable, enhancing financial flexibility and shareholder value.\n\n## Relevant material matters\n\n## Relevant capitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Doing in 2023\n\n## Opportunity\n\n- \u00b7 Addressed macroeconomic challenges with focused initiatives such as  supply chain advances.\n- \u00b7 Supported public-private partnerships and government programmes for socioeconomic advancement.\n- \u00b7 Boosted business resilience to meet targets.\n- \u00b7 Integrated political and economic analyses into risk and contingency planning.\n- \u00b7 Conducted stress tests for financial ratios and business plans against currency fluctuations.\n- \u00b7 Replaced trade lines with cash-backed letters of credit to lessen forex risks.\n- \u00b7 Applied hedging for foreign currency expenses and investments.\n\nTo address macroeconomic uncertainties around inflation, interest rates and currency volatility, MTN will continue Ambition 2025 initiatives relating to expense efficiencies and containment.\n\nMacro and geopolitical impacts on global supply chains reinforce the importance of initiatives to reduce supplier concentration risk and to modernise network elements better in the face of catastrophic supply chain shocks.\n\nIn the telco sector in general there is opportunity to enhance the positioning of our products and services as critical to national infrastructure and digital human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatural\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nIntellectual\n\nHuman Manufactured\n\nSocial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are dealing with rising expenses brought on by increases in the price of raw materials and disruptions in logistics. The situation in the Red Sea is especially urgent because Houthi rebel activities are endangering vital shipping routes, most notably the Suez Canal, which is a vital conduit for international trade and communication networks. The re-routing of ships around southern Africa considerably lengthens transit times and raises shipping costs, which may influence the price of imported telecom equipment and overall industry inflation. The possible risk of sabotage of undersea global internet cables in the Red Sea could lead to disruption of data and financial communications between Europe and Asia. Inflation and currency devaluation in our markets poses further risks to supplier payments. These kinds of circumstances emphasise the need for sophisticated risk management and the development of all-encompassing contingency plans to deal with possible delays in procurement, spikes in costs, and the requirement for adjustments in logistics. To add to the complexity, the everchanging landscape of cybersecurity threats and regulatory requirements highlights the necessity for a flexible and robust supply chain strategy to maintain operational dependability and consistent service.\n\n## Relevant material matters\n\n## Relevant capitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Doing in 2023\n\n## Opportunity\n\n- \u00b7 Updated supply chain resilience programme to review the impact of unpredictable events such as regional conflicts, trade route and port congestion, and raw material shortages.\n- \u00b7 Defined pre-emptive actions on upstream supply chain, freight and commodities to minimise the impact on operations.\n- \u00b7 Expanded business resilience controls on supply chain to include tracking of purchase orders, supplier risk management, payment terms and local market risks.\n- \u00b7 Ensured closer collaboration with suppliers to understand supply chain challenges, detect disruption risks and take proactive measures on the risks pertaining to the upstream supply chain, freight, supplier-specific constraints and the ringfencing of MTN-specific demand to ensure continuous supply to MTN.\n- \u00b7 Communicated updates and early warnings to internal stakeholders through regular supply chain newsletters.\n- \u00b7 Developed risk models and monitoring systems to support the supply chain resilience programme.\n- \u00b7 Further developed our digital solutions platform  to include new capabilities such as expansion of our supply chain control tower with order management systems of additional suppliers to monitor shipments in real time and intervene based on proactive alerts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMTN has an opportunity to succeed in supply chain robustness as a result of our experience with the Red Sea interruption and broader supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\nBy turning these challenges into strategic opportunities, MTN can improve our own sourcing and logistics approach and position ourselves as the industry leader in supply chain resilience for telecommunications.\n\nThis proactive approach enables the introduction of new supply routes, strategic supplier relationships and reinforced risk mitigation strategies, all of which can result in improved operational effectiveness and reduced exposure to supply chain constraints.\n\nUltimately, these developments may result in important advantages including lower costs, more dependability and a stronger position in the market, reaffirming MTN's dedication to quality and resilience in a challenging global environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman Manufactured\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Doing through mitigation and controls\n\n- \u00b7 Boost supply chain diversity.\n- \u00b7 Monitor trade policies.\n- \u00b7 Engage in strategic partnerships.\n- \u00b7 Synchronise and streamline operational tasks to yield both qualitative and financial benefits, such as providing real-time, comprehensive supply chain visibility and enable flexibility in reaction to dynamic markets and major events.\n- \u00b7 Development of supply chain operational strategies, implementation of robust risk management practices, end-to-end supply chain planning, and establishing oversight of large and complex capital-intensive projects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

How did this impact the financials?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Chairman (page 10) and the CEO (page 12) outlined our macro-context in 2023. Many market dynamics have been at play for some time, but they intensified in the year. Broadly, our financial performance was impacted by elevated inflation, forex volatility and paucity, and geopolitical instability. Given these headwinds, I am very encouraged by the Group's resilient financial performance in 2023.\n\nHigh inflation placed upward pressure on operating expenses, including our tower lease expenses. In Ghana, we had to apply hyperinflation  accounting  to  the  results  of  MTN  Ghana. Currency volatility affected our financial performance in terms of  the  stronger  average  rand  exchange  rate  versus  the currencies of the Opcos that had a negative impact on MTN's reported  growth  compared  to  the  growth  rate  in  constant\n\ncurrency. The weaker closing rand rate versus the US dollar and euro negatively impacted  our Holdco net debt.\n\nThe devaluation of the naira in Nigeria significantly impacted our results, including forex losses of R21.0 billion through the finance cost line in 2023. MTN Nigeria's results also included a restatement of 2022 financial results, reflecting the cumulative net effects of restating the lease liabilities, the deferred tax liabilities, the right-of-use assets, as well as the profit after tax from MTN Nigeria. This had a resultant impact on the Group as we translate into our reported currency, the rand.\n\nThis impacted the Group's 2022 opening balances of retained earnings (restated lower by R2.4 billion) and 2022 profit after tax (restated by R407 million). For 2022 earnings per share (EPS), the impact was 17 cents.\n\nIn 2023, we had asset impairments of R900 million for MTN Afghanistan (a remeasurement of non-current assets held for sale) and R746 million for MTN Sudan (a result of warehouse damage from the conflict and hyperinflation). These items impacted  our  expenses,  EBITDA  and  headline  EPS.  As mentioned,  we  are  pleased  with  our  overall  financial performance and resilience in this context, which positions us well to deliver on our growth and strategic ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt 13.5%*, service revenue growth to R210.1 billion was in line with our medium-term guidance and was supported by an expansion of 35.0%* in MTN Ghana, 22.1%* in MTN Nigeria, 2.5%  in  MTN  SA  and  healthy  growth  in  SEA  and  WECA.

The  EBITDA  margin  of  41.5%* (2022: 42.7%*) was affected by increased operating expenses resulting from higher inflation and forex devaluation. However, the extent of these impacts was moderated by the delivery of meaningful expense efficiencies (see below for details).\n\nReported headline earnings per share (HEPS) decreased by 72.3% to 315 cents (2022: restated 1 137 cents), hurt by net non-operational and once-off items of 888 cents - largely hyperinflation adjustments and forex losses stemming from the naira's devaluation. Adjusted HEPS declined by 9.5% to 1 203 cents, a resilient performance in the circumstances.\n\nWe continued investing in network capacity expansion, with R63.6 billion of capex on an IFRS 16 basis, a 12.0% increase. Capex (ex-leases) was up by 7.6% to R41.1 billion, including a hyperinflation  impact  of  R1.0  billion  and  R2.7  billion  of capitalised costs of the renewed Ericsson Converged Wallet deal in fintech. Capex intensity (ex-leases) was 18.6%, just above our medium-term target range of 15 to 18%.\n\nGroup  operating  free  cash  flow  decreased  by  6.1%  to R38.5  billion. Adjusting for licence renewals and spectrum acquisition, it was R45.9 billion. ROE  (adjusted for non-operational items, including hyperinflation) increased by 0.2 percentage points to 24.4%, reflecting the resilience of our business in a volatile environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\nUsing  a  base  of  2020,  we  had  previously  set  ourselves  a three-year target of unlocking at least R5 billion in expense efficiencies. By the end of December 2022, we had realised savings of R6.4 billion.\n\nWe focused on efficiencies and, in 2023, exceeded our target for the year of R1.5 billion by recording savings of R2.6 billion. These gains were led by MTN SA, WECA, MTN Nigeria and SEA. Most  came  from  general  and  administration  functions; network and IT; followed by sales and distribution, and marketing.\n\nIn the year, the ratio of total costs to revenue edged up to 58.6% from 57.4%, clearly illustrating the challenges of the operating environment. Given that macro-headwinds to our business remain, we are now busy with phase two of our expense efficiency programme - EEP 2.0 - with plans to save costs  of  R7  billion  to  R8  billion  over  three  years  starting in 2024.\n\nAmong  the  areas  we  are  targeting  are  a  review  and renegotiation  of  our  major  contracts,  including  our  tower lease contracts; decommissioning of legacy IT and simplification  of  those  contracts;  and  an  optimisation  of commission structures, as well as distribution channels.\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Savings realised by region\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "All about MTN\n\n## Q&A with the CFO continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMTN's financial resilience has been key to mitigating the risks of the operating environment. What have been the challenges, and areas of progress and focus?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the past few years, we have worked hard - and with success - to strengthen our balance sheet to absorb shocks in our  operating  environment  and  provide  the  flexibility  to capture opportunities and implement our strategic priorities. The business has benefited from faster deleveraging and derisking of the Holdco balance sheet, focused on reducing nonrand  debt.  And  I  have  already  highlighted  the  key  role  of expense efficiencies, which remain critical in the period ahead.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Group's net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.4x (2022: 0.3x) and net interest cover of 6.4x were well within covenant  thresholds  of  2.5x  and  of  no  less  than  5.0x, respectively. At 1.4x (2022: 0.8x), Holdco's leverage was within the guidance of 1.5x and compared favourably to the 2019 level  of  2.2x.  It  was  supported  by  R13.4  billion  in  cash upstreamed  from  operations.  However,  the  leverage  was negatively affected by the rand's depreciation, the effects of forex losses from our Eurobonds, as well as our election for scrip dividends from MTN Nigeria and MTN Ghana for FY 2022, the latter decision taken amid scarce forex in those markets. Other impacts were drawdowns from head office facilities, particularly  in  supporting  MTN  SA's  network  resilience programme.\n\nIn the year, we raised R24 billion in Holdco loan facilities to refinance maturing debt, manage the debt maturity profile and bolster Holdco liquidity. As part of our work to deleverage non-rand debt at the Holdco through a cash tender offer, we early redeemed US$353 million of the MTN 2024 Eurobonds, bringing the total redeemed to date to US$1.2 billion. The Holdco debt dollar:rand ratio improved to 23:77, well within our target of keeping debt denominated in foreign currencies to below 40%. We ended 2023 with a healthy Holdco liquidity position of R44.1 billion in cash and committed facilities.\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Is MTN's capital allocation framework still appropriate in the period ahead?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGiven the fundamental changes in our macro-environment, in 2023 we spent a lot of time looking at the framework to test it for continued relevance ahead. We concluded that it remains the right one, certainly in the near term. It is designed to help us deliver on our strategy, ranking the allocation of capital to ensure  the  best  returns  for  the  business  and  providing shareholders with an appropriate return on investment.\n\nContinuing  to  prioritise  investment  in  the  growth  of  our networks and platforms, for 2024 we target capex (ex-leases) of  R35  billion  to  R39  billion,  based  on  current  currency assumptions. Stabilising the leverage remains important, and we plan to settle more of our remaining Eurobonds in the period ahead. We will also maintain prudent management of our liquidity position.\n\nAs  part  of  total  shareholder  return,  the  dividend  remains critical. For FY 2024, in line with our dividend policy, the Board anticipates paying a minimum ordinary final dividend of at least 330cps after announcing full-year results in March 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Guided by our disciplined capital allocation framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Organic growth\n\nWell-invested networks\n\nand platforms\n\nImproving capex intensity\n\n## Faster deleveraging of Holdco leverage\n\nRebalancing the mix to have rand debt making up at least 60% of Holdco net debt\n\n## Return cash to shareholders through dividends\n\nAnticipate paying a minimum ordinary dividend of 330cps for FY 2024\n\n## Selective merger and acquisitions\n\nOpportunities aligned to the investment case, subject to strict risk and financial criteria\n\n## Share repurchases or special dividends\n\nOnly considered when other capital allocation priorities have been met\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Inflation averaged 6.0% in the year (2022: 6.8%), although the trend moderated in H2, recording 5.1% in December 2023 (December 2022: 7.2%). The US dollar appreciated by an average of 12.5% against the rand, which impacted the cost of imports and also fed into inflation. 2023 experienced more intense power outages, with a total of 335 loadshedding days compared to 205 in 2022.\n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  MTN  SA  continued  to  invest  in  the resilience  of  its  network,  strengthening  its  operations  and supporting resilient quarterly progression in service revenue growth  in  key  verticals,  driven  by  its  customer-centric commercial strategy execution.\n\nDuring  the  year,  MTN  SA  invested  R10.1  billion  of  capex (ex-leases), including its resilience plan to improve network availability  in  the  context  of  increased  loadshedding.  By December 2023, MTN SA's network availability had improved significantly and ahead of schedule, to approximately 95%. This translated into an improvement in customer satisfaction, with  the  NPS  on  network  recording  a  notable  increase. Our  efforts  have  narrowed  the  gap  to  the  competition, propelling us to gain network leadership in key regions such as Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n## Network resilience supported progressive quarterly performance improvements\n\nThe improved network availability promoted and enhanced customer experience, enabling MTN SA to drive its commercial strategy to support revenue growth.\n\nThis was underpinned by a 2.4% increase in subscribers to 37.4 million, with net additions of 893k for the year. The number of postpaid subscribers grew by 4.4% for the year, reaching 4.1 million (excluding telemetry). Prepaid customers increased by 0.3% to 28.3 million.\n\nData remained the primary driver of growth, accounting for 47.8% of MTN SA's service revenue and growing by 7.4% for the year. This was driven by an 8.0% increase in active data subscribers  to  20.4  million,  as  well  as  a  27.7%  growth  in network traffic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn active prepaid data subscriber now consumes an average of 3.0GB of data a month (up 15.0% YoY); an active postpaid data subscriber uses an average 16.5GB (up 29.6% YoY).\n\nConsumer postpaid service revenue grew by 2.8% for the year, supported by the sustained uplift in data consumption and price-up initiatives. MTN SA delivered steady growth in the residential  business,  introducing  new  home  propositions (including MTN Fibre) while expanding and diversifying the sales channel. This sustained the customer base and revenue growth.\n\nConsumer prepaid service revenue decreased by 2.8%. In Q4, the softer decline of 1.8% showed a pleasing improvement in trend versus the 2.0%, 2.3% and 5.0% declines recorded in Q3, Q2 and Q1, respectively. Focusing on customer experience excellence,  we  have  made  significant  progress  in  product rationalisation and improvements in customer journeys.\n\nOutgoing voice revenue declined by 12.1% for the year (11.9% decline  including  incoming  voice  revenue).  However,  the trajectory over the year was encouraging, with the Q4 decline of  9.9%  showing  a  notable  improvement  compared  to  the declines  of  10.7%,  11.7%  and  16.0%  in  Q3,  Q2  and  Q1, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the quarterly improvement in network availability, this improvement in voice performance was also enabled by an acceleration in Xtratime penetration, which reached 36% in Q4, up from 26% in Q3, 25% in Q2 and 24% in Q1.\n\nCVM initiatives continued to gain traction with personalised bundle offerings now available on 12 platforms. CVM bundle penetration progressed steadily through 2023, rising to 29% in Q4 2023 (Q4 2022: 22%).\n\nThe enterprise business  continued  to  achieve  double-digit service revenue growth, with 15.9% for the year. This was driven by the ICT business, while the digital mobile advertising and core mobile businesses continued to benefit from strong data  product  propositions  as  well  as  distribution  channel expansion.\n\nThe wholesale business  sustained  double-digit  revenue growth, with an increase of 13.4% (including incoming voice revenue) for the year building on a strong base. Excluding incoming voice, wholesale revenue increased by 20.9%. MTN SA's national roaming revenue rose by 26.1%, driven by Cell C revenues  as  well  as  the  steady  scaling  of  the  multi-year national roaming agreement with Telkom.",

        "page_content": "S\n\n+\n\n## Operational performance summary continued\n\nThe fintech business  grew  service  revenue  by  14.7%.  We expanded our platform capabilities significantly in H1 including small to medium enterprise financial solutions and launched MoMo 2.0 in Q3. We also focused on driving advanced services, encompassing international remittances, Point of Sale and funeral cover to name a few.\n\nMTN SA's EBITDA declined by 5.8%, including the once-off gain from the disposal of SA towers; excluding this effect, EBITDA declined by 4.4% YoY. The EBITDA margin of 36.1% was 3.1pp lower YoY (down 2.6pp to 35.9%, excluding the gain on disposal of SA towers). The result was also impacted by voluntary severance package provisions of R162 million, which when  further  adjusted  for,  FY  2023  EBITDA  would  have decreased by 3.6% and margin would have been 2.2pp lower to 36.3% (i.e. excluding both gain from disposal of SA towers and impact of VSP provision).\n\nEBITDA was impacted by top-line pressures, as well as higher power  and  other  network-resilience-related  costs.  We continued  with  our  cost  optimisation  drive  to  safeguard profitability  and  cash  flows,  underpinned  by  the  EEP. This  enabled  us  to  absorb  some  of  the  macroeconomic shocks experienced during the year.\n\nMTN SA deployed capex of R10.1 billion (ex-leases), at an intensity of 19.5%, which enabled the investment in network resilience and capacity. Including IFRS 16 leases, capex was R15.7 billion. During the year, MTN SA delivered R5.4 billion in cash release initiatives, which helped mitigate the pressure on cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nigeria\n\nMTN Nigeria delivered a resilient set of annual results in a challenging environment and impacted by significant devaluation of the local currency. In this context, the operating performance remained solid with good underlying commercial momentum.\n\nService revenue  was  up  22.1%*  in  line  with  medium-term growth guidance, with a growth acceleration in Q4 to 25.0%*. The main driver of growth was data revenue, with voice growth remaining solid.\n\nVoice revenue  increased  by  10.2%*,  benefiting  from  the expansion of the mobile subscriber base and higher usage resulting from CVM activities and redesigned voice offerings.\n\nData revenue rose by 38.6%* (up 48.7%* in Q4) driven by revamped data bundle offerings and considerable investments. This underpinned a 28.5% increase in data usage to 8.2GB and 44.9% growth in traffic on the network. As at December 2023, MTN Nigeria's 4G network covered 81.5% of the population (2022: 79.1%) and 5G covered 11.3%. Smartphone penetration increased to 55.6%, up 4.1pp YoY.\n\nFintech revenue increased by 3.7%*, largely attributable to Xtratime. MTN Nigeria added 3.3 million active wallets to close the year at 5.3 million, despite the challenges experienced due to NIN requirements for KYC introduced in Q4. MoMo PSB revenue growth of 8.1%*, with an expansion in the ecosystem where active agents and merchants grew to over 326k (up 46.0% YoY) and 324k, respectively. Transaction volume grew by  49.2%  YoY,  underpinned  by  the  key  ecosystem  metrics, which all accelerated in Q4.\n\nThe digital business, which recorded revenue growth of 65.6%*, gained traction through the optimisation of its services. This underpinned the increase in the number of active users of digital  services,  with  rich  media  subscriptions  -  excluding ayoba - growing by 57.2% to reach about 8 million. Ayoba saw a 65.6% increase in monthly active users to reach 8.6 million by year-end.\n\nRevenue from the enterprise business rose by 45.3%*, on increased  uptake  of  communication  and  ICT  services  by enterprises and public sector institutions. Mobile and fixed connection services were the main revenue drivers, fuelled by onboarding of new customers, enhanced offers and growing usage.\n\nThe combined effects of naira devaluation and the once-off provision for the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) VAT assessment resulted in opex growth of 39.8%. Excluding these effects, opex increased by 24.5%*.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMTN Nigeria recorded EBITDA growth of 14.2%*, while the EBITDA margin declined by 3.6pp* to 49.7%*. The result was impacted by naira devaluation, higher general inflation and energy costs, and the introduction of the 2023 Finance Act VAT on tower leases. Adjusting for the effects of naira devaluation (2.8pp*) and the provision for FIRS VAT assessment (0.9pp*) in particular, the EBITDA margin for FY 2023 would have been 53.4%* (Q4 2023: 53.8%*).\n\nOverall, MTN Nigeria recorded a loss after tax of R2.4 billion. Adjusting  for  net  forex  losses,  PAT  would  have  been R11.6 billion (down by 3.4%). Further adjusting for the impact of naira devaluation in opex and the once-off provision for the FIRS VAT assessment, PAT would have been up by 12.0% to R13.5  billion.  MTN  Nigeria  generated  strong  adjusted  free cash flow of R20.1 billion, up 22.0%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  annual  blended  inflation  in  SEA  averaged  10.0%, compared to 14.3% in 2022.\n\nMTN Uganda reported service revenue growth of 16.1%* YoY, underpinned by continued momentum in voice (up 11.6%*) and solid  performances  from  data  (up  21.6%*)  and  fintech  (up 17.6%*). The subscriber base grew by 13.3% to 19.5  million. The  performance  was  boosted  by  the  customisation  of customer packages through improved CVM offers as well as a revised approach to our regional distribution network, which drove higher traffic.\n\nData revenue was supported by YoY increases of 22.5% and 49.6% in active data users and data traffic, respectively. The increase  in  data  consumption  came  on  the  back  of improvements  in  network  speeds  following  the  additional spectrum deployment in the 700MHz, 2300MHz and 2600MHz bands allowing for a better user experience.\n\nFintech active users were up 10.5% to 12.1 million, which drove transaction  volume  growth  of  30.8%  to  3.4  billion.  MTN Uganda's ecosystem development was also pleasing, where the active agent and merchant networks expanded by 10.0% (to 170k) and 68.7% (to 292k), respectively.\n\nMTN  Uganda's  EBITDA  increased  by  16.2%*.  The  EBITDA margin held steady at 51.3%*, underpinned by solid top-line growth and focused operational efficiency.\n\nMTN Rwanda reported 6.5% YoY growth in the subscriber base to 7.3 million despite a slowdown in economic growth, elevated inflation  and  regulatory  hurdles.  Service  revenue  grew  by 11.3%*, owing to top-line growth in data (up 21.5%*), fintech (up 30.3%*) and enterprise (up 15.1%*).\n\nData revenue sustained its strong growth momentum, driven by a 14.3% increase in active data users and a 20.8% YoY increase in data traffic - this was boosted by the launch of MTN Rwanda's own 4G network during the year. Commercially, the  business  drove  user  engagement  and  usage  through introduction of our affordable, competitive and customised data packages.\n\nFintech revenue maintained solid YoY development underpinned by a 13.9% expansion of the active user base and 30.3%  growth  in  transaction  volumes  to  1.9  billion.  MTN Rwanda's advanced service revenue rose by 69.5%, supported by continued broadening of its agent and merchant bases (up 8.6% and 138.8%, respectively).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMTN Rwanda reported EBITDA growth of 3.6%* and an EBITDA margin of 46.3%* (down 3.5pp YoY). EBITDA was impacted by  a zero-mobile termination rate (MTR) directive from the regulator in Q4, which affected interconnect revenue. There was some mitigation from the launch of MTN Rwanda's own 4G network in July 2023, which reduced data cost of sales and enabled more efficient network expansion.\n\nOverall, the SEA portfolio reported a 0.5pp* decline in the blended EBITDA margin to 46.0%*.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Active data subscribers increased by 11.5% to 35.7 million and active MoMo users increased by 7.4% to 35.1 million. The average blended inflation for the region was 17.4% in 2023, compared to 14.1% in 2022. Excluding Ghana, the WECA region's service revenue growth was 4.1% compared to blended inflation of 5.0%.\n\nMTN Ghana continued to be a meaningful contributor to the Group's  performance.  Against  a  macro-environment  that remained challenging - with inflation averaging 40.3% in the year, and the cedi depreciating by 34.5% against the US dollar in 2023 - this outcome was achieved through well-executed commercial strategies, pricing initiatives and focused investment in the network.\n\nService revenue grew by 35.0%* supported by a solid voice performance,  and  strong  growth  in  data  and  fintech notwithstanding the impacts of a regulatory directive to block non-compliant SIMs from the network.\n\nVoice revenue increased by 9.0%*, supported by optimised and customer-centric CVM initiatives, pricing initiatives and improved network coverage. The contribution of voice to total service revenue declined from 33.1% to 26.8%, as customer behaviour continued to evolve in line with global trends.\n\nData revenue  rose  by  51.3%*,  a  robust  data  performance driven by a 14.0% YoY increase in active data subscribers as well as data pricing initiatives and well-positioned offers in the market. Data demand continued to grow as megabytes (MB) consumed per active user per month grew by 19.3% and data traffic  increased  by  36.1%.  The  growth  in  demand  was supported by various commercial interventions coupled with investments  in  network  infrastructure  to  offer  high-speed data services to homes and mobile subscribers.\n\nThe fintech business reported revenue growth of 46.4%* with pleasing growth in active users (up 20.1%). The outcome was further  supported  by  partnerships  with  various  financial institutions, agents and merchants, which enabled continued expansion  of  the  fintech  ecosystem  and  strong  growth  in advanced  services,  whose  contribution  to  fintech  revenue grew to 24.8% from 21.8% in 2022.\n\nDigital revenue  decreased  by  4.5%*  YoY,  however,  due  to ongoing efforts to enhance customer experience, as well as to rationalise the digital product portfolio, H2 growth accelerated to 18.2%. The number of active digital subscribers increased by 28.6% YoY, reaching a total of 4.6 million. Our primary focus is on improving the myMTN application and expanding the music and game offerings on ayoba.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA increased by 39.6%* YoY, with the margin increasing by 1.9pp to 58.4%*, due to the top-line growth and ongoing efficiencies. There was a benefit to the EBITDA performance from reversing provisions relating to the TMTA agreement, which was only renewed in December 2023. Adjusting for this, would result in an EBITDA margin of 56.1%*.\n\nMTN C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has had a tough year with a stable service revenue  outcome  (up  marginally  by  0.1%*  YoY).  The regulatory  environment  remained  challenging,  exacerbated by increased price-based competition in the market.\n\nThe  result  was  negatively  affected  by  a  decline  in  voice revenue (down 6.1%*) in the market driven by the removal of the pricing framework by the regulator in April 2023, which led to price dilution. Data revenue growth also slowed (up 10.1%*) due to longer lead times in network rollout arising from tower lease contract renewals and equipment logistics bottlenecks.\n\nFintech  revenue  increased  by  0.8%*,  impacted  by  lower monthly active users (MAU) (down 29.3% to 4.8 million). This was due to interventions to clean up the user base. More encouragingly, development of the overall ecosystem remained steady with transaction volumes up by 18.0% to 1.1 billion.\n\nMore broadly, price repair initiatives in the sector are key focus in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, with engagements underway with relevant authorities  in  the  country.  These  discussions,  along  with aggressive commercial interventions, are anticipated to drive a steady recovery of the business over time.\n\nMTN C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's EBITDA margin declined slightly by 0.2pp* to  32.9%*,  reflecting  the  macroeconomic  and  competitive pressures on the business. The impacts were mitigated by expense efficiencies realised in the year.\n\nMTN  Cameroon reported  solid  service  revenue  growth  of 10.9%* and maintained leading market share in a challenging and highly competitive environment. CVM initiatives continued to drive solid growth in data (up 20.1%*) and fintech (up 25.4%*) revenue, despite increased pricing competition in the market. The EBITDA margin for MTN Cameroon improved by 2.2pp* to 37.8%*,  driven  by  strong  top-line  growth  and  expense efficiencies.\n\nWECA reported a 22.8%* increase in EBITDA and a blended EBITDA margin of 40.8%*, up by 3.0pp*. Excluding MTN Ghana, the WECA markets reported a 1.3pp* increase in the blended EBITDA margin to 30.8%*.",

Excluding  MTN Irancell, the overall subscriber base fell by 23.3% to 11.6 million and the number of active data users fell by 30.2% to 3.6 million.\n\nMTN Sudan's service revenue decreased by 12.3%* YoY. The situation in the country remained volatile in 2023 given the ongoing conflict in the country and high inflation. As a result, EBITDA margin declined by 21.7pp* to 30.6%*. These effects were mitigated by revenue recovery initiatives, which were supported  by  expense  efficiency  measures  as  well  as  the restoration of the network where it was safe to do so.\n\nMENA reported a blended EBITDA margin of 29.5%*, down by 12.2pp*, mainly affected by the conflict in Sudan.\n\n## Associates, JVs and investments\n\n## Telecoms operations\n\nMTN  Irancell , our  equity-accounted  JV,  delivered  service revenue growth of 34.5%*, supported by increased data usage. Solid data revenue of 15.9%* was supported by a 9.8% increase in usage, higher effective pricing and a 6.1% increase in active data subscribers. The EBITDA margin declined by 0.5pp* to 41.1%*  due  to  opex  pressures  as  a  result  of  currency depreciation.\n\n## E-commerce investments\n\nThe Iran Internet Group continued its strong performance in the 12 months to December 2023. Ride-hailing app, Snapp remained  the  market  leader,  ranking  among  the  top ride-hailing apps globally and reaching 4.7 million daily rides compared  to  3.7  million  rides  in  2022.  Last-mile  delivery service,  Snappbox  also  remained  the  market  leader  with revenue up 97% YoY and daily orders increasing by 28% YoY to almost 390k. Food delivery app, Snappfood grew revenue by 94% YoY and remained the largest player in the country.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We track our progress through multiple mechanisms including benchmarking to best practice and monitoring selected ESG rankings and ratings, each with their own approach to evaluating performance. We are committed to transparency and reporting on our progress in a way that is meaningful and relevant to our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ratings agency\n\n## Changes on prior year\n\nSustainalytics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS&P Global ESG rating\n\nMorgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improved ESG risk rating to 22.2^ in the medium risk category, better than our target for the year.\n\nThis is a result of an improvement across six out of the eight key areas, with the greatest improvement in the area of business ethics. Carbon (own operations) and data privacy and security are the two areas with no change. Regulatory scrutiny for product governance, including network quality and marketing practices are areas requiring more attention, as failure to comply with regulators may result in significant monetary penalties and could adversely affect our customers' confidence in our services. Heightened exposure to data privacy and security risks due to the high volume of customer data we process. MTN's focus on expanding into developing markets increases our exposure to potential business ethics risks and challenges. Despite our exit from the Middle East, we still face significant business ethics risks due to operations in high-conflict countries.\n\n## MTN's score declined to 45 in 2023 from 47 in 2022.\n\nS&P has changed its methodology to include a new Global ESG score, which is a combination of company disclosures, media analysis and stakeholder engagement. This change has resulted in a new set of recommendations for improvement areas, which MTN is committed to addressing. Specific focus will be placed on enhancing environmental reporting on water and waste, and placing greater emphasis on biodiversity and deforestation. Improving our talent attraction and retention to remain competitive within the industry remains a priority.\n\n## MTN's rating is unchanged at 'AA'\n\nMTN leads most global peers in corporate governance practices. Led by a fully independent chair, the Board is majority independent, and backed by fully independent audit, remuneration, and nomination committees. Such practices may enhance oversight of management. Further, MTN's labour management initiatives are relatively strong compared to those of industry peers. However, business ethics and tax-related allegations (as of August 2023) weigh on the company's assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n^ Latest data\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through these committees, various areas of MTN's operations and long-term objectives receive  specialised,  concentrated  attention.  They probe the business's operations to ensure that the Board fulfils its responsibilities with due diligence and foresight.\n\nChairman, Mcebisi Jonas an independent non-executive  director,  leads  the  Board  with  an impartial view. In accordance with the policy contained in  the  Board  Charter,  he  ensures  that  there  is  a balance of power and authority so that no individual has  unfettered  powers,  at  board  level.  He  ensures that conflicts are managed appropriately.\n\nLead  independent  director  (LID),  Khotso  Mokhele, appointed by the Board, takes the lead role in the event that the Chairman is unable to serve or has a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Chairman's leadership keeps the Board aligned and  focused  on  its  strategic  priorities,  and  he  is assisted by the Group Company Secretary who plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the Board's processes are efficient,  that  there  is  sufficient  awareness  and compliance with governance and regulatory requirements, and that Board members are continually upskilled and developed.\n\n## Committee mandates and membership\n\nEvery year, we assess the terms of reference and the membership  of  each  committee  to  consider  global changes,  best  practices,  and  emerging  trends  in governance.

Implementation was challenging yet rewarding. There were several setbacks in various jurisdictions, necessitating agile operational adjustments. However, the overall process to familiarise everyone with the new framework was a success, as it is now embedded within our processes.\n\nIn 2024, our primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of our new decision-making framework. Our focus will be on identifying the areas of implementation that present challenges and working to strengthen our DMF even more.\n\nOur goal is to address the pain points in the current implementation process and push for continuous improvement to make our DMF more effective and efficient.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence\n\n+",

This matter was held in abeyance as the focus shifted to securing the fintech skills needed on the MTN Fintech Board. Once this matter is completed, our attention will return to securing essential fintech and digital skills for the Group Board. All other significant items from the 2020 evaluation were addressed.\n\nThree years later in November 2023, we retained the services of Hoffmann Reed and FluidRock. Their evaluation focused on Board effectiveness, dynamics and composition, with an emphasis on enhancing MTN's strategic direction.  Consistent with our practice, we are committed to transparently sharing the final outcomes with our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board development and training\n\nTo remain effective, the Board recognises it must induct, develop and change its members from time to time to suit the company's needs. Accordingly, the  Group  Company  Secretariat  has  a structured  induction  and  development programme  that  seeks  to  equip  new directors  with  understanding  of  the strategy  and  the  complexities  of  the business.  We  provide  ongoing  training for  all  directors  on  various  matters related to their role to assist them to act with due care, skill and diligence.\n\nBy keeping informed of various developments,  directors  are  able  to exercise courage in taking appropriate risks  and  capturing  opportunities  in  a responsible  manner  and  in  the  best interests of MTN Group.\n\n## Executing on the Board's mandate\n\nThe Board meets on a quarterly basis in line with the Group reporting cycle. Each meeting follows an agenda agreed by the Chairman, CEO and Company Secretary. Documents for discussion are loaded on a virtual platform for directors to preview. Meeting discussions are usually around performance,  risks  and  opportunities, governance  updates  and  regulatory matters  for  consideration,  as  well  as strategy execution. In 2023, there were quarterly meetings, three special Board meetings and one business plan session.\n\n## Strategic direction in 2023\n\nThe Board held annual strategy sessions in April,  July  and  November  2023,  following consideration of the trajectory of MTN, the geopolitical environment and the emerging risks. The  Board  resolved  to  add  an additional  strategy  session  in  the  fourth quater. At all the sessions it constructively interrogated proposals presented by management and considered various macroeconomic factors.",

This has become the standard, and stakeholder feedback indicates that we should continue to enable shareholders to participate remotely.\n\nOur resolutions all passed with the requisite majority votes, and we earnestly endeavoured to address concerns raised by shareholders.\n\nWe encourage shareholders to submit questions prior to the meeting; this has proven to be an effective way for the company to consider and effectively respond to concerns and suggestions. Shareholders will still be able to 'raise their hands' at the meeting and MTN will make a concerted effort to ensure that all questions are addressed.\n\nThe Board was pleased that Ordinary Resolution 9 relating to the Implementation Report was also carried;  it  served  as  a  positive  testament  to  the  ongoing  and  constructive  engagements  with shareholders regarding our Remuneration Report, as well as the efforts that our management is making to consider shareholder recommendations.\n\n## Governance roadshow\n\nIn the past few years, MTN has regularly scheduled an annual governance roadshow to interact with shareholders. During these sessions, topics such as the AGM notice and broader governance issues, including remuneration, are discussed. The roadshows are overseen by Chairman Mcebisi Jonas and Lead Independent Director Khotso Mokhele, who also serves as the Chair of the Remuneration Committee. The discussions in 2023 were productive and constructive.\n\nThe Board Committees entrusted with assessing the issues raised during the Governance Roadshows have considered all of them, the majority of which have already been resolved, and the board intends to continually review every issue and work to close it.\n\n## Engaging dissenting shareholders\n\nWe continue to engage with shareholders regarding the evolving remuneration governance and good practice requirements. In the event of a vote of over 25% against our remuneration policy or implementation report, we will certainly hold engagements with dissenting shareholders to listen to their concerns.\n\n## Directors' dealings\n\nMTN has a share dealing and insider trading policy which governs the share dealing processes for directors,  prescribed  officers  and  employees.  The  policy  aims  to  align  with  the  JSE  Listings Requirements and ensures that MTN has robust administrative and disclosure processes. The policy also imposes more provisions to safeguard employees from contravening the Financial Markets Act.\n\n## Compliance with laws and MoI\n\nThe company is in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act and is operating in conformity with its memorandum of incorporation.\n\n## Board appointments and resignations\n\nAll appointments to the Board for 2023 were conducted through a formal and transparent process, guided by an approved policy and assisted by the Directors and Corporate Governance Affairs Committee in consultation with the Group Company Secretary.\n\nTowards the end of 2022, we announced that Nicky Newton-King would be joining the Board, effective from 1 January 2023. Since joining Nicky's has been a great addition to the diversity on the Board and is making a significant contribution.\n\nPaul Hanratty also stepped down from the Board, effective 30 April 2023, to focus on his executive responsibilities.\n\n## Due diligence on directors\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of ensuring the integrity and efficacy of appointments to the Board. We assure stakeholders that we hold our obligations in this regard to the highest standards.\n\nAs part of the evolution of our Group Board between 2019 and 2020, and anticipating that the majority of our operational subsidiaries would be listed separately in their respective countries, we re-evaluated how we select, verify and execute due diligence on our directors.\n\nWe implemented a rigorous and open approach led by our directors' appointment and diversity policy, which comprises a thorough set of processes designed to ensure that we recruit and appoint directors with the necessary skills, competence and ethics.\n\nWe have always verified and vetted our directors, but owing to changes in the corporate, geopolitical and economic climate, in recent times it has become necessary to strengthen our approach to screening appointments to the Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe process is conducted under the oversight of the Directors Affairs and Governance Committee, led by the Group Board Chairman, and guided by our policy on the appointment of directors.\n\nWe  continue  to  review  new  trends  in  the  regulatory  landscape  for  emerging  remuneration governance requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "All about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\n## Governance in support of value creation continued\n\n## Group Company Secretary\n\nThe Board is assisted by a competent and suitably qualified Group Company Secretary function, led by Thobeka Sishuba-Bonoyi. She and her representatives have an arm's length relationship with the Board. Following a rigorous assessment of performance in March 2024, the Board is satisfied that the function has the competency, qualifications and experience to provide sound governance advisory and stewardship to the Board and management.\n\nTo  align  with Ambition  2025 ,  the  Group  Company  Secretariat  function  is  re-evaluating  and improving its operating model across the Group to ensure that the department is fit for purpose, independent and adequately resourced.\n\n## Our combined assurance model\n\nMTN's  directors  and  executives  provide  oversight  using  a  combined  assurance  model  which considers the role of management, control functions, internal and external audit and the Board committees  of  subsidiaries.  They  use  a  simplified  governance  approach  in  often  complex environments as they strive to create and preserve shared value through all subsidiary companies. The  Group  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  oversight  of  the  implementation  of  combined assurance.\n\nThe combined assurance model means there are numerous lines of defence to identify, prevent and mitigate risks and provide independent assurance to both the Group Exco and the Board either  through  the  Group  Audit  Committee  or  the  Group  Risk  Management  and  Compliance Committee.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nWe are committed to protecting and ensuring the security of the personal information of all our stakeholders. Our privacy and data protection policy prescribes a set of principles that governs how  MTN  collects,  processes  and  protects  personal  information.  The  policy  reiterates  our commitment to compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements governing the collection and processing of personal information. Therefore, the privacy rights of all data subjects are respected and protected; we always ensure that our business interest does not override the rights of data subjects, and we rely on a lawful basis to process all forms of personal information.\n\n## Conflicts of interest - gifts and entertainment\n\nMTN recognises that the management of conflicts of interest is critical in promoting ethical conduct and  protecting  the  integrity  of  MTN  decision-making  processes.  Accordingly,  directors  and employees are encouraged to act in a responsible and ethical manner, taking into consideration the Group's best interests. They are required to complete a declaration of interest at the start of each year.\n\nThere has been significant improvement in the understanding of the process; this has been as a result of the awareness created with the MTN Conduct Passport and the guidance framework provided to employees and rolled out in all operations.\n\n## Gifts, Hospitality and Entertainment\n\nAs an organisation, we are aware of the impression of impropriety that excessive entertainment or giving and accepting gifts may create. Therefore, while we appreciate our business partners' goodwill, MTN has a strict 'No-Gifts' policy but with certain exception that allows gifts of limited value, such as corporate branded gift items, to foster and maintain good relationships with our stakeholders.  The  gifts,  hospitality  and  entertainment  policy  provides  limits  and  approval requirements and requires that all gifts be declared and recorded in a gifts register.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite  these challenges,  we  stood  strong  guided  by  our Ambition  2025 strategy and unwavering dedication to our core principles. Leveraging  our  strengths,  adaptability  and  the  collective efforts of our talented employees, we not only weathered the storm but stand strong in the demonstrated ability of our people to thrive in even the most demanding circumstances.\n\nTo support the solid underlying commercial performance of our business, we remained focused on expense efficiencies to safeguard  the  profitability  and  cash  generation  of  the business. As a result, we are proud to have reported on a resilient  set  of  financial  and  non-financial  performance, characterised by the agility and commitment of our people to delivering long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. Key  to  our  performance  is  our  commitment  to  our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. We prioritised sustainability, reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and promoting eco-friendly practices. We are addressing the gender  pay  gap  and  are  ensuring  that  we  pay  above\n\ngovernment  minimum  wage  standards  and  are  actively fostering diversity and equity in our business. This was all performed while maintaining robust governance practices of transparency, accountability and ethical conduct throughout our operations. Our focus has also resulted in recognition from external bodies and the positive sentiments expressed by our employees indicate that our policies and principles are having  the  desired  impact  on  attraction,  retention  and employee behaviour alignment.\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA detailed breakdown of executive director and prescribed officer remuneration provides insight into the remuneration outcomes reflected in this report.

Led by a team of experienced professionals, the committee ensured that our remuneration and human resources policies remained robust, fair and aligned with the organisational goals.

These elements are fundamental to our Live Inspired value proposition, reflecting our commitment to fair and responsible pay principles.\n\n## Principle details\n\n## Fair and responsible pay\n\nOur commitment to fair and responsible remuneration is deeply ingrained in our remuneration policy, guided by our fair and responsible pay principles. As a committee, we ensure that our remuneration practices are externally competitive, internally equitable and devoid of bias. This includes job grading, annual salary benchmarking and mean gender differential analysis, designed to ensure that remuneration remains primarily market-oriented and fair. We are further considering the appropriate methodology to measure and report the gap in pay between the highest and lowest earners, as required by the Companies Amendment Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe ensure internal equity in our remuneration practices by applying fair pay principles and addressing identified gaps such as the total pay gender mean and median pay gap which we reduced by 1.76% and 3.19% respectively in FY 2023 through company-wide analysis and initiatives (this is described in our on page 48). We also uphold equal pay for equal work principles, ensuring fair remuneration based on job complexity, as determined by our job grading system. We conduct ongoing analyses to ensure the consistent application of this principle.\n\n## An enabler of strategic objectives\n\nOur remuneration framework plays a pivotal role in aligning our workforce with the company's overarching goals and values. We reviewed our STI parameters to address perceived remuneration gaps between non-executive and executive employees, increasing the maximum to 200% for non-executive employees. This change was successfully implemented across our markets in FY 2023 and is expected to help close the gap in total remuneration between the two groups.\n\nRecognising the sensitivity and significance of the pay gap, we are developing the appropriate principles and metrics to accurately assess the gap. We will disclose these, along with initiatives to reduce identified gaps in FY 2024.\n\n## Strengthen the culture and core values\n\nStrengthening the MTN culture, our Anywhere, Anytime Work Policy has enabled employees to work flexibly and still meet their work objectives. We also recognise that hybrid work requires conscious and deliberate in-person mechanisms to ensure our culture, connections and experiences as a Y'ello family remain strong. While we are committed to maintaining the benefits of the policy, we have adjusted it to include a minimum three-day in-office requirement, effective from April 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Attract, motivate, reward and retain our human capital\n\nRetain crucial talent for the achievement of our Ambition 2025 strategy, we need to invest in our employees. We have therefore approved the implementation of a cash retention plan payment for identified scarce and critical skills. This will support and reinforce our overall retention strategy.\n\nA cash retention payment will only be considered in exceptional circumstances, where the loss of a critical or scarce skill poses a significant risk to business continuity, value and effective operations of MTN. The quantum of the payment is based on affordability (budget availability), the degree of the retention risk and the value of the skill to MTN. A rigorous application process based on defined eligibility criteria and approval from Group Exco, Human Capital and Group Remco will ensure a fair, objective and rational approach to selection. Successful applicants are required to sign a retention and payback agreement.\n\n## Transparent consistent communication\n\nWe have utilised digital tools such as Microsoft Teams platforms, collaboration software and messaging apps to facilitate quick and transparent communication across MTN. By implementing these strategies, we foster a culture of transparent and consistent communication, leading to improved employee engagement and organisational effectiveness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the growth and life stage of the Opcos, in addition to the business platforms having different growth projections, there was a requirement to review the plan and align it to applicable Group incentive principles. The review was undertaken in 2023 and the following adjustments are recommended for implementation in future allocations.\n\n| Plan element                              | Change from                                             | Change from                                             | Change to                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determination  of incentive  payout value | Based on the appreciation in  the notional share price. | Based on the appreciation in  the notional share price. | Based on the full notional share price  considering actual performance  against the three-year business plan.                                           |\n| Allocation  multiples                     | General Managers  Senior Managers                       | 0.75 0.50                                               | General Managers  0.60 Senior Managers  0.40                                                                                                            |\n| Performance  condition                    | EBITDA-based valuation                                  | EBITDA-based valuation                                  | Valuation using profit after tax (PAT),  three-year average of actual to  business plan, with 25% vesting at 90%  of target and 100% vesting at stretch |\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee share ownership plan (ESOP)\n\nThe MTN Group established the 2016 ESOP for the purposes of incentivising, rewarding and economically empowering our employees through share ownership. Under this plan, employer companies,  from  time  to  time,  procure  the  grant  of  participation  shares  to  designated participating employees. All non-management level employees in South Africa and other listed entities are eligible to participate.\n\nSince the establishment of the ESOP Trust, for employees based in South Africa, a total of ten  allocations have been made to over 5 200 employees. The overall cumulative market value of the vested and unvested awards at the end of FY 2022 and FY 2023 was in the order of R352 million and R337 million, respectively. We are proud of how this plan has empowered our participating employees. Although this plan terminated in 2022, we are in the process of reviewing it to implement it in the future.\n\nThe overall ESOP Trust limit was 3 million shares. The below table presents the share balances for FY 2023:\n\n|                                   | Number of shares   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Allocated since inception         | 2 528 349          |\n| Less: exercised up to 31 Dec 2022 | (1 733 868)        |\n| Equals: closing as at 31 Dec 2022 | 794 481            |\n| Less: exercised during FY 2023    | (353 706)          |\n| Equals: closing as at 31 Dec 2023 | 440 775            |\n\nThe closing balance consists of unexercised (vested, unvested and forfeited) shares in  trust. The vested and unvested will still be claimed by employees under the terms of the current scheme, whereas the forfeited shares will remain in the trust until it is wound down.\n\n## Executive remuneration\n\n## FY 2023 pay mix\n\nExecutives receive a combination of fixed pay, benefits and short and long-term incentives. The proportion of at-risk performance variable pay increases at senior levels, aligning executive interests with those of our shareholders to drive long-term sustainable value. While annual fixed remuneration does not vary based on performance, the variable portion does. In line with King IV\u2122 and proxy adviser guidelines, the remuneration mix scenarios, in addition to the total figure of potential remuneration outcomes for below target/minimum, on-target and maximum performance, are reflected for each executive director and prescribed officer.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Executive pay is demonstrably tied to performance, with upside potential for overperformance and significant downside for underperformance in accordance with our pay-forperformance philosophy. Remuneration outcomes for various performance scenarios are indicated in ZAR.\n\n## Annual fixed remuneration determination\n\nWe  operate  globally,  therefore  the  need  to  consider  the structure  and  quantum  of  executive  remuneration  from different perspectives is critical to ensure the attraction and retention of skills required to deliver sustainable returns to shareholders. The committee undertakes an annual review of executive remuneration relative to defined peer companies based on relative size, industry and complexity. All elements of remuneration are compared to market benchmarks. We target the  median  (50th  percentile)  of  the  relevant  market  for executive and prescribed officer total remuneration including annual fixed package and variable pay elements.\n\nWe subscribe to the Old Mutual RemChannel salary survey. Bowmans Reward Advisory Services conduct a customised benchmark survey for our Group Exco roles. These surveys include  a  mix  of  peer  companies  in  the  same  industry, competing industries for specific skills, or companies of similar size and financial performance.\n\nOur  peer  benchmark  comparators  include  large  JSE-listed companies  (JSE  comparators)  with  substantial  operations outside South Africa and in the JSE Top 40, such as AngloGold Ashanti, Vodacom, Bidcorp, Sibanye Stillwater, Standard Bank, Shoprite, Sasol, Multichoice and Woolworths. We also consider global  telecommunication  companies  regardless  of  size and jurisdiction, including Vodafone, Telefonica, BCE, Telstra and  Spark  NZ.

To secure the services of NEDs with the right mix of skills and experience, we apply the following fee structure, differentiated by role and committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual retainer.\n- \u00b7 Fee per meeting.\n- \u00b7 Further fee per meeting for any additional special meetings over and above Board and committee meetings.\n\n## Non-executive director service contracts\n\nNEDs are not employees and are subject to re-election by shareholders at the AGM. They do not participate in our short or long-term incentive plans and  are  provided  with communication devices such as mobile phones to conduct their duties. They are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses, such  as  travel  and  accommodation  costs,  incurred  in  the execution of their duties.\n\n## Non-executive director fee determination\n\nThe  same  principles  to  determine  executive  and  employee remuneration levels are applied to NED fee determination. Remco reviews fees and policies annually which are informed by  economic  conditions,  affordability  and  peer  market benchmarking conducted by DG Capital.\n\nThe following criteria are utilised to determine appropriate peer benchmarks:\n\n- \u00b7 Company size.\n- \u00b7 Time commitment and responsibility associated with the role.\n- \u00b7 Residency (local/international).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where fees fall below the market median, additional adjustment are recommended to the Board. Where adjustments are above the approved budget, caps are applied and adjustments to the median are considered over time. NED fees are recommended to the Board and thereafter require a non-binding approval vote from shareholders at the AGM.

Performance against these was reviewed and validated by the Group CEO and externally audited by EY in accordance with the agreed-upon audit procedures. Individual KPIs are based on a balanced scorecard of shared KPIs cascaded from MTN Group KPIs as reflected in the Ambition 2025 strategy.

These metrics are linked to executive remuneration, underscoring our commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nDespite challenging economic conditions, we successfully met our 2023 KPIs.\n\nIn our pursuit of Net Zero emissions by 2040, we exceeded expectations with a 10.9% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023, surpassing our target of 7.5%. This achievement,  excluding  MTN  South  Africa,  rose  to  an impressive 42.1% reduction, primarily due to the sale of BTS sites in SA which caused an organic reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions. MTN SA is buying back some power assets and we expect normalisation in 2024.\n\nAddressing  the  digital  divide,  we  approached  our  2023 target of 90% broadband coverage, achieving 89.18%. This expansion provided connectivity to an additional 9.2 million people, supported by the deployment of 6 984 sites in rural areas across our operations, promoting digital and financial inclusion in underserved communities.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion remain integral to our values, evident  in  our  workforce  where  women  comprise  40%, nearing our 2025 target of 41%. We closely monitor key dimensions such as women in leadership (28% against 30% target), women in succession (33% against 35% target) and women in technology (23% against 21% target), ensuring progress in gender equality.\n\nWith  most  long-term  targets  on  track,  our  sustained progress positions us favourably to achieve our objectives.\n\nWe  are  on  track  with  all  KPIs  in  the  2023  ESG  index, including our reduction target for Project Zero, despite the excessive  loadshedding  experienced  in  South  Africa, which necessitated the use of diesel generators to provide continuity of service. MTN South Africa saw a significant reduction due to a shift in emissions from Scope 1 and 2 to Scope 3, driven by changes in a TowerCo transaction.\n\n| Creating shared value                                                       | Creating shared value                                                                                               | Target   2023   | Achieved 2023                     | Target 2022                                  | Achieved  2022                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| We are committed to                                                         | \u00b7  Project Zero: ~50% average  reduction target by 2030 and  Net Zero emissions by 2040^                            | 7.5%            | 10.9%                             | 3.5%  reduction in  Scope 1 and  2 emissions | 13.9%*                             |\n| ecosystem responsibility  and achieving Net Zero  emissions by 2040         | \u00b7   Water  and  waste  management: Baseline  assessment                                                             |                 | 70% of  Opcos                     | 50% of  Opcos                                | 70%                                |\n| We are committed   to driving digital and                                   | \u00b7  Cost to communicate:  Reduce entry bundle to 1GB  bundle price ratio                                             | 14 Opcos        | 14 Opcos                          | 14 Opcos                                     | 14 Opcos                           |\n| financial inclusion and                                                     | \u00b7  Broadband coverage:  Achieve 95% by 2025^                                                                        | 90%             | 89.18%                            | 85.6% of  market                             | 87.8%                              |\n| diverse society                                                             | \u00b7  Diversity, equity and  inclusion (DEI): 50% women  in overall workforce by 2030^                                 | 40%             | 40%                               | 40%                                          | 40%                                |\n|                                                                             | \u00b7  Reputation Index Survey:  Achieve 75% score                                                                      | 75%             | 80%                               | 75%                                          | 79.6%                              |\n| We are committed partners  to stakeholders to create  and protect value     | \u00b7  DHR: Exceed Ranking  Digital Rights Corporate  Accountability Index Score                                        | -               | -                                 | 24                                           | 34                                 |\n| We are committed  to boosting inclusive  economic growth on   the continent | \u00b7  Network and IT investment \u00b7  Salaries and wages paid \u00b7  Income taxes paid \u00b7  CSI spend \u00b7  Commercial procurement |                 | R159bn 64.3% 7.4% 9.9% 0.1% 18.3% | N/A                                          | ~R149bn 8.5% 9.4% 0.2% 21.6% 60.3% |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ^ Linked to executive LTIs.      * Excluding South Africa, which was impacted by loadshedding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail on achievement of ESG KPIs are reflected in our FY 2023 on page 13.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

The allocation of shares made under the PSP in December 2020 vested in December 2023, three years after allocation. This allocation was a conditional award of shares dependent on achievement of specified conditions.\n\nAn assessment of the TSR performance condition achievement was performed by Alexander Forbes. Condition fulfilment on COFCF and ROACE were performed by external auditors.\n\nBased on this, overall weighted vesting approved by Remco is:\n\n- \u2022 Group President and CEO:\n\n89.49%\n\n- \u2022 Group COO:\n\n89.49%\n\n- \u2022 MTN Group Exco members:   88.30%\n- \u2022 Other participants:\n\n91.24%\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese vesting percentages include the 25% retention element as  approved  at  allocation.  The  2020  allocation  is  the  last allocation  which  includes  the  retention  element  as  these allocations  were  subsequently  removed  from  specified officers in 2021 and replaced with ESG factors.\n\n## Vesting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Award  Condition                       | Vesting conditions                                                                                                     | Target                                             | Performance Achievement               | Performance Achievement                   | Performance Achievement        | Group CEO  & COO Group         | Exco                           | All other  employees           |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Total Shareholder  Return ('TSR' MSCI) | MSCI EM Telecoms ranking 100% vesting at the 75th percentile 25% vesting at the median 0% vesting for below the median | 75th ranking: 9 Median ranking:  17                | Actual ranking:  9 Vesting %:  100    | TSR (rank) 17 9 Target Threshold          | 9                              | 30.00%                         | 33.33%                         | 25%                            |\n| Operating Free  Cash Flow  ('OFCF')    | Cashflow growth 100% vesting at 110% of target 25% vesting at 90% of target 0% vesting below 90% of target             | Minimum: 90%  of target At target: 110%  of target | Actual %:  100.66% Vesting %:  64.98% | Cash flow (Rm) 24.9 27.7 Target Threshold | 27.9                           | 19.49%                         | 21.66%                         | 16.24%                         |\n| Service/Retention                      | Service requirement Employee must be employed as at the  date of vesting                                               | In service at  vesting date                        | In service at vesting date 25%        | In service at vesting date 25%            | In service at vesting date 25% | In service at vesting date 25% | In service at vesting date 25% | In service at vesting date 25% |\n| Return on Equity ('ROE')               | Equity growth 100% vesting at 100% of target 25% vesting at 90% of target 0% vesting below 90% of target               | Minimum: 90%  of target At target: 100%  of target | Actual %:  119.93% Vesting %:  100%   | ROE (%) 17.2 19.1                         | 22.9                           | 30%                            | 33.33%                         | 25%                            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Earned remuneration is indicated in both US$ and ZAR. For the purposes of calculating the single-figure remuneration, the following average forex rates have been used: FY 2023 (fixed remuneration: US$1 to R17.66, bonus: 1US$ to R19.01). FY 2022 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R16.49, bonus: 1US$ to R17.91).\n- 2 There was a 100% vesting for FY 2022 (i.e. 2019  allocation), settled at the share price of R130.21, and an 89.49% share vesting for FY 2023 (i.e. 2020 allocation), settled at the share price of R96.42.\n- 3 LTI awarded is the value of PSP shares awarded during FY 2023.\n\nIn terms of Team Performance, Ralph and his team delivered resilient performance in specific areas in a very challenging macro environment. They achieved solid YoY momentum in key operational and financial KPIs, although some were short of the 100% target. These include delivery of subscriber growth (including active data users and fintech subscribers). Adjusted HEPS and capital efficiency achieved the kick-in for an STI payout, with the ROIC KPI at 95% of target.\n\nThe team made progress on strategic initiatives including work on the structural separation of the fintech business from the GSM, as well as the minority investment into fintech group business. The KPIs that exceeded the internal targets were delivery in the ESG targets, employee engagement and diversity, brand health and the management of the risk and regulatory environment.\n\nRalph's annual STI incentive is structured 70% CP and 30% TP.\n\nThe bonus multiplier is 100% for on-target performance and a maximum of 200% of the AFP.\n\nBased on this TP and the CP outlined on page 126, his final STI outcome for FY 2023 was 71% of the AFP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash upstreaming was below the 100% target; however, Tsholo and her team also achieved the kick-in point required for an STI payment for this KPI. They exceeded the 2023 target of R1.5 billion in expense efficiencies by achieving savings of R2.6 billion despite elevated inflation, as well as notable forex volatility and depreciation in many of our markets. ROIC was at 95% of target. Tsholo's team achieved an above-target outcome for cash released from working capital during the FY 2023, contributing to a stronger balance sheet for the Group.\n\nIn terms of her other KPIs, she delivered strong outcomes on the strategic investment into the Group fintech business, as well as the structural separation of that business from the GSM. She also achieved commendable scores on employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and brand health.\n\nTsholofelo's annual STI is structured 70% CP and 30% TP.\n\nThe bonus multiplier is 100% for on-target performance and a maximum of 175% of the AFP.\n\nBased on this TP and the CP outlined on page 126, her final STI outcome for FY 2023 was 66% of the AFP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Earned remuneration is indicated in both US$ and ZAR. For the purposes of calculating the single-figure remuneration, the following average forex rates have been used: FY 2023 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R17.66, bonus: 1US$ to R19.01). FY 2022 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R16.49, bonus: 1US$ to R17.91).\n- 2 There was a 100% vesting for  FY 2022 (i.e. 2019 allocation), settled at the share price of R130.21, and an 89.49% share vesting for FY 2023 (i.e. 2020 allocation), settled at the share price of R96.42.\n- 3 LTI awarded reflects the value of PSP shares awarded during FY 2023.\n\nJens and his team also contributed to driving the shared KPIs of subscriber growth momentum (total, active data and fintech) and adjusted HEPS, albeit below internal targets. His team also delivered strong results in terms of team performance for ayoba subscribers, increasing the number of connected homes through the FTTx strategy and progress in scaling the Bayobab business. They fell short of the internal 100% STI target for digital revenue.\n\nIn the other shared KPIs, Jens and his team scored well on employee engagement across the platform businesses, as well as brand health.\n\nJens's annual STI is structured 50% CP and 50% TP.\n\nThe bonus multiplier is 100% for on-target performance and a maximum of 175% of the AFP.\n\nBased on this TP and the CP outlined on page 126, his final STI outcome for FY 2023 was 86% of the AFP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the year under the review, the Nigerian naira experienced material devaluation.\n\n- 1 Earned remuneration is indicated in US$, Nigerian Naira, and for LTI purposes, ZAR. For the purposes of calculating the single-figure remuneration expressed in ZAR, the following average forex rates have been used: FY 2023 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R17.66, 1NGN to R0.025, bonus: 1US$ to R19.01, 1NGN to R0.025) FY 2022 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R16.49, 1NGN to R0.03728, bonus: 1US$ to R17.91, 1NGN to R0.03891). Nigeria increases are awarded on gross salary.\n- 2 There was  a 100% vesting for FY 2022 (i.e. 2019 allocation), settled at the share price of R130.21, and an 88.3% vesting for the FY 2023 (i.e. 2020 allocation), settled at the share price of R96.42. The share values expressed in ZAR above were paid from Nigeria in Nigerian Naira. They have been recorded in ZAR as they were accrued in South African ZAR currency at vesting.\n- 3 LTI awarded reflects the value of PSP shares awarded during FY 2023 in relation to his US$ split component. Karl received the balance of shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nKarl and his team fell short of the 100% STI targets for subscribers (total, active data and fintech), in a challenging macro environment in Nigeria, with regulatory interventions such as NIN-SIM and KYC requirements. The team also fell below the target on MTN Nigeria's HEPS and ROIC targets. The team achieved above-target performance in connected homes, overall network performance and carbon emission reduction, while they achieved the 100% target for cash upstreaming from the operation.\n\nThey delivered above-target outcomes for employee engagement and brand health.\n\nKarl's annual STI is structured 60% CP and 40% TP. The CP is further made up of 30% MTN Group performance and 30% MTN Nigeria performance.\n\nThe bonus multiplier is 100% for on-target performance and a maximum of 175% of the AFP.\n\nBased on this TP and the CP outlined on page 126, his final STI outcome for 2023 was 79% of the AFP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the year under the review, the Ghanian cedi experienced significant appreciation in value.\n\n- 1 Earned remuneration is indicated in US$, Ghanaian Cedi, and for LTI purposes, ZAR. For the purposes of calculating the single-figure remuneration expressed in ZAR, the following average forex rates have been used:  FY 2023 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R17.66, 1GHS to R1.56, bonus: 1GHS to R1.56). FY 2022 (fixed remuneration: 1US$ to R16.49, 1GHS to R1.97, bonus: 1US$ to R17.91, 1GHS to R1.44). Ghana increases are awarded on basic salary.\n- 2 There was a 100% vesting for FY 2022 (i.e. 2019 allocation), settled at the share price of R130.21, and an 88.3% share vesting for FY 2023 (i.e. 2020 allocation), settled at the share price of R96.42. The share values expressed in ZAR above were paid from Ghana in Ghanaian Cedi. They have been recorded in ZAR as they were accrued in South African currency at vesting.\n- 3 LTI awarded reflects the value of PSP shares awarded during FY 2023. For FY 2022, there was a correction on his PSP award whereby the allocation made under Ghana was corrected and made under Group PSPs.\n\nEbenezer and his team are responsible for markets' portfolio in the group. Similar to his colleagues above, Ebenezer and team fell short of the 100% STI target in the shared KPIs for subscribers (total, active data and fintech) and adjusted HEPS. He also fell short of the ayoba subscribers and digital revenue, as these relate to Tier 2 and 3 markets.\n\nEbenezer and his team delivered an above-target performance in effective stakeholder management, as measured by MTN Group's Reputation Index Survey. Other strong outcomes were recorded in his markets for cash upstreaming, connected homes and fintech EBITDA. They also performed well on the shared KPIs of employee engagement and brand health.\n\nEbenezer's annual STI is structured 60% CP and 40% TP.\n\nThe bonus multiplier is 100% for on-target performance and a maximum of 175% of the AFP.\n\nBased on this TP and the CP outlined on page 126, his final STI outcome for FY 2023 was 69% of the AFP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

For FY 2024, the Board approved a budget of 4.5% for local NEDs paid in ZAR and 3% for internationals paid in euro. The distribution of the budget is dependent on the position  to  median.  The  NED  fee  benchmarking  exercise conducted by DG Capital reflected that several local NED fees fall below their respective peer group median, while many international NED fees are above or are aligned to their peer benchmark median.\n\n## Local non-executive director fee increases\n\nWhere  fees  fall  below  the  market  median,  the  approved increase plus a capped adjustment has been recommended. This is to ensure that the overall fee increase budget of 4.5% is not exceeded.\n\nThe table below indicates FY 2023 fees and proposed FY 2024 fees  for  retainer,  attendance  and  total  fees.  The  NED  fee benchmarking  exercise  conducted  by  DG  Capital  reflected that several local NED fees fall below their respective peer group median, while many international NED fees are above or are aligned to their peer benchmark median.\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## International non-executive director fee increases\n\nMany  of  the  international  fees  are  aligned  with  or  above the  fee  medians  (including  the  premium),  therefore  most international fees will remain the same until such time as they align to their peer benchmark median.\n\nThe table below indicates FY 2023 fees and proposed FY 2024 fees for retainer, attendance, and total fees for the Group Board and its committees:\n\n- \u00b7 A capped increase indicates that the fee reflected falls below the market median and requires further adjustment but has been capped to ensure that increases remain within budget.\n- \u00b7 Where no increase is proposed, the fee is aligned with or above the market median.\n\n| Board and committees                    | Approved FY 2023 fees   | Approved FY 2023 fees   | Approved FY 2023 fees   | Proposed FY 2024 fees   | Proposed FY 2024 fees   | Proposed FY

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology is applied to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Applicable emission factors are sourced from the latest data provided by Eskom and Defra, in addition to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report and the IPCC 2006 Guidelines.\n\nScope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources that companies own or control directly. Direct GHG emissions are principally the result of the following types of activities undertaken by the company:\n\n- \u00b7 Generation of electricity, heat, or steam - These emissions result from combustion of fuels in stationary sources, e.g., boilers, furnaces, turbines.\n- \u00b7 Physical or chemical processing - Most of these emissions result from manufacture or processing of chemicals and materials, e.g., cement, aluminium, ammonia manufacture, and waste processing.\n- \u00b7 Transportation of materials, products, waste, and employees - These emissions result from the combustion of fuels in company owned/controlled mobile combustion sources (e.g., trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, buses, and cars).\n- \u00b7 Fugitive emissions - These emissions result from intentional or unintentional releases, e.g., equipment leaks from joints, seals, packing, and gaskets; methane emissions from coal mines and venting; hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions during the use of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment; and methane leakages from gas transport.\n\nScope 2 emissions are defined as indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling that is consumed in a companies owned or controlled equipment or operations. Purchased electricity refers to electricity that is purchased or otherwise brought into organisational boundary of the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team with experience in assurance, sustainability performance and carbon emissions.\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we  have  obtained  (and  subject  to  the  inherent  limitations outlined elsewhere in this report), nothing has come to our\n\nattention  that  causes  us  to  believe  that  the  selected sustainability  performance  information  as  set  out  in  the Subject  Matter  paragraph  below,  for  the  year  ended 31 December 2023, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with management's measurement and reporting criteria.\n\n## Subject matter\n\nWe  have  been  engaged  to  provide  a  limited  assurance conclusion in our report on the following selected sustainability performance  information  identified  and  selected  by  MTN's management as requiring independent external assurance:\n\n|   No | Selected sustainability  performance information         | Unit of  measurement   | Reporting Boundary                                               | Location  disclosed in the  Integrated  Report   | Location of  description of  MTN's Criteria in  the Integrated  Report   |\n|------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    1 | Employee sustainable engagement score                    | %                      | MTN Group Limited                                                | page 19                                          | page 143                                                                 |\n|    2 | Calls to whistle-blower hotline                          | Number                 | MTN Group Limited                                                | page 19                                          | page 143                                                                 |\n|    3 | Net Promoter Score (NPS) percentages:  South Africa      | %                      | MTN South Africa                                                 | page 19                                          | page 143                                                                 |\n|    4 | Net Promoter Score (NPS) percentages:  Nigeria           | %                      | MTN Nigeria                                                      | page 19                                          | page 143                                                                 |\n|    5 | Net Promoter Score (NPS) percentages:  Other key markets | %                      | MTN Other key markets \u00b7 Cameroon \u00b7 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire \u00b7 Iran \u00b7 Uganda | page 19                                          | page 143                                                                 |\n|    6 | Total tax contribution (Rbn)                             | ZAR                    | MTN Group Limited                                                | page 19                                          | page 143                                                                 |\n|    7 | Carbon emissions - scope 1 (tCO 2 e)                     | (tCO 2 e)              | MTN South Africa                                                 | page 19                                          | page 144                                                                 |\n|    8 | Carbon emissions - scope 2 (tCO 2 e)                     | (tCO 2 e)              | MTN South Africa                                                 | page 19                                          | page 144                                                                 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe selected sustainability performance information prepared and presented in accordance with management's criteria are marked with the symbol LA (Limited Assurance) to indicate that we have provided limited assurance over the selected sustainability performance information.\n\nOther than as described in the preceding paragraphs, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the Integrated Report, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.\n\n## MTN's responsibilities\n\nThe  Directors  of  MTN  are  responsible  for  the  selection, preparation, and presentation of the selected sustainability performance information in accordance with management's measurement and reporting criteria as set out on page 05 of the  Integrated  Report.  These  responsibilities  include  the identification of stakeholders and stakeholder requirements, key  issues,  commitments  with  respect  to  sustainability performance and design, implementation and maintenance of internal control and maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Integrated Report and any references or statements of compliance with reporting frameworks applied, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe  Directors  of  MTN  are  responsible  for,  in  relation  to application of the reporting standards used in the preparation of  the  Integrated  Report,  those  reports  being  prepared  in accordance  with  the  reporting  principles  as  per  those standards.\n\nThe  Directors  are  also  responsible  for  determining  the appropriateness of the measurement and reporting criteria in view  of  the  intended  users  of  the  selected  sustainability performance information and for ensuring that those criteria are publicly available to the Integrated Report users.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nWhere  MTN's  reporting  of  the  selected  sustainability performance  information  relies  on  factors  derived  by independent  third  parties,  our  assurance  work  has  not included examination of the derivation of those factors and other third-party information.\n\nThe scope of work was limited to the selected sustainability performance information disclosed in the Integrated Report",

The IRBA Code is consistent with the corresponding sections  of  the  International  Ethics  Standards  Board  for Accountants'  International  Code  of  Ethics  for  Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards).\n\nEY also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1,  Quality  Management  for  Firms  that  Perform  Audits  or Reviews  of  Financial  Statements,  or  Other  Assurance  or Related Services engagements, which requires that we design, implement  and  operate  a  system  of  quality  management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the selected sustainability performance information as set out in the Subject Matter paragraph, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with ISAE 3410, Assurance  Engagements  on  Greenhouse  Gas  Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Those Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement  to  obtain  the  appropriate  level  of  assurance about  whether  the  selected  sustainability  performance information is free from material misstatement.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. As a result, the level of assurance  obtained  in  a  limited  assurance  engagement  is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained  had  we  performed  a  reasonable  assurance engagement.\n\n## Summary of work performed\n\nLimited assurance\n\nA limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) and ISAE 3410 involves assessing the  suitability  in  the  circumstances  of  MTN's  use  of  its measurement and reporting criteria as the basis of preparation for  the  selected  sustainability  performance  information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the selected sustainability performance information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the selected  sustainability  performance  information.  A  limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both risk assessment  procedures,  including  an  understanding  of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement. A limited assurance engagement  consists  of  making  enquiries,  primarily  of persons responsible for preparing the sustainability performance information subject matter and related information  and  applying  analytical  and  other  appropriate procedures.\n\nFor the selected sustainability performance information, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Performed analytical procedures to evaluate the reasonability of the reported performance results.\n- \u00b7 Obtained explanations from management in response to our analytical procedures and assessing the reasonability in the context of our understanding of the business.\n- \u00b7 Performed tests of detail on the selected performance information, on a selective basis, as part of assessing whether (i) the data has been appropriately measured, recorded, collated, and reported; and (ii) activities set out by management are appropriately evidenced and reported; and\n- \u00b7 Confirmation with internal or external parties; and\n- \u00b7 Performed procedures to:\n- \u203a Evaluate the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of external service providers acting as management's experts.\n- \u203a Obtain an understanding of the work of the management expert; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u203a Evaluate the appropriateness of the management expert's work as evidence, including assessing the data provided by MTN as an input to the expert's work.\n- \u203a We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  evidence  obtained  is  sufficient  and appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  limited  assurance conclusion.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nApart from what was reported in our assurance report for the prior period (2022), no further assurance procedures were performed on prior periods.\n\n## Restriction of Liability\n\nOur  report,  including  our  conclusions,  has  been  prepared solely for the Board of Directors of MTN in accordance with the  agreement  between  us  and  for  no  other  purpose.  We permit this report to be published in MTN's Integrated Report to  assist  the  Directors  in  responding  to  their  governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent assurance report in connection with the selected sustainability performance information.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume  responsibility  to  anyone  other  than  the  Board  of Directors  of  MTN  for  our  work  or  for  our  report  and  the conclusion contained therein. We agree to publication of our assurance report within MTN's Integrated Report provided it is clearly understood by recipients or readers of the Report and that we accept no duty of care to them whatsoever in respect of our independent assurance report.\n\nMaintenance and integrity of MTN's website is the responsibility of  MTN  management.  Our  procedures  did  not  involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly we accept no responsibility for any  changes  to  either  the  selected sustainability performance information as reported, or our independent assurance report that may occur subsequent to the initial date of publication of the Report on MTN's website.\n\nErnst & Young Inc.\n\nDirector: Morkel Hendrik Pienaar\n\nRegistered Auditor\n\nChartered Accountant (SA)\n\n29 April 2024 102 Rivonia Road, Sandton, Johannesburg\n\nSouth Africa",

As part of our sustainability strategy, we have identified primary and secondary UNSDGs where we have the greatest contribution, aligning these with our four sustainability pillars. Guided by the best practice proposed in the SDG Compass and the SDG Impact Standards we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of impact along MTN's value chain to help identify which SDGs MTN is best positioned to make a difference on. As we further engage with business and look to consciously embed SDGs in our organisation there could be slight adjustments to MTN's priority areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS\n\n## Transfer secretaries\n\nComputershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited Registration number 2004/003647/070 Rosebank Towers, 15 Biermann Avenue Rosebank, 2196\n\nPO Box 61051, Marshalltown, 2107\n\n## Auditor\n\nErnst & Young Inc. 102 Rivonia Road, Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa, 2146\n\n## Lead sponsor\n\nTamela Holdings Proprietary Limited Ground Floor, Golden Oak House, 35 Ballyclare Drive, Bryanston, 2021\n\n## Joint sponsor\n\nJ.P.
