The majority of our proved reserves are located in the adjacent offshore Campos and Santos Basins in southeast Brazil. Their proximity allows us to optimize  our  infrastructure  and  limit  our  costs  of  exploration,  development  and production.  Additionally,  we  have  developed  technical  knowledge  in  deepwater exploration  and  production  from  almost  50  years  of  developing  Brazil's  offshore basins, including the Campos and Santos Basins. The Campos and Santos Basins are expected to remain the main source of our future growth in proved reserves and oil and gas production.\n\nOur business, however, goes beyond the oil and gas exploration and production. It entails a long process through which we get the oil and gas to our refineries and gas treatment units which themselves must be equipped and in constant evolution to supply the best products.\n\nWe operate the majority of the refining capacity in Brazil. Our refining capacity is substantially concentrated in southeast Brazil, within the country's most populated and industrialized markets and adjacent to the sources of most of our crude oil in the Campos and Santos Basins. We meet our demand for oil products through a planned combination of domestic refining of crude oil and oil products imports, seeking value creation. We are also involved in the production of petrochemicals through stakes in some companies. We distribute oil products through wholesalers and retailers.\n\nWe  also  participate  in  the  Brazilian  natural  gas  market,  including  the  logistics, distribution and processing of natural gas.",

We  also  participate  in  the  domestic  power market  primarily  through  our  investments  in  gas-fired,  fuel  oil  and  diesel  oil thermoelectric power plants and in renewable energy.\n\nWe currently divide our business into three main segments:\n\n- \\_ Exploration  and  Production  ('E&P'): this  segment  covers  the  activities  of exploration, development and production of crude oil, Natutal Gas Liquids ('NGL') and  natural  gas  in  Brazil  and  abroad,  for  the  primary  purpose  of  supplying  our domestic refineries. The E&P segment also operates through partnerships with other companies, including holding interests in non-Brazilian companies in this segment.\n- \\_ Refining,  Transportation  and  Marketing  ('Refining'): this  segment  covers  the activities of refining, logistics, transport, marketing and trading of crude oil and oil products in Brazil and abroad, exports of ethanol, petrochemical operations, such as extraction  and  processing  of  shale,  as  well  as  holding  interests  in  petrochemical companies in Brazil.\n- \\_ Gas and Power ('G&P'): this segment covers the activities of logistics and trading of natural gas and electricity, transportation and trading of LNG, generation of electricity by  means  of  thermoelectric  power  plants,  as  well  as  holding  interests  in transportation and distribution companies of natural gas in Brazil and abroad. It also includes natural gas processing and fertilizer operations.\n\nActivities that are not attributed to the business segments are classified as 'Corporate and  Other  Businesses'  including,  notably  those  related  to  corporate  financial management, corporate overhead and other expenses, provision for the class action settlement, and actuarial expenses related to the pension and medical benefits for retired employees and their dependents. It also comprises biofuels and distribution businesses. The biofuels business covers the activities of production of biodiesel and its co-products and ethanol. The distribution business covers the equity interest in the associate BR Distribuidora and the business for the distribution of oil products abroad (South America).\n\nFor further information regarding our business segments, see Notes 13 and 33 to our audited consolidated financial statements, as well as 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' in this annual report.",

Our Board of Directors, in turn, selects our management.\n\nOn  February  19,  2021,  the  Brazilian  federal  government,  through  the  Ministry  of Mines and Energy (MME), issued a formal notice ( oficio ) to the Chairman of our Board of Directors requesting that the Chairman call a general shareholders meeting for the election of Directors. The notice designated Joaquim Silva e Luna to replace Roberto da Cunha Castello Branco as a Director, based on the Brazilian federal government's power to remove members of the Board of Directors.  It also requested the Board of Directors to subsequently consider and elect Mr. Silva e Luna to replace Mr. Castello Branco as our CEO. Media reports have suggested that the decision to replace Mr. Castello  Branco  was  related  to  our  February  2021  announcement  of  increases  in prices for diesel and gasoline products.\n\nUnder  Brazilian  law,  the  removal  of  a  Director  elected  by  cumulative  voting automatically results in the removal of all other Directors elected through the same mechanism.  Mr.  Castello  Branco  and  seven  other  Directors  were  elected  by cumulative voting in the July 2020 Ordinary Shareholders Meeting.  The MME notice proposed that, at the meeting to replace Mr. Castello Branco, the other Directors be re-elected  for  the  balance  of  their  terms.    However,  five  of  the  seven  have  since announced that they would not accept their nomination for the election (Jo\u00e3o Cox Neto, Nivio Ziviani, Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Omar Carneiro da Cunha Sobrinho and Leonardo Pietro Antonelli).\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the Brazilian federal government, through MME and the Ministry of Economy, designated six individuals for election to the Board of Directors:  Eduardo Bacellar Leal Ferreira (for Chairman of the Board), Joaquim Silva e Luna, Ruy Flaks Schneider,  M\u00e1rcio  Andrade  Weber,  Murilo  Marroquim  de  Souza  and  Sonia  Julia Sulzbeck Villalobos.\n\nOn March 8, 2021, minority shareholders designated Leonardo Pietro Antonelli for a Board position in the event that the election is conducted using cumulative voting. Under Brazilian law, the election of our Board members must be by cumulative voting if requested by holders of at least 5% of the outstanding shares. If cumulative voting is  adopted,  the  Brazilian  federal  government  may  not  be  able  to  elect  all  of  its designees in the general shareholders meeting.\n\nOn March 10, 2021, the Brazilian federal government, through MME, designated two more individuals for election to the Board of Directors: Cynthia Santana Silveira and Ana  Silvia  Corso  Matte.  These  additional  designations  completed  the  list  of  eight nominees by the Brazilian federal government.",

This meeting may provide more definition about the  future  of  Petrobras,  the  composition  of  our  Board  of  Directors  and  our management team. However, the situation is changing rapidly and there can be no certainty  as  to  the  outcome  of  that  meeting,  the  composition  of  our  Board  of Directors or our management team.\n\nFor a current list of our Executive Officers and Board of Director members as of the date of this annual report, see 'Management and Employees - Management' and 'Management and Employees - Executive Officers' in this annual report.\n\nIt  is  possible  that  members  of  our  Board  of  Directors  may  resign  prior  to  the Extraordinary General Meeting. Our CEO is expected to depart once his removal is approved  by  a  majority  of  votes  at  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting.  It  is  also possible that our CFO and other members of our senior management may depart, whether by termination or resignation, after the Extraordinary General Meeting. On March 24, 2021, four of our executive officers, Andrea Almeida, Chief Financial and Investor Relations Officer, Carlos Alberto Pereira de Oliveira, Chief Exploration and Production Officer, Andr\u00e9 Chiarini, Chief Trading and Logistics Officer, and Rudimar Andreis Lorenzatto, Chief Production Development Officer, informed our Board that they do not intend to renew their respective terms in such positions.  Although their terms expired on March 20, 2021, they will continue to serve until their successors are  appointed,  in  accordance  with  Brazilian  law.  On  March  24,  2021,  our  Board approved  the  appointment  of  Salvador  Dahan  as  our  new  Chief  Governance  and Compliance Officer, to be effective following completion of all internal processes.  If there are vacancies at the Board of Directors or in senior management, it is possible that such positions will not be filled promptly.\n\nThe  potential  changes  to  the  composition  of  our  Board  of  Directors  and  our management team may result in significant additional uncertainty. It is difficult to predict  the  future  strategic,  business  or  policy  decisions  or  views  that  any  newlyelected members of our Board of Directors or our management team may take or have,  and  we  cannot  predict  how  this  will  affect  our  business,  our  results  of operations and our financial condition, which could in turn adversely affect the value of our securities.",

        "page_content": "## Potential Changes to our Strategic Plan and our Pricing Policies\n\nOur Strategic Plan consists of our continuous evaluation of the business environment and the implementation of our strategies, allowing for adjustments to be made in a more efficient way.  See 'Strategic Plan-2021-2025 Strategic Plan' in this annual report.    The  recent  developments  described  above,  including  any  changes  to  our Board  of  Directors  and  our  management  team,  may  affect  not  only  our  ability  to implement our Strategic Plan, but whether that Strategic Plan remains in place, as well as the direction of any subsequent strategic plans, including decisions related to the management of our operations and investments.\n\nOur current pricing policy in Brazil takes into account domestic market conditions and seeks to align the price of oil products with international prices. Specifically, diesel oil, gasoline, LPG, jet fuel, fuel oil and other minor product prices are defined taking into account  the  international  import  parity  price,  margins  to  remunerate  the  risks inherent in our operations and the level of market share.\n\nIn 2021, we raised fuel prices according to international price parity as global oil prices surged. Although we announced increases in fuel prices in early March, on March 24, 2021, we announced that we would decrease wholesale diesel prices by 4.2% and wholesale  gasoline  prices  by  4.4%,  effective  on  March  25,  2021.  For  more information, see 'Risks-Financial Risks-Our cash flow and profitability are exposed to the volatility of prices of oil, gas and oil products' and 'Our Business-Refining, Transportation  and  Marketing-Marketing-Oil  products  prices.'  The  Brazilian federal government has recently made statements regarding the need to modify and adjust our pricing policy for domestic conditions.\n\nIn  February  2021,  the  Brazilian  federal  government  announced,  for  a  two-month period,  changes  in  state  fuel  taxes,  and  in  March  2021,  announced  that  it  would eliminate federal taxes on diesel fuel (for two months) and residential LPG.\n\nIn  view  of  the  statements  made  by  the  Brazilian  President  and  the  recent developments described above, the new CEO, the new management team or the new Board of Directors may propose changes to our pricing policies, including a decision that such policies will not seek for alignment with international price parity.  Changes to our fuel pricing policy could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, our results of operations and our financial condition, which could in turn adversely affect the value of our securities.\n\n## Lava Jato Investigation\n\nIn  2021,  the  Brazilian  Supreme  Court  started  to  decide  cases  brought  by  criminal defendants in Lava Jato proceedings aimed at nullifying criminal convictions relating to the investigation. These cases are still in progress and their outcomes may affect our interests. For more information, see 'Risks-Risk Factors-We may face additional proceedings  related  to  the  Lava  Jato  investigation'  and  'Legal  and  Tax-Legal Proceedings-Lava Jato Investigation' in this annual report.",

In particular, deepwater, ultra-deepwater and refining activities present various risks, such as oil spills and explosions in our refineries and exploration and production units, including platforms, ships, pipelines, terminals and dams, among other assets owned or operated by us. These events may occur due to  technical  failures,  human  errors  or  natural  events,  among  other  factors.  The occurrence of one of these events, or other related incidents, may result in various damages  such  as  death,  and  serious  environmental  damage,  and  may  impact  our workforce  or  communities.  They  may  cause  property  damage,  loss  of  production, financial  losses  and,  in  certain  circumstances,  liability  in  civil,  labor,  criminal, environmental and administrative lawsuits. As a consequence, we may incur expenses for cleaning, repairing or remedying the damages caused.\n\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to a number of risks that could, individually or together, have an effect on our financial performance. We classify the risks to which we are exposed in the following groups: (i) operational risks, (ii) financial risks, and (iii) compliance, legal and regulatory risks. We also describe herein the risks arising from the government ownership and country risks, as well as debt and equity securities risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If this interference continues, we may experience short-term or long-term accidents, leaks or damage in our facilities as a result, which can impact the continuation of our operations. In  addition,  we  may  be  compelled  to  indemnify  for  any  damages  caused  to  the environment or to third parties because of these incidents. In addition, public health epidemics and pandemics such as the Covid-19 outbreak could cause health restrictions to  our  workforce  and,  therefore,  impact  the  operation  of  some  of  our  facilities, including our platforms, refineries, terminals, among others. This condition could have a negative impact on our results and financial condition. Finally, due to risks such as those mentioned above, we may face difficulties in obtaining or maintaining operating licenses and may suffer damages to our image and reputation.\n\nChanges in  the  competitive  environment  of  the  Brazilian  oil  and  gas  market  may intensify the requirements for our performance levels to remain in line with the best companies in the sector. The need to adapt to an increasingly competitive and more complex environment may compromise our ability to implement our current Strategic Plan or any subsequent plans adopted.\n\nWe may face greater competitive forces in the downstream segment in Brazil, with the emergence of new companies competing against us in this sector. If we are unable to maximize return on capital employed, reduce costs, sell our products competitively, and implement new technologies in our business, we may encounter adverse effects on our results and operations.\n\nAdditionally,  in  the  upstream  segment,  we  may  not  be  successful  in  acquiring exploration blocks in future bidding rounds if our competitors are able to bid based on better cost and capital structures than us. In that case, we may therefore have difficulty in repositioning our portfolio towards upstream assets that offer higher profitability and  competitive  advantage,  especially  in  the  pre-salt  layer,  which  could  negatively affect our results.\n\nIn addition, changes in the regulatory framework and inquiries regarding compliance with antitrust and competition laws may subject us to penalties, business restrictions and difficulties in renewing concessions, adversely affecting our operations, results and reputation.\n\nIn order to create a favorable environment for new investors to enter the natural gas and  refining  industries  in  Brazil,  we  signed  commitment  agreements  with  the Administrative  Council  for  Economic  Defense  (CADE)  and  the  National  Petroleum, Natural  Gas  and  Biofuels  Agency  (ANP).  Under  the  agreements,  we  committed  to include  some  of  our  shareholding  participation  in  companies  and  assets  of  the  gas transportation and distribution segments in our divestment program and to renounce some of the contracted transportation network capacity (of injection and withdrawal volumes),  which  would  create  more  competitive  conditions  to  encourage  new economic  agents  to  enter  the  downstream  market.  Failure  to  comply  with  these commitment  agreements  may  result  in  negative  impacts  such  as  administrative proceedings and fines.",

Interruption or malfunction affecting these systems and/ or their infrastructure,  as  a  result  of  obsolescence, technical  failures  and/or  deliberate  acts, may harm or halt our business and adversely impact our operations and reputation.\n\nMoreover, information security failures, including automation systems, either due to external acts, deliberate or unintentional, such as malware,  hacking  and cyberterrorism, or internal ones, such as negligence and misuse from employees or contractors, may also cause impacts on our business, our reputation, our relationship with  stakeholders  and  external  agents  (government,  regulatory  bodies,  partners, suppliers  and  others),  our  strategic  positioning  towards  our  competitors  and  our results. According to Law No. 13,709/2018 Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais ('LGPD'), we will be subject to penalties in cases of disclosure or misuse of personal information.\n\n## The selection and development of our investment projects have risks that may affect our expected results.\n\nWe have numerous project opportunities in our portfolio of investments. Since most projects  are  characterized  by  a  long  development  period,  we  may  face  changes  in market  conditions,  such  as  changes  in  prices,  consumer  preferences  and  demand profile,  exchange  and  interest  rates  and  financing  conditions  of  projects  that  may jeopardize our expected rate of return on these projects.\n\nWe  also  face  specific  risks  for  oil  and  gas  projects.  Despite  our  experience  in  the exploration  and  production  of  oil  in  deepwater  and  ultra-deepwater  and  the continuous development of studies during the planning stages, the quantity and quality of oil produced in a certain field will only be fully known in the phases of deployment and operation, which may require adjustments throughout the project lifecycle and its expected rate of return.\n\nFurthermore, decommissioning projects have grown and become more relevant to our portfolio  as  concession  contracts  and  production  systems  expire.  With  the  recent publication of Resolution ANP 817/2020, we might face some difficulties in defining the scope of these decommissioning projects and meeting the regulation requirements, particularly in light of our and the industry's learning curve in this area.\n\nMoreover, despite our experience in exploration and production, we may face new technical challenges as we move closer to the technology frontier.\n\nIn  addition,  public  health  epidemics  and  pandemics  such  as  the  Covid-19  outbreak could cause restrictions on of our workforce, partners and suppliers, that could have an impact in the productivity of various activities.\n\nExternal factors could impact the successful implementation of our partnerships and our portfolio management.\n\nPursuant  to  our  Strategic  Plan,  our  divestment  portfolio  includes  several  assets  in different stages of the sales process, which we expect to conclude in the coming years.",

See 'Recent Developments' in this annual report.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our planned partnerships and divestments, or if our divestment plan is modified, this may negatively impact our business, results and financial condition, including by potentially exposing us to short and medium-term liquidity constraints.\n\n## Climate change could impact our results and strategy.\n\nClimate  change  poses  new  challenges  and  opportunities  for  our  business.  More stringent environmental regulations can result in the imposition of costs associated with  greenhouse gas emissions, either through environmental agency requirements relating to mitigation initiatives or through other regulatory measures such as carbon pricing taxation limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, which have the potential to increase our operating costs and reduce production.\n\nIn addition, environmental laws that may be implemented in the future could increase litigation risks and have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nThe risks associated with climate change could also include difficulties to access capital due  to  public  image  issues  with  investors;  changes  in  the  consumer  profile,  with reduced  consumption  of  fossil  fuels;  and  energy  transitions  in  the  world  economy, towards a lower carbon matrix, with the insertion of substitute products for fossil fuels and  the  increasing  use  of  electricity  for  urban  mobility.  These  factors  may  have  a negative impact on the demand for our products and services and may jeopardize or even impair the implementation and operation of our businesses, adversely impacting our results and financial condition and limiting some of our growth opportunities.\n\nMaintaining  our  long-term  objectives  for  oil  production  depends  on  our  ability  to successfully obtain and develop oil reserves.\n\nOur ability to maintain our long-term objectives for oil production is highly dependent upon our ability to obtain additional reserves and to successfully develop our existing reserves.",

We possess, as a concessionaire or contracted party of certain oil and natural gas fields in Brazil, the exclusive right to develop the volumes of crude oil and natural  gas  included  in  our  reserves  pursuant  to  concession  and  other  agreements. Access to crude oil and natural gas reserves is essential to an oil and gas company's sustained production and generation of income, and our ability to generate income would be adversely affected if the Brazilian  federal  government  were to  restrict or prevent us from exploiting these crude oil and natural gas reserves.\n\n## As a result of divestments and partnerships, we are exposed to risks that could lead to unforeseen financial losses.\n\nUpon  completion  of  each  divestment  or  partnership  (post-closing  stage),  we  must perform integrated management and monitoring of the actions required and provided for in the contracts related to each project, paying attention to the fulfillment of the obligations established for the buyer and the seller.

International prices for oil and oil products are volatile and strongly influenced by conditions and expectations of world supply and demand. In addition,  public  health  epidemics  and  pandemics  (such  as  the  Covid-19  pandemic during 2020) could affect oil prices and demand, which, consequently, may affect our financial results.

Price adjustments can be made at any time. Since one of our pricing  objectives  is  to  maintain  fuel  prices  in  parity  with  global  market  trends, substantial or extended declines in international crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition, and may also affect the value of our proved reserves.Additionally, the periodicity of the fuel readjustments, determined by us, may be revised due to exogenous factors that affect our customers, such as the transportation sector, among others and consequently, our business.\n\nIn the past, our management has adjusted our pricing of oil, gas and oil products from time to time. In the future, there may be periods during which our product prices will not be at parity with international product prices. Actions of the Brazilian government, as  our  controlling  shareholder,  could  affect  these  pricing  decisions.    See  '-Risks Relating  to  Our  Relationship  with  the  Brazilian  Federal  Government-The  Brazilian federal government, as our controlling shareholder, may pursue certain macroeconomic and social objectives through  us  that may  have  a  material  adverse effect on us.' We cannot guarantee that our way of setting prices will not change in the future. As a result, when we are a net importer by volume of oil and oil products to meet  Brazilian  demand,  increases  in  the  price  of  crude  oil  and  oil  products  in  the international markets may have a negative impact on our costs of sales and margins, since the cost to acquire such oil and oil products may exceed the price at which we are able to sell these products in Brazil.  A similar effect occurs when the real depreciates in  relation  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  as  we  sell  oil  and  oil  products  in  Brazil  in  reais  and international prices for crude oil and oil products are set in U.S. dollars. A depreciation of the real increases our cost of imported oil and oil products, without a corresponding increase  in  our  revenues  unless  we  are  able  to  increase  the  price  at  which  we  sell products in Brazil.\n\nThe Brazilian President has, at times, made statements regarding the need to modify and adjust our pricing policy for domestic conditions.  In view of the statements made by  the  Brazilian  President  and  the  recent  developments  described  in  'Recent Developments' above, a new CEO, a new management team or Board of Directors may propose changes to our pricing policies, including a decision that such policies will not seek for alignment with international price parity.  Changes to our fuel pricing policy could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, results, financial condition, and the value of our securities. See 'Recent Developments' in this annual report.\n\nWe have substantial liabilities and may be exposed to significant liquidity constraints in  the  near  and  medium  term,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our financial condition and results.\n\nWe have incurred in a substantial amount of debt related to investments decisions taken in the past and in order to finance the capital expenditures needed to meet our long-term objectives.\n\nSince there may be liquidity restrictions on the debt market to finance our planned investments and repay principal and interest obligations under the terms of our debt, any difficulty in raising significant amounts of debt capital in the future may impact our results and the ability to fulfill our Strategic Plan or any subsequent plan adopted.",

The impact on our ability to obtain financing and the cost of financing may adversely affect our results and financial condition.\n\nIn  addition,  our  credit  rating  is  sensitive  to  any  change  in  the  credit  rating  of  the Brazilian federal government. Any further lowering of the Brazilian sovereign's credit ratings may have additional adverse consequences on our ability to obtain financing or the cost of our financing, and consequently, on our results and financial condition.\n\n## We are vulnerable to increased debt service resulting from depreciation of the real in relation to the U.S. dollar and increases in prevailing market interest rates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 84.9% of our financial debt was denominated in currencies other than the real .  A  substantial portion of our indebtedness is, and is expected to continue  to  be,  denominated  in  or  indexed  to  the  U.S.  dollar  and  other  foreign currencies. A further depreciation of the real against any of these other currencies will increase our debt service in reais , as the amount of reais necessary to pay principal and interest on foreign currency debt will increase with this depreciation.\n\nForeign exchange variations may have an immediate impact on our reported income.

As most of our revenues are denominated in reais but linked to Brent prices in U.S. dollars, unless we increase the prices of our products in the local market to reflect the depreciation of the real ,  our cash generation relative to our capacity to service debt may decline.\n\nTo the extent we refinance our maturing obligations with newly contracted debt, we may incur additional interest expense.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 41.9% of our finance debt consisted of floating rate debt. We generally do not enter into derivative contracts or similar financial instruments or make other arrangements with third parties to hedge against the risk of an increase in interest rates.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  such  floating  rates  rise,  we  may  incur  in  additional  expenses. Moreover,  as  we  refinance  our  existing  debt  in  the  coming  years,  the  mix  of  our indebtedness  may  change,  specifically  as  it  relates  to  the  ratio  of  fixed  to  floating interest rates, the ratio of short-term to long-term debt, and the currencies in which our debt is denominated or to which it is indexed.\n\nChanges that affect the composition of our debt and cause rises in short or long-term interest rates may increase our debt service payments, which could have an adverse effect on our results and financial condition.",

It  is  also  difficult  to  project  the  effectiveness  of internal control over financial reporting for future periods, as our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or because our degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate and we cannot be certain that in the future additional material weaknesses will not occur or otherwise be identified in a timely manner.\n\nAny failure to maintain our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results in future periods accurately and in a timely manner, and to file required forms and documents with government authorities, including the SEC. We may also be unable to detect accounting errors in our financial reports or may even have to restate our financial results.

As part of the SEC resolution, we settled charges  of  violation  of  the  United  States  Securities  Act  of  1933  and  the  books  and records and internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, without admitting the SEC allegations.\n\nIf, during the term of the NPA (three years, unless extended), the DoJ determines that we  have  committed  a  felony  under  U.S.  federal  law,  provided  deliberately  false  or misleading  information,  or  otherwise  breached  the  NPA,  we  could  be  subject  to prosecution and additional fines or penalties, including charges under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ('FCPA').",

In  each  case,  the  proceedings  were  brought  by  investors  (or entities that allegedly represent investors' interests) who purchased our shares traded on the B3 Stock Exchange or other securities issued by us outside of the United States, alleging damages caused by facts uncovered in the Lava Jato investigations.\n\nIn Argentina, we are the defendant in two criminal lawsuits. The first lawsuit alleges non-compliance  by  us  with  the  obligation  to  disclose  to  the  Argentinian  market  a pending class action filed by Consumidores Financieros Asociaci\u00f3n Civil para su Defensa before  the  Judicial  Commercial  Courts,  pursuant  to  provisions  of  Argentine  capital markets  law.  The  second  criminal  action  alleges  a  fraudulent  offer  of  securities aggravated by allegedly false information included in our financial statements issued prior to 2015.\n\nIn  addition,  EIG  Management  Company,  LLC  ('EIG  Management')  and  eight  of  EIG Management's managed funds ('EIG Funds') (together with EIG Management, 'EIG') filed a complaint against us on February 23, 2016 before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The dispute arises out of the EIG Funds' indirect purchase of equity interests in Sete Brasil Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A., and EIG currently has claims against us for fraud and aiding and abetting fraud related to the Lava Jato investigation. EIG seeks damages of at least US$221 million.\n\nIt is possible that additional complaints or claims might be filed in the United States, Brazil, or elsewhere against us relating to the Lava Jato investigation in the future. It is also possible that further information damaging to us and our interests will come to light in the course of the ongoing investigations of corruption by Brazilian authorities. Our management may be required to direct its time and attention to defending these claims, which could prevent them from focusing on our core business.",

We may be required to restate our financial statements to further adjust the write offs representing the overstatement of our assets recognized in our audited consolidated financial statements for prior years.\n\nDiffering interpretations and numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and industry standards that are becoming more stringent may result in increased capital and operating expenditures and decreased production.\n\nOur activities are subject to evolving industry standards and best practices, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment, both in Brazil and in other jurisdictions where we operate. These laws, regulations and requirements may result in significant costs, which may have a negative impact on the profitability of the projects we intend to implement or may make such projects economically unfeasible.\n\nAny substantial increase in expenditures for compliance with environmental, health or safety  regulations  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  and  financial condition. These increasingly stringent laws, regulations and requirements may result in significant decreases in our production, including unplanned shutdowns, which may also have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition.\n\nMoreover, we have operational units in several metropolitan regions of the country and, in some of these locations, the concentration of pollutants generated by a variable set  of  polluters  (industries,  passenger  cars,  trucks,  etc.)  may  exceed  the  air  quality standards defined by legislation. Recently, more restrictive air quality standards were defined, which may increase the demands on industrial units installed in regions that already have air quality problems. This could include obstacles to obtaining or renewing operating licenses and the need to adopt new environmental control practices such as new types of practices, increasing the frequency of monitoring emissions and installing new environmental protection equipment, generating higher costs for us. There is also a risk that the use of fuels will be subject to restrictions related to the level of pollutant emissions, which may increase the need for investments in refineries or loss of market.\n\nIn addition, changes  in  interpretation  or  differing  interpretations  regarding environmental,  health  and  safety  regulations,  as  well  as  our  decision  to  settle  any claims related to such regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results.",

In some cases, when we have exhausted all administrative appeals relating to a tax contingency, further appeals must be made in the judicial courts, which may require that, in order to appeal, we provide collateral to judicial courts, such as the deposit of amounts equal to the potential tax liability in addition to accrued interest and  penalties.  In  certain  of  these  cases,  settlement  of  the  matter  may  be  a  more favorable option for us.\n\nWe may face similar situations in which our interpretation of a tax regulation may differ from that of tax authorities, or tax authorities may dispute our interpretation and we may eventually take unanticipated provisions and charges. In addition, the eventual settlement of one tax dispute may have a broader impact on other tax disputes.

As  a  result,  a  number  of politicians, including senior federal officials and congressmen, resigned or have been arrested.\n\nCurrently, elected officials and other public officials in Brazil are being investigated for allegations of unethical and illegal conduct identified during the Lava Jato investigation being  conducted  by  the  Office  of  the  Brazilian  Federal  Prosecutor.  The  potential outcome of these investigations is unknown, but they have already had an adverse impact  on  the  image  and  reputation  of  the  implicated  companies  (including  us),  in addition to the adverse impact on general market perception of the Brazilian economy.

        "page_content": "In  order  to  support  the  risk  management  process,  our  corporate  risk  management policy specifies authorities to be consulted, responsibilities to be undertaken, and five principles and ten guidelines that drive our risk management initiatives.\n\nThis  policy  has  a  comprehensive  approach  to  corporate  risk  management,  which combines the traditional economic and financial risk management approach with other relevant areas of interest, such as protection of life, health and environment, assets and business information protection (property and security) and combating fraud and corruption  (legal  and  compliance),  among  other  corporate  risks.  With  a  focus  on integrating risk management actions, our policy allows any employee to have access to the terms and concepts related to risk management, as well as to the measures taken and parties responsible for the management of each of the risks we are exposed to.\n\nFor further information regarding our revised business risk management policy, please visit our website at www.petrobras.com.br/ir. The information on this website, which might be accessible through a hyperlink resulting from this URL, is not and shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this annual report.\n\n## Disclosures about Market Risk\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe operate in an integrated manner throughout the various stages of the oil industry. A significant  portion  of  our  results  relate  directly to  oil  exploration  and  production, refining and the sale of natural gas, biofuels, and electricity in Brazil. As our purchases and sales of crude oil and oil products are linked to international commodity prices, we are exposed to their price fluctuations, which may influence our profitability, our cash flow from operations and our financial situation.\n\nWe prefer to maintain exposure to the price cycle than use financial derivatives to systematically  protect  purchases  and  sale  transactions  that  focus  on  fulfilling  our operation  needs.  However,  based  on  crude  oil  market  conditions  and  prospects  of realization  of  our  Strategic Plan, we  may  decide to  implement protection strategies using financial instruments to manage our cash flow expenses.\n\nIn addition, we are party to derivative contracts in order to protect our margins for short-term  commercial  transactions  carried  out  abroad.  Our  derivatives  contracts provide economic hedges for oil product purchases and sales in the global markets, generally expected to occur within a 30 to 360-day period.\n\nFor  more  information  about  our  commodity  derivatives  transactions,  including  a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the net change in fair value of a 25% (or 50%) adverse change in the price of the underlying commodity for options and futures, see Note 38 to our audited consolidated financial statements.",

The coverages of these policies are contracted according to the objectives we  define  and  the  limitations  imposed  by  the  global  insurance  and  reinsurance markets. Although some policies are issued in Brazil, most of our policies are reinsured abroad with reinsurers rated A- or higher by Standard & Poor's or A3 by Moody's and/or B ++ or higher by A.M. Best.\n\nOur policies are subject to deductibles, limits, exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all possible  consequences  and  damages  associated  with  our  activities.  Thus,  it  is  not possible  to  assure  that  insurance  coverage  will  exist  for  all  damages  resulting  from possible incidents or accidents, which may negatively affect our results.\n\nSpecifically, we do not maintain insurance coverage to safeguard our assets in case of war or sabotage. We also do not maintain coverage for business interruption, except for some specific assets in Brazil. Generally, we do not maintain coverage for our wells in operation in Brazil, except when required by a joint operating agreement. In addition, our third-party liability policies do not cover government fines or punitive damages.\n\nOur national property damage policies have a maximum deductible of US$180 million and their indemnity limits can reach US$2.2 billion for refineries and US$1.9 billion for platforms, depending on the replacement value of our assets.\n\nOur  general  third-party  liability  policy  with  respect  to  our  onshore  and  offshore activities  in  Brazil,  including  losses  due  to  sudden  pollution,  such  as  oil  spills,  has  a maximum indemnity limit of US$250 million with an associated deductible of US$10 million. We also maintain marine insurance with additional protection and indemnity against third parties related to our domestic offshore operations with an indemnity limit  of  US$50  million  up  to  US$500  million,  depending  on  the  type  of  vessel.  For activities in Brazil, in the event of an explosion or similar event on one of our non-fixed offshore platforms, these policies may provide third-party combined liability coverage of up to US$750 million. In addition, although we do not insure most of our pipelines against property damage, we have insurance against damages or losses to third parties arising from specific incidents, such as unexpected infiltration and oil pollution.",

We  maintain  separate  well-control  insurance  policies  in  our international operations to cover liabilities arising from the uncontrolled eruption of oil, gas, water or drilling fluid. In addition, such policies cover claims of environmental damage caused by wellbore explosion and similar events as well as related clean-up costs with coverage limits of up to US$198 million depending on the country.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nEmerging risks are the long-term risks that we have identified as the most severe and could significantly impact the execution of our current and subsequent strategic plans. We detail below the main emerging risks, which are also briefly described in 'Risks Risk Factors' in this annual report, either as a separate risk factor or as part of one or more risk factors.\n\n## Technology systems, security (cybersecurity) systems, telecommunications systems and services.\n\nRecently, concerns about information security failures have been growing in the world. These failures may have an external source, such as malware, hacking, cyber terrorism, among others. These failures can also have an internal origin, through intentional and fraudulent acts by employees and contractors with the purpose of obtaining personal advantages.\n\nThe  perception  of  the  severity  of  this  risk  by  our  management  has  increased significantly over time. In addition to cybersecurity issues, the concern and actions by our management aimed to improve protection and privacy of personal data held by us.\n\nAccording to Law No. 13,709/2018 - Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais ('LGPD'), we will be subject to penalties in cases of disclosure or misuse of personal information.\n\nWe are using layers of protection over e-mails, analysis of vulnerabilities in networks and applications, audit trails in information systems, privileged access control, updating security  packages,  authentication  of  devices  and  users  for  access  to  the  internet, corporate  network,  internet  content  filters,  encryption  and  segregation  of  key functions.\n\nAdditionally, in order to guarantee our security in a world where data is considered valuable we have maintained an area dedicated to information security, linked to the Digital Transformation and Innovation Executive Officer, for the purpose of centralizing management related to all security information disciplines.",

        "page_content": "The strategic initiative for digital transformation of our Strategic Plan aims to prepare for  a  competitive  environment  that  is  being  increasingly  influenced  by  digital technologies and a new way of working, based on collaboration. The possibilities for transforming  operational  and  business  models  bring  opportunities  to  increase  the efficiency and safety of operations, reduce costs and bring more robustness and agility to  decisions.  Efforts  go  beyond  the  implementation  of  technological  solutions,  also seeking  to  implement  a  culture  of  innovation  that  promotes  experimentation, multifunctional collaboration and information sharing.\n\nFor  more  details,  see  'Risks  -  Risk  Factors  -  Digital  Transformation'  in  this  annual report.\n\n## Carbon Risk\n\nThe  Paris  Agreement  requires  a  profound  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  and  a transformation of the energy supply. Our scenarios point to an unequivocal energy transition and alterations are already being observed in the energy markets, through regulatory changes and some physical impacts of climate change on the infrastructure of  companies  and  countries.  The  industry  leaders  have  been  expanding  their commitments  to  lower  carbon  emissions,  and  the  market's  increasing  demand  for transparency  of  the  results  related  to  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  and  the impacts of the transition to low carbon emissions for the companies. The transition generates a series of additional expenses, both for controlling emissions and eventual adaptations to avoid or mitigate physical risks of the units, as well as for adapting to the business to regulatory and market changes.\n\nThe scenario predicts possible reduction in the demand for fossil fuels, carbon pricing generating higher costs, and segmentation of oils and fuels according to their carbon intensity. Greater requirements regarding the transparency of actions related to low carbon transition can also be expected, with the potential to generate image issues, loss of investors and greater difficulty in capital access.\n\nWhile we work to safeguard a solid financial position in the medium and long term, we also work on our competitiveness to capture potential renewable opportunities from a long-term  perspective.  In  this  context,  the  Strategic  Plan  presents  the  strategies  to 'Undertake  research  aimed  at  operating,  in  the  long  term,  in  petrochemical  and renewable energy businesses with a focus on wind and solar power in Brazil' and 'Add value to the refining park, with more efficient processes and new BioRefining products, such as Biokerosene and Renewable Diesel Fuel, moving towards a low carbon market.'\n\nIn  the  short  and  medium  term,  our  Strategic  Plan  also  contains  ten  sustainability commitments, six of which are related to carbon with clear and well-defined metrics.\n\nSince 2019, metrics related to carbon intensity in our refining and upstream operations have  been  integrated  into  executive  remuneration.  In  2020,  these  metrics  were incorporated  as  a  main  indicator,  influencing  variable  remuneration  not  only  for executives, but for all company employees.",

The  program involves all our operational areas and includes actions related to reduce natural gas flaring, CO2 reinjection, energy efficiency gains and control of operational losses.\n\nThe commitments and actions of the GHG emissions mitigation program are monitored at different levels of governance, including senior management. In 2020, we created a climate  change  executive  management  position,  reinforcing  our  existing  carbon governance, also composed of advisory committees of the Executive Board and the Board of Directors, in addition to several management level positions that evaluate carbon aspects in its activities.\n\nIn  addition,  we  assess  the  physical  risk  associated  with  climate  change  in  our operations,  through  research  and  development  of  climate  regionalization,  with renowned  institutions  in  Brazil  and  abroad  (Federal  University  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo  -  USP, National Institute for Space Research - INPE and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  -  NOAA),  of  parameters  considered  potentially  more  susceptible  to these changes, such as water availability for our refineries and thermoelectric plants and wave, wind and current patterns for our offshore platforms, generating qualified information for the process of our operations adaptation.\n\n## The Covid-19 Pandemic\n\nPublic health epidemics and pandemics, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, can impact our workforce, our partners and our suppliers, which can affect our supply chain and the productivity of many our activities, including impact on some of our facilities, such as our platforms, refineries, terminals, among others. This may have a negative impact on our  results  and  financial  condition.  A  pandemic  has  the  potential  to  influence  our activities in many ways, which can result in operational discontinuity, increased costs, reduced revenues, compromised supply, delays in processes and projects, interruption and / or interdiction of activities. In addition, public health epidemics and pandemics may affect oil prices and demand and, consequently, our financial results. The risk of mass contagion of our own employees and contractors is being monitored by us. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we have observed:\n\n- \\_ A reduction in demand for oil products due to the restriction in the mobility of society by lockdown measures imposed by state and municipal governments.\n- \\_ A decrease in economic activity, recession, unemployment growth due to the closing of small and medium-sized companies, which may affect our supply chain.\n- \\_ The postponement of return to work due to the pandemic, increase of employees' absence from work due to the growth of mental illnesses related to social isolation and social distance.\n- \\_ The increase in freight prices, given the depressed oil prices, led to a shortage of ships in the market, as they were being used to store oil and byproducts.",

Forms of payment vary depending on the applied regulatory model. Biddings rounds are the main process for the acquisition of rights over the exploratory blocks.\n\nThere are currently three regulatory models in Brazil: Concession Agreements, Transfer of Rights Agreements and Production Sharing Agreements. The concession model fully governed  the  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  and  production  until  2010,  when  the Brazilian federal government enacted laws establishing the Transfer of Rights Regime and  the  Production  Sharing  Regime  in  the  Pre-salt  Polygon.

In  addition  to  confirming  the  presence  of  oil  of excellent quality in the southeastern area of the B\u00fazios field, in the Santos Basin, a well test proved greater potential in the pre-salt area of the Albacora field, in the Campos Basin. While the former is considered a promising area for a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading ('FPSO'), the latter still has remaining untapped potential and can continue to contribute to our production.\n\nAnother well in the pre-salt area of the Uirapuru block, in the Santos Basin, also resulted in  discoveries  of  oil  and  gas.  There  is  at  least  one  extension  well  planned  for  this prospect in the next five years. Moreover, a prospect situated in block C-M-657, in the Campos Basin, but outside of the main pre-salt cluster, was drilled this year and the results identified the presence of hydrocarbons. Additional studies are being conducted to provide better measurements and to guarantee each project's economic viability and future resources incorporation.\n\nWe  also  obtained  encouraging  results  outside  the  pre-salt  reservoirs.  In  the southwestern portion of the ring fence of Tartaruga Verde, also located in the Campos Basin, an exploratory well discovered oil in carbonate reservoirs from the Albian age. We  are  currently  evaluating  the  commerciality  of  the  discovery  and  the  possible incorporation of resources into existing infrastructure.",

        "page_content": "Finally,  the  turbiditic  reservoirs  in  the  Sergipe  Alagoas Basin  also  showed  promising results. After the incorporation of the results of two wells in our geological models, there was an increase in the expected volume of both Po\u00e7o Verde and Moita Bonita's appraisal  blocks.  These  results  contributed  to  an  increase  in  the  future  resources incorporation.  We  also  conducted  a  long-term  test  in  the  Farfan  reservoir,  which resulted not only in reduced uncertainties regarding reservoir properties, but also in an increase  of  the  expected  volumes.  Thus,  this  test  confirmed  the  good  productivity projections for this region of the deepwater complex.\n\nIn order to achieve greater return on invested capital, while always prioritizing safety, the speed at which our new projects are implemented is key. Thus, we have a strategic program (PROD1000) with the objective of reducing the implementation time of our projects,  with  the  ambition  to  reach  1,000  days  between  field  discovery  and  the beginning of production, compared to our current average of 3,540 days, considering large projects that use FPSO systems. Our efforts in such program are related to the integration of exploration and production development and technical data teams, the optimization  of  reservoir  processes,  the  standardization  of  FPSO,  subsea  and  well design, the early supplier engagement, the reduction of the construction time, and the optimization of processes using digital technologies and agile methods. As an example of  our  standardization  efforts  in  the  FPSO  design,  we  applied  for  a  patent  for  a Polyvalent Riser Balcony, which can be applied to different project scenarios and reduce engineering time and late changes during the FPSO construction phase.\n\nIn addition, we implemented a strategic program (EXP100) that has the ambition to increase the chance of discovering oil to 100% in exploratory wells, reducing project risks  and  costs  by  expediting  production  development. This program aims to better evaluate  the  prediction  of  geological  properties  through  the  use  of  an  integrated upstream data platform and high-performance computing capacity, that enables the application of more complex algorithms in the processing of large volumes of data. Several initiatives are already underway, with notable advances in the integration of the exploratory database and in the automated interpretation of seismic and well data.\n\n## Production\n\n## Production Development\n\nAfter a field is declared commercially viable, the process of production development begins.  The  investments  made  in  this  phase  are  mainly  focused  on  designing  and contracting production systems, which includes platforms, subsea systems, drilling, and the completion of wells.",

        "page_content": "Over the last ten years, we pursued substantial cost optimizations related to project development.  Time  to  drill  and  complete  wells  in  the  Santos  Basin  pre-salt  area decreased by 64% in 2020 when compared to 2010. In 2020, we spent an average of 117 days in the drilling  and  completion  of  a  pre-salt  well  on  the  Santos  Basin.  This helped  to  significantly  reduce  our  capital  expenditures  per  well.  Through  the  Well Efficiency  Program  (PEP70),  launched  in  2019,  we  strive  to  further  reduce  well construction  costs  by  30%  by  shortening  construction  time,  optimizing  well configurations, streamlining operations and adopting new technologies. In the postsalt, we highlight the adoption of the True One Trip - Three Phases (TOT-3P) technology, which allowed us to build a well in half the estimated time and cost and resulted in savings of US$30 million.\n\nWe have also pursued substantial cost optimizations in wells interconnections in the Santos Basin pre-salt area, with an average cost reduction of around 6-7% per year during the past four years. Regarding the integrity of subsea systems, we have made progress in the development and application of new tools for inspection, leading to greater  reliability  and  availability  of  equipment,  pipelines  and  other  components, especially those subsea components exposed to SCC-CO2 events.\n\nIn 2020, we also completed the Reference Basic Design for the new generation of FPSOs for  pre-salts.  The  design,  which  focuses  on  maximizing  the  economic  value  of production development projects, features solutions aimed at reducing implementation  times,  increasing  system  standardization,  enhancing  operational efficiencies and integrating new technologies and innovations to meet our low carbon commitments. This project incorporates improvements based on more than a decade of  experience  with  the  design,  construction,  start-up  and  operation  of  production platforms in the pre-salt layer.\n\nIn the last three years, we have installed several major systems, mainly in the pre-salt area of the Santos Basin, which helped to mitigate the Santos Basin's natural decline. In  2019,  we  started  four  new  production  systems:  (i)  the  P-76  and  P-77  platforms, located in the B\u00fazios field; (ii) the P-67 platform, located in the Tupi field; and (iii) the P-68, located in the Berbig\u00e3o and Sururu fields. In 2020, we started the P-70 platform, located  in  the  Atapu  field.  Those  five  new  systems  connected  32  new  wells  (19 production wells and 13 injection wells) into our production systems.   We expect to install 13 new FPSOs in the next five years.\n\nIn January 2020, the P-77 platform in the B\u00fazios field reached its full capacity in only 10.4 months. In the B\u00fazios field, we also achieved monthly production records of 615 kbpd of oil and 765 kboed in July, and the highest monthly production achieved by a well  in  Brazil,  with  a  record  of  69.6  kboed  from  the  BUZ-10  well,  registered  in September.  The  performance  of  the  B\u00fazios  platforms  was  aided  by  the  temporary expansion of the oil and gas processing capacity of the units, using spare capacity in power generation and gas compression available until the beginning of gas exports, and by the high production potential of the wells and the reservoir.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, our producing platforms had a daily production of 2.06 million barrels of oil and 2,393 million cubic feet of natural gas (discounting the liquefied volume).  As part of our response to the 2020 oil crisis, we indefinitely mothballed, and have no current plan to reenable, our 63 shallow water platforms (37 active and 26 inactive immediately prior  to  the  mothballing).  Additionally,  during  2020,  and  due  to  divestment  or demobilization efforts, we also discontinued eight active platforms that contributed to our  annual  production.  These  mothballed  and  discontinued  platforms  produced approximately 29 mbbl/d in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we own 43 and lease 16 offshore  producing  platforms.  Besides  these  offshore  platforms,  there  are  three platforms on fields operated by our partners, totalling 62 active platforms.\n\nPre-salt  and  the  fields  under  the  Transfer  of  Rights  Agreements  will  be  particularly important to support our production growth.\n\nIn  2021,  the  FPSO  Carioca  will  be  installed  in  the  S\u00e9pia  field.  This  platform  has  the capacity to process 180 kbpd and 211.9 mmcf/d of natural gas per day and arrived in Rio de Janeiro in February 2021 to finalize the integration and commissioning activities. In 2021, we also expect to install the FPSO Guanabara, the first definitive system in the Mero field. This FPSO has the capacity to process 180 kbpd and 423.8 mmcf/d of natural gas per day and is under construction in China.\n\nAfter negotiations with our partners in the BM-S-11 Consortium, Shell Brasil Petr\u00f3leo Ltda (owning a 25% stake in the partnership) and Petrogal Brasil S.A. (owning a 10% stake in the partnership), we signed a commitment to purchase platform P-71. The unit, which is in the final phase of construction, has a production capacity of 150 kbpd and will be allocated to the Itapu field, which will allow us to begin oil production one year earlier.\n\nWith the commitment to sell P-71, subject to the above-mentioned conditions, the partners of the BM-S-11 Consortium in Brazil agreed to prepare a new development plan for the Tupi field, to be delivered to the ANP in 2021. The acquisition of P-71 and the actions to elaborate a new DP for the Tupi field are in line with our strategy of concentrating our activities on world-class assets in deep and ultra-deepwaters.",

Before that, however, we prioritize  solutions  for  the  continuity  and  maximization  of  production,  including processes for assigning our rights (through divestments) of fields that no longer fit into our strategic portfolio or that have reached their economic limit.\n\nIn 2020, we made advancements in the approval of decommissioning plans and in the execution of activities relating to decommissioning.\n\nWe obtained the approvals of Brazilian regulatory bodies overseeing decommissioning plans as to: the P-07 platform, in the Bicudo field; the P-12 platform, in the Linguado field; the P-15 platform, in the Pira\u00fana field; and the P-32 platform, in the Marlim field, all in the Campos Basin. During 2020, we sold three of those platforms (P-07, P-15 and P-12) through a public  auction,  one  (P-12)  of  which was  already  removed  from the location.\n\nAdditionally,  some  decommissioning  processes  approved  before  2020  have  also advanced.  We  started  the  decommissioning  of  the  FPSO  Piranema  Spirit,  and contracted  Engineering,  Preparation,  Removal  and  Final  Disposal  (EPRD)  services  to assist with the decommissioning of the PCA-1, PCA-2 and PCA-3 platforms.\n\n## Critical Resources in Exploration and Production\n\nWe seek to procure, develop and retain all of the critical resources that are necessary to meet our production targets. Drilling rigs and special vessels are important resources for our exploration and production operations and are centrally coordinated to assure both technical specifications and proper lead time.\n\nSince 2008, we have grown from three rigs capable of drilling in waters with depth greater than 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) to 19 rigs with this capacity as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe have sufficient rigs to meet our production targets, and we will continue to evaluate our drilling and special vessels demands and will adjust our fleet size as needed.",

As of December 31, 2020, we had 13 PLSVs and our specialized vessels were sufficient to meet our needs.\n\nIn the subsea area, we have also been developing the HISEP TM Technology, which is a subsea separation and boosting system that will remove a significant portion of the produced gas rich in CO2 from the seabed, debottlenecking the topside gas processing plants. The new technology will enable the extension of the oil production plateau, accelerating the production and boosting the economics of development projects in areas  with  high  GOR  and  high  CO2  content.  Once  qualified,  HISEP TM will  have  the potential to unlock the development of new FPSO generations suitable for areas with high  GOR  and  high  CO2  content,  since  they  will  benefit  from  the  synergy  between topside and subsea processing systems capacities. This represents an opportunity to maximize oil production with controlled handled gas inventory in the surface facility, reducing CAPEX, OPEX, lead time as well as emissions, improving safety. The HISEP TM will  be  qualified  in  2025  in  the  Mero  Field  via  construction,  installation  and  tests execution in a subsea real scale prototype that will be supported by Libra Consortium's R,D&I levy.",

The B\u00fazios field is the largest discovered deepwater field in the world. It has light oil and high productivity wells.\n\nThe B\u00fazios field is an asset with significant reserves and low lifting costs. It is economically resilient to a low oil price scenario.\n\nIn 2019, we acquired 90% of the exploration and production rights of the surplus volume of the B\u00fazios field from the Transfer of Rights Agreement, in a partnership with CNODC Brasil Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s Ltda. (5%) and CNOOC Petroleum Brasil Ltda. (5%). This acquisition is consistent with the strategy of focusing our investments on world-class assets.\n\nIn March 2020, we signed the Production Sharing Contract for the Suplus of the Transfer of Rights of the B\u00fazios Area (ToR), with CNOOC and CNODC as private partners and Pr\u00e9-Sal Petr\u00f3leo S.A (PPSA) as its manager. The parties have been discussing the global development strategy and other matters related to the co-participation agreement, that will regulate the coexistence of the Transfer of Rights Contract and Production Sharing Contract for the Surplus of the ToR. Pursuant to Ordinance MME 265/2019, the co-participation agreement should be signed by September 2021. Each of the private partners will have the right to increase their participating interest by 5%, if certain conditions have been met.\n\nThere are currently four units in operation in B\u00fazios. A fifth platform, the FPSO Almirante Barroso, is under construction and expected to start production in 2022. FPSO Almirante Barroso will be the first chartered unit in the B\u00fazios Field, capable of processing 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day.\n\nIn  July  2020,  we  received  approval  for  three  additional  operational  units  in  B\u00fazios.  FPSO  Almirante Tamandar\u00e9, a chartered unit that will become the field's sixth production system, is expected to start production  in  2024.  In  addition,  P-78  and  P-79,  two  platforms  owned  by  us,  are  expected  to  start production in 2025.\n\nIn 2020, with less than two years of operation, the B\u00fazios field surpassed the 600 kbpd production mark, due to good operating results and a technical study that allowed its units to operate above the nominal capacity. In addition, three important field records were also achieved in 2020: daily field production of 674 kbbl, monthly field production of 615 kbpd in July and daily production of a single well of 65 kbbl (9BUZ-4-RJS). Moreover, another important milestone achieved this year was the start of gas exports from the P-74 platform.\n\nWe expect better operating results for 2021 due to internal actions that have been taken to improve the production efficiency and the maintenance of the production level above the nominal capacity until the end of 2021. Finally, in 2021 we also expect to start exporting gas from other three FPSOs that are in operation.\n\nIn 2020, investments in the B\u00fazios field totaled US$1.7 billion. According to the Strategic Plan, US$20.2 billion  will  be  invested  over  the  next  five  years.  The  average  daily  production  from  2021  to  2025  is expected  to  be  639  kbbl,  with  Operational  Expenditures  around  US$5.6  billion,  including  leasing  of vessels.",

In 2020, our total production of oil and gas, including NGL, was 2,836 mboed, of which 2,788 mboed were produced in Brazil and 48 mboed were produced abroad, a  2.4%  increase  compared  to  2019.  This  production  growth  was  due  to  higher production in the B\u00fazios and Tupi fields.\n\nOur 2020 operating performance was leveraged by the ramp-up of new production systems in the B\u00fazios and Tupi fields, offsetting the negative effects derivedduring the Covid-19 pandemic. The oil production represented 81% of the average of 2,788 mboed oil and gas produced in Brazil.\n\nOur production in the pre-salt layer reached 1,546 mbbl/d in 2020, representing an increase of 21.1% in relation to our production in 2019.

The pre-salt area is comprised of large accumulations of light oil, of excellent quality and with high commercial value. The post-salt oil production, in deep and ultradeepwaters,  decreased  by  17.3%.  This  was  due  to  natural  decline  in  reservoirs, especially from the Campos Basin.\n\nShallow waters oil production decreased by 51.5%, to 32 mbbl/d, due to hibernation of all  shallow  water  platforms.

        "page_content": "## Tupi Field\n\nIn July 2020, we reached the accumulated production of two billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in the Tupi field, located in the pre-salt of the Santos Basin, approximately 230 km from the coast of the state of  Rio  de  Janeiro.  This  milestone  took  place  in  the  same  month  in  which  we  celebrated  the  20th anniversary of the signing of the concession agreement for block BM-S-11, where the field is located currently producing approximately one million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nThis accumulated production occured just 10 years after the start of the first permanent production system, the FPSO Cidade Angra dos Reis, and 14 years after it was discovered, in 2006. From 2010 to 2019, the consortium, formed by us, with a 65% stake in the partnership with Shell Brasil Petr\u00f3leo Ltda (25% stake in the partnership) and Petrogal Brasil S.A. (10% stake in the partnership), put into operation nine production systems, an average of one system per year.\n\nIn  the  process  of  implementing  these  production  systems,  we  had  to  overcome  a  series  of unprecedented challenges in the industry, such as the distance from the coast and the existence of very few similar reservoirs in the world, ultra-deep reservoirs under a thick layer of salt. In partnership with research  institutions,  partner  companies  and  suppliers,  we  developed  a  series  of  technologies  and innovations  that  allowed  safe  and  profitable  productions  in  pre-salt  fields,  which  continues  to  be  a reference in terms of its environmental performance. As a result of the unprecedented technologies we developed, in 2015 we received the Distinguished Achievement Award for Companies, Organizations and Institutions,  which  is  the  main  award  in  the  industry  and  is  promoted  by  the  Offshore  Technology Conference (OTC).\n\n## The Future of Tupi\n\nTogether  with  our  partners  in  the  BM-S-11  block,  we  have  developed  several  initiatives  aimed  at revitalizing the field even before the start of its decline, seeking to increase the oil and gas recovery factor that can be extracted from the field and, thus, maximize the value of the asset. Working towards this goal, we are developing projects to maintain the reservoir's pressure, such as interconnecting new wells into already implemented production systems and alternating water and gas injection technology (Water Alternating Gas - WAG). In addition to these projects, together with our partners we are also analyzing actions that will be taken according to the terms of the concession and seeking to develop other low-cost and highly reliable technologies that may increase the recovery factor.\n\nWe also carry out limited oil shale mining operations in S\u00e3o Mateus do Sul, in the Paran\u00e1 Basin of Brazil, and convert the kerogen (solid organic matter) from these deposits into synthetic oil and gas. This operation is conducted in an integrated facility and its final products are fuel gas, liquefied petroleum gas ('LPG'), shale naphtha and shale fuel oil. Our business units in Brazil do not utilize the fracking method or the hydraulic fracturing method  for  oil  production,  since  they  are  not  appropriate  in  the  context  of  our operations. Also, we do not inject any water or chemicals in the soil in connection with our open pit oil shale mining operations. Our process consists of crushing, screening and subsequently heating all the shale at high temperatures (pyrolysis) and we have in place a proper segregation process for the by-products derived from such process.",

Our overseas portfolio includes approximately 60 clients, such as refiners that process or have processed Brazilian oils regularly, distributed throughout China, Americas, Europe, and other countries in Asia.\n\n## OIL CLIENTS (% VOL)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFuel oil is one of the most representative types of oil products in terms of volume in exports. In 2020, we exported high sulfur oil and, to a greater degree, low sulfur fuel oil to several destinations. Our fuel oil is available in the major hubs in the market such as Singapore, the Mediterranean, the US Gulf Coast, the west coast of Africa, Panama and the Caribbean. Our counterparties list consists of major companies, trading companies and barging companies. We have sold fuel oil to more than 40 different companies this year.\n\nIn the exploration and production industry, we deal with several competitors when we participate in bidding rounds conducted by the ANP.",

In accordance with those rules, we estimate reserves by considering average prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-themonth price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, except for the reserves of the Amazon fields for which volumes are estimated using gas prices as set forth in our contractual  arrangements  for  gas  sales.  In  2020,  we  did  not  book  proved  reserves  relating  to  nontraditional reserves such as synthetic oil and gas.\n\nWe estimate reserves based on forecasts of field production, which depends on an array of technical information,  such  as  seismic  surveys,  well  logs  and  tests,  rock  and  fluid  samples,  and  geoscience, engineering  and  economic  data.  All  reserve  estimates  involve  some  degree  of  uncertainty.  The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of that data. Our estimates are thus made using the most reliable data and technology at the time of the estimate, in accordance with the best practices in the oil and gas industry and SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThus, the reserve estimation process begins with an initial evaluation of our assets by geophysicists, geologists  and  engineers.  Reserves  coordinators  in  each  business  unit  in  Brazil  and  the  corporate reserves team provide guidance for reserves estimates in compliance with SEC requirements to the asset teams. General managers in our business units in Brazil and executive officers of companies outside Brazil where we have interests are responsible for regional reserves estimates in compliance with SEC requirements.  The  corporate  reserves  team  is  responsible  for  consolidating  our  reserves  estimates, standardized measures of discounted net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves and other information related to proved oil and gas reserves. Our reserves estimates are approved by our Board of Executive Officers, which then informs our Board of Directors about the approval. The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves is the manager of the corporate reserves team, who has a degree in engineering and 18 years of experience in the oil and gas industry.\n\nDeGolyer and MacNaughton ('D&M') conducted a reserves evaluation of 97% of our net proved crude oil,  condensate and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2020 in Brazil. The amount of reserves reviewed by D&M corresponds to 97% of our total proved reserves company-wide on a net equivalent barrel basis. For disclosure describing the qualification of D&M's technical person primarily responsible for overseeing our reserves evaluation, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report.\n\nFor a description of the risks relating to our reserves and our reserve estimates, see 'Risks' in this annual report.",

The production does not consider injected gas volumes, production of EWTs in exploratory blocks and production in Bolivia, since Bolivian reserves are not included in our reserves due to restrictions determined by Bolivian Constitution.\n\nIn  2020, we incorporated 223.7 million boe of proved reserves by revising previous estimates, including:\n\n- \\_ addition  of  637.1  million  boe  arising  from  technical  revisions,  mainly  due  to  good performance and increased production experience in reservoirs in the pre-salt layer of Santos Basin;\n- \\_ addition of 253.9 million boe due to approvals of new projects, mainly in the Santos and Campos Basins; and\n- \\_ reduction  of  667.2  million  boe  related  to  economic  revisions,  mainly  due  to  the decrease in oil prices.\n\nIn addition, we added 40.8 million boe to our proved reserves due to extensions and discoveries in the pre-salt of Santos Basin, and reduced 116.8 million boe due to sales of proved reserves.",

In  these cases, the full development of the reserves related to these investments may exceed five years.\n\nFor further information on our reserves, see the unaudited section 'Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production' in our audited consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Oil and Gas Additional Information\n\nThe following tables show (i) the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and (ii) total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which we had working interests as of December 31, 2020. A gross well or acre is a well or acre where we own a working interest, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of fractional working interests in gross wells or acres. We do not have any material acreage expiring before 2025.",

The  remainder  was exported. In 2020, we produced 1.828 million bbl/d of oil products, from the processing of Brazilian oil (94% of feedstock) and imported oil (6% of feedstock). We traded these oil products both in Brazil and abroad.\n\nFurthermore,  we  operate  in  the  petrochemical  sector  with  interests  in companies, as well as in the production of biofuels through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Petrobras Biocombust\u00edvel S.A. ('PBIO').\n\n## Overview\n\nWe own and operate 13 refineries in Brazil, with a total net crude distillation capacity of 2,176 mbbl/d. This represents 99% of all refining capacity in Brazil, according to the 2020 statistical yearbook published by the ANP.\n\nMost of our refineries are located near our crude oil pipelines, storage facilities, refined product pipelines and major petrochemical facilities, easing access to crude oil supplies and end-users.\n\nWe also operate a large and complex infrastructure of pipelines and terminals, and a shipping fleet to transport oil products and crude oil to Brazilian and global markets.  We  operate  44  of  our  own  terminals  through  our  wholly-owned subsidiary Petrobras Transporte S.A. ('Transpetro'), and we have contracts for the use of some of the storage capacity of 17 third-party terminals.",

The  purpose  of  the  agreement  is  to provide competitive conditions, encouraging new economic agents to enter the downstream  market,  as  well  as  suspending  CADE's  court  administrative investigation  related  to  the  alleged  abuse  of  our  dominant  position  in  the refining  segment. The agreement considers the divestment of approximately 50%  of  our  refining  capacity,  which  comprises  seven  refining  units  (Reman, Lubnor, Rnest, Rlam, Regap, Repar and Refap) and a shale industrialization unit (SIX).\n\nFor more information on our agreement with CADE regarding our divestments in refining assets, see 'Risks - Risk Factors - Operational Risks' and 'Portfolio Management' in this annual report.\n\nThe initial stages of these divestments processes were announced in 2019.

The following graphs show the processed feedstock and the performance of our refineries.\n\n## PROCESSED FEEDSTOCK (MBBL/D)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  October, our refineries broke an internal production record of S-10 Diesel low-sulfur diesel, producing 2.01 million m\u00b3 of the product, a higher volume than in July, when production reached 1.81 million m\u00b3, and 25% higher than the June mark of 1.6 million m\u00b3.\n\nThe S-10 Diesel records follow the evolution of heavy-duty and utility vehicle engines  powered  by  diesel,  which  are  responsible  for  most  of  the  goods circulated in Brazil. There are two types of road diesel in Brazil, the S-500 and the S-10, with the former being used by vehicles manufactured prior to 2012.\n\nIn 2020, there was an increase in the production of oil products and utilization factor  of  the  refining  system  as  compared  to  2019.  Despite  the  reduction  in gasoline and jet fuel production between 2019 and 2020, the production of oil products rose in 2020 mainly due to increases in the production of low sulfur fuel oil for export, which resulted from higher bunker oil prices in the global market  due  to  the  new  IMO  2020  quality  specifications.  Diesel  production increased in 2020, despite the drop in sales in the domestic market, with the surplus being directed to exports.\n\nNaphtha production increased in 2020, accompanying the increase in sales in the domestic market, due to the reduction in direct imports made by Braskem.",

        "page_content": "LPG production increased in 2020 due to an increase in sales resulting from lower  average  temperatures  and  social  isolation  because  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic, both of which boosted the consumption of residential LPG.\n\nIn  2020,  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  production  of  jet  fuel  following  the reduction in sales due to the impact of Covid-19 on commercial jet fuel demand.\n\nIn addition to constructing new refineries, over the past 10 years we have made substantial  investments  in  our  existing  refineries  to  increase  our  capacity  to economically process heavier Brazilian crude oil, improve the quality of our oil products to meet stricter regulatory standards, modernize our refineries, and reduce the environmental impact of our refining operations. These investments in our existing refineries have been largely completed.\n\nThe following table sets out the performance of our refineries.\n\n## PERFORMANCE OF REFINERIES\n\n|

With respect to the UPGN, all critical bidding for the  UPGN  utilities  was  successfully  completed  during  2019.  In  2020,  some utilities systems were successfully completed and the unit start up is scheduled for 2022. We are studying new project alternatives for the GASLUB Itabora\u00ed area that include integration with the refinery operating in Duque de Caxias (REDUC) for  the  production  of  basic  lubricants  G-II  and  high  quality  fuels  and  the construction of a Natural Gas Thermoelectric Power Plant.\n\n## International Maritime Organization\n\nIn 2016, the International Maritime Organization ('IMO') decided to reduce the allowable upper limit for sulfur content in marine fuels (bunker oil) from 3.5% to 0.5% from January 1, 2020 onwards.\n\nFrom 2017 to the first quarter of 2019, we carried out studies and analyses in order to prepare our refineries and logistics to produce and deliver a compliant fuel. Furthermore, our increasing production of oil from pre-salt has low sulfur, allowing us to obtain fuel oil that already practically meets the bunker fuel specifications without requiring the addition of high amounts of diluents which give us a competitive edge in the global market.\n\nWe have a competitive advantage in the production of the IMO 2020 compliant marine fuel, allowing us to anticipate the market trend and satisfying the needs of our clients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Even with increasing export quantities during 2020, the average of LSFO grades from Brazil were commercialized at a positive crackspread against Brent.\n\n## Logistics\n\nOil and oil products logistics connect the oil production systems to refineries and markets  seeking  to  maximize  the  value  of  oil  refining  operations  and  the commercialization  of  oil  and  oil  products  in  Brazil  and  abroad  through  an integrated  system  of  logistics  planning,  sales,  and  operations  and  assets,  as depicted below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe directly manage some assets of this system, while we contract others with our wholly owned subsidiary Transpetro.",

The oil is transported from the production fields to Transpetro terminals either by pipeline or by ship. From there, it is transported to refineries or for export. After  refining,  the  oil  products  are  again  drained  through  pipelines  to  the terminals  to  be  delivered  to  fuel  distribution  companies,  which  supply  the Brazilian and global markets.\n\nThis operation covers a 7,719 km pipeline network and 44 terminals, 24 of which are marine and 20 onshore. The terminals have a total nominal storage capacity of 10.24 million m 3 . In 2020, Transpetro handled 568.4 million m 3 of oil and oil products, totaling 8,227 operations with tankers and oil barges.\n\n## VOLUME MOVED AT TERMINALS AND PIPELINES (MILLION M 3 )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Brazilian economy is recovering more rapidly than expected due to strong agribusiness activity and the economic stimulus introduced by the Brazilian federal government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The resumption of demand in the domestic market resulted in the recovery of sales and production of oil by-products, prompting an increase in domestic refinery runs and leveraging the volumes handled by Transpetro. External demand for crude oil and fuel oil also exceeded estimates, increasing transhipment operations.\n\nIn 2020, we continued, in partnership with Transpetro, our implementation of the  Integrated  Pipeline  Protection  Program  (' Pr\u00f3-Dutos '). Pr\u00f3-Dutos aims  to expand and integrate all actions targeted at mitigating the risks caused by fuel thefts  (illegal  taps)  in  onshore  pipelines.  The  scope  of  the  program  is multidisciplinary  and  focuses  on  six  areas:  intelligence,  legislation,  social responsibility, communication, technology and contingency.",

In  2020,  new  pipeline routes for the transportation of LPG, naphtha and oil were put into operation. As a result, these highly flammable products are now transported far away from the  urban  centers  of  the  metropolitan  region  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo,  significantly mitigating the risk to human life caused by the fuel theft from pipelines. In 2020, 4,973 m\u00b3 of oil and oil products were stolen, a decrease of 30% compared to 2019.  The  number  of  thefts  in  2020  reached  201,  slightly  below  the  203 occurrences in 2019.\n\nWe also launched a new and wide-ranging advertising campaign to raise public awareness of  fuel  theft  risks  and  to  encourage  the  public  to  report  criminal actions  through  our  communication  channel.  In  addition,  we  continued  to exercise our crises procedures and responses to emergencies resulting from fuel theft from pipelines. For example, in 2020, we completed the first integrated crisis simulation exercise between Transpetro and us.",

Traditionally, a lighter crude oil has a better value than a heavier one, given that it can generate higher value products. Recently, however, heavy crudes have shown a strong market value due to the possibility of high margin production when these crudes are processed in high complexity hardware refineries. Moreover, low-sulfur crude oil could have a better expectancy value than oil with higher sulfur content if they both have similar yields and physical properties. Different refineries assign different values to the same crude oil, depending on their conversion capacity and the products they intend to produce to supply their specific market. Refineries can process a wide variety of different crude oils, which make different crude oils competitors among themselves.\n\nCrude oils are globally traded and their prices used to be referenced on international quotations, as WTI, Brent or Dubai. Depending on the quality, offer, demand, size lot, commercial conditions and logistics costs to make a crude oil cargo available at a certain delivery point, a premium or a discount negotiated between buyer and seller will be added to the reference quotation.\n\nRefined oil products are commodities and their prices in the global market are driven by the supply and demand balance, crude oil price and crack spread. Crack spread refers to the overall pricing difference between a barrel of crude oil and oil products refined from it. It is an industry-specific type of gross processing margin. The 'crack' being referred to is an industry term for breaking apart crude oil into the component products, including gases like propane, heating fuel, gasoline, light distillates like jet fuel, intermediate distillates like diesel fuel and heavy distillates like grease. Typically, a crack is defined in terms of one specific product versus one specific crude. For example, the diesel crack on Brent indicates how much the price of the individual product is contributing to refining profitability.\n\nThe price of a barrel of crude oil and the various prices of the products refined from it are not always in perfect  synchronization.  Depending  on  seasonality  and  global  inventories  among  other  factors,  the supply and demand for particular distillates results in pricing changes that can impact the profit margins on a barrel of crude oil for the refiner.\n\nAs oil products are traded globally and can be transported between markets, prices around the world tend to fluctuate together, subject to local conditions.\n\n## Diesel and Gasoline\n\nDiesel and gasoline prices in the Brazilian market are defined taking into account the import parity price and margins to remunerate the risks inherent in the operation.\n\nPrices  readjustments  of  diesel  and  gasoline  are  carried  out  without  defined  frequency,  according  to market  conditions  and  external  environment  analysis,  enabling  us  to  compete  more  efficiently  and flexibly.\n\nIn 2020, we announced adjustments to selling prices at refineries, resulting in price decreases of 4.1% for gasoline and 13.2% for diesel, when comparing prices in place on December 31, 2020 with those effective as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## LPG\n\nIn August 2019, prices for 'residential LPG' began to adopt the import parity price as reference, similar to the 'industrial/commercial LPG' policy. This allowed a greater alignment of prices for both segments.",

        "page_content": "In November 2019, we equalized prices for residential and industrial/commercial use.  In March 2020, the Brazilian National Council of Energy Policy (CNPE) revoked the legal basis that allowed differentiation of prices by segment.\n\nPrice adjustments are made without defined periodicity, according to market conditions and analysis of internal and external environments.\n\nIn 2020, we announced adjustments to selling prices at refineries, resulting in price increases of 21.9% for LPG, when comparing prices in place on December 31, 2020 with those effective as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## Imports, Exports, and International Sales\n\nOur import and export of crude and oil products are driven by economic factors involving our domestic refining, the Brazilian demand levels and international prices. Most of the crude oil we produce in Brazil is classified as medium API gravity. We import some light crude oil to balance the slate for our refineries, and export mainly medium crude oil from our production in Brazil. In addition, we continue to import oil products to balance any shortfall between production from our Brazilian refineries and the market demand for each product.\n\nIn 2020, net exports increased by 362,000 bbl/d, reaching 743,000 bbl/d. This increase resulted from the record in oil exports, 33% higher than in 2019 and from  an  increase  in  fuel  oil  exports  for  bunker  formulation  due  to  the appreciation caused by the entry of IMO 2020. In addition, there was a drop in diesel and gasoline imports due to the negative impact on consumption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF CRUDE OIL AND OIL PRODUCTS (MBBL/D)\n\n|                    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Exports            |        |        |        |\n| Crude oil          | 713    | 536    | 428    |\n| Fuel oil           | 194    | 133    | 121    |\n| Other oil products | 50     | 66     | 43     |\n| Total exports      | 957    | 735    | 592    |\n| Imports            |        |        |        |\n| Crude oil          | 97     | 168    | 154    |\n| Diesel             | 18     | 70     | 59     |\n| Gasoline           | 10     | 28     | 19     |\n| Other oil products | 89     | 88     | 117    |\n| Total imports      | 214    | 354    | 349    |",

The resulting fuel  presents  the  same  structure  as  conventional  diesel  fuel.  According  to reports  from  the  Biodiesel  Producers  Association  (APROBIO),  this  new  fuel  reduces  the  emission  of greenhouse  gases  by  70%  compared  to  mineral  diesel  oil  and  by  15%  compared  to  ester  biodiesel. Renewable diesel is also free of contaminants and does not cause any damage to engines, effectively increasing vehicle life and reducing transportation costs. The authorization for the commercial sale of this biofuel in Brazil will depend on a new regulation to be issued by the National Petroleum Agency (ANP).\n\nBioQAv, or biojet fuel, will be used worldwide to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the aviation sector.

We  have  developed  a  technology  that  covers  all  stages  of  the manufacturing process. The products obtained from shale processing are fuel oil, naphtha, fuel gas, liquefied gas, sulfur and paving inputs that are used by various industries, such as ceramics, oil refineries, cement plants, sugar mills and agricultural undertakings. The process also produces shale water, which is an input used to formulate foliar fertilizers.\n\nFuel oils obtained from shale are suitable for industrial consumption in urban centers because they are highly fluid, very easy to handle and eliminate the need for pre-heating. This allows for reductions in burning operating costs and, as such, is ideal for cold climates.\n\nIn  conducting  our  operation,  we  work  to  repair  mined  areas  through  an environmental program that consists of reforestation with native species and the return of fauna to rehabilitated land.\n\nIn line with our repositioning process, in 2019, we signed a commitment with the CADE which consolidated our understanding on the execution of divestment of refining assets in Brazil and started the divestment processes of seven refining units (Reman, Lubnor, Rnest, Rlam, Regap, Repar and Refap) and SIX.\n\nFor more information on our agreement with CADE regarding our divestments in refining assets, see 'Risks - Risk Factors - Operational Risks' and 'Portfolio Management' in this annual report.",

We own 65% of Route 1, Shell owns 25% and Petrogal owns the remaining 10%.\n\nROUTE 2: The 401 km pipeline links the Santos Basin pre-salt to the UTGCAB processing asset, in the city of Maca\u00e9 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It had an initial capacity to flow up to 13 million m 3 /d, which then increased to 16 million m 3 /d. In July 2019, the ANP authorized the pipeline to operate with 20 million m 3 /d. We own 65% of Route 2 Tupi-Cernambi, Shell owns 25% and Petrogal owns the remaining 10%. We own 55% of Route 2 Cernambi-TECAB, Shell owns 25%, Petrogal owns 10%, and Repson owns the remaining 10%.",

Three hundred seven km of the pipeline will be offshore, and 48 km onshore. The natural gas processing plant will have two units with a total capacity of processing 21 million m 3 /d of natural gas, which will increase the supply of natural gas, LPG and natural gasoline (C5+) to the market. The construction of Route 3 is scheduled to start in 2022. We own 100% of Route 3.\n\nRecently installed and upcoming units in the Santos Basin pre-salt will be progressively connected to Route 2 (P-66, P-69, P-68, P-76) and to Route 3 once they become operational (P-67, P-75, P-77, P-70, FPSO Carioca and FPSO Almirante Barroso). All projects will be able to flow through any of the three flow routes once the system is fully implemented.\n\n## Marketing and Sales\n\nThe  total  volume  of  natural  gas  sold  by  us  in  2020  was  68.3  mmm\u00b3/d.  The volume of our natural gas consumption by industrial, gas-fired electric power generation,  commercial  and  retail  customers  in  2020  was  54.7  mmm 3 /d, representing a small decrease of approximately 11% compared to 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, the consumption of natural gas by our refineries and fertilizer plants was 13.5 mmm\u00b3/d, the same level as in 2019.\n\nBelow we present our sources and consumption in 2020:",

        "page_content": "## Opening the gas market\n\nIn  July  2019,  we  signed  an  agreement  with  CADE,  which  consolidates  the understandings between the parties on the promotion of competition in the natural gas industry in Brazil. This agreement includes the sale of shareholdings in  gas  transportation  and  distribution  companies  and,  among  other  matters, increases the flexibility for third parties to have access to our processing plants and release capacity in certain gas transportation contracts to which we are part. The purpose of the agreement is to preserve and protect the competitive conditions, aiming to open the Brazilian natural gas market, encouraging new agents to enter this market, as well as suspending administrative procedures established  by  CADE  court  to  investigate  our  natural  gas  business.  The agreement  signed  in  July  2019  also  contains  our  commitment  to  sell  the following  ownership  interest:  (i)  our  10%  stake  in  Nova  Transportadora  do Sudeste S.A. (NTS); (ii) our 10% stake in Transportadora Associada de G\u00e1s S.A. (TAG); (iii) our 51% stake in Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bol\u00edvia-Brasil S.A. (TBG); and (iv) our indirect stake in gas distribution companies, either by selling  our  51%  interest  in  Gaspetro,  or  by  selling  our  indirect  stakes  in  the distribution companies. In 2020, additional initiatives were implemented and for  2021  other  initiatives  are  planned,  which  are  included  in  the  infographic below.\n\nAdditionally,  we  initiated  the  GAS  +  Program,  which  aims  to  increase  our competitiveness in the natural gas segment within Brazil's current conditions of market opening. With this program, we will launch new commercial products, new forms of relationships with customers, new tools (such as digital contracts and sales  through  automated platforms),  and  new  business  models  (such  as negotiated access to the outflow infrastructure and gas processing in our Gas Treatment Units), as well as direct the portfolio to high performance assets.\n\nThe Gas + Program also includes initiatives aimed at enhancing the efficiency and profitability of our Gas and Energy segment, thereby contributing to our high performance in a competitive market.\n\nThe  program  also  provides  for  the  incorporation  of  digital  transformation initiatives,  utilizing  technological  advances  as  an  important  resource  for improving performance in all processes, whether at the industrial or business level.",

        "page_content": "For more information on our agreement with CADE, see 'Risks - Risk Factors Operational Risks' and 'Portfolio Management' in this annual report.\n\n## Natural gas sales contracts and long-term gas purchase and transportation commitments\n\nWe sell our gas primarily to local gas distribution companies and to gas-powered plants, generally based on standard take-or-pay, medium term supply contracts. This represents 66% of total demand volumes. The price formulas under these contracts are mostly aligned with Brent oil prices and the U.S. dollar. They were negotiated under the new gas bill.\n\nIn  2020, we renegotiated some existing mid-term natural gas sales contracts with local natural gas distribution companies in order to promote adjustments to commercial conditions tailored to specific market demands. We ultimately negotiated with 12 local distribution companies that represent 46% of the nonthermoelectric natural gas market and they were negotiated by the new gas policy.\n\nWhen we began construction of the Bolivia-Brazil pipeline ('GASBOL') in 1996, we entered into a long-term Gas Supply Agreement ('GSA'), with the Bolivian state-owned company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos ('YPFB'), to purchase certain minimum volumes of natural gas at prices linked to the global fuel oil price through 2019. In 2020, the agreement may be extended until all contracted  volume  has  been  delivered  by  YPFB.  We  estimate  that  the agreement will be extended at least through May 2024 under the existing terms.\n\nIn December 2019, we signed a transition agreement with YPFB under the GSA which sets a transition period (from January 1, 2020 to March 10, 2020), during which we continued the ongoing negotiation process. Our purpose is to change certain  commercial  conditions  according  to  the  Brazilian  natural  gas  market opening process and the new context of the Bolivian market.\n\nFollowing the transition agreement, in March 2020, we and YPFB signed a new amendment to the GSA, (Amendment Eight), which refers to the volume of gas initially contracted that has not yet been delivered by YPFB until December 31, 2019.  This  amendment  provides  for  the  reductions  of  (i)  the  YPFB  supply obligation to us from the current volume of 30.08 million m 3 /d to 20 million m 3 /d and (ii) our take-or-pay obligation from the current volume of 24.06 million m 3 /d  (annual  basis  with  make-up  possibility)  to  14  million  m 3 /d  (daily  basis without make-up possibility), without  any  changes  on the  gas  price  formula, thus allowing the surplus volume of natural gas to be traded directly by YPFB with other market agents in Brazil.\n\nTherefore, the execution of this amendment reaffirms our commitment to the opening  of  the  Brazilian  natural  gas  market,  stimulating  its  competition  by encouraging new agents to enter the market.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, on March 21, 2020, we invoked force majeure under the GSA due to the impacts in the natural gas demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and, the consequent declaration of force majeure by each of the local distribution companies of natural gas in Brazil with respect to their own contracts with us. As a result, any payments of take-or-pay obligations were suspended up until the end of this event which occurred on August 31, 2020, which the GSA came back into full force.\n\nAccording to the GSA provisions, the suspension of payments of take-or-pay obligations will be in place up until the date when we have taken the remaining gas volume originally agreed with YPFB. We estimate that this will occur in 2024 or 2025, depending on the gas demand that we perceive until then.\n\nOn the Bolivian side of GASBOL, while YPFB has shipper's obligations, we agreed to pay, on behalf of YPFB, the amounts related to 24 million m 3 /d directly to GTB through 2019 and pre-paid six million m 3 /d through 2039.\n\nOn  the  Brazilian  side  of  GASBOL,  after  2020,  we  expect  12  million  m 3 /d  of remaining volume related to Bolivian gas imports and 5.2 million m 3 /d related to extra capacity between Paul\u00ednia, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and Arauc\u00e1ria, in the state of Paran\u00e1. Any additional capacity must be contracted through a public process conducted by the ANP, in accordance with Brazilian law. In December 2019, the ANP approved the resumption of the ANP Public Call 01/2019 process, authorizing  Transportadora  Brasileira  Gasoduto  Bol\u00edvia-Brasil  S.A.  ('TBG')  to disclose the result of the guaranteed proposal stage and the signing of transport service contracts. As a result, we hired 18.08 million m\u00b3/d of entry capacity and 13.84  million  m\u00b3/d  of  exit  capacity  for  2020  and  8.00  million  m\u00b3/d  of  entry capacity and 1.82 million m\u00b3/d of exit capacity for 2021.\n\nIn December 2020, the ANP authorized TBG to implement a public auction, as an alternative to the postponed ANP Public Call 02/2020. After the conclusion of the auction, we hired additional entry capacity of 3.00 million m\u00b3/d and exit capacity of 9.47 million m\u00b3/d for the year 2021.\n\nMore recently,  the  ANP  approved  the  resumption  of  its  Public  Call  02/2020 process, relating to the period from May 2021 up to December 2025. We plan to participate in this process.\n\nOur volume obligations under the ship-or-pay arrangements entered into with GTB and TBG were originally designed to match our gas purchase obligations under the GSA.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  these  contractual  commitments  under  the  above agreements for the five-year period from 2021 through 2025.",

In  2020,  we  started  the  sale  process  of  our  entire  51%  stake  in Gaspetro. In addition, we hold a 37.5% stake in BR Distribuidora, which holds a 49% stake in a natural gas distribution company in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo.\n\nFor more information on our divestment process, see 'Portfolio Management' in this annual report.\n\nIn  2020,  of  the  total  of  34.1  mmm 3 /d  of  gas  sold  to  distributors,  40%  was distributed  through  distributors  which  participation  is  partially  held  by Gaspetro.\n\n## Power\n\nBrazilian  electricity  needs  are  mainly  met  by  hydroelectric  power  plants  and other sources of energy (wind, coal, nuclear, fuel oil, diesel oil, natural gas used in thermoelectrics, and others). The Free Marketing Environment ('ACL') and the Regulated Marketing Environment ('ACR') are involved in the regulation of the electric energy market in Brazil.\n\nHydroelectric power plants are dependent on the annual level of rainfall. When rainfall  is  abundant,  Brazilian  hydroelectric  power  plants  generate  more electricity.  As  a  result,  under  these  circumstances,  there  is  less  demand  for power generation by thermoelectric power plants.\n\nWe generate and sell electric power from a generator complex consisting of 20 thermoelectric  power  plants  that  we  own  or  lease,  operating  under  the authorization regime as an independent power producer. They are powered by natural gas, diesel or fuel oil, with a total installed capacity of 6,131 MW. These plants are designed to supplement power from the hydroelectric power plants.\n\nIn  2020,  the  total  electricity  generated  in  Brazil,  according  to  the  ONS,  was 66,229  MWavg.  Our  thermoelectric  power  plants  contributed  1,756  MWavg (2,028 MWavg in 2019 and 2,205 MWavg in 2018). This was due to the decrease in energy consumption resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and the increase in storage of the reservoirs supplying the hydroelectric plants of the National Interconnected  System (as  a  result  of  the  favorable  rainfalls  throughout  the year).\n\nWe also have plants with generation through renewable sources. In addition, we hold participation in other projects of power generation. This adds up to 315 MW to our electricity generation capacity.",

The certificate is granted to ensure a constant sale of commercial capacity over the course of years to each power plant, given its role within Brazil's system to supplement hydroelectricity power during periods of unfavorable rainfall. The amount of certified capacity for each power plant is determined by its expected capacity to generate energy over time.\n\nThe total capacity certified by the MME (' garantia f\u00edsica ') may be sold through long-term contracts in auctions to power distribution companies (standby availability), and through bilateral contracts executed with free customers and used to meet the energy needs of our own facilities.\n\nIn  exchange for selling this certified capacity, the thermoelectric power plants must produce energy whenever requested by ONS. In addition to a capacity payment, thermoelectric power plants also receive a  reimbursement  for  variable  costs  (declared  to  MME  to  calculate  commercial  certified  capacity) incurred whenever they are requested to generate electricity.\n\nIn 2020, the commercial capacity certified by MME for all thermoelectric power plants we control was 3,532 MWavg. Our total generating capacity was 6,131 MWavg. Of the total 4,226 MWavg of commercial capacity available for sale in 2020, approximately 57% was sold as standby availability in public auctions in  the  regulated  market  (compared  to  67%  in  2019)  and  approximately  20%  was  committed  under bilateral contracts and self-productio, i.e. sales to related parties, (compared to 28% in 2019).\n\nUnder the terms of standby availability contracts, we receive a fixed amount whether or not we generate any power. Additionally, whenever we have to deliver energy under these contracts,  we receive an additional payment for the energy delivered that is set on the auction date and is revised monthly or annually, based on inflation-adjusted international fuel price indexes.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  the  evolution  of  our  installed  thermoelectric  power  plants'  capacity,  our purchases in the free market and the associated certificated commercial capacity.\n\n## INSTALLED POWER CAPACITY AND UTIL I ZATION\n\n|                                                | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Installed capacity (MW)                        | 6,131  | 6,148  | 6,148  |\n| Certified commercial capacity (Mwavg)          | 3,524  | 3,770  | 3,900  |\n| Purchases in the free market (Mwavg)           | 693    | 391    | 821    |\n| Commercial capacity available (Lastro) (Mwavg) | 4,193  | 4,161  | 4,720  |",

We  hold indirect  interests  in  two  small  hydroelectric  power  plants  (Areia  and  \u00c1gua Limpa) through our associate Termoel\u00e9trica Potiguar S.A. ('TEP'). We also own a solar power plant unit, Unidade Fotovoltaica de Alto Rodrigues. Additionally, we participate in joint ventures in four wind power plants (Mangue Seco 1, 2, 3 and 4), all of which are currently undergoing divestment processes. During the beginning of 2021, we signed the sale of Mangue Seco 1, 2, 3 and 4. Our strategy is  to  maximize  value  through  active  portfolio  management,  maintaining investments  in  research  and  development  in  renewable  energy.  In  order  to invest in such areas in the future, we are planning to invest US$70 million/year in R&D for decarbonization and renewables.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our power generation capacity (alone and through the equity interests we hold in renewable energy companies) was as follows:\n\n- \\_ 3.6 MW of hydroelectric capacity;\n- \\_ 1.1 MW of solar capacity; and\n- \\_ 51.5 MW wind capacity, corresponding to 49.5% of the 104 MW of Mangue Seco 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\nWe  and  our  partners  sell  energy  from  these  plants  directly  to  the  Brazilian federal government through auctions.",

In 2020, we signed a letter of intent ('LoI') with Equinor aiming to jointly evaluate a future wind project in the Campos Basin,  using  R&D  funding.  For  more  information  on  our  divestment process, see 'Portfolio Management'.\n\n## Customers and Competitors\n\nNatural gas is marketed to 21 clients, most of which are distributors. The entire demand  for  natural  gas  includes  our  non-thermoelectric,  thermoelectric, refining  and  fertilizer  markets,  as  well  as  the  consumption  by  natural-gas carriers contracted by us for the provision of transportation services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the energy segment, we operate in the regulated market (energy distributors) and free market (marketers and free consumers/large consumers). We have 134 clients and suppliers, of which 39 are distributors, 36 are marketing companies, 11  are  generating  companies  and  48  are  free  consumers.  All  contracts  are registered at the Electricity Trading Chamber, a sector agent responsible for the settlement and accounting of these contracts.\n\nIn  the  commercialization  of  natural  gas,  we  act  as  importers  and  domestic producers who can directly sell our product to the distributors or thermoelectric plants.  We  expect  an  increase  in  competition  due  to  new  regulation  under discussion which aims to improve the regulatory framework of the natural gas sector and to establish guidelines for a new design of the market that allows the entry of new agents in the sector in order to promote competition.",

        "page_content": "The transportation of natural gas also consists of a monopoly of the Brazilian federal government and may be exercised upon concession or authorization by companies  incorporated  under  Brazilian  law,  with  headquarters  and administration in the country.\n\nIn the  natural  gas  distribution  segment  we  operate  through  indirect participation in state companies, where each distributor has a monopoly for its concession  area,  and  there  is  no  competition,  since  the  Brazilian  federal constitution  provides  that  the  natural-gas  distribution  segment  can  only  be exercised through concession by public authorities of each state.\n\nWe concluded the transition to new contracts for the sale of natural gas to Local Distribution Companies in which the prices of the molecule started to be linked to the variation in the price of Brent oil, replacing the basket of international quotations  of  fuel  oils  that  until  then  prevailed.  This  improvement  brought greater transparency to the update of contractual prices and also allowed selling prices to respond more quickly to international references, making them more competitive, as observed in the year 2020.\n\nIn  addition,  throughout  2020,  due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic  and  the consequent structural  reduction  in  the  demand  for  natural  gas  in  the  entire Brazilian  market,  there  was  a  declaration  of  force  majeure  by  all  Local Distribution  Companies  in  their  respective  gas  purchase  contracts.  By September  2020,  with  the  resumption  of  consumption  in  the  nonthermoelectric market, the legal and contractual requirements of force majeure were no longer met, so the contracts were resumed under their normal supply conditions.\n\nAs mentioned before, in July 2019, we signed an agreement with CADE, which consolidates  understandings  between  the  parties  on  the  promotion  of competition in the natural gas industry in Brazil.\n\nFor more information on our agreement with CADE regarding our divestments in the natural gas industry, see 'Risks - Risk Factors - Operational Risks' and 'Our Business - Gas and Power - Marketing' in this annual report.\n\nIn the energy segment, we operate in generation and sale. In generation, we compete with third-party thermoelectric plants, as well as other generators with other energy sources (hydro, wind, solar). In terms of commercialization, we compete with other energy marketers.",

('ANSA').  Their  main  products  are ammonia and urea. Together these plants have an installed capacity of 1.852 million t/year of urea, 1.406 million t/y of ammonia, 319,000 t/y of ammonium sulfate and 800,000 tons/y of ARLA-32. The ammonium sulfate unit in Sergipe, however, did not operate in 2020. Most of our ammonia production is used to produce urea, and the excess production is mainly sold in the Brazilian market. We also have an unfinished Fertilizer Unit (UFN-III) in Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nWe continue to pursue our strategy of leaving the fertilizer market and focusing on assets that generate greater financial return and are more adherent to our business. In 2019, we mothballed our plants located in Bahia and Sergipe and, after that, we signed lease agreements with Proquigel Qu\u00edmica S.A. ('Proquigel Qu\u00edmica'), a company of the Unigel Group, leasing FAFEN-BA and FAFEN-SE for a total amount of R$177 million. The agreements have an initial term of 10 years and may be extended for additional 10 years. Leases became effective in August 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, we concluded the mothballing of Arauc\u00e1ria Nitrogenados S.A. (ANSA)  and  in  September,  we  announced  the  beginning  of  the  divestment process for the sale of our participation in this fertilizer plant. In October 2020 we started the binding phase.\n\nIn February 2020, we announced the beginning of the non-binding phase related to the sale of all our equity stake in the Nitrogen Fertilizer Unit (UFN-III). UFN-III is a nitrogen fertilizer industrial project located in Tr\u00eas Lagoas, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul,  Brazil.  The  construction  of  UFN-III  began  in  September 2011, but was interrupted in December 2014, with a physical advance of about 81%. The completion of UFN-III will be the responsibility of the potential buyer.\n\n## FERTILIZER PRODUCTION (THOUSAND TONS)\n\n<!-- image -->",

On July 20, 2020 we sold our remaining 10% stake in TAG.\n\nIn our transportation systems, we undertake to specify the maximum injection and withdrawal volumes at each receiving point and delivery area, for further adjustments to the current transportation service contracts, so that transportation companies, under the supervision of the ANP, can offer the remaining capacity  to  the  market,  thus  enabling  other  companies  to  use  the  remainder  of  the  transportation network.  Furthermore,  we  are  committed  to  other  actions  to  allow  greater  competitiveness  in  the natural gas market, such as: (i) negotiating access to outflow and processing assets, (ii) refraining from purchasing new gas volumes from partners/third parties, except in certain situations provided for in the agreement, and (iii) leasing the regasification terminal in the state of Bahia.\n\nThe purpose of the agreement is to preserve and protect competitive conditions, aiming to open the Brazilian  natural  gas  market,  encouraging  new  agents  to  enter  this  market,  as  well  as  suspending administrative procedures established by CADE to investigate our natural gas business.\n\nIn  addition,  we  have  in  our  portfolio  other  projects  in  their  structuring  phase,  and believe in a strategy for our portfolio management that focuses on core assets, in order to improve our capital allocation, enable debt and capital cost reduction, and ultimately increase value generation for us and our shares.\n\nWe have disclosed the teasers, non-binding and binding phases related to the following assets that are currently part of our divestment portfolio.",

We describe key variables in 2020 below.\n\n## Global Economy\n\nThe performance of the global economy in 2020 was shaped by the impact of the Covid19 pandemic. The first cases of the disease were reported in December 2019 in China, remaining reasonably restricted to the region until February. In the beginning of March, however,  the  situation  became  more  serious  as  the  virus  spread  to  several  other countries. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially recognized Covid-19 as a pandemic. According to WHO data, over 82 million people globally have been infected as of December 31, 2020.\n\nGiven this  situation,  the  main  measures  adopted  by  countries  to  try  to  control  the spread of the virus among the population were restrictions on the circulation of people, goods and services, which caused the global activity level to drop sharply and quickly. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  already  fell  by  2.0%  in  the  first  quarter, signaling the worsening of the sanitary crisis, the increase in global uncertainty and the implementation  of  restrictive  measures.  Nevertheless,  the  most  severe  impact occurred in the second quarter, when these countries' GDP's, in the aggregate, fell by 10.6% (the highest drop since 1962, when the series became available). The expansion of monetary and fiscal measures to mitigate the economic slowdown, together with the lifting of restrictive circulation measures, allowed for a moderate recovery to take place in the second half of the year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that the global economy will shrink by 3.5% in 2020.\n\n## GDP GLOBAL GROWTH RATE (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IMF, 2020",

        "page_content": "The Covid-19 pandemic had different effects on each of the U.S. and China, the two largest economies in the world. In relation to the Chinese economy, the impacts were concentrated in the first quarter, when the economy contracted by 10%. In the second quarter, China's GDP showed a solid recovery of 11.7%. Confirming the recovery, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that China grew 2.3% in 2020. Although the number represented the smallest growth since 1980, China will be one of the few countries whose GDP grew in 2020, according to the NBS. For 2021, the IMF projects a GDP growth of 8.1%.\n\nIn the U.S., the economy was affected starting in March, represented in part by the 1.3% contraction during the first quarter. However, the shock took place in the second quarter, when the activity level contracted by 9.0% (31% when annualized), the highest quarterly fall in history. Other indicators show the intensity of the Covid-19 pandemic shock across the U.S. economy. For example, unemployment rates rose to 14.7% in April from 4.4% in March. The IMF projected a 3.4% contraction in the U.S. economy in 2020 and currently projects a 3.1% expansion in 2021.\n\nFor 2021, the global economy is expected to recover due to the possibility that a large share  of  the  world  population  will  be  vaccinated,  which  will  decrease  the  need  for restrictions  on  the  circulation  of  people,  goods,  and  services,  and  will  incentivize growth. The IMF projects a 5.5% growth for the year.\n\n## Global Oil & Gas Market\n\nThe year 2020 began with high volatility on the supply side. On January 3, 2020, the U.S.  carried  out  an  airstrike  on  the  Baghdad  airport  in  Iraq,  killing  the  Iranian  top military  leader.  The  attack  increased  tensions  in  the  international  oil  market.  In response, the volatility of Brent increased, and its price rose to levels near US$70/bbl during the first week of January.\n\nDuring  the  first  two  months  of  2020,  the  spread  of  Covid-19  in  China  led  the government to isolate affected cities. The cancellation of commercial flights and the closing  of  the  China-Russia  border  caused  a  reduction  in  the  consumption  of  oil products. As a result of reduction in Chinese demand, oil prices fell to an average of US$55.57/bbl in February, which represented a drop of 13% in comparison to January.\n\nIn early March, the OPEC+ meeting failed to reach the expected outcome of increasing oil production cuts to balance the oil market. The disagreement between the leading members of OPEC+, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, led to the non-renewal of the production cuts in force, thus allowing participating countries to produce without limits after April 1, 2020. In mid-March, the WHO declared the Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the pessimism of the international oil market and led to severe social distancing measures across the world.\n\nIn response to the fall in global oil demand by the end of April, on April 21, 2020 the Brent price reached US$13.2/bbl, the lowest level seen since 1999. In response to this drop  in  the  Brent  price,  OPEC+  members  reestablished  negotiations,  reaching  an agreement to cut about 10 million barrels per day of oil production.",

        "page_content": "In May, with the entry into force of the OPEC+ agreement, the price began to recover. A  drop  in  supply  from  non-OPEC  countries  and  the  relaxation  of  social  distancing measures in some countries contributed to this recovery. In addition, an acceleration in  demand  recovery,  especially  in  China,  improved  the  perception  that  the  market would be closer to rebalancing. As a result, the second quarter ended with a Brent price above US$40/bbl.\n\nThe third quarter maintained the price recovery trend observed in 2Q20. However, despite the high level of compliance with the OPEC+ agreement, there was a negative effect on prices. This negative effect was due primarily to signs of a slowdown in the demand recovery, due mainly to the advance of the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S. and the second wave of infections in Europe. Nonetheless, the average price of dated Brent ended 3Q20 with a gain of 45.3% compared to 2Q20.\n\nThe last quarter of the year began with the oil prices down to levels below US$40/bbl, in  response to new lockdowns in many countries and the uncertainty regarding the approval of an economic recovery plan for the U.S. On the supply side, the recovery of production in Libya and the increase in oil exports from Saudi Arabia also contributed to the drop in price. In November, the outcome of the U.S. election positively impacted the market, reducing the uncertainty in the political field. In December, the start of vaccination  against  Covid-19  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in  the  U.S.  created  an optimistic atmosphere for a world economic recovery. The Brent price increased in response, ending the year above US$50/bbl.\n\n## BRENT - CRUDE OIL PRICE (US$/BBL)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Bloomberg, 2020",

        "page_content": "## Brazilian Economy\n\nThe Brazilian economy contracted by 4.1% in 2020, according to the Brazilian Institute for  Geography  and  Statistics  ('IBGE'),  the  deepest  contraction  recorded  by  official statistics.  Despite  the  strong  recession,  after  April,  when  the  Covid-19  pandemic negatively impacted economic activity, industrial production and retail sales recovered at a quick pace. At the end of the year, the production levels of these activities were higher in comparison to the same period of the previous year.  On the other hand, the services sector was the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and at the end of 2020 was still operating below the pre-pandemic level.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, the observed economic recovery was closely associated to cash transfers made by the Brazilian government to the lowest income share of the population. The social program reached around 67 million people who received at least R$600  per  month  from  April  until  August.  Between  September  and  December,  the amount  was  decreased  to  R$300  per  month.  The  cash  transfers  boosted  private consumption,  mainly  of  semi  and  non-durable  goods,  stimulating  both  industrial production and retail trade.\n\nAlso, the depreciation of the Brazilian currency, one of the consequences of the Covid19  pandemic  due  to  an  increase  in  uncertainty  and  in  the  risk  perception  of international  investors,  played  an  important  role  in  the  improvement  of  the competitiveness  of  Brazilian  production,  contributing  to  the  above-mentioned recovery.

        "page_content": "In addition  to  domestic  demand,  Brazilian  exports  also  showed  significant improvement. Besides the depreciation of the national currency, which increased the competitiveness of Brazilian production, the strong recovery of the Chinese economy in March supported Brazilian exports, as China is Brazil's main trade partner, absorbing around 30% of all Brazilian exports, mainly commodities.\n\nThis environment allowed an optimistic outlook for 2021 among some entrepreneurs, but there are still many challenges to overcome. The first challenge is related to health measures to control the Covid-19 pandemic, given the accelerated spread of the virus in the last months of 2020. The second is that the unemployment rate is still high. The majority  of  jobs  in  the  Brazilian  economy  are  in  the  services  sector,  in  which  most companies suffered significant debt increases and will need to improve their financial conditions in the post-Covid-19 period. Finally, inflation accelerated sharply at the end of  2020.  If  price  increases  persist  in  2021,  the  interest  rate  may  rise  again,  limiting economic recovery.\n\nAnother crucial component are Brazilian fiscal fundamentals. Public debt reached 89% of the GDP in the end of 2020 due to the actions taken to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Fiscal fragility may affect risk perception, inflation and interest rates.\n\n## Brazilian Oil and Gas Market\n\nAfter two years of recession in 2015 and 2016, the Brazilian economy experienced three years of limited growth, affecting the domestic consumption of oil products.\n\nThe  Covid-19  pandemic  has  had,  and  continues  to  have,  extensive  effects  on  oil products  demand,  starting  in  the  second  quarter  of  2020.  Strong  social  distancing measures,  personal  mobility  restrictions,  and  temporary  lockdowns  led  to  an unprecedented  fall  in  oil-related  demand  for  passenger  transportation  activities. Gasoline and jet fuel were the most severely impacted products. Although goods and cargoes  kept  moving  around  the  country,  the  slowdown  in  economic  activity  also slightly reduced diesel demand. Despite the overall slowdown, the higher use among residential users strengthened LPG consumption in the same period.\n\nIn the following quarters, restriction measures were lifted gradually amid the decrease in the daily number of Covid-19 related cases and deaths. Although strong, the recovery was not enough to bring demand levels to where they were at the end of 2019. The economic  activity  has  not  yet  recovered  from  the  negative  impact  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic.",

Additionally, exclusively gasoline-fueled vehicles are being replaced by both flex fuel and electric automobiles.\n\nMoreover, the development of diesel demand is being slowed due to the mandatory increase  of  the  biodiesel  percentage  in  the  fuel  blend  that  is  delivered  to  the  final consumer.  Diesel  sales  fell  just  1.4%  in  2020.  Temporary  basic  income  policies  to mitigate pandemic effects stimulated the demand for necessary goods such as food and beverages, and therefore the freight and diesel demand. In turn, jet fuel demand was the most affected by travel restrictions put into place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The demand fell by roughly 50% in comparison to 2019.\n\nFor at least two decades now, fuel oil has been undergoing a process of substitution by other sources, especially natural gas, and there is still some room for this process to continue in the next years. In the case of thermoelectric demand, there were fewer dispatches  using  fuel  oil,  negatively  affecting  its  sales.  Bunker  fuel  represents  an important part of fuel oil market in Brazil and its demand has increased 6.2% in 2020.\n\nNatural gas demand, according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy inter-annual data until November 2020, has declined by 10%, from an average of 78 million m 3 /d for 2019 to 70 million m 3 /d.\n\nThe year 2020 began with an average total consumption of 80 million m\u00b3/d between January and February, 3% above the figure for the year 2019, of 78 million m\u00b3/day (Ministry of Mines and Energy). The demand started to reflect the impact of Covid-19 as  of  March,  with  a  result  of  65  million  m\u00b3/day,  and  hit  the  lowest  point  in  April, reaching 54 million m\u00b3/d, which represented a drop of 24 MM m\u00b3/d relative to the average  for  2019.  The  market  has  been  recovering  since  then,  with  November  (95 million m\u00b3/d) surpassing November 2019 (91 million m\u00b3/d).",

This provisional structure, composed of our internal professionals, guided, in a uniform manner, all our actions to prevent and combat the advance of Covid-19 and mitigate its consequences on all possible fronts.\n\nWe acted  quickly  and  adopted  a  series  of  measures  to  preserve  the  health  of  our employees in the operational and administrative areas. These initiatives are in line with the recommendations from the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health and  aim  to  contribute  to  efforts  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  the  disease.  Preventative measures were adopted, such as:\n\n(i) extensive testing, including carrying out more than 400,000 tests in our workforce by December 2020; (ii) pre-shipment and preshift health monitoring, reinforcement in hygiene measures, distance and mandatory mask use at the units; (iii) reducing the number of personnel aboard platforms, rigs and other vessels to what is necessary for the safe operation of each unit; (iv) intensification of the inspection of compliance with the prevention rules in all operational units at sea or on land, with audits at all units and  immediate  correction  of  any  deviations;  (v)  extension  of  remote  work  for  all activities that can be carried out remotely until March 31, 2021; (vi) awareness and orientation  actions  for  employees  and  contractors  about  individual  care;  and  (vii) health monitoring and access to telemedicine services.\n\nAll employees and contractors were instructed to report any symptoms immediately. We provide specific communication channels (24-hour call center and e-mail), as well as  an  online  form  for  self-reporting  of  suspected  Covid-19  symptoms.  We  monitor suspected  cases  and  their  contacts  from  the  first  report,  taking  all  preventative measures to avoid contagion, guiding employees and contractors and applying RT-PCR (Protein  Transcriptase  Reverse  Chain  Reaction)  tests  when  indicated  by  the  health team. We also provide our employees with medical service, including telemedicine 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",

We implemented monitored home isolation and screening by health professionals in pre-boarding  platforms,  with  the  suspension  of  boarding  for  those  who  show  any symptoms  in  the  previous  14  days,  as  well  as  carrying  out  diagnostic  tests  before boarding.  We  assess,  by  means  of  a  dedicated  health  team,  all  employees  and contractors with symptoms on board and provide for the immediate disembarkation of suspected cases and their contacts.\n\nIn order to ensure that the best practices are also adopted by our suppliers, we follow the measures and planning of the companies responsible for chartered units and the companies providing services.\n\nIn 2020, we used existing communication channels in the communities neighboring our operations  to  address  issues  such  as  periodic  monitoring  of  the  status  of  Covid-19, guidelines  from  the  federal  government,  and  hygiene  tips.  In  virtual  meetings,  we publicized these solidarity campaigns and dealt with topics such as mental health during Covid-19, with the participation of our health professionals.\n\nThe Petrobras Socio-Environmental Program projects also acted promptly in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, with subsequent measures to mitigate health risks, adopting a  series  of  measures  to  safeguard  the  health  of  technical  teams  and  beneficiaries. During  this  period,  it  was  possible  to  count  on  the  support  network  of  socioenvironmental projects to raise funds for the communities surrounding our operations. In total, the network raised US$55,233.82, an amount that allowed for the donation of 4,036 basic food baskets. In addition, more than 400,000 masks were produced for distribution.\n\nWe also made financial contributions to projects to fight Covid-19, donating fuel, Covid19  tests,  Individual  Protection  Equipment  and  hygiene  items,  for  a  total  of US$4,542,195.22.\n\nHours  from  the  academic  supercomputers  SDumont,  at  LNCC,  and  OGBON,  at SENAI/CIMATEC were devoted to research related to Covid-19 through the Stanford folding@home project. Both LNCC and SENAI/CIMATEC are our academic partners. We invest in the expansion and installation of supercomputers and we are entitled to use part of the infrastructure. The reports showed a total of 19,248 OGBON and 459,772.50 SDumont hours dedicated to the folding@home project, that is, a total of 479,020.50 hours.",

One such measure was the draw down of revolving credit lines, amounting to US$8 billion, as well as other lines in  the  domestic  banking  market,  in  the  total  amount  of  US$698  million  in  the  first quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, we repaid US$7.6 billion of revolving credit lines.\n\nWe also adopted a series of measures to reduce disbursements and preserve cash as a measure  to  protect  our  financial  health.  These  measures  include  optimizing  oil production, postponing cash disbursements and reducing costs. We mothballed our platforms that operate in shallow water fields, with higher lifting costs per barrel, and adjusted the processing of our refineries in line with fuel demand. We reduced costs with well interventions, optimized production logistics, and postponed significant new hires.\n\nExcluding  the  exchange  rate  effect,  we  have  achieved  a  reduction  of  US$1  billion compared  to  our  operating  expenses  budget,  and  a  US$2  billion  reduction  in  the investments scheduled for 2020, resulting in a total investment of US$8.1 billion.\n\nOur expenses in corporate areas were reduced by 15% compared with 2019. For more information on the Covid-19 pandemic impacts on our operations and results, see 'Our Business' and 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' in this annual report.\n\n## Scientific journey\n\nLed by our R&D Center (CENPES), we also worked to combat and mitigate the effects caused by Covid-19.\n\nOur  scientists  used  their  multidisciplinary  expertise,  including  knowledge  in  agile methodologies,  digital  technologies,  prototyping,  microbiology,  and  many  other specialties,  to  propose  ways  to  fight  the  pandemic.  All  actions  were  aimed  at preventing, diagnosing and curing Covid-19, both within our company and in society.\n\nWe  transformed  our  technical  capacity  into  benefits  for  society  on  several  fronts, making use of partnerships that allowed us to expand and accelerate our actions. Our energy was directed towards quick and viable solutions in facing Covid-19.\n\nThe main actions of the projects developed or supported were:\n\n- \\_ Acceleration  of  lung  ventilator  production  through  financial  support  for: (i)  three projects supported with US$19,245.57 each; and (ii) one USP (S\u00e3o Paulo University) project  supported  with US$211,701.31,  for the  production  of the first  batch  of 135 ventilators  for  donation  to  state-owned  hospitals,  of  which  50  have  already  been produced and donated.\n- \\_ Maintenance  of  pulmonary  ventilators: Support  of  US$190,307.45  for  the  SENAI initiative with the recovery of more than 2,400 unused ventilators in hospitals and more than 68 ventilators repaired with our own resources in 2020.",

Senai's initiative to recover lung ventilators,  supported  by  us  and  other  companies,  received  in  December 2020,  the Social Entrepreneur of the Year Award from Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo and from the Schwab Foundation (linked to the World Economic Forum).\n\nAnother recognized project was the artificial intelligence platform RadVid19, developed by USP, which detects Covid-19 in radiography and computed tomography exams. This initiative, a partnership between us and other institutions, won, in December 2020, the Abril / Dasa Award as the best project in the Diagnostic Medicine category.",

By leveraging an ecosystem of startups, tech companies, academia and crowdsourcing, and using the 'fail fast' concept, the corporate lab not only aims to create disruptive solutions, but, above all, to address the crucial opportunities within corporate areas.\n\nThe safety of our workers is one of our core values. Even though our accident ratio is very low, a benchmark for the oil and gas industry, we challenged ourselves to improve safety even more. For this purpose, we also launched the Safety Innovation Lab, which follows  the  same  processes  of  agility  and  collaboration  above,  to  offer  solutions  to predict and prevent risks through actively monitoring work or reducing risk exposure by improving the use of wearables, intelligent video analytics, robotics and drones, for example.\n\n## Digital Transformation Academy\n\nCompanies  are  transformed  through  transformation  of  people.  Thus,  we  created  a digital  transformation  academy  to  coordinate  this  transformation  journey,  ensuring that  our  teams  will  have  all  the  necessary  upskilling  and  reskilling  routes  available. Promoters  and  supporters  of  our  transformation  are  supported  with  company investment  in  digital  education  programs.  Through  these  efforts,  we  will  provide additional  skills  for  employees  by  providing  tools  on  technology  use,  collaborative techniques and digital approaches that will empower them to be more efficient and effective on the execution of their roles. We will also prepare several employees for new data scientist roles, as required by our company transformation journey.\n\n## Go Lean\n\nIn  2020,  we  started  to  rethink  our  internal  processes,  enabling  them  for  digital transformation through inserting concepts of smart office and digital shared services center. The combination of shared processes brings the possibility of optimization and improved  service  level,  especially  with  the  application  of  new  technologies.  The implementation of digital solutions in the mobility processes allows for the expansion of self-service initiatives, enhancing cost optimization, reducing back-office, increasing the safety of users and employee experiences.\n\nWe accelerated the modernization of workplace environments, associated with the implementation of a definitive teleworking model, which imposes a new dynamic of work environments using coworking concepts and maximizing building occupancy. All of these environments speak directly to our culture transformation model, focused on employee-centric  solutions.  In  addition,  we  developed  changes  in  systems  and processes for opening up the use of new mobility players and providers, expanding access  to  other  options  available  on  the  market.  We  also  introduced  building optimizations of nine buildings in 2020 and during 2021, which we expect will reduce our operating expenses.",

During  six  months  of operation, CERD delivered more than 30 optimized process flows and digitalizations and 107 robotizations, contributing both to improving the efficiency of BE LEAN and to its automation on GO DIGITAL.\n\n## Innovation and R&D\n\nAlong with the three initiatives  mentioned  above, we use  innovation, research  and development as tools to expand the creation of value and influence our strategy.\n\nWe  have  a  history  of  successfully  developing  and  implementing  innovative technologies,  mainly  with  respect  to  drilling,  completing  and  producing  wells  in increasingly deepwater. Our efforts received four OTC awards, recently in 2019 for the technologies  we  developed  for  the  Libra  Extended  Term  Test.  In  2020,  the  award recognized the set of innovations developed to enable production in the B\u00fazios field, in the  Santos  Basin  pre-salt.  To  make  this  project  a  reality,  we  developed  a  series  of technologies  for  a  scenario  that  combines  challenging  conditions,  such  as  ultradeepwaters and reservoirs located  below  the  salt  layer,  subjected  to  high  pressure levels, as well as a high presence of carbon dioxide. The innovations cover the technical areas  of  geosciences,  reservoirs,  wells,  elevation  and  flow,  as  well  as  subsea technologies and surface installations. One of the main highlights of the development was  the  installation  of  four  FPSO  type  vessels  (floating  oil  production,  storage  and transfer unit) in a period of just 11 months in a single production field.",

The facility's laboratories are dedicated  in  particular  to  pre-salt  technologies,  which  is  our  main  source  of  value. CENPES' mission is to 'imagine, create and make today the future of Petrobras.' As of December 31, 2020, this facility had 1,237 employees, 89 % of which are dedicated to research  and  development.  This  employee  group  includes  15 employees  with  postdoctoral degrees, 253 with doctorates and 365 with master's degrees in the sciences. We also have several semi-industrial scale prototype plants throughout Brazil that are located near our industrial facilities and are aimed at fast prototyping and scaling up new industrial technologies at reduced costs. In 2020, we engaged in several activities relating to research and development. We conducted joint research projects with more than 120 universities and research centers in Brazil and 85 outside of Brazil.\n\nAs we pursue valuable results in research and development, we are exploring new ways to  innovate  through  disruptive  technologies,  digital  transformation  and  start-up engagement.  The  innovation  ecosystems  are  key  to  unlocking  the  full  potential  of emerging  technologies  and  can  speed  up  innovation.  We  currently  work  with technological partnerships to leverage our human capital. We have already started to improve our connections with innovation ecosystems by adopting new open innovation practices with start-ups. The first step was an innovation challenge in cooperation with the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service ('SEBRAE') (a non-profit private entity with the mission of promoting the sustainable and competitive development of small businesses in Brazil) through a call for start-ups and small companies for projects aiming  to  improve  technology  readiness  and  implementation  rates.  In  2020,  we launched the second public call for  R&D challenges and optimized the engagement process when compared to our original initiative in 2019, increasing the number of proposals and startups involved. In addition, based on a strategy of quick wins, we also held  a  pioneering  public  call  in  order  to  test  innovative  solutions  at  scale  that  can improve the productivity or safety of critical operations.",

For instance, our program 'PROD1000' has the ambition to reach 1,000 days between field discovery and beginning of production, compared to current average of 3,540 days (PROD1000). Our intention is to combine PROD1000 with 'EXP100', a program with the ambition to increase the chance of discovering oil to 100% in drilling exploratory wells, reducing project  risks  and  costs  by  expediting  production  development.  The  result  would  be earlier starts of the production development stage, which would boost the full-cycle capital  efficiency.  CENPES  is  currently  working  towards  a  vision  of  the  future  that comprises smart subsea systems, with a high level of connectivity, leading to greater integrity  management, reliability  and  significant  cost  and  emissions  reductions.  The extensive use of resident autonomous underwater vehicles and enhanced exploration of the sea floor could increase the use of subsea processing systems, relieving topside units, which creates options for unmanned facilities, subsea to shore designs or a hybrid production system.\n\nBrazilian Pre-Salt heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs typically present long net pays, high  production/injection  rates  and  flow  assurance  risks.    The  challenge  is  how  to maximize production volume with minimum overall costs. In order to accomplish this challenge, two well designs were developed for Brazilian Pre-Salt application: PACI 3Z HD (Open Hole Intelligent Completion - three zones - Direct Hydraulics) and PACI-e (Open  Hole  Intelligent  Completion  -  Electrical).  Both  focus  on  cost  reduction  and production maximization.  The second design represents a technology breakthrough leading  to  better  reliability  resulting  in  maintenance  cost  reduction  and  ultimate recovery improvement when compared with the first design.  In 2020 we achieved a new record for post-salt wells, by drilling a complete post-salt well in 44 days. This result is a game changer in brownfields, by the introduction of a new concept called 'True One Trip - 3 Phases' due to its design innovation: drilling wells with only three phases and  install  all  completion  in  one  trip.  This  concept  was  developed  by  one  of  our multidisciplinary groups. This field trial also validates the concept, allowing its future application in several projects and ultimately resulting in a general cost reduction of 50%.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (US$ MILLION)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCurrently, about 25.2% of our R&D portfolio includes digital technologies such as big data, high performance computing and artificial intelligence, in order to support the development of our business.",

In 2020, due to the intensification of cyber attacks since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, we created the Center for Excellence in Treatment and Response to Security Events. The Center focuses on the cyber protection of our technological and operational assets, including industrial and control systems. This way, we have solid processes to protect  our  digital  environments,  in  line  with  the  best  market  practices  and  the constant improvement of preventative actions. Based on reference frameworks and benchmarks with oil and gas industry peers, a consistent work plan is underway, which we  hope  will  elevate  us  to  a  position  above  the  average  of  our  market,  regarding security  management  maturity,  information,  both  in  the  corporate  and  automation environments.\n\nWe  also  lead  a  national  intelligence  network  for  sharing  information  about  cyber attacks.\n\nPrivacy is another relevant topic for us. We see the legislation on the protection of personal data as an opportunity to evolve our degree of maturity, adding continuous improvements to this process.

Each year, we maintain a set of initiatives focused on the prevention of accidents and the preservation of life and the environment. For this purpose, we launched the Commitment to Life Program (the 'Program'), which aims to strengthen guidelines and standardize safety practices at all stages of our operations. The Program was launched in 2016. It is currently in its  fifth  cycle, 2020-2021,  and supports the implementation of the Total Recordable Injury safety indicator and of the Leaked Volume of Oil and Petroleum Products, an environmental indicator, which are two one of our top metrics.\n\nWe structured these initiatives under our Program keeping in mind (i) the results of our Health, Safety and Environment ('HSE') management assessments, (ii) the root causes of accidents identified in accident investigations and (iii) environmental scenarios in recent years and future perspectives.\n\nThe main initiatives of the Program for the 2020-2021 cycle are the following:\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we support several socioenvironmental projects. Due to the pandemic, some licensing constraints were implemented remotely or the schedules were renegotiated, with the approval from environmental authorities, causing a lower disbursement when compared to 2019.\n\nThe  development  of  business  with  suppliers  also  comprises  environmental requirements according to the best practices in the industry. Contracted companies must present evidence and certifications related to compliance with HSE standards and confirm  that  they  comply  with  all  applicable  requirements,  laws  and  regulations, according to new commitments formalized in 2020.\n\nSince 2019, we have been certified by ASCM Enterprise Certification, which is the firstof-its-kind corporate level designation that demonstrates supply chain excellence and transparency - a growing value for consumers as they become more educated about supply chain supporting ethical and sustainable business practices. The certification is valid for three years, with the annual requirement to demonstrate adherence to ASCM defined  standards  for  certificate  maintenance  throughout  the  validity  period.  By obtaining the certification, we reinforce our commitment to continuously improve our capacity to manage goods and services supply processes, contributing to our increased credibility in a competitive market.\n\n## Total Recordable Injury\n\nSafety is one of our core values. The TRI rate is one of the metrics monitored by our senior management for matters of health and safety. The evolution of the TRI reflects the  implementation  of  several  initiatives  for  the  promotion  of  our  safety  culture, trainings and our HSE management assessment program.",

We  expect  this  result  to  place  us  among  top  oil  and  gas companies in terms of safety.\n\nEliminating fatal accidents and achieving top-notch performance when it comes to the prevention of injuries to our employees and to third parties are the two key important goals of our HSE management. In 2020, we trained our employees in process safety, HSE  aspects  in  contracts,  behavioral  auditing,  human  factors,  and  almost  60,000 employees and outsourced professionals in hands safety.\n\nTOTAL RECORDABLE INJURY RATE - TRI (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) The TRI result achieved in 2020 represents an important improvement compared to the 2019 TRI result.

Our  procedure is to investigate all incidents reported in order to identify their causes and take preventative and corrective actions. These actions are regularly  monitored  once  they  are  adopted.  In  case  of  serious  accidents,  we  send company-wide alerts to enable other operating units to assess the probability of similar events occurring in their own operations.",

Two main events were responsible for 99% of this total: (i) during the oil production line inertization procedure using diesel, the service line collapsed and led to a discharge of 64.04 m\u00b3 of diesel into the sea, at FPSO Cidade de S\u00e3o Vicente, in the Farfan field, located in the Sergipe Basin in ultra-deepwater; and (ii) the discharge of approximately 148 m\u00b3 of diesel at sea during a transfer operation with tug, at P-67 platform, in the Tupi Field, in the Santos Basin. In both cases, immediate pollution control procedures were implemented in order to minimize the impacts generated by the spills, and the causes were investigated for future prevention purposes.\n\nWe are constantly seeking to improve our standards, procedures and leakage response plans, which are structured at the local, regional and corporate levels.\n\nIn 2019, we set up a plan called 'Mar Azul' (Blue Ocean) with the aim of identifying and addressing the main causes for loss of primary containment events, mainly those with environmental impacts potential. This plan consists of investments for improving the management  of  processes  and  for  ensuring  the  integrity  of  our  equipment  and installations. We adopt our operational and sanitary procedures in order to ensure not only the readiness of the contingency bases but also a safety and efficient response on the  field  from  specialized  personnel.  We  also  conduct  major  table-top  exercises, including in the Buzios field, in the Santos basin Pre-Salt, which involved more than 200 people.\n\nIn 2020, the 'Mar Azul' plan moved forward, proceeding to the structuring of phase two, and it was integrated to ' Programa Compromisso com a Vida ' (Commitment to Life Program), one of our major HSE programs.\n\nAs  part  of  our  environmental  plans,  procedures  and  efforts,  we  maintain  detailed response and remediation contingency plans to be implemented in the event of an oil spill or leak from our offshore operations. The Brazilian Institute of the Environment and  of  Renewable  Natural  Resources  (IBAMA)  audits,  approves  and  authorizes  the execution of these programs.\n\nIn order to respond to these events, we have dedicated oil spill recovery vessels fully equipped  for  oil  spill  control  and  firefighting,  support  boats  and  other  vehicles, additional support and recovery boats available to fight offshore oil spills and leaks, containment  booms,  absorbent  booms  and  oil  dispersants,  among  other  resources. These resources are distributed in Environmental Defense Centers, located in strategic areas, in order to ensure rapid and coordinated response to onshore or offshore oil spills.\n\nWe have approximately 300 trained workers available to respond to oil spills 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we can mobilize additional trained workers for shoreline cleanups on short notice from a large group of trained environmental agents in the country. While these workers are located in Brazil, they are also available to respond to an offshore oil spill outside of Brazil.",

OSRL participates in the Global Response Network, an organization composed of several other companies dedicated to fighting oil spills. As a member of the OSRL, we have access to all resources available through that network, and also subscribe to their Subsea Well Intervention Services, which  provide  swift  international  deployment  of  response-ready  capping  and containment equipment. The capping equipment is stored and maintained at bases worldwide, including Brazil.\n\nIn 2020, even with the Covid-19 pandemic, we conducted six remote emergency drills of regional scope using remote communication tools.\n\nWe continue to evaluate and develop initiatives to address HSE concerns and to reduce our exposure to HSE risks on capital projects and operations.\n\n## Air Emissions and Transition to Low Carbon\n\nOur  actions  related  to  climate  change  are  supported  by  three  pillars:  (1)  carbon quantification and transparency, (2) resilience of our position in oil and gas facing low carbon transition and (3) strengthening of our skills to create value in low carbon. To that end,\n\n- \\_ we  strive  to  ensure  that  carbon  risks  and  opportunities  are  properly  captured  in scenarios,  quantified,  and  considered  in  our  decisions,  for  the  sustainability  and resilience  of  our  business.  We  adopted  transparency  in  carbon  as  a  value  and  we highlight  our  recent  public  support  to  the  TCFD  -  Task  Force  for  Climate  Related Financial Disclosures.\n- \\_ our priority is to operate at low costs and with superior performance in carbon, in order to thrive in scenarios of low oil prices, carbon prices and possible oil differentiation based on their carbon intensity in production. For this, we established a set of low carbon targets and have a company-wide carbon mitigation program, with an allocated budget. In 2020, we reinforced our structure and governance by creating an executive management area of  climate  change  that  reports  directly  to  the  Chief  Institutional Relations  and  Sustainability  Officer.  We  have  also  reviewed  our  oil  price  key assumptions in 2020, assuming a long term price of crude oil of US$50 and a resilience scenario of US$35. Those are stringent assumptions for the price of oil, compatible with scenarios aligned with the Paris agreement and more conservative than the prices from IEA Sustainable Development Scenario.\n- \\_ on the third pillar our focus is on innovation and in the acquisition of skills that may allow  future  diversification  in  renewables  and  low  carbon  products.  While  we  are working to protect a solid financial situation in the medium and long term, we also work on our competitiveness to capture the potential opportunities in renewables in a longterm perspective.  On that front we have recently announced our plans to produced advanced hydrotreated biofuels.",

Our operational emissions reduction target covers 100% of  operated  assets  in  all  our  businesses  (including  power  generation),  for  all greenhouse gases and represents a material, relevant and short-term contribution to halting climate change. We include direct (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from the acquisition of electric and/or thermal energy produced by third parties (Scope 2). Since  2019,  metrics  related  to  carbon  intensity  in  our  downstream  and  upstream operations have been integrated into executive remuneration. In 2020, these metrics were incorporated as one of our four top indicators, influencing variable remuneration not only for executives, but for all company employees.\n\nIn 2020, our performance in terms of GHG emissions was as follows:\n\n- \\_ Total  GHG  emissions  of  56  million  tCO2e,  consolidating  six  years  of  consecutive reduction of emissions and compatible with our target to reduce total operational GHG emissions by 25% by 2030, compared to 2015;\n- \\_ Carbon intensity in E&P of 15.8 kgCO2e/boe 2 , on track for achieving the medium-term target of 15 kgCO2e/boe in 2025, maintained until 2030;\n- \\_ Carbon intensity in refining of 40.2 kgCO2e/CWT 3 on track for achieving the mediumterm target of 36 kgCO2e/CWT in 2025 and of 30 kgCO2e/CWT in 2030.\n\nOur  carbon  intensity  targets  (E&P  and  Refining)  represented  a  coverage  of  76%  of emissions from activities that we operated in 2020.\n\nOur strategy also focuses on collaboration and we have continued to partner with other companies and with the science, technology and innovation community. We highlight, for instance, our participation in the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative and our support for the World Bank's 'Zero Routine Flaring by 2030' initiative. Our program on Connections for Innovation - Startups Module, conducted in partnership with SEBRAE, had a topic of carbon  reduction  on  its  two  editions  (2020  and  2019).  In  fact,  one  of  the  winning companies of the 2020 edition, Alfa Sense, will work in GHG emissions reduction in our operations and Pam Selective Membranes, which was one of the winning companies in the 2019 edition, has initiated its work last year on carbon capture technology.\n\nIn addition, we note that our Climate Change Supplement is available on our website, serving  as  an  internal  guide  which  details  our  contributions  to  reducing  the  carbon intensity of our energy supply and how we aim to remain competitive in an evolving context.\n\n-",

Through  its  10  commitments,  the initiative aims to promote racial equality, equal opportunities, and fair treatment for all. In 2018, we also signed the Open Letter Enterprises for Human Rights, where we pledged,  among  other  things,  to  adopt  a  policy  of  communication,  investigation  of complaints, and sanctions, in order to suppress practices that go against our Code of Ethical Conduct.\n\nWe also promote a commitment to human rights in our supply chain. Each year, the most  distinguished  suppliers  are  awarded  with  \" Pr\u00eamio  Melhores  Fornecedores  da Petrobras \" ('Award for Best Petrobras Suppliers'). Beyond technical categories, some special ESG category awards include Diversity (focus on Gender Equity, Persons with Disabilities,  and  Racial  Equality),  Early  Childhood  Education,  and  Best  Practices  in Compliance.

In June 2020, we launched our Human Rights Guidelines for business strategies with a view to ensuring respect for human rights, recognized  nationally  and  internationally  in  all  regions  where  we  operate  and throughout the life cycle of our projects and operations. Our human rights operations are guided by the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and structured along four axes: People Management, Community Relations, Involvement with the  Supplier  and Partner Chain,  and  Due  Diligence  in Human Rights.  Each  axis describes the processes from which we aim to ensure the incorporation of respect for human rights in all areas of our business and in our relations with our stakeholders, as well  as  to  identify  potential  risks  of  human  rights  violations  related  to  operations, products, or services we provide, and to remedy the impacts we cause.\n\nRegarding the support given to projects through the Petrobras Socio-Environmental Program, we consider that actions aimed at the promotion of human rights are a high value  attribute.  In  2020,  we  included  human  rights  as  a  transversal  theme  of  the Program, as it can be applied to all projects in relation to its main theme, to expand the scope and potential for transformation of the Program. The projects that carry out affirmative actions to promote Gender Equity, Racial Equality, and Inclusion of People with  Disabilities  must  demonstrate  the  association  between  their  actions  and  the expected results.

Our  Bylaws  extended  the  requirement  to  40%.  Technical criteria for the selection of members of the Board of Directors and executive officers set forth in Law 13,303/16 and in our Bylaws banned the appointment of ministers, secretaries and others in certain positions of public administration. Our Bylaws also provided additional requirements in addition to those of Law 13,303/16 for assessing the reputation of the administrators and members of the Fiscal Council.\n\nAs we are a mixed-capital company, the Brazilian federal government can guide our activities,  with  the  purpose  of  contributing  to  the  public  interest  that  justified  our creation,  aiming  to  guarantee  the  supply  of  oil  products  throughout  the  national territory. However, this contribution to the public interest must be compatible with our corporate purpose and with market conditions and cannot jeopardize our profitability and financial sustainability.",

        "page_content": "Thus, if providing for the public interest calls for conditions different from those of any other private sector company operating in the same market, as explained in our Bylaws, the  obligations  or  responsibilities  that  we  assume  must  be  defined  in  rules  or regulations  and  outlined  in  a  specific  document,  such  as  a  contract  or  agreement, widely  publicized  and  with  disclosure  in  such  instruments  of  detailed  costs  and revenues, including in the accounting plan. Then, the Brazilian federal government will compensate us, each fiscal year, for the difference between market conditions and the operating result or economic return of the assumed obligation.\n\nTransactions with the Brazilian federal government that require our Board of Directors' approval and occur outside the normal course of business must have been previously reviewed by the minority committee and approved by two-thirds of the board. The minority committee is formed by two members of our Board of Directors appointed by minority  common  shareholders  and  preferred  shareholders,  as  well  as  one independent member, according to our Bylaws.\n\nWe have made improvements in our governance decision-making process as well. Our Bylaws already define the board advisory committees that review all matters submitted to the Board of Directors prior to a decision. In order to ensure transparency in our most relevant decisions, we have implemented a shared authorization model, where at least two people must come to a decision (the four-eyes principle).\n\nOur  whistleblower  channel  is  an  independent,  confidential  and  impartial  tool.  It  is available  to  our  external  and  internal  audiences  and  our  controlled  companies  to register  denouncements  of  fraud,  corruption,  money  laundering,  harassment, discrimination, HSE and other issues.\n\nOur Board of Directors nominates the chief governance and compliance officer. The majority of the board must approve the dismissal of such an officer, with the vote of at least one of the directors elected by minority shareholders.\n\nWe are part of the special Level 2 corporate governance listing segment of the B3, which demands compliance with differentiated governance regulation and the improvement of the quality of the information we provide. This voluntary move to Level 2 of the B3 reinforces our advances in corporate governance and ratifies our commitment to the continued improvement of processes and to our alignment with market best practices.\n\nPossible initiatives related to changes for governance improvements require formality and transparency of process. In most cases, a shareholders' meeting is required if the proposed change is to a governance rule provided for in our Bylaws or stems from a legislative amendment if relates to a Law 13,303/16 provision.",

We achieved net cash provided by operating activities of US$28.9 billion, a Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure defined below) of US$22 billion and Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure defined below) of US$28.4 billion.\n\nOperating income in 2020 was US$10 billion, 51% lower than 2019 primarily due to lower average Brent prices in 2020 and increase in operating expenses, mainly, higher impairment, as a result of the reduction in projected Brent prices, and higher selling expenses, led by an increase in international freight costs and the sale of 90% stake held in TAG in 2019, resulting in higher payments of associated tariffs in 2020. On the other hand,  in  2020  there  were  more  exports,  which  compensated  for  the  reduction  in demand  and  margins  on  oil  products  in  Brazil,  lower  General  and  Administrative expenses (G&A) and gains of the health care plan actuarial review, as a consequence of the  reduction  in  the  contribution  paid  by  us.  There  were  also  gains  related  to  the exclusion  of  the  VAT  tax  from  the  calculation  basis  of  the  PIS/COFINS  and  lower provision for legal and administrative proceedings in 2020. Net income attributable to our  shareholders  was  US$ 1.1  billion  in  2020,  an  89%  decrease  compared  to  2019, mainly as a result of lower Brent prices, higher impairment losses, lower gains with divestments and the depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn  2019,  we  lost  control  of  BR  Distribuidora  through  a  secondary  public  offering. Accordingly, pursuant to IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, our investment became a discontinued operation, since it represented a separate major line of business. Thus, in the consolidated statement of income and cash flows,  the  net  income,  operating,  investing  and  financing  cash  flows  relating  to  BR Distribuidora are presented in separate line items, as a net amount for discontinued operations.\n\nFluctuations  in  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  driven  by  a combination of factors, including:\n\n- \\_ the volume of crude oil, oil products and natural gas we produce and sell;\n- \\_ changes  in  international  prices  of  crude  oil  and  oil  products  (denominated  in  U.S. dollars);\n- \\_ changes in the domestic prices of oil products (denominated in reais );\n- \\_ fluctuations in the real vs. U.S. dollar exchange rates and other currencies, as discussed in Note 34.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements;\n- \\_ the demand for oil products in Brazil;\n- \\_ the recoverable amounts of assets for impairment testing purposes; and\n- \\_ the amount of production taxes from our operations that we are required to pay.",

We also have entities that operate outside Brazil, the functional currency of which is the U.S. dollar. We have selected the U.S. dollar as our presentation currency in this report to facilitate the comparison with other oil and gas companies.  We have used criteria set forth in IAS 21 - 'The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates' to translate the audited consolidated financial statements from reais into U.S. dollars. Based on IAS 21, we have translated (i) all assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate as of the date of the statement of financial position; (ii) all accounts in the statements of income, other comprehensive income and cash flows using the average exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period and (iii) equity items at the exchange rates prevailing at the respective transactions dates.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME\n\n## As reported (US$ million)\n\n|                                                      | Jan-Dec   | Jan-Dec   | Variation   | Variation   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                      | 2020      | 2019      | \u25b2           | \u25b2 (%)       |\n| Sales revenues                                       | 53,683    | 76,589    | (22,906)    | (29.9)      |\n| Cost of sales                                        | (29,195)  | (45,732)  | 16,537      | (36.2)      |\n| Gross profit                                         | 24,488    | 30,857    | (6,369)     | (20.6)      |\n| Selling expenses                                     | (4,884)   | (4,476)   | (408)       | 9.1         |\n| General and administrative expenses                  | (1,090)   | (2,124)   | 1,034       | (48.7)      |\n| Exploration costs                                    | (803)     | (799)     | (4)         | 0.5         |\n| Research and development expenses                    | (355)     | (576)     | 221         | (38.4)      |\n| Other taxes                                          | (952)     | (619)     | (333)       | 53.8        |\n| Impairment of assets                                 | (7,339)   | (2,848)   | (4.491)     | 157.7       |\n| Other income and expenses                            | 998       | 1,199     | (201)       | (16.8)      |\n| Operating income                                     | 10,063    | 20,614    | (10,551)    | (51.2)      |\n| Net finance income (expense)                         | (9,630)   | (8,764)   | (866)       | 9.9         |\n| Results of equity-accounted investments              | (659)     | 153       | (812)       | (530.7)     |\n| Income before income taxes                           | (226)     | 12,003    | (12,229)    | (101.9)     |\n| Income taxes                                         | 1,174     | (4,200)   | 5,374       | (128.0)     |\n| Net income from continuing operations for the period | 948       | 7,803     | (6,855)     | (87.9)      |\n| Net income from discontinued operations for the year | -         | 2,560     | (2,560)     | (100.0)     |\n| Net income for the year                              | 948       | 10,363    | (9,415)     | (90.9)      |\n\nFor more information regarding our functional and presentation currency, see 'About Us' and Note 2.3 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations have multiple effects on our results of operations in reais.",

When the real depreciates against the U.S. dollar, as it did in 2020, generally the effect is a decrease both in revenues and expenses when expressed in U.S. dollars.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect the results of variables such as the following:\n\n- \\_ Margins: The relative pace at which our total revenues and expenses in reais increase or decrease as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, and its impact on our margins, is affected by our pricing policy in Brazil. Absent changes in the international prices of crude oil, oil products and natural gas, when the real appreciates against the U.S. dollar, and we do not adjust our prices in Brazil,  our  margins  generally  increase. Absent  changes in  the  international prices of crude oil, oil products and natural gas, when the real depreciates against the U.S. dollar and we do not adjust our prices in Brazil, our margins generally decline. However, it is our goal to sell our products in Brazil at parity with international product prices. For further information on our prices and recent developments in our pricing policies, see 'Sales Volumes and Prices' in this section and 'Recent Developments' in this annual report.\n- \\_ Debt service: The depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar also increases our debt service in reais , as the amount of reais necessary to pay principal and interest on foreign currency debt increases with the depreciation of the real . A depreciation of the real also increases our costs to import oil, oil products, goods and services necessary for our operations and our production taxes. Unless the depreciation of the real is offset by higher prices for our products sold in Brazil, which is the practice under our currently pricing policy, a depreciation increases our  debt  service  relative  to  our  cash  flows  while  also  reducing  our  operating margins. As our net debt denominated in other currencies increases, the negative impact  of  a  depreciation  of  the real on  our  results  and  net  income  when",

Therefore, the price of oil products in Brazil has a significant impact on our financial results. International oil product prices vary over time as the result of  many  factors,  including  the  price  of  crude  oil.  We  seek  to  sell  our  products  in  Brazil  at  par  with international product prices, when possible.

Impairment  losses  on  producing  properties  in  Brazil amounted to US$7,083 million, most of it related to CGUs that provide service in E&P fields, also reflecting the hibernation of producing assets in the first quarter of 2020, as well as the revision on the key assumptions of the Strategic Plan, mainly expected Brent prices, depreciation of the Brazilian real against U.S. dollar, economic slowdown and reduction in the demand for oil and oil products.\n\n## 2019 compared to 2018\n\nWe  recognized  impairment  of  assets  in  the  amount  of  US$2,848  million  in  2019 compared to US$2,005 million in 2018, mainly for E&P and Refining assets (US$1,956 million  and  US$697 million, respectively), mainly due to significant reduction in the prices of oil and natural gas projected for the 2021-2025 period and the increase in the provision for the dismantling of areas, due to the reduction in risk-free discount rates, and to changes in the schedule for removal and treatment of oil and gas production facilities.  The  higher  estimates  of  decommissioning  costs  of  E&P  fields  in  Brazil  are notably in cash generating units of Papa-Terra, in Campos Basin, in the Urugu\u00e1 group (Urugu\u00e1 and Tamba\u00fa fields), in Santos Basin, in the Canapu and Golfinho fields and in the Espirito Santo Basin, partially offset by the effects of reversals relating to the sale of producing fields in Brazil. In addition, we accounted for impairment losses in 2019 due to the postponing of a project to conclude the second refining unit of RNEST, and also due to the writing-off of UFN-III, following our decision to forego the conclusion of this  plant.  In  2018, we recognized impairment of assets in the amount of US$2,005 million  mainly  for  E&P  and  Refining  assets  (US$1,391  million  and  US$442  million, respectively),  primarily  driven  by  higher  estimates  of  decommissioning  costs  in producing properties in Brazil, the sale of production fields in Gulf of Mexico and lower freight rate forecasts pertaining to transportation assets.",

This variation is explained by the decreased result in Braskem due to legal proceedings related to activities at the rock salt  mining  in  Alagoas  and  currency  depreciation;  and  impairment  losses  in  BR Distribuidora triggered by our decision to sell our remaining shares. The recoverable value of this investment took into account the value in use, including the disposal value, considering our intention to sell the shares.\n\n## 2019 compared to 2018\n\nWe experienced income in equity-accounted investments of US$153 million in 2019, a 71% decrease (US$370 million) compared to US$523 million in 2018, mainly as a result of the decreased result in Braskem, due to legal proceedings related to activities at the rock salt mining in Alagoas, partially offset by the positive result of BR Distribuidora, as a result of the follow-on transaction in July 2019 which led to its classification as an equity-accounted investment.",

With respect to the management  of  financial  risks,  including  market  risks,  we  use  more  structural  actions  through  the management of our equity and indebtedness levels, instead of using financial derivative instruments.\n\nMarket risk management focuses on the uncertainties inherent in meeting our objectives and aims at establishing action plans towards a balanced combination of risk, return and liquidity.

We define the limits for market risks when elaborating each new strategic plan we adopt, considering our strategic objectives, goals, expected value and the liquidity of financial  resources  required  for  the  implementation  of  that  strategic  plan.  The  use  of  financial instruments, such as derivatives, may be necessary to meet our needs.\n\nIn  general, our foreign currency floating rate debt is principally subject to fluctuations in LIBOR. Our floating rate debt denominated in reais is subject to fluctuations in the Brazilian interbank offering rate, or 'DI' and Brazilian long-term interest rate, or 'TJLP' as fixed by the CMN.\n\nWe are taking actions to mitigate the potential impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR by 2021 on our debt contracts in order to substitute LIBOR with another reference rate but according to informations that we have through the date of this annual report, we do not believe this event should represent a material risk to our consolidated results and financial condition.\n\nWe generally do not use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuation, but we may utilize these financial instruments in the future.\n\nThe exchange rate risk to which we are exposed has greater impact on the balance sheet and derives\n\nprincipally from the presence of nonreal denominated obligations in our debt portfolio. With respect to the  management  of  foreign  exchange  risks,  we  take  a  broader  view  of  our  consolidated  activities, capturing possible natural hedges whenever they are available, benefiting from the correlation between our income and expenses. For the short term, the management of our foreign exchange risk involves allocating our cash investments between the real and other foreign currencies. Our strategy, reevaluated annually in the revision of our Strategic Plan, may also involve the use of financial instruments, such as derivatives, to hedge certain liabilities, minimizing foreign exchange rate risk exposure, especially when we are exposed to a foreign currency in which no cash inflows are expected, for example, Pound Sterling. In  2017,  we  entered  into  derivative  transactions,  through  our  indirect  subsidiary  Petrobras  Global Trading BV ('PGT'), in the form of cross-currency swaps to hedge against exposure in sterling pounds versus U.S. dollars, arising from past issues of bonds in that currency. In 2018, we also entered into, through PGT, derivative operations in the form of non-deliverable forwards to hedge against exposure in sterling pounds versus U.S. dollars, arising from past issues of bonds in that currency. Both transactions are still outstanding.\n\nIn September 2019, we contracted derivative operations to hedge against cash flow exposure arising from debt issued in Brazilian reais ,  the  first  series  of  the  7th  issue  of  debentures,  with the IPCAxCDI interest rate swap maturing in September 2029 and September 2034 and the CDI x Dollar cross-currency swap operations maturing in September 2024 and September 2029.\n\nWe have designated cash flow hedging relationships to reflect the economic essence of the structural hedge mechanism between U.S. dollar-denominated debt and future sales revenues.\n\nSee 'Consolidated Financial Performance - Exchange Rate Variation Impacts' in this section and Notes 4.8 and 38.3(a) to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information about our cash flow hedge.\n\nSee  Note  38.3(c)  to  our  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  for  more  information  about  our interest rate and exchange rate risks, including a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the potential impact of a 25% (or 50%) adverse change in the underlying variables as of December 31, 2020.\n\nFor further information regarding expected maturity schedule and currency, the principal and interest cash flows, related average interest rates of our debt obligations, credit risk and liquidity risk, see Notes 34, 38.5 and 38.6 to our audited consolidated financial statements.",

Accordingly, assets and liabilities items were translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate as of the date of the statement of financial position, and all items pertaining to the statement of income and statement of cash flows were translated at the average rates prevailing at each period.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  reconciliation  for  2020  and  2019  of  the  Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with IFRS, which is, in this case, the Finance debt plus Lease liability less cash and cash equivalents / Net cash provided by operating activities ratio:\n\n|                                                                              | 2020   (US$ million)   | 2019   (US$ million)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents                                                    | 11,711                 | 7,372                  |\n| Government securities and time deposits (maturity of more than three months) | 659                    | 888                    |\n| Adjusted Cash and Cash Equivalents                                           | 12,370                 | 8,260                  |\n| Finance debt                                                                 | 53,888                 | 63,260                 |\n| Lease liability                                                              | 21,650                 | 23,861                 |\n| Current and non-current debt-Gross Debt                                      | 75,538                 | 87,121                 |\n| Net Debt                                                                     | 63,168                 | 78,861                 |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations         | 28,890                 | 25,277                 |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued activities       | -                      | 323                    |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities-OCF                                | 28,890                 | 25,600                 |\n| Income taxes                                                                 | (1,174)                | 4,200                  |\n| Allowance for credit loss on trade and other receivables                     | (144)                  | (87)                   |\n| Trade and other receivables, net                                             | (1)                    | (2,233)                |\n| Inventories                                                                  | (724)                  | 281                    |\n| Trade payables                                                               | (216)                  | 989                    |\n| Deferred income taxes, net                                                   | 1,743                  | (2,798)                |\n| Taxes payable                                                                | (2,914)                | 2,105                  |\n| Others                                                                       | 2,931                  | 4,650                  |\n| Total Adjusted EBITDA                                                        | 28,391                 | 32,707                 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations                                   | 28,391                 | 32,406                 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations                                 | -                      | 301                    |\n| Gross debt net of cash and cash equivalents/OCF ratio                        | 2.21                   | 3.12                   |\n| Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio                                               | 2.22                   | 2.41                   |",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee\n\nOur statutory audit committee is an advisory committee of our Board of Directors, and provides  assistance  in  matters  involving  our  accounting,  internal  controls,  financial reporting  and  compliance.  Our  statutory  audit  committee  also  recommends  the appointment of our independent auditors to our Board of Directors and evaluates the effectiveness of our internal financial and legal compliance controls. In accordance with Law No. 13,303/2016 and Decree No. 8,945/2016, our statutory audit committee must have  at  least  three  members,  and  not  more  than  five  members,  who  must  be independent  in  accordance  with  the  independence  requirements  of  the  Law  No. 13,303/2016 and CVM Instruction No. 509/2011 and at least one of whom must have recognized  experience  in  corporate  accounting.  Additionally,  CVM  Instruction  No. 509/2011 requires at least one member of the audit committee to be a board member, although they permit the appointment of other members who are not members of the Board  of  Directors  provided  that  such  other  members  meet  the  independence requirements  of  the  CVM.  On  November  30,  2020,  our  shareholders  approved  an amendment to our bylaws requiring our audit committee to be composed of members of our Board of Directors and external individuals. On March 24, 2021, our Board of Directors nominated Mr. Valdir Augusto de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o as an external member of our audit committee.\n\nDue  to  its  composition,  our  statutory  audit  committee  is  not  equivalent  to  or comparable with a U.S. audit committee. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(c)(3), which  provides  for  an  exemption  under  the  rules  of  the  SEC  regarding  the  audit committees of listed companies, a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee  equivalent  to  or  comparable  with  a  U.S.  audit  committee  if  the  foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be separate from the full board, (ii) its members not be elected by management, (iii) no executive officer be a member of the body, and (iv) home country legal or listing provisions set forth standards for the independence of the members of the body.\n\nGiven that in 2011, the CVM approved an Instruction (No. 509/2011) governing the comit\u00ea  de  auditoria  estatut\u00e1rio  (statutory  audit  committee),  an  audit  committee established under the bylaws of the issuer and subject to certain requirements under the CVM rules, we understand that our statutory audit committee complies with these requirements, and we rely on the exemption provided by Rule 10A-3(c)(3) under the Exchange Act.\n\nMr. Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva is our audit committee financial expert. Our audit committee is currently composed of three members (all independent, in accordance with the independence requirements of the CVM and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act) and is responsible for, among other matters:\n\n- \\_ monitoring, analyzing, and making recommendations to our Board of Directors with respect  to  the  appointment  and  dismissal  of  our  independent  auditors,  as  well  as evaluating the independence of our independent auditors for issuing an opinion on the financial statements and their qualifications and expertise;",

Our audit committee has the authority to recommend pre-approval policies and procedures for the engagement of our independent auditor's services. Our management is required to obtain the audit committee's pre-approval before engaging independent auditors to provide any audit or permitted non-audit services to us or any of our consolidated subsidiaries. Our audit committee has pre-approved a detailed list of audit services, up to specified monetary thresholds. The list of pre-approved services is updated from time to time. The audit services that are not included in the list, or that exceed  the  thresholds  specified  therein,  must  be  directly  approved  by  our  audit committee.

Until  December  31, 2019, 3,294 employees enrolled in these three programs. Regarding the dismissals in 2019, 995 employees left as part of those three PDVs launched in 2019, 12 left as part of the PIDV launched in 2014 and 83 left as part of the PIDV launched in 2016, totaling 1,090 employees.\n\nIn 2020, we launched a specific program ('PAI') focused on employees that, despite meeting the legal conditions for retirement, do not require the benefit for personal reasons. Considering these four programs, three PDVs since 2019 and PAI, launched in 2020, we had 10,567 employees enrolled during 2019 and 2020 until December 31, 2020.

This  created  a  more balanced professional profile distribution by seniority. Our current workforce profile is appropriate  for  our  growth  in  terms  of  knowledge  and  talent  management,  which ensures competitive advantage and value to our business.\n\n## Labor Relations\n\nWe value transparency in our relationships with all of our stakeholders, including trade unions. We maintain relationships with 17 trade unions and one federation (i.e. a toplevel union entity) of oil workers, as well as eight unions and one federation of maritime workers. 43% of our employees are unionized, and 92% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements include economic and social clauses relating to work, safety conditions, benefits, and other matters and are valid for two years under the current collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIn February 2020 the oil workers' unions launched a strike that lasted 21 days. The strike was against the mothballing of ANSA, one of our subsidiaries, and having no relation with the 2019-2020 collective bargaining agreement. The Superior Labor Court decreed the strike of oil tankers abusive and illegal. Despite the number of days, there was no impact on production.\n\nBy  June,  we  began  negotiations  of  the  2020-2022  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement ('2020-2022  CBA')  with  all  of  the  oil  workers'  trade  unions.  The  negotiation  was concluded in October with the signature of the Collective Bargaining Agreement by all the unions. The 2020-2022 CBA is valid for two years and ensures a 2.94% increase in meal vouchers in September 2020, the automatic adjustment of wages and benefits for the cost of living in September 2021, guarantee of non-dismissal during its term. In October 2020, we started the negotiations of the 2020-2022 CBA with maritime unions.\n\nOnce the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement was concluded, we began the negotiations on the profit and results sharing agreement for the years 2021 and 2022, which ended in December 2020.\n\nThis year we also offered employees who hold a higher education degree and receive a monthly salary of US$2,366.68 or more the option to negotiate their labor conditions through individual employment agreements. Currently, 8% of our employees are under individual employment agreements.",

        "page_content": "## Benefits\n\n## Employees Variable Compensation\n\nIn 2019, our Board of Directors approved the Performance Award Program ('PPP'), a new variable remuneration model for all our employees. In line with the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan, the PPP aims to enhance meritocracy and bring flexibility to a scenario in which we seek more efficiency and alignment with the best management practices. The PPP was activated in 2019 due to our fulfillment of the minimum requirement to present a net profit above US$2.5 billion (R$10 billion) by the end of the 2019 fiscal year. As a result, during 2020, US$397 million was paid between the advance in the first quarter and settlement in the last quarter.\n\nThe settlement of the 2019 PPP payment was originally scheduled to occur in May 2020 but  was  postponed  due  to  the  resilience  measures  adopted  due  to  the  Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, the final payments to employees occurred in November 2020 and the final payments to members of the Executive Board ocurred in December 2020, after the payment of dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe  overall  compensation  of  the  administrators  (Board  of  Directors  and  Board  of Executive Officers) is approved annually during the General Meeting, in accordance with Article 152 of the Brazilian Corporate Law (Law No. 6,404, 12/15/1976). The People Committee ('COPE') is linked to our Board of Directors, and is comprised of board members and / or people in the market that have notable experience and technical capacity. Among its duties, COPE evaluates and proposes policies and mechanisms to the Board of Directors for the remuneration of members of our senior management, in compliance  with  our  strategies  and  market  benchmarks.  It  is  up  to  the  Board  of Directors to approve the proposals presented by COPE. The remuneration of Executive Officer members is guided by a consideration of economic and financial results, as well as  by  the  desire  to  recognize  managers'  efforts  and their  alignment  with  our  short, medium and long term strategies and goals. The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors corresponds to 10% of the average monthly fees received by these members. There are no differences between the benefit plans and contribution rates of the highest governance body, senior executives and all other employees.\n\nIn the calculation of the variable remuneration, the scorecards of organizational units were  considered  as  inputs  for  the  evaluation  of  directors,  executive  managers  and other members of our corporate structure. These scorecards reported the following items: (i) Net Debt / Adjusted Ebitda results which measured our leverage and Roce results, which measured our return on capital employed; (ii) specific metrics for which organizational units were responsible (represented by specific indicators and strategic initiatives covering economic, environmental and social factors); and (iii) discretionary assessments made by immediate superiors in accordance with an employee's profile and performance. Throughout 2019, the results and projections of top metrics, specific indicators, and strategic initiatives were monitored, making it possible to assess the performance of the organizational units at the end of the year, which in turn served as input for the assessment of personal performance.",

These  adjustments  were  made  to  achieve consistency with the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan.\n\nThe requirements to activate the 2020 PPP in relation to members of the Board of Executive Officers was the achievement of a positive net income in the 2020 fiscal year. The  requirements  to  activate  the  2020  PPP  in  relation  to  employees  was  the achievement of net income, excluding impairment losses or reversals and exchange rate variation, in the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nIn  addition,  the  scorecards of  the  organizational  units continue to  be  considered as inputs  for  the  evaluations  made  by  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Officers, executive managers and other members of our company's corporate structure. These scorecards  report  the  following  items:  (i)  the  results  of  key  metrics  such  as  Delta Economic Value Added, which measures economic profit in a given period less the cost of  capital  invested  from  operating  profit);  IGEE,  which  monitors  our  performance regarding direct emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; and VAZO, which calculates the total volume of oil leaked, exceeding one barrel, that has reached water bodies  or  non-waterproofed  soil);  (ii)  specific  metrics  for  which  organizational  units were responsible (represented by specific indicators and strategic initiatives covering economic, environmental and social factors); and (iii) discretionary assessments made by immediate superiors in accordance with an employee's profile and performance. Throughout 2019, the results and projections of key metrics, specific indicators, and strategic initiatives were monitored, making it possible to assess the performance of the organizational units at the end of the year, which in turn served as input for the assessment of personal performance.\n\nThe estimated amount of disbursement will depend on a variety of factors, such as individual employee performance and our performance metrics.\n\nThe Profit Sharing Program ('PLR') agreement was signed for the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 only for maritime employees. In December 2020, PLR 2019 was paid to maritime employees after the payment of dividends to shareholders.\n\nAlso in December 2020, the agreement established the regulation of the PLR for the 2021-2022 period. The PLR's target audience is employees who do not hold leadership and  expert  roles  (i.e.,  it  would  not  include  individuals  holding  positions  such  as managers, specialists and supervisors).\n\nFor the payment of the PLR to occur, the following conditions must be met:\n\n- \\_ Dividend distribution approval by the Annual General Meeting;\n- \\_ Net Income Calculation of the reference year; and\n- \\_ Achievement of an average percentage (weighted) of at least 80% for target indicators established by the Board of Directors in the PLR agreement.",

        "page_content": "## Main Benefits Granted to Employees\n\nWe  offer  benefits  that  are  commensurate  with  our  size  and  seek  to  value  our employees. All of our employees are entitled to the same benefits, regardless of their positions or duties. Namely, we offer complementary pension plans, medical assistance and pharmacy benefits. In addition, some of our consolidated subsidiaries have their own benefit plans.\n\n## Pension Plans\n\nUntil March 2018, we sponsored two pension plans: (i) the Plano Petros do Sistema Petrobras ('PPSP'), a defined-benefit plan closed to new members, and (ii) the Petros2 Plan ('Petros 2'), a variable contribution plan, open and in force since 2007, and managed by Petrobras Social Security Foundation - Petros.\n\nIn April 2018, the PPSP was split up into two plans: (i) one made up of employees and pensioners, who adhered to the new rules of the plan in 2006, 2007 and 2012 ('PPSPRenegotiated')  and  (ii)  one  for  those  employees  that  did  not  adhere  ('PPSP-Not Renegotiated'). In December 2019, once again, the PPSP-Renegotiated and PPSP-Not Renegotiated  plans  were  split  into  two  new  plans  each:  (i)  one  for  employees  and pensioners who joined the plan before 1970 and (ii) one for employees and pensioners who joined the plan after 1970. Thus, apart from Petros 2, there are currently four defined-benefit plans. Together, these plans cover 14.6% of our employees. In addition to Petros 2, 96,1% of our workforce is in a pension plan.\n\nIn  order to offer a pension plan option separate from the post-70 benefit plan, we, together with Petros, structured a new defined-contribution plan, called the Petros-3 Plan  ('PP3'),  which  will  be  open  for  voluntary  migration  of  participants  and beneficiaries from PPSP-Renegotiated and PPSP-Not Renegotiated.\n\nPP3  pension  plan  is  a  defined  contribution  plan  to  which  the  employer  and  the employee make contributions on a regular basis. Individual accounts are set up for participants and benefits are based on the account sum plus any biometric (such as longevity or disability) or investment variations along the time.\n\nIn January 2021, the Board of Directors recieved the approval for the PP3 plan from the Superintend\u00eancia  Nacional  de  Previd\u00eancia  Complementar  ('PREVIC'),  the  Brazilian Pension Funds Regulatory Agency, and the Secretaria de Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o e Governan\u00e7a das  Empresas  Estatais  ('SEST'),  the  Brazilian  State-Owned  Companies  Regulatory Agency.\n\nPetros will proceed with the new migration plan offer and, after this phase, its viability will  be  confirmed.  Then,  it  will  be  able  to  operate  the  new  plan,  with  the implementation scheduled beginning in the second half of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Equalization of Petros Plans\n\nThe main purpose of our pension plans is to supplement the social security pension benefits of our retired employees. Thus, our employees make mandatory monthly contributions as participants of our plans, and we do the same as sponsors.\n\nSince 2002, which was the last year that new participants could join the plan, Petros began to observe the deficits in the PPSP. As a result, in 2017, the PPSP underwent an equalization plan due to a total deficit of US$8.0 billion (as of December 2019). The equalization plan was based on the rules established in the 2015 Deficit Equalization Plan ('DEP 2015') made by Petros. At the time, the remaining term for this equalization plan was 16 years, and in March 2018 DEP 2015 received the previously outstanding contributions  from  all  participants  and  from  us.  These  include  active  and  retired  employees  and pensioners, as well as us, BR Distribuidora and Petros as sponsors, as required by Brazilian law.\n\nWe and Petros have also been subject to material legal proceedings in connection with the benefits granted  by  the  Petros  plans.  In  2019,  there  were  judicial  discussions  regarding  extraordinary contributions  of  DEP  2015.  These  discussions  led  to  injunctions  that  temporarily  suspended  those extraordinary contributions for certain participants.\n\nAfter those discussions and a favorable outcome to Petros, contributions to the DEP 2015 began again and  the  flow  of  extraordinary  monthly  contributions  was  restored  until  its  review  through  the  New Deficit Equalization Plan ('New DEP').\n\nIn March 2020, our Board of Directors deliberated on the New DEP of the PPSP-Renegotiated and PPSPNot Renegotiated, managed by Petros and in compliance with Brazilian social security legislation.\n\nThe New DEP, approved in May 2020 by PREVIC and SEST, came into effect in June 2020. It replaced the DEP 2015, mitigated  the  deficit  registered  in  2018,  considered  the  utilization  of  the  plans'  actuarial results achieved in 2019, and the actuarial impacts related to changes in PPSP-Renegotiated and PPSPNot Renegotiated plans regulations, which was approved by the Board of Directors, in compliance with new Brazilian  social  security  legislation,  which  allowed  the  deficit  to  be  refinanced  for  a  new  term, throughout the life of the plans. Therefore, it was possible to reduce the extraordinary contributions for most of the participants and beneficiaries and improve the regulations of the plans, which will allow for the revision of the regular contributions and will mitigate the need for new equalization plans in the future.\n\nThe remaining balance to be settled by the extraordinary contributions contracted through the New DEP in the PPSP-Renegotiated and PPSP-Not Renegotiated plans was US$6.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, as recorded in Petros plans balance sheets at present value. Of this total, US$3.1 billion corresponds to our liability in strict compliance with the principle of contributory parity provided for in Constitutional Amendment No. 20/1998, and adding the remaining obligation arising from a 20-year contract between us and Petros of US$0.4 billion to cover our share of responsibility for reducing peculium benefits (after death lumpsum benefit) in context of the New DEP.\n\nThe  effects  of  the  New  DEP  on  our  financial  statements  have  been  accounted  for  since  the  second quarter of 2020, when the New DEP was approved.\n\nFor more information on the New DEP, see Note 19.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.",

CGPAR established new governance and cost guidelines for self-managed health-care benefits of companies controlled by the Brazilian federal state. These guidelines target sustainability and financial-actuarial balance. As of January 2018, we had 48 months to adjust our AMS contribution practices to the new guidelines; however, the adjustments will only occur as a result of the recent 2020-2022 collective bargaining agreement.\n\nDuring 2020, we had to absorb 70% of these costs and 30% must be paid by health insurance associates. For 2021, the agreement settled with our employee unions state that 60% of the costs will be absorbed by us. The same agreement indicates that we will be responsible for 50% of these costs in 2022, leaving the other half to be paid by health insurance associates.\n\nThe changes in the proportion of costs paid by us and our employees in the AMS Plan, brought by the current collective bargaining agreement, led to a reallocation in our liabilities.  As of December 31, 2020, we recognized a US$2,538 million gain relating to past service cost, a portion of which was recognized in service cost (related to active participants)  and  another  portion  was  recognized  in  other  income  and  expenses (related to assisted and retired participants).\n\nAn independent actuary calculates our commitment related to future benefits for plan participants on an annual basis, based on the projected unit credit method. The health care plan is not funded or otherwise collateralized by assets. Instead, we make benefit payments based on annual costs incurred by plan participants.",

The Benef\u00edcio Farm\u00e1cia program only covers drugs from a predefined  list  of  chronic  or  psychiatric  diseases.  By  choosing  to  use  the  Benef\u00edcio Farm\u00e1cia,  the  beneficiary  must  incur  costs  as  determined  in  the  co-participation system.\n\n## New management model of AMS\n\nIn  April  2020,  our  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  new management model for AMS through the creation of a non-profit association that maintains a self-management and private health care provider model.\n\nThe change in the model aims to provide greater corporate security with technology, governance and compliance, through professional management and with expertise in supplementary health. This will enable the improvement of the quality of services and assistance to beneficiaries, as well as greater transparency in their administration, cost efficiency and risk segregation. It should be noted that the new management model will not affect the benefits or scope under the plan.\n\nWe expect that the new operator will begin managing the health plan in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe table below shows the benefits paid, contributions made and outstanding medical liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n|                                        | US$ million   | US$ million   | US$ million   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                        | 2020          | 2019          | 2018          |\n| Total benefits paid - medical plan (1) | 310           | 442           | 456           |\n| Total contributions - medical plan (1) | 308           | 442           | 321           |\n| Net actuarial liabilities (2)          | 5,356         | 11,986        | 12,236        |\n\nFor more information on our employee benefits, see Notes 4.4 and 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements and 'Risks - Risk Factors' in this annual report.",

The unification of the previous documents is a simple approach, improving the organization's values, the principles and conduct  it  expects,  promoting  elements  such  as  trust,  transparency,  responsibility, innovation, meritocracy, and good market practices.\n\nOur  Code  of  Ethical  Conduct  defines  the  ethical  principles  that  guide  our  system's actions  and  our  conduct  commitments,  both  corporate  and  that  of  our employees, explaining the ethical sense of our mission, of our vision, and of our Strategic Plan.\n\nThe Code of Ethical Conduct also applies to the members of the Board of Directors and its  advisory  committees,  members  of  the  Fiscal  Council,  members  of  the  Executive Board, employees, interns, service providers and anyone acting on our behalf, including our subsidiaries in Brazil and abroad.\n\nWe believe the Code of Ethical Conduct is aligned with the best corporate integrity practices and represents another step towards strengthening our integrity culture. It is based on our values such as respect for life, people and the environment, ethics and transparency, outperformance and confidence, market orientation, and results. Based on these values, the three main principles that support the guidelines of the Code of Ethical Conduct are:",

The information on our website is not and shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this annual report.\n\n## Antitrust Code of Conduct\n\nThe review of the Antitrust Code of Conduct was approved by our Executive Board in May  2020.  It  summarizes  the  applicable  legislation,  provides  control  for  internal procedures, ensuring compliance with principles and rules and serves as a general guide for  our  managers  and  employees.    Acting  in  compliance  with  the  Antitrust  Code  is essential  to  avoid  penalties  for  antitrust  breaches,  as  well  as  to  prevent  anticompetitive practices by third parties against us.\n\n## Ethical Conduct Guide for Suppliers\n\nIn  October 2020 we approved the Ethical Conduct Guide for Suppliers. It is the first document exclusively aimed at our suppliers, with guidelines on expected values and ethical  behavior.  The  Ethical  Conduct  Guide  for  Suppliers  applies  to  all  suppliers,  in Brazil or abroad, that are involved in business processes and have signed contracts, agreements and terms of cooperation with us. The Ethical Conduct Guide for Suppliers reaffirms our zero tolerance to any form of fraud and corruption, demanding the same stance from our supply chain. The Ethical Conduct Guide for Suppliers was elaborated in accordance with the best international practices and is aligned with the guidelines of the  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Index,  the  B3  Corporate  Sustainability  Index  and  the Corporate  Human  Rights  Benchmark.  The  Ethical  Conduct  Guide  for  Suppliers reinforces that suppliers must promote decent and safe working conditions for their employees, combat child and slavery labor and respect the environment. The Ethical Conduct Guide for Suppliers also determines that suppliers must promote diversity, gender  and  racial  equality  and  the  inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities.  The  Ethical Conduct Guide for Suppliers brings an evolution by consolidating the principles and ethical guidelines applicable to suppliers in a single document. The observance of this Ethical Conduct Guide by all suppliers is crucial for us to achieve our goals in an ethical and  transparent  way  and  is  aligned  with  our  ESG  -  Environmental,  Social  and Governance standards.",

Our ethics commission also serves in a consulting capacity for our management and workforce, providing  recommendations  with  respect  to  topics  related  to  ethics  management, proposing  rules  for  the  incorporation  of  new  concepts,  and  adopting  measures  to comply with legislation  and  follows  best  practices  that  reinforce  our  zero  tolerance approach to acts of misconduct.\n\nOur ethics commission is composed of employees appointed after an internal selection process consisting of interviews and resumes review. Our Board of Directors and our Board of Executive Officers approve each new appointment.\n\n## Petrobras Corruption Prevention Program\n\nThe PCPP, our integrity program, is driven by ongoing actions to prevent, detect, and correct  ethical  deviations,  including  fraud,  corruption  and  money  laundering.  The program is aimed at our various stakeholders, such as senior management, customers, investors, partners, public authorities, company employees and suppliers.\n\nIn  performing  our  activities  in  Brazil  and  abroad,  we  are  subject  to  national  and international  anti-corruption  laws.  We  work  to  continually  improve  our  integrity program. It adheres to best practices and anti-corruption laws, particularly Law No. 12,846/13 (Brazilian Anti-Corruption Act), the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act.\n\nPursuant to the PCPP, we undertake Integrity Due Diligence on our counterparties, seeking  to  assess  the  integrity  risks  inherent  in  our  business  relationships.  We communicate to our managers the findings of such due diligence in terms of integrity risk and our managers consider these findings in their decision-making processes. In 2020, our team evaluated 3,101 counterparties.\n\nIn addition, we perform Integrity Background Check for individuals appointed by us for key positions in our company and our subsidiaries and affiliates. This procedure aims to assist  managers in making decisions considering the degree of exposure to integrity risks  and  proposes  mitigation  measures.  In  2020,  we  conducted  6,790  integrity assessments for key positions.\n\nWe have also  developed  other  integrity  mechanisms.  These  mechanisms  deal  with topics such as: conflicts of interests; nepotism; illegal acts such as fraud and corruption; receiving or offering gifts and entertainment; transparency in actions and resources for sponsored projects; Bid-Tailoring favoritism, bribery or facilitation payment; payment of funds to foreign governments; anti-corruption laws; international embargoes and sanctions; internal investigations; internal controls; accounting practices and records of assets  and  liabilities;  information  security;  overpricing  and  underpricing;  and relationships  with  public  authorities.  In  order  to  raise  workforce  awareness,  we disseminate  guidelines  on  proper  conduct  and  reinforce  our  ethical  values  through publications and communications in our internal channels.",

From July 31 through September 30, 2020, we undertook a campaign aiming to have all employees sign the term in which they declare that they have knowledge of the Code of Ethical Conduct's content, when we reached a rate of 98.5% of total employees who have signed the acknowledgement term.\n\nIn addition, due to social distance measures in order to control the Covid-19 pandemic, we have reformulated our face-to-face integrity program courses to e-learning training. In 2020, we trained:\n\n- \\_ 5,472 managers;\n- \\_ 1,686 employees who perform activities that are more exposed to compliance risks, such as our employees involved in procurement processes and contract management;\n- \\_ 1,103 professionals involved in trading and portfolio management activities; and\n- \\_ 50 professionals, including compliance professionals, internal audit and ombudsman.\n- In 2019, we decided to develop and implement a multi-language training focused on our  counterparties.  The  training  is  available  to  counterparties  in  a  manner  that prioritizes those who offer us the greatest risk. Although it is not mandatory, it assists in fulfilling the obligations entered into by these counterparties when signing a contract with us. In 2020, 710 members from our counterparts completed the training.\n\nIn  2020,  we  also  provided  training  sessions  to  directors  and  senior  management, covering mainly the following topics:\n\n- \\_ Code of Ethical Conduct;\n- \\_ Law No. 13,709/2018 - General Personal Data Protection Law ('GDPL');\n- \\_ Our model of corporate governance and decision-making process;\n- \\_ Internal controls and related party transactions;\n- \\_ Tone at the top - Top management's commitment to the compliance culture;\n- \\_ Risk management;\n- \\_ Compliance;\n- \\_ Business performance;\n- \\_ Brazilian anti-corruption law; and\n- \\_ Prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.",

This policy also aims to guarantee the  adequate  and  diligent  decision-making  process  by  our  management, observing market conditions or appropriate compensation mechanics, in the event of potential conflicts of interest.\n\nAny related-party  transaction  in  which  we  are  involved  and  that  meets  the  criteria established in our policy, must be previously analyzed by our Audit Committee, which has to report its conclusions to our Board of Directors on a monthly basis.\n\nOur policy provides for a strict governance procedure for proposed transactions directly or indirectly involving our controlling shareholder. In such cases, whenever there is a need  to  evaluate  potential  transactions  with  the  Brazilian  federal  government,  its municipalities, foundations  or  federal  state-owned  enterprises,  our  Minority Committee must issue an opinion on the proposed transactions, provided that such transactions (i) are not in our ordinary course of business and (ii) fall within the purview of our Board of Directors for approval. Any such transaction must be approved by twothirds of the present members at the meeting of our Board of Directors.\n\nFor additional information regarding our outstanding related party transactions, see Note 39 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Transactions with our Board of Directors or Executive Officers\n\nDirect transactions with members of our Board of Directors or our executive officers must follow the conditions of an arms-length transaction and market practice guiding transactions with third parties. None of our Board of Directors members, our executive officers or close members of their families has had any direct interest in any transaction we effected that is or was unusual in its nature or conditions, or material to our business during  the  year,  and  which  remains  in  any  way  outstanding  or  unperformed.  In addition, we have not entered into any transaction with related parties which is or was unusual  in  its  nature  or  conditions  during  the  current  or  the  three  immediately preceding financial years, nor is any such transaction proposed, that is or would be material to our business.

In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  of becoming inadequate because of changes in its conditions and assumptions.\n\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as  of  December  31,  2020  based  on  the  criteria  established  in  'Internal Controls  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)'  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations  of  Treadway  Commission  ('COSO').

Banco Bradesco performs services of safekeeping and transfer of shares.\n\nHolders of our common shares are entitled to one voting right for each unit of common shares held. Holders of our preferred shares are not entitled to voting rights, except for: (i) the right to appoint one member of our Board of Directors and one member of our Fiscal Council; and (ii) certain matters relating to preferred shares (such as creation, increasing, changes in the preferences or creation of a new class), whenever rights of holders of preferred shares are adversely affected.\n\nIn the U.S., our common or preferred shares, which are evidenced by ADRs, are listed in the form of ADSs on the NYSE. The ADSs are registered and delivered by a depositary bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A ('JPMorgan' or 'Depositary') which, since January 2, 2020, acts as the depositary for both of our common and preferred ADSs.

In 2020, our stock value was affected  by  the  impact  of  Covid-19  pandemic  and  Brent  prices  reduction, underperforming the IBOV at the B3. Our stock value increased in 2019, maintaining the growth performance of 2018, and outperformed our peers at the NYSE (Amex Oil index or AMEXOIL), as well as performed slightly below the Ibovespa index (or IBOV) at the B3.",

The  payment  of  annual dividends is based on our year-end audited consolidated financial statements.\n- \\_ Intermediate  Dividends  (dividendos  intercalares): Pursuant  to  Brazilian  Corporate Law, we may distribute intermediate dividends, which shall be calculated based on our semi-annual or quarterly balance sheet prepared during the current fiscal year and not yet  approved  by  our  shareholders,  i.e.  before  we  have  determined  our  full-year earnings.\n- \\_ Interim  Dividends  (dividendos  intermedi\u00e1rios): Our  Board  of  Directors  may  also approve the payment of interim dividends, which shall be calculated based on our profit reserve  account  existing  in  the  last  balance  sheet  approved  by  our  shareholders' meeting (i.e. these dividends are paid based on either an annual or semi-annual balance sheet  already  approved  by  our  shareholders).

The  amount  paid  to shareholders as interest on capital, net of any withholding tax, may be included as part of  any  mandatory  distribution  of  dividends.  Under  Brazilian  Corporate  Law,  we  are required  to  distribute  to  shareholders  an  amount  sufficient  to  ensure  that  the  net amount  received,  after  payment  by  us  of  applicable  Brazilian  withholding  taxes  in respect  of  the  distribution  of  interest  on  capital,  is  at  least  equal  to  the  minimum mandatory dividend as set forth by the Brazilian law.\n\nFor more information on Brazilian taxation of ADSs and our shares, see 'Legal and Tax - Taxation Relating to the ADSs and our Common and Preferred Shares' in this annual report.\n\n- \\_ Date  of  payment: Under  Brazilian  Corporate  Law  and  our  Bylaws,  dividends  are generally required to be paid within 60 days following the date they are declared, unless a shareholders' resolution sets forth for another date of payment, which, in any case, must occur prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared.\n- \\_ Adjustments: Our  board  of  directors  may  approve  the  payment  of  anticipated dividends or interest on capital to our shareholders which amountis subject to financial charges at the SELIC rate from the end of each fiscal year through the date we actually pay such dividends or interest on capital.\n- \\_ Unclaimed  dividends: Shareholders  have  a  three-year  period  from  the  dividend payment date to claim dividends or interest on capital payments with respect to their shares, after which the amount of the unclaimed dividends reverts to us.\n\nOur total distributions to shareholders for 2020 amounts to US$1,977 million and will be voted at our shareholder's annual general meeting to occur in 2021.

In this case, our Board of Directors must file with the CVM an explanation for suspending the dividend distribution. Profits not distributed due to such suspension must be allocated to a special reserve and, if not absorbed by subsequent losses, must be distributed as soon as our financial condition allows such payments.\n\n## Allocation of net income\n\nAt  each  annual  general  shareholders' meeting, our Board of Directors and Board of Executive  Officers  are  required  to  recommend  how  to  allocate  net  income  for  the preceding  fiscal  year.  Under  Brazilian  Corporate  Law,  net  income  is  obtained  after deducting statutory holdings of the employees, managers and beneficiary parties.\n\nIn  accordance with Brazilian Corporate Law, an amount equal to our net profits, as further  reduced  by  amounts  allocated  to  the  legal  reserve,  to  the  fiscal  incentive investment reserve, to the contingency reserve or to the unrealized income reserve established by us in compliance with applicable law (discussed below) and increased by reversals  of  reserves  constituted  in  prior  years,  is  available  for  distribution  to shareholders  in  any  given  year.  After  the  distribution  of  preferred  dividends,  a percentage of net income may be allocated to a contingency reserve for anticipated losses that are deemed probable for future years. Any amount so allocated in a prior year must be either (i) reversed in the fiscal year in which the reasons justifying the reserve cease to exist, or (ii) written off in the event that the anticipated loss occurs.\n\nA portion of the net income from donations or government grants for investments may also be allocated to the creation of a tax incentive reserve.\n\nIf  the mandatory distribution amount, determined without deducting the amount of unrealized profits from its calculation basis, exceeds the sum of realized net income in a given year, this excess may be allocated to an unrealized revenue reserve. Brazilian Corporate Law defines realized net income as the amount of net income that exceeds the sum of the net positive result of equity adjustments and profits or revenues from operations whose financial results take place after the end of the next succeeding fiscal year. As long as we are able to make the minimum mandatory distribution described below, we must allocate an amount equivalent to 0.5% of subscribed and fully paid-in capital  at  year-end  to  a  statutory  reserve.  The  reserve  is  used  to  fund  the  costs  of research and technological development programs. The accumulated balance of this reserve cannot exceed 5% of the subscribed and fully paid-in capital stock.\n\nBrazilian  Corporate  Law  also  provides  for  the  retention  of  profits,  which  cannot  be approved  in  the  event  there  is  mandatory  dividend  distribution  and  must  be  in accordance  with  the  terms  of  our  capital  budget  previously  approved  by  the shareholders' meeting.",

However, if foreign investors are registered with the CVM, in accordance with CMN Resolution No. 4,373, they may use the dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of shares to buy and sell securities directly on the B3, which generally requires, among other steps, the registration of the relevant investment with the Central Bank of Brazil. Nonetheless, any non-Brazilian holder who registers with the CVM in accordance with CMN Resolution No. 4,373 may buy and sell securities directly on the B3. Such non-Brazilian holders must appoint a local representative in Brazil who will be required, among other duties, to register and keep updated with the Central Bank of Brazil the record of all transactions of such investors on the B3.\n\nThe  right  to  convert  dividend  payments  and  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  shares  into foreign  currency  and  to  remit  such  amounts  outside  Brazil  may  also  be  subject  to restrictions under foreign investment legislation.

The Depositary's corporate trust office at which the ADSs will be administered is located at 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, New York, New York 10179, United States.\n\nThe Depositary has obtained from the Central Bank of Brazil an electronic certificate of registration with respect to our existing ADR program. Pursuant to the registration, the custodian and the Depositary will be able to convert dividends and other distributions with respect to the relevant shares represented by ADSs into foreign currency and to remit the proceeds outside Brazil.\n\nIn  the  event  that  an  ADS  holder  exchanges  ADSs  for  the  underlying  common  or preferred shares, the holder will be required to obtain registration as a foreign investor in Brazil pursuant to CMN Resolution No. 4,373 by appointing a local representative and obtaining a certificate of registration from the Central Bank of Brazil. Failure to take these measures may subject the holder to the inability of converting the proceeds from the disposition of, or distributions with respect to, the relevant shares, into foreign currency  and  to  remit  proceeds  outside  of  Brazil.  Additionally,  the  holder  may  be subjected to a less favorable Brazilian tax treatment than a holder of ADSs.

There are three different types of E&P contracts: (i) Concession Regime; (ii) Production Sharing; and (iii) Transfer of Rights.\n\n## Concession Regime\n\nUntil 1997, we were the Brazilian federal government's exclusive agent to carry out exploration and production of oil and gas in Brazil.\n\nIn 1997, the Brazilian federal government established a concession-based regulatory framework and created an independent regulatory agency to regulate the oil, natural gas and renewable fuel industry in Brazil, namely the ANP. This framework and the ANP created a competitive environment in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe concession-based regulatory framework granted us the right to explore crude oil reserves in each of our already existing producing fields under concession contracts for an  initial  term  of  27  years  from  the  date  when  they  were  declared  commercially profitable. These are known as the 'Round Zero' concession agreements. This initial 27-year period for production can be extended at the request of the concessionaire, subject to approval from the ANP.\n\nStarting  in  1999,  all  areas  that  were  not  already  subject  to  concessions  became available for public bidding conducted by the ANP. We participated in these biddings both independently or through partnerships with private companies (as operator or as non-operator, in a case-by-case analysis).\n\nAccording  to  Law  No.  9,478/1997,  and  as  per  our  concession  agreements  for exploration and production activities, we are entitled to the oil and gas exploited from the  concession  areas  and  we  are  required  to  distribute  to  the  Brazilian  federal government a portion of the corresponding proceeds.\n\nFor information related to Taxation under Concession Regime for Oil and Gas, see item 'Legal and Tax - Tax' in this annual report.",

In 2010, laws were enacted to regulate contracts under a production-sharing regime in the pre-salt area, as defined under Law No. 12,351/2010 and in potentially strategic areas. The enacted legislation did not impact the concession contracts.\n\nWe are no longer required to be the exclusive operator of the pre-salt areas, but prior to any bid round, the Brazilian federal government must offer us, the right to express our interest to exercise the preemption right to operate the blocks under productionsharing  regime  with  minimum  30%  of  participating  interest.  Should  there  be  no proposal for the areas to which we have expressed such interest that area will not be awarded and therefore, we have no remaining obligations. The preemption right only becomes  effective  in  (i)  cases  of  winning  proposals  above  the  minimum  profit  oil, should we decide to be part of such consortium and have previously expressed interest and (ii) cases in which the winning proposal is in the minimum profit oil, then we are required to be the operator, with minimum 30% of participating interest, as applicable according to the relevant Governmental Resolution. Regardless of whether we exercise our preemption right, we will also be able to participate, at our discretion, in the bidding process to increase our interest in any of the pre-salt areas.\n\nThe winning bidder will be the company that offers to the Brazilian federal government the highest percentage of 'profit oil,' which is the gross revenue of the production of a certain field after deduction of royalties and 'cost oil,' which is the cost associated with oil production. The royalty rate is 15% applicable to the gross production of oil and natural  gas  and  there  is  no  other  government  fee  payable  to  the  Brazilian  federal government.\n\nThe production-sharing contracts are executed by and between the private companies that  are  winning  bidders,  the  state-owned  non-operating  company  PPSA,  which represents the interests of the Brazilian federal government in the production-sharing contracts and manages the Brazilian federal government's share of the profit oil, and the ANP. The PPSA participates in operational committees, with a casting vote and veto powers and manages and controls the relevant costs, all of it according to each specific production-sharing contract.\n\n## Transfer of Rights (Cess\u00e3o Onerosa)\n\nIn 2010, we entered into an agreement with the Brazilian federal government, under which the government assigned to us the right to conduct activities for the exploration and production of oil, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons in specified pre-salt areas, subject to a maximum production of five bnboe. The initial contract price for our rights under the Transfer of Rights Agreement was US$14,395 million, as of December 31, 2020, which was paid in full in 2010.

The main purpose of the review procedure is to verify whether the price paid to the Brazilian federal government by us in 2010 was appropriate in relation to the price for granting us the rights to explore and produce five billion barrels of oil equivalent in certain pre-salt areas.\n\nAccording to the Transfer of Rights Agreement, the review must be based on technical reports prepared by independent certifying entities to be contracted by the ANP and the assignee, which shall consider the best practices of the oil industry, including the following  items:  (a)  information  contained  in  the  final  report  of  the  mandatory exploration program (as such term is defined in the Transfer of Rights Agreement); (b) the  market  prices  of  oil  and  natural  gas;  and  (c)  specification  of  the  product  being produced. In addition, as provided in the Transfer of Rights Agreement, the review must follow the assumptions set forth in such agreement.\n\nAn internal committee to negotiate the revision of the Transfer of Rights Agreement with representatives of the Brazilian federal government (i.e. representatives of the MME, the Ministry of Finance, and the ANP) was created. The negotiations resulted in a  revision  of  the  Transfer  of  Rights  Agreement  that  was  submitted  to  the  TCU  for analysis, by recommendation of the MME.\n\nIn 2019, the amendment to the Transfer of Rights Agreement was approved by us, the TCU and the National Council for Energy Policy.\n\nThe amendment consolidates one of several scenarios discussed among the Brazilian federal government and our comissions and resulted in a credit of US$9,058 billion in our  favor,  that  was  fully  paid  in  December  2019.  Additionaly,  the  amendment establishes  new  percentages  for  local  content:  25%  for  well  construction;  40%  for production collection and disposal system; and 25% for stationary production unit. For information related to the new taxation model for the oil and gas industry ('REPETRO') see 'Legal and Tax - Tax' in this annual report.\n\n## Refining, Transportation and Marketing\n\nRegarding oil refining, the ANP requires specific authorization for the construction and operation of each of the process units, product treatment units and ancillary units of an oil  refinery.  The  byproducts  commercialization is subject to compliance with the specifications established by the ANP for each product (e.g. gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas).\n\nThe  ANP  requires  information  on  import,  export,  production,  processing,  handling, transportation and transfer, storage and distribution of oil, oil products, natural gas products and shale products activities on a monthly basis.\n\nSince 2013, the ANP requires oil product producers (refineries and other agents) and fuel distributors to ensure minimum inventories of gasoline and diesel. In 2015, the ANP established the same obligation for producers of LPG and jet fuel.",

In June 2019, the CNPE fixed the mandatory annual reduction of carbon emission targets and the ANP established (i) the individualization of  the  annual  mandatory  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  targets  for  the commercialization of fuels (Resolution No. 791/2019) and (ii) the procedures for the primary emission of carbon emission reduction credits (Resolution No. 802/2019).\n\nIn June 2017, the CNPE established strategic guidelines for the development of the local market for fuels, other oil byproducts and biofuels. As part of the guidelines, the MME launched  the  'Abastece  Brasil'  program  on  April  24,  2019,  which  aims  to  develop Brazil's local fuel market, promote competition in the sector, diversification of players, new investments in refining and logistics, and combating tax evasion and adulteration of fuels.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  CNPE  established  guidelines  (Resolution  No.  14/2020)  to substitute the relevant bidding procedure for biodiesel acquisition and designated ANP to design the new marketing model that must be in force by January 1, 2022).\n\nOur oil and natural gas refining area is also subject to the preventive and stringent control of CADE.\n\nIn June 2019, we signed a commitment with CADE (termo de cessa\u00e7\u00e3o de conduta) that consolidates our understanding on the divestment of refining assets in Brazil.\n\nFor  more  information  on  our  agreement  with  CADE  regarding  our  divestments  in refining  assets,  see  'Risks  -  Risk  Factors  -  Operational  Risks'  and  'Portfolio Management' in this annual report.\n\n## Gas and Power\n\n## Natural Gas Law of 2009\n\nIn March 2009, the Brazilian Congress enacted Law No. 11,909, or 'Gas Law', regulating activities  in  the  gas  industry,  including  transport,  processing,  storage,  liquefaction, regasification and commercialization. The Gas Law created a concession regime for the construction  and  operation  of  new  pipelines  to  transport  natural  gas  of  general interest,  while  maintaining  an  authorization  regime  for  pipelines  subject  to international agreements. According to the Gas Law, after a certain exclusivity period, operators  will  be  required  to  grant  access  to  transport  pipelines  and  maritime terminals, except for LNG terminals, to third parties in order to maximize utilization of capacity.",

All pipelines currently operated in Brazil are subject to an authorization regime. The ANP will issue regulations governing third-party access and carrier compensation if no agreement is reached between the parties.\n\nThe Gas Law also authorized certain consumers, who can purchase natural gas on the open market or obtain their own supplies of natural gas, to construct facilities  and pipelines for their own use in the event local gas distributors controlled by the states, which have monopoly over local gas distribution, do not meet their distribution needs. These  consumers  are  required  to  delegate  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the facilities and pipelines to local gas distributors, but they are not required to sign gas supply agreements with the local gas distributors.\n\nIn December 2010, Decree No. 7,382 was enacted in order to regulate Chapters I to VI and  VIII  of  the  Gas  Law  as  it  relates  to  activities  in  the  gas  industry,  including transportation and commercialization. Since the publication of this decree, a number of  administrative  regulations  were  enacted  by  the  ANP  and  the  MME  in  order  to regulate various issues related to the Gas Law and Decree No. 7,382 that needed to be further clarified. Among those is ANP Resolution No. 51/2013, which prevents a carrier from holding any relevant equity interest  in  companies  holding  concessions  for  gas transport pipelines. Resolution No. 51/2013 applies only to the concessions granted after  its  publication,  not  affecting,  therefore,  the  transportation  of  our  natural  gas production  through  pipelines  operated  by  TBG  and  subject  to  the  previous authorization regime.\n\nAnother important resolution is ANP Resolution No. 52/2011, which (i) establishes that ANP  is  responsible  for  authorizing  the  activity  of  commercialization  of  natural  gas, within  the  competence  of  the  Brazilian  federal  government;  (ii)  regulates  the registration of the gas seller agent; and (iii) regulates the registration of gas sales and purchase  agreements.  This  resolution  was  modified  in  July  2019  by  Resolution  No. 794/2019,  which  requires  the  publication,  by  the  ANP,  of  all  natural  gas  sales  and purchase agreements signed with local gas distributors to attend captive markets.\n\nIn June 2016, the MME created the program Gas to Grow, or G\u00e1s para Crescer, which aims  to  promote  a  competitive  market  environment  to  achieve  the  effective development of gas trading in Brazil, enabling the entry of new agents into the gas market.",

More recently, in June 2019, the CNPE established guidelines for promoting competition in the natural gas market, and in July 2019, the New Gas Market program, or Novo Mercado de G\u00e1s, was created and Decree No.  9,934  was  signed.  This  decree  establishes  a  committee  that  monitors  the implementation of the actions required for the entry of new agents into the natural gas market.\n\nAlso,  in  July  2019,  we  signed  an  agreement  with  CADE  (termo  de  compromisso  de cessa\u00e7\u00e3o), which consolidates understandings between the parties on the promotion of competition in the natural gas industry in Brazil.\n\nFor more information on our agreement with CADE regarding our divestments in the natural gas industry, see 'Risks - Risk Factors - Operational Risks' and 'Our Business Gas and Power - Marketing' in this annual report.\n\nIn 2020, considering the obligations established in the agreement mentioned above, we concluded the sale of our shareholdings in the transportation company, TAG, and initiated the sale processes of other transportation companies, NTS and TBG, and of Gaspetro, which hold stakes of several gas distribution companies in Brazil. We also negotiated some contracts for third party access to our processing plants and started the  competitive  process  for  the  lease  of  the  Regasification  Terminal  in  the  state  of Bahia, among other actions in compliance with the agreement signed with CADE.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing market opening process, in 2020 the ANP also initiated public  consultations  about  important  changes  in  the  gas  regulation,  including discussions on the creation of independence criteria for gas transportation companies, on the conceptual model for the gas market activities of federal competence and on the  exercise  of  production  of  oil  products  and  natural  gas  activities.  The  ANP  also intends  to  start  the  process  of  modifying  several  resolutions  regarding  gas  market activities, according to its regulatory agenda.\n\nThere is also a pending bill that intents to modify the Gas Law (Bill No. 6,407/2013), which includes proposals that have been discussed in the context of the Gas to Grow and New Gas Market programs. If the bill is approved, it will result in important changes in the natural gas market, including the exploitation regime of natural gas transport activities.\n\nFor  more  information  on  our  agreement  with  CADE,  see  'Risks  -  Risk  Factors  Operational  Risks',  'Portfolio  Management'  and  'Our  Business  -  Gas  and  Power  Marketing' in this annual report.",

In 2002, the Brazilian federal government eliminated price controls for crude oil and oil products, although it retained regulation over certain existing natural gas sales agreements and electricity agreements (specifically the electric power trade contracts in the regulated market - CCEAR).\n\nFor information on our price policy, see 'Our Business - Refining, Transportation and Marketing' in this annual report.\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nAll phases of the crude oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards. Our facilities in Brazil are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to the protection of human health and the environment, and they fall under the regulatory authority of CONAMA.\n\nOur  offshore  activities  are  subject  to  the  administrative  authority  of  IBAMA,  which issues operating and drilling licenses. We are required to submit reports on a regular basis,  including  safety  and  pollution  monitoring  reports  to  IBAMA  and  third  party environmental  audits  in  order  to  maintain  our  licenses.  This  way,  we  maintain  an ongoing  communication  channel  with  the  environmental  authorities,  in  order  to improve  issues  connected  with  the  environmental  management  of  our  exploration, production and refining processes of oil and natural gas. In 2018, we designed actions and  measures,  together  with  IBAMA,  to  adjust  the  treatment  and  discharge  of produced water in some of our offshore platforms in order to accommodate recently issued requirements by IBAMA. All of these actions are being met by us within the schedules defined with IBAMA.\n\nIn addition, in order to help ensuring the safety of navigation, the Brazilian maritime authority also works towards the prevention of environmental pollution, with random or periodic surveys of offshore units.\n\nMost of the onshore environmental, health and safety conditions are controlled either at the federal or the state level depending on where our facilities are located and the type of activity under development. However, it is also possible for these conditions to be controlled on a local basis whenever the activities generate a local impact or are established in a county conservation unit. Under Brazilian law, there is strict and joint liability  for  environmental  damage,  mechanisms  for  enforcement  of  environmental standards and licensing requirements for polluting activities.\n\nIndividuals or entities whose conduct or activities cause harm to the environment are subject  to  criminal,  civil  and  administrative  sanctions.  Government  environmental protection agencies may also impose administrative sanctions for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations, including:\n\n- \\_ fines;\n- \\_ partial or total suspension of activities;",

Following the review by these governmental authorities, the Brazilian Congress must approve our budget. Thus, there may be a reduction or change in our planned investments. As a result, we may not be able to implement all of our planned investments, including those related to the expansion and development of our oil and natural gas fields, which may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\n\nAll medium and long-term debt incurred by us or our subsidiaries requires the approval of the Finance Executive Manager jointly with another Executive Manager within the parameters established by our Board of Executive Offices and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe exceptions are the issuance of public debt in the capital markets and collateralized debt obligations, which require the approval of our Board of Executive Officers, within the parameters established by our Board of Directors, and the issuance of debentures, which requires the approval of our Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition, Law No. 13,303/16 requires us to define in our Bylaws the public interest we pursue and which publicly-oriented actions we are allowed to take in the pursuit of such  public  interest.  In  order  to  comply  with  Law  No.  13,303/16,  we  amended  our Bylaws to include the definition of public interest and to state that the Brazilian federal government  may  orient  our  activities  to  pursue  the  public  interest  under  certain circumstances, which distinguishes us from any other private company operating in the oil and gas market.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  Brazilian  federal  government  may  guide  us  to  take  publiclyoriented  obligations  or  responsibilities,  including  executing  investment  projects  and undertaking certain operating costs, when two conditions are met: (i) the undertaking of obligations or responsibilities must be defined by law or regulation and provided for in a contract or agreement entered into with any public entity with powers to negotiate such contract or agreement; and (ii) the investment projects must have their cost and revenues broken down and disclosed in a transparent manner.",

Under the First Production Sharing Agreement, the Libra Consortium was awarded the rights and obligations to operate and explore a strategic pre-salt area known as Libra block, located in the ultra-deepwaters of the Santos Basin. For further information on the Production Sharing Agreement, see Exhibit 2.22 to this annual report.\n\n## Second and Third Production Sharing Agreements - 2 nd and 3 rd Production Sharing Bidding Rounds\n\nIn  2017,  we  acquired,  in  partnership  with  other  international  oil  companies,  three offshore blocks in the 2 nd and 3 rd bidding rounds under the production sharing system held by the ANP. We are the operator of these blocks ('Second and Third Production Sharing Agreements'). In January 2018, together with our partners, the ANP, PPSA and the Brazilian federal government, we signed the Second and Third Production Sharing Agreements for exploration and production of oil and natural gas.\n\nUnder the production sharing system, the consortium submits to the government a percentage of the so-called 'surplus in oil profit for the Brazilian federal government,' which is applied to revenue discounted of the production costs and royalties. The only criteria adopted by the ANP to define the winning bidder was the amount of profit oil to the Brazilian federal government, since the bidding rules provided for the fixed value of  the  signing  bonus,  the  minimum  exploratory  program  and  the  local  content commitments.\n\nThe following table summarizes the blocks we acquired, in partnership, in the 2 nd and 3 rd bidding rounds as part of the production sharing system:",

The only criteria adopted by the ANP to define the winning bidder was the amount of oil profit to the Brazilian federal government too, since the bidding rules provided for the fixed value of the signing bonus, the minimum exploratory program and the local content commitments. Basic Terms:\n\nOperating Committee. The Production Sharing Agreement Consortia are managed by an  operating  committee  in  which  we,  our  partners  and  PPSA  all  participate.  PPSA represents the interests of the Brazilian federal government and although it will not invest in the blocks, PPSA holds 50% of the operating committee voting rights and also has a casting vote and veto powers, as defined in the Production Sharing Agreements.\n\nRisks, Costs and Compensation. All exploration, development and production activities under the Production Sharing Agreements will be conducted at the expense and risk of the members of the consortium. For commercial discoveries of crude oil and/or natural gas in the blocks, the consortium will be entitled to recover, on a monthly basis, (i) a portion  of  the  production  of  oil  and  gas  in  the  block  corresponding  to  its  royalty expenses and (ii) the 'cost oil' corresponding to costs incurred (which is the amount associated with capital expenditures incurred and operating costs of the consortium's exploration and production activities), subject to the conditions, proportions and terms set  forth  in  the  Production  Sharing  Agreements.  In  addition,  for  each  commercial discovery, the consortia are entitled to receive, on a monthly basis, their share of 'profit oil' as defined under the Production Sharing Agreements.\n\n## Duration:\n\nThe term of the Production Sharing Agreements is 35 years.\n\n## Phases:\n\nOur activities under the Production Sharing Agreements are divided into two phases, as follows:\n\nExploration  phase.  This  phase  comprises  appraisal  activities  for  purposes  of determining the  commerciality  of  any  discoveries  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas.  The exploration phase begins upon the execution of the Production Sharing Agreements and will end for each discovery upon the declaration of commerciality.

This right was used once, and the ANP conceded waiver to  the  hull  items  and  certain  items  of  the  process  plants.  By  Resolution  No 726/2018,  the  ANP  gave  the  Libra  consortium  the  possibility  of  changing  the  local content requirements to lower levels, but the possibility of waiver was excluded.\n\nOn the Production Sharing Bidding Round 2, the fields bid on had the same local content requirements of their adjacent fields contracts, according to the CNPE Resolution No 7/2017. Such resolution established new local content levels for the Production Sharing Agreements, and the Bidding Rounds 3, 4, 5 and 6 used those levels.\n\n## Royalties and Expenses with Research and Development:\n\nOnce we begin production in each field, members of the consortia (other than PPSA) will be required to pay monthly royalties of 15% of the oil and natural gas production, to  be  recovered  from  a  portion  of  the  production  of  oil  and  gas  in  the  block.  All members of the consortia (other than PPSA) will also be required to invest 1.0% of their annual gross revenues from crude oil and natural gas production under the Production Sharing Agreements in research and development activities related to the oil, gas and biofuel sectors.\n\n## Miscellaneous Provisions:\n\nUnder the Brazilian production-sharing regime, we can assign our rights and obligations inherent  to  our  participation  above  30%  in  the  areas  in  which  we  exercised  our preemptive right to be the operator.\n\nAll members of the consortia (other than PPSA) have a right of first refusal with respect to  an  assignment of rights and obligations by any other member of the consortium (other than PPSA).\n\nThe Production Sharing Agreements shall be terminated in the following circumstances: (i)  the  expiration  of  their  terms;  (ii)  if  the  minimum  work  program  has  not  been completed  by  the  end  of  the  exploration  phase;  (iii)  if  there  has  not  been  any commercial  discovery  by  the  end  of  the  exploration  phase;  (iv)  if  the  consortium members (other than PPSA) exercise their withdrawal rights  during the  exploration phase; (v) if the consortium refuses to execute a  unitization agreement after the ANP makes such determination (which termination may be complete or partial) and (vi) any other basis for termination described in the Production Sharing Agreements.",

If any breach of the Production Sharing Agreements is considered by the Brazilian federal government not to be significant, intentional, or a result of negligence, imprudence or recklessness, or it is proved that the consortium has worked diligently to cure such breach, the Brazilian federal government may, instead of terminating the Production Sharing Agreements, propose that the ANP apply designated sanctions on the relevant parties.\n\nWe and other consortium members will use our best efforts to settle any disputes. If we  are  unable  to  do  so,  any  consortium  member  may  submit  such  dispute  or controversy to an ad hoc arbitration following the rules established by the UNCITRAL, or  by  the  consent  of  the  parties  in  interest,  to  the  ICC,  or  any  other  well-regarded arbitration chamber.

In the event of a dispute involving nonnegotiable rights, the parties shall submit the dispute to the federal courts in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.\n\nThe Production Sharing Agreements are governed by Brazilian law.\n\n## Amendment to the Transfer of Rights Agreement\n\nThe Transfer of Rights Agreement was executed in 2010. Its amendment was approved in 2019 by the TCU and the CNPE and our governing bodies.\n\nThe  parties  involved  discussed  several  scenarios  about  the  revision  of  the  original agreement,  as  both  of  them  could  be  simultaneously  creditor  and/or  debtor.  The amendment consolidates one such scenario, resulting in a credit of US$9,058 billion in our favor, which was fully paid in December 2019.\n\nIn  addition  to  such  credit,  the  main  changes  as  a  result  of  the  amendment  to  the Transfer of Rights Agreement were (i) the local content clauses that lowered the local content requirements for the production phase (development and production stages) and (ii) the dispute resolution provisions that became similar to the provisions of the Production Sharing Agreements of the latest ANP bid rounds.\n\nFor more information concerning our other material contracts, see 'Our Business' and 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' in this annual report.",

Our audited consolidated financial statements only include provisions for probable and reasonably estimable losses and expenses we may incur in connection with pending proceedings.\n\nSome of our main legal proceedings are listed below.\n\n## Lava Jato Investigation\n\nIn  2009,  the  Brazilian  federal  police  began  an  investigation  aimed  at  criminal organizations engaged in money laundering in several Brazilian states, known as 'Car wash'  operation  ('Lava  Jato').  The  Lava  Jato  investigation  is  extremely  broad  and comprises numerous investigations into several criminal practices, spanning crimes and conduct committed by individuals in different parts of the country and different sectors of the Brazilian economy. In 2014, Lava Jato started to focus part of its investigation on irregularities involving our contractors and suppliers and uncovered a broad payment scheme that involved a wide range of participants, including our former personnel. It is possible that further information damaging us and our interests will come to light in the course of the ongoing investigations of corruption by Brazilian authorities.\n\nWe are not a target of the Lava Jato investigation and we are formally recognized, by the  Brazilian  authorities,  as  a  victim  of  the  improper  payments  scheme.  We  will continue to pursue legal measures against companies and individuals, including former employees and politicians, who have caused financial and image damages to us. We have been working together with the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor's Office, the Brazilian federal police, the Federal Revenue Services and other competent authorities since the beginning of  the  investigation.  The  total  amount  of  restitution  paid  to  us  since  the beginning  of  Lava  Jato  through  December  31,  2020  was  US$1,287  million  (about US$155 million in 2020, US$220 million in 2019, US$457 million in 2018, US$252 million in 2017, and US$131 million in 2016).\n\nFor further information regarding Lava Jato and its impacts on us, see Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements.",

In 2014, the SEC and DoJ initiated investigations in connection with the facts disclosed in connection with Lava Jato. We have fully cooperated with their investigations.\n\nIn September 2018, we entered into agreements with the SEC and the DoJ related to our internal controls, accounting records and financial statements for the period 2003 to 2012, which fully resolved their respective investigations. Under the terms of these agreements,  we  paid  US$85.3  million  to  the  DoJ,  US$85.3  million  to  the  SEC  and US$682.6 million to Brazilian authorities.\n\nIn  our  agreements  with  them,  the  DoJ  and  SEC  recognize  improvements  to  our compliance  program,  internal  controls  and  anti  corruption  procedures.  We  have committed to continue evaluating and improving these and other efforts.

We  reiterate  that  we  will  continue  to  cooperate  with  regulatory authorities, including the CFTC, regarding any inquiry, reinforcing our commitment to integrity and transparency.\n\n## Brazil: Prosecutor's Office\n\nIn  2015, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo Prosecutor's Office established a civil proceeding to investigate the existence of potential damages caused by us to investors listed in the Brazilian stock market. However, the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor's Office assessed this civil proceeding and determined that the S\u00e3o Paulo Public Prosecutor's Office has no authority  over  this  matter,  which  must  be  presided  over  by  the  Brazilian  Federal Prosecutor's  Office.

However, in one of the arbitrations, proposed by two institutional investors, on  May  26,  2020,  a  partial  arbitration  award  has  been  issued.  The  partial  award indicates our liability, but does not determine our payment of amounts, nor does it end the procedure. This arbitration is confidential, as well as the others in progress, and the partial award represents only the position of the three arbitrators of such arbitration panel and are not extendable to the other existing arbitrations. On July 20, 2020, we filed a lawsuit for the annulment of this partial arbitration award, considering our view that it contains serious flaws and improprieties. On November 10, 2020, the first level judge of Rio de Janeiro state court declared the partial award null. The appeals against this decision are pending. In compliance with CAM rules, the lawsuit is confidential. We reiterate that we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously, out of respect for our current shareholders, in all arbitrations to which we are a party.\n\n## Arbitration in Argentina\n\nIn  2018,  we  were  served  with  an  arbitral  claim  filed  by  Consumidores  Financieros Asociaci\u00f3n Civil para su Defensa (the 'Association') against us and other individuals and legal entities, before the 'Tribunal de Arbitraje General de la Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires' ('Arbitral Tribunal').\n\nAmong other issues, the Association alleged our liability for a supposed loss of market value of our shares in Argentina, due to proceedings related to Lava Jato.\n\nIn June 2019, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that the arbitral claim should be considered withdrawn  due  to  the  lack  of  payment  of  the  arbitral  fee  by  the  Association.  The Association has filed appeals that were rejected by the court of appeals on November 20, 2019. The Association has appealed to the Argentinian Supreme Court, and a final decision is still pending.\n\n## Criminal Actions in Argentina\n\nWe were accused of these two criminal actions in Argentina, as described below:\n\n- \\_ Criminal  action  alleging  non-compliance  by  us  with  the  obligation  to  publish  as 'relevant fact' to the Argentinian market the existence of a class action claim filed by Consumidores  Financieros  Asociaci\u00f3n  Civil  para  su  Defensa  before  the  Judicial Commercial Courts (Judicial Commercial Claim), pursuant to provisions of Argentine capital market law. It is worth mentioning that the Judicial Commercial Claim had never been served to us. This criminal court docket is being handled by Criminal Economic Court No. 3 of the city of Buenos Aires.

On  September  14,  2020,  the  judge  accepted  our  defense  grounded  in jurisdiction  immunity  and  decided  that  we  cannot  be  sued  in  criminal  proceedings before the Argentine Courts. The Association appealed against this decision, and the appeal is pending judgment.\n\n## Sete Brasil's Investor Claim and Mediation Procedure\n\nWe are currently a party to a lawsuit in the District Court of the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C. filed by EIG in 2016, a complaint against us concerning its indirect purchase of equity interests in Sete Brasil, a company created in order to build rigs with high local content. In this proceeding, EIG alleges that we induced investors to invest in Sete Brasil and that we were among the parties responsible for the financial crisis of Sete Brasil, which filed judicial recovery proceedings ('recupera\u00e7\u00e3o judicial'), in Brazil.\n\nThe District Court denied our motion to dismiss on various grounds including sovereign immunity and ruled that the claims could proceed to discovery, which is the exchange of legal information and known facts of a case between the parties. We appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which affirmed  the  court's  decision.  We  presented  a  petition  for  writ  of  certiorari  to  the Supreme Court of the United  States  that  was  denied.  We  subsequently  moved  the District  Court  to  stay  the  case  pending  arbitration,  which  was  denied.  We  have appealed that decision and that appeal was denied. During 2020, the parties engaged in extensive document exchanges and other written discovery.  The parties also have taken the depositions of numerous fact witnesses.  Depositions will continue in 2021 and then the parties will proceed to expert discovery.\n\nWe were also a party to arbitrations in Brazil filed by investors of Sete Brasil, which concluded in 2020 when a favorable arbitration award was granted to us. On April 1, 2020, July 29, 2020, and on December 17, 2020, we disclosed the settlement of three other arbitrations related to the investment in Sete Brasil.\n\nIn addition, as result of an extrajudicial mediation initiated in 2017 in Brazil, in 2019 our Board of Directors approved the final terms of an agreement to be executed between us  and  Sete  Brasil,  the  key  terms  of  which  include:  (i)  maintenance  of  charter  and operation contracts referring to four drilling rigs, with termination of signed contracts in relation to the other twenty-four drilling rigs; (ii) the contracts shall have effect for ten years, with a daily rate of US$299 thousand, including the chartering and operation of  the  units;  (iii)  and  our  removal  and  the  removal  of  our  subsidiaries  from  the shareholding structure of the companies of Grupo Sete Brasil and FIP Sondas until we no longer hold any shares in such company; and (iv) the resulting dissolution of all other contracts that are not compatible with the terms of the agreement. Magni Partners shall charter the rigs to us and the rigs shall be operated by Etesco.",

As a result, our Executive Board authorized the beginning of a new negotiation with Sete Brasil.\n\nWe no longer hold any direct or indirect equity in the companies of the Sete Brasil Group.\n\n## Other Legal proceedings\n\n## Legal Proceedings and Preliminary Procedure on TCU Divestments\n\nThere are some judicial proceedings (mainly civil suits), which allege a supposed lack of publicity and competitiveness in our proceedings, and in some cases the purchase price, for  the  sale  of  participation  shares  in  controlled  companies  and  assets,  such  as exploration and production rights in Oil & Gas Fields ('Divestment Bids'). Some bids were suspended due to injunctions granted under preliminary analysis, which were reversed after we presented our statement of defense and/or appeals. Although the aforementioned court proceedings are still pending on the final awards, there is no injunction preventing any Divestment Bid.\n\nThere are constitutional actions filed before the Brazilian Supreme Court challenging the  constitutionality  of  the  Decree  No.  9,188/2017,  which  sets  forth  rules  for divestment of assets and controlled affiliates  by federal  mixed-capital  corporations, including  us.  Due  to  the  preliminary  injunction  granted  on  June  27,  2018  by  the Supreme Court's Minister Ricardo Lewandowski in Direct Unconstitutionality Action ADI 5624 MC/DF, which presumably could affect its Divestments, we have suspended some sales, according to the press release dated July 3, 2018. On June 6, 2019, the court partially revised the injunction to the extent that state companies are allowed to sell their  corporate  control  in  affiliates'  companies  provided  that  such  state  companies were granted a general authorization to do so by their law of incorporation and that the  sale  process  is  competitive  and  executed  in  accordance  with  the  constitutional principles  applicable  to  the  public  administration,  pursuant  to  Federal  Decree  No. 9,188/2017. Hence, we may seek the divestment of assets and controlled affiliates, without any constraint. Another constitutional action (Direct Unconstitutionality Action 5841), with the same purpose, was filed and the Brazilian Supreme Court has denied the injunction in virtual sessions held in December 2020. The final decision of both constitutional procedures are still pending.\n\nAlso,  there  is  a  Direct  Unconstitutionality  Action  filed  against  Federal  Decree  No. 9,355/18 ('Federal Decree') that aims at the immediate suspension of its effects and a declaration of unconstitutionality for allegedly disregarding the provisions of articles 28 to 84 of Law No. 13,303/16 and the principles of legality, morality, impersonality and efficiency (Direct Unconstitutionality Action - ADI -5942).",

On  January  11,  2019,  the  President  of  the Supreme Court granted a preliminary injunction to suspend the effects of the Decision until the judgment by the plenary of the court, which occurred in virtual sessions in October,  2020.  The  court  has  ruled  the  claim  groundless  by  a  decision  yet  to  be published in the Federal Official Gazette on February 8, 2021.\n\nWith  respect  to  TCU,  all  projects  included  in  our  divestment  portfolio  (excluding partnerships and acquisitions, subject to another set of rules) follow the methodology deemed  appropriate  by  TCU  under  administrative  procedure  TC-013.056/2016  -6. Recently, our divestment process methodology was reviewed and forwarded to TCU under administrative procedure TC-009.508/2019 -8. The most up-to-date methodology took effect on December 23, 2020.\n\n## Labor Proceedings\n\n## RMNR\n\nThere  are  a  number  of  lawsuits  relating  to  Minimum  Compensation  per  Level  and Working Regime ('RMNR') with the purpose to review its calculating criteria.\n\nThe RMNR consists of a minimum compensation guaranteed to the workforce, based on the salary level, the work regime and condition and the geographic location. This compensation policy was created and implemented in 2007 as a result of collective bargaining with union representatives and approval in employee assemblies, and it was only challenged three years after its implementation. The matter at dispute is whether to  include  additional  working  arrangements  and  special  working  conditions  as  a complement to RMNR.\n\nIn  2018, the  Brazilian  Superior  Labor Court ('TST') ruled against us and we filed an appeal against its decision. The STF suspended the effects of the decision issued by the TST  and  called  for  the  national  suspension  of  the  ongoing  proceedings  relating  to RMNR.\n\n## Applicable rate\n\nSince several judges were considering the application of the rate provided for by the law ('Taxa Referencial') to be unconstitutional, the matter was referred to the STF. In December 2020, the STF decided that, in labor litigation, the IPCA-E rate should be applied up until the date that the process is initiated, and the SELIC rate should be applied as of the date that the process has been initiated. However, this decision has not yet been published officially, and its exact content is not yet available. This may have an effect on our provisions, including RMNR provisions.",

The Parque das Baleias arbitration was terminated by means of an agreement executed by the parties.\n\nIn the case of the Tartaruga Mesti\u00e7a and Tartaruga Verde arbitration, the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro upheld the competence-competence principle, in which the arbitral tribunal is entitled to rule on its own jurisdiction of the case. Thus, this arbitration was resumed and at the hearings held in December 2020, the parties presented a brief 'case exposition' and arguments related to the discussion of preliminary issues.\n\nIn  relation  to  the  Ba\u00fana  and  Piracaba  arbitration,  a  judicial  injunction  is  keeping  it suspended. The Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro will decide an appeal filled by us to resume the arbitration proceeding.\n\nIn addition, the BM-S-11 Consortium, formed with Shell and Petrogal, of which we are the operator, challenged the ANP's decision on unifying Tupi and Cernambi fields. The arbitration  remains  suspended  due  to  a  judicial  injunction.  Currently,  the  Brazilian Superior Court decided to annul the former judgment issued by the Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro in order to determine a new trial. Therefore, the Federal Court will once again decide which court (the state court or arbitral tribunal) should decide the merits of the case.\n\n## Drilling contract with Vantage\n\nFurthermore, we were a party to an arbitration with Vantage Deepwater Company and Vantage  Deepwater  Drilling,  Inc.  (collectively,  'Vantage')  administered  by  the International Centre for Dispute Resolution and related to a drilling contract we entered into with Vantage. In July 2018, a tribunal of three members concluded by majority, with one dissenting opinion, Vantage was entitled to receive US$622.02 million, plus interest  of  15.2%  per  annum  compounded  monthly,  as  compensation  for  the  early termination of said contract and invoices related to the drilling of a well in the Gulf of Mexico. We filed a motion to vacate the award before a Federal Court in Texas, arguing that we had been denied the fundamental safeguards of due process, as expressed by the dissenting arbitrator's opinion. Vantage sought and obtained attachments from a Dutch court, which were served in 2018, blocking the shares of our Netherlands-based subsidiaries  and  any  amounts  and  assets  due  to  us,  arising  from  obligations  of  our Netherlands-based subsidiaries to secure payment of the arbitral award. In May 2019, the Federal Court confirmed the arbitration award and denied our motion to vacate it. In  June  2019,  our  subsidiaries  paid  approximately  US$700  million  related  to  such decision. The payment ceased accruing interest, allowed the lifting of the pre-judgment attachments of our Netherland-based subsidiaries and avoided other legal constraints, but did not end the dispute. We appealed the decision in June 2019. In July 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Federal Court decision and rejected the appeal. The Court of Appeals subsequently rejected our petitions for rehearing in August 2020. In January",

In August 2019, we signed an agreement ('termo de ajustamento de conduta') in the amount of US$208 million with the state of Rio de Janeiro, the Prosecutor's Office and INEA, to conclude one of the civil actions concerning the environmental licensing of COMPERJ. Regarding the four other civil actions, they have been partially settled by the first agreement and another agreement ('termo de ajustamento de conduta') in the amount of US$11 million was signed in February 2020 with the same parts to conclude them. As a result, the judicial procedures were archived.\n\nAdditionally, since 2000, we are party to another public civil action regarding the OSPAR pipeline, related to the obligation to compensate damages and alleged moral damages resulting from the environmental accident that occurred in the state of Paran\u00e1 on July 16, 2000. We had a court decision condemning us and the amount of US$150 million was provisioned.

We also aim at engaging with tax authorities in an ethical and transparent manner. Considering that we are the biggest taxpayers in Brazil, our engagement with tax authorities may result in various effects on tax collection at the federal, state and municipal levels, as well as production taxes under the ANP.\n\nWe are subject to tax on our income at a Brazilian statutory corporate rate of 34%, comprising of a 25% rate of income tax and a social contribution tax at a 9% rate. Since 2015,  we  have  been  recognizing  income  tax  expenses  over  non-exempt  income generated by our foreign subsidiaries based on Brazilian statutory corporate rates as established by Law No. 12,973/2014.\n\nIn addition to taxes paid on behalf of consumers to the Brazilian federal government, as well as state and municipal governments, such as the value-added tax (Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os, or 'ICMS'), we are required to pay three main charges on our oil production activities in Brazil under the scope of the ANP: (i) royalties, (ii) special participation and (iii) retention bonuses. See '- Taxation under Concession Regime for Oil and Gas' below and 'Risks - Risk Factors - Government Ownership and Country Risks' in this annual report. These charges imposed by the Brazilian federal government are included in our cost of sales.\n\n## Taxation under Concession Regime for Oil and Gas\n\nAccording to Law No. 9,478/1997 and under our concession agreements for exploration and production activities with the ANP, we are required to pay the government the following:\n\n- \\_ Signing bonuses paid upon the execution of the concession agreement, which are based on the amount of the winning bid, subject to the minimum signing bonuses published in the relevant bidding guidelines (edital de licita\u00e7\u00e3o);\n- \\_ Annual  retention  bonuses  for  the  occupation  or  retention  of  areas  available  for exploration and production, at a rate established by the ANP in the relevant bidding guidelines based on the size, location and geological characteristics of the concession block;",

Net revenues are gross revenues, based on reference prices for crude oil or natural gas established by Decree No.  2,705  and  ANP  regulatory  acts,  less  royalties  paid,  investments  in  exploration, operational costs and depreciation adjustments and applicable taxes. In 2020, we paid this  government  take  on  10  of  our  fields,  namely  Jubarte,  Leste  do  Urucu,  Marlim, Marlim Sul, Mexilh\u00e3o, Rio Urucu, Roncador, Sapinho\u00e1, Tartaruga Verde and Tupi; and\n- \\_ Royalties to be established in the concession contracts at a rate ranging between 5% and 10% of gross revenues from production, based on reference prices for crude oil or natural  gas  established  in  its  regulatory  acts.  In  establishing  royalty  rates  in  the concession  contracts,  the  ANP  also  takes  consideration  the  geological  risks  and expected productivity levels for each concession. Most of our crude oil production is currently paid at the maximum royalty rate.\n\nLaw No. 9,478/1997 also requires concessionaires of onshore fields to pay to the owner of the land a participation fee that varies between 0.5% and 1.0% of the sales revenues derived from the production of the field.\n\n## Taxation Model for the Oil and Gas Industry (RepetroSPED)\n\nOn December 28, 2017, the Brazilian  federal  government enacted  Law  No. 13,586, which outlined a new taxation model for the oil and gas industry and, along with the Decree No. 9,128/2017, established a new special regime for exploration, development and production of oil, gas and other liquid hydrocarbons named Repetro-Sped, which will expire in December 2040.\n\nThis regime provides for the continuation of total tax relief over goods imported with temporary  permanence  in  Brazil,  as  previously  established  by  the  former  Repetro (special customs regime for the export and import of goods designated to exploration and  production  of  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves),  and  adds  this  relief  to  goods permanently  held  in  Brazil.  This  benefit  allowed  for  the  migration  of  all  the  goods acquired in the former Repetro to the Repetro-Sped.\n\nIn 2018, we started to transfer the ownership of oil and gas assets under this regime from our foreign subsidiaries to our parent company and the joint ventures (consortia) in Brazil. The transfer was completed in 2020.\n\nIn addition, the legislation prescribes the Repetro-Industrializa\u00e7\u00e3o, a special tax regime, regulated in 2019, which exempts acquisitions from the O&G supply chain established in Brazil.\n\nFollowing the creation of Repetro-Sped and Repetro-Industrializa\u00e7\u00e3o, some Brazilian states,  pursuant  to  a  decision  by  the  Brazilian  National  Council  of  Finance  Policies (CONFAZ), agreed to grant tax incentives relating to the value added tax (ICMS) over transactions under these regimes to the extent each state enacts its specific regulation providing for the tax relief on the oil and gas industry.",

This summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality or taxing jurisdiction other than Brazil and the United States.\n\nThis summary is based upon the tax laws of Brazil and the United States as in effect on the date of this annual report, which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect).

Prospective purchasers of common or preferred  shares  or  ADSs  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  as  to  the  tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of common or preferred shares or ADSs.\n\nThere is no income tax treaty between the United States and Brazil.

In addition, securities trading is restricted  to  transactions  carried  out  in  the  stock  exchanges  or  organized  over-thecounter markets authorized by the CVM.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\nGenerally speaking, dividends paid by us, including stock dividends and other dividends paid in property to the Depositary in respect of the ADSs, or to a non-Brazilian holder in respect of the preferred or common shares, are not subject to withholding income tax in Brazil, to the extent that such amounts are related to profits generated after January 1, 1996.\n\nWe  must  pay  to  our  shareholders  (including  non-Brazilian  holders  of  common  or preferred  shares  or  ADSs)  interest  on  the  amount  of  dividends  payable  to  them, updated by the SELIC rate, from the end of each fiscal year through the date of effective payment  of  those  dividends.  These  interest  payments  are  considered  fixed-yield income and are subject to withholding income tax at varying rates depending on the length of period of interest accrual. The tax rate for payments made to beneficiaries resident or domiciled in Brazil varies from 15%, in case of interest accrued for a period greater than 720 days, 17.5% in case of interest accrued for a period between 361 and 720 days, 20% in case of interest accrued for a period between 181 and 360 days, and to 22.5%, in case of interest accrued for a period up to 180 days. However, when the beneficiary is a non-Brazilian holder, under CMN Resolution No. 4,373 rules, the general applicable  withholding  income  tax  rate  over  interest  is  15%  except  in  case  the beneficiary  is  resident  or  domiciled  in  a  country  or  other  jurisdiction  that  does  not impose income tax or imposes it at a maximum income tax rate lower than 17% (a Low or  Nil  Tax  Jurisdiction)  or,  based  on  the  position  of  the  Brazilian  tax  authorities,  a country  or  other  jurisdiction  where  the  local  legislation  does  not  allow  access  to information  related  to  the  shareholding  composition  of  legal  entities,  to  their ownership or to the identity of the effective beneficiary of the income attributed to shareholders (the 'Non-Transparency Rule'), when the applicable withholding income tax rate will be 25%.

See 'Shareholder Information - Dividends - Payment of Dividends and Interest on Capital' in this annual report. In the case of non-Brazilian residents that are resident in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (including in the view of Brazilian authorities the jurisdictions to which the Non-Transparency Rule applies), the applicable  withholding  income  tax  rate  is  25%.  See  'Tax  -  Taxation  of  Dividends  Clarifications  on  Non-Brazilian  Holders  Resident  or  Domiciled  in  a  Low  or  Nil  Tax Jurisdiction' in this annual report. The payment of interest with respect to updating recorded distributions by the SELIC rate that is applicable to payments of dividends applies equally to payments of interest on capital. The determination of whether or not we will make distributions in the form of interest on capital or in the form of dividends is made by our Board of Directors at the time distributions are to be made. We cannot determine how our Board of Directors will make these determinations in connection with future distributions.\n\n## Taxation of Gains\n\nFor purposes of Brazilian taxation on capital gains, two types of non-Brazilian holders have to be considered: (i) non-Brazilian holders of ADSs, preferred shares or common shares that are not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction, and that, in the case of preferred or common shares, have registered before the Central Bank of Brazil and the CVM in accordance with CMN Resolution No. 4,373; and (ii) any other non-Brazilian  holder,  including  non-Brazilian  holders  who  invest  in  Brazil  not  in accordance  with  CMN  Resolution  No.  4,373  (including  registration  under  Law  No. 4,131/1962) and who are resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction. See 'Tax - Taxation of Dividends - Clarifications on Non- Brazilian Holders Resident or Domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction' in this annual report.\n\nAccording to Law No. 10,833/2003, capital gains realized on the disposition of assets located in Brazil by non-Brazilian holders, whether or not to other non-residents and whether  made  outside  or  within  Brazil,  may  be  subject  to  taxation  in  Brazil.  With respect to the disposition of common or preferred shares, as they are assets located in Brazil,  the  non-Brazilian holder may be subject to income tax on any gains realized, following  the  rules  described  below,  regardless  of  whether  the  transactions  are conducted in Brazil or with a Brazilian resident. We understand the ADSs do not fall within the definition of assets located in Brazil for the purposes of this law, but there is still neither pronunciation from tax authorities nor judicial court rulings in this respect. Therefore, we are unable to predict whether such understanding will prevail in the courts of Brazil.\n\nAlthough there are grounds to sustain otherwise, the deposit of preferred or common shares in exchange for ADSs may be subject to Brazilian taxation on capital gains if the acquisition cost of the preferred or common shares is lower than the average price per preferred or common share.",

In this last case,  for  the  capital  gains  related  to  transactions  conducted  on  the  Brazilian  nonorganized over-the-counter market with intermediation, the withholding income tax of 0.005% will also apply and can be offset against the eventual income tax due on the capital gain.",

Law No. 13,259 provides for new rates that range from 15%  to  22.5%  depending  on  the  amount  of  the  gain  recognized  by  the  Brazilian individual, as follows: (i) 15% on gains not exceeding R$5 million; (ii) 17.5% on gains that exceed R$5 million and do not exceed R$10 million; (iii) 20% on gains that exceed R$10 million and do not exceed R$30 million; and (iv) 22.5% on gains exceeding R$30 million.

        "page_content": "## Clarifications on Non-Brazilian Holders Resident or Domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction\n\nLaw No. 9,779/1999 states that, except for limited prescribed circumstances, income derived  from  transactions  by  a  person  resident  or  domiciled  in  a  Low  or  Nil  Tax Jurisdiction will be subject to withholding income tax at the rate of 25%. A Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction is generally considered to be a country or other jurisdiction which does not impose any income tax or which imposes such tax at a maximum rate lower than 17%. Under certain circumstances, the NonTransparency Rule is also taken into account for determining whether a country or other jurisdiction is a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction. In addition, Law No. 11,727/2008 introduced the concept of a 'privileged tax regime,' which is defined as a tax regime which (i) does not tax income or taxes it at a maximum rate lower than 17%; (ii) grants tax benefits to non-resident entities or individuals (a) without the requirement to carry out a substantial economic activity in the country or other  jurisdiction  or  (b)  contingent  on  the  non-exercise  of  a  substantial  economic activity in the country or other jurisdiction; (iii) does not tax or that taxes foreign source income  at  a  maximum  rate  lower  than  17%;  or  (iv)  does  not  provide  access  to information related  to  shareholding  composition,  ownership  of  assets  and rights or economic transactions carried out. We believe that the best interpretation of Law No. 11,727/2008  is  that  the  concept  of  a  'privileged  tax  regime'  will  apply  solely  for purposes of the transfer pricing rules in export and import transactions, deductibility for  Brazilian  corporate  income  taxes  and  the  thin  capitalization  rules  and,  would therefore generally not have an impact on the taxation of a non-Brazilian holder of preferred or common shares or ADSs, as discussed herein. However, we are unable to ascertain whether the privileged tax regime concept will also apply in the context of the rules applicable to Low or Nil Tax Jurisdictions, although the Brazilian tax authorities appear to agree with our position, in view of the provisions of the Withholding Income Tax Manual (MAFON - 2020), issued by the Brazilian Revenue Service.\n\n## Taxation of Foreign Exchange Transactions (IOF/Exchange)\n\nBrazilian law imposes the IOF/Exchange on the conversion of reais into foreign currency and  on  the  conversion  of  foreign  currency  into reais .  Currently,  for  most  foreign currency exchange transactions, the rate of IOF/Exchange is 0.38%. However, foreign exchange transactions related to inflows of funds to Brazil for investments made by foreign investors in the Brazilian financial and capital markets are generally subject to IOF/Exchange at a zero percent rate. Foreign exchange transactions related to outflows of proceeds from Brazil in connection with investments made by foreign investors in the Brazilian financial and capital markets are also subject to the IOF/Exchange tax at a zero percent rate. This zero percent rate applies to payments of dividends and interest on capital received by foreign investors with respect to investments in the Brazilian financial and capital markets, such as investments made by a non-Brazilian holder as provided for in CMN Resolution No. 4,373. The Brazilian executive branch may increase such rates at any time, up to 25% of the amount of the foreign exchange transaction, but not with retroactive effect.",

The rate of IOF/Bonds applicable to transactions involving preferred or common shares is currently zero. However, the Brazilian federal government may increase such rate at any time up to 1.5% of the transaction amount per day, but the tax cannot be applied retroactively.\n\nThe  IOF  on  transfer  of  shares,  which  are  admitted  to  trading  on  a  stock  exchange located  in  Brazil,  with  the  specific  purpose  of  backing  the  issuance  of  depositary receipts traded abroad have been reduced from 1.5% to zero, as of December 24, 2013.\n\n## Other Brazilian Taxes\n\nThere are no Brazilian inheritance, gift or succession taxes applicable to the ownership, transfer  or  disposition  of  preferred  or  common  shares  or  ADSs  by  a  non-Brazilian holder, except for gift and inheritance taxes which are levied by certain states of Brazil on  gifts  made  or  inheritances  bestowed  by  a  non-Brazilian  holder  to  individuals  or entities resident or domiciled within such states in Brazil.

See 'Risks - Risk Factors - Equity and Debt Securities Risks' in this annual report.\n\n## U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThis summary describes material U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) from the ownership and disposition of common  or  preferred  shares  or  ADSs.  This  summary  is  based  on  the  U.S.  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ('the Code'), its legislative history, existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and court decisions, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a decision to hold or dispose of common or  preferred  shares  or  ADSs.  This  summary  applies  only  to  purchasers  of common or preferred shares or ADSs who hold the common or preferred shares or ADSs as 'capital assets' (generally, property held for investment), and does not apply to  special  classes  of  holders  such  as  dealers  or  traders  in  securities  or  currencies, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, holders of 10% or more of our shares, measured by voting power or value (taking into account shares held directly or through depositary arrangements), tax-exempt organizations, partnerships or partners therein,  financial  institutions,  life  insurance  companies,  holders  liable  for  the alternative minimum tax, securities traders who elect to account for their investment in common or preferred shares or ADSs on a mark-to-market basis, persons that enter into  a  constructive  sale transaction  with  respect to  common or preferred shares or ADSs, persons holding common or preferred shares or ADSs in a hedging transaction or as part of a straddle or conversion transaction, or nonresident alien individuals present in the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year. Moreover, this summary addresses only U.S. federal income tax consequences and does not address state, local or foreign taxes or the U.S. federal estate and gift taxes or the Medicare tax on net investment income.\n\nEACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE OVERALL TAX  CONSEQUENCES  IN  ITS  PARTICULAR  CIRCUMSTANCES,  INCLUDING  THE CONSEQUENCES  UNDER  LAWS  OTHER  THAN  U.S.  FEDERAL  INCOME  TAX  LAWS ADDRESSED HEREIN, OF AN INVESTMENT IN COMMON OR PREFERRED SHARES OR ADSs.",

In general, a holder of an ADS will be treated as the holder of the shares of common or preferred stock represented by those ADSs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no gain or loss will be recognized if you exchange ADSs for the shares of common or preferred stock represented by that ADS.\n\nIn this discussion, references to ADSs refer to ADSs with respect to both common and preferred shares, and references to a 'U.S. Holder' are to a holder of a common or preferred share or ADS that is:\n\n- \\_ an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n- \\_ a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; or\n- \\_ otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net basis with respect to the share or the ADS.\n\n## Taxation of Distributions\n\nA  U.S.  Holder  will  recognize  ordinary  dividend  income  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax purposes in an amount equal to the amount of any cash and the value of any property we distribute as a dividend to the extent that such distribution is paid out of our current or  accumulated  earnings  and  profits,  as  determined  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax purposes, when such distribution is received by the depositary, in the case of ADSs, or by the U.S. Holder in the case of a holder of common or preferred shares. The amount of any distribution will include distributions characterized as interest on capital and the amount of  Brazilian  tax  withheld  on  the  amount  distributed,  and  the  amount  of  a distribution  paid  in reais will  be  measured  by  reference  to  the  exchange  rate  for converting reais into U.S. dollars in effect on the date the distribution is received by the depositary, in the case of ADSs, or by a U.S. Holder in the case of a holder of common or preferred shares. If the depositary, in the case of ADSs, or U.S. Holder in the case of a holder of common or preferred shares, does not convert such reais into U.S. dollars on the date it receives them, it is possible that the U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency loss or gain, which would be U.S. source ordinary loss or gain, when the reais are converted into U.S. dollars. Dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code.\n\nSubject  to  certain  exceptions  for  short-term  and  hedged  positions,  the  U.S.  dollar amount of dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. Holder with respect to the ADSs will generally be subject to taxation at preferential rates if the dividends are 'qualified dividends.' Dividends paid on the ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States and (ii) we were not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a 'passive foreign investment company' as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a PFIC). The ADSs are listed on the NYSE, and will qualify as readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States  so  long  as  they  are  so  listed.  Based  on  our  audited  consolidated  financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe that we should not be treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the 2020 or",

In addition, based on our audited consolidated financial statements and our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets, the sources and  nature  of  our  income,  and  relevant  market  and  shareholder  data,  we  do  not anticipate becoming a PFIC for our 2021 taxable year.  Based on existing guidance, it is not  clear  whether  dividends  received  with  respect  to  the  shares  will  be  treated  as qualified dividends, because the shares are not themselves listed on a U.S. exchange. U.S. Holders of our ADSs should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in the light of their particular circumstances.\n\nDistributions out of earnings and profits with respect to the shares or ADSs generally will  be  treated  as  dividend  income  from  sources  outside  of  the  United  States  and generally  will  be  treated  as  'passive  category  income'  for  U.S.  foreign  tax  credit purposes. Subject to certain limitations, Brazilian income tax withheld in connection with any distribution with respect to the shares or ADSs may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. federal income tax liability of a U.S. Holder, or, at the U.S. Holder's election, such Brazilian withholding tax may be taken as a deduction against taxable income (provided that the U.S. Holder elects to deduct, rather than credit, all foreign income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year). A U.S. foreign tax credit may not be allowed for Brazilian withholding tax imposed in respect of certain shortterm or hedged positions in securities or in respect of arrangements in which a U.S. Holder's expected economic profit is insubstantial. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the U.S. foreign tax credit, including the translation  of reais into  U.S.  dollar  for  these  purposes,  in  light  of  their  particular circumstances.\n\nHolders of ADSs that are foreign corporations or nonresident alien individuals (non-U.S. Holders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including withholding tax, on distributions with respect to shares or ADSs that are treated as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless such dividends are effectively connected with the conduct by the holder of a trade or business in the United States.\n\n## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\nUpon the sale or other disposition of a share or an ADS, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S. source capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the U.S. Holder's tax basis in such share or ADS. Any gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares or ADSs have been held for more than one year. Non-corporate U.S. Holders of shares or ADSs may be eligible for a preferential rate of U.S. federal income tax in respect of long-term capital gains. Capital losses may be deducted from taxable income, subject to certain limitations. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, such disposition would not result in foreign source income to a U.S. Holder. As a result, a U.S. Holder may not be able to use the foreign tax credit associated with any Brazilian income taxes imposed on such gains, unless such holder can use the credit against U.S. tax due on other  foreign  source  income.  U.S.  Holders  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors regarding the availability of the U.S. foreign tax credit.",

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding collected from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, so long as the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.\n\nU.S.  Holders  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  about  any  additional  reporting requirements that may arise as a result of their purchasing, holding or disposing of our ADSs, or common or preferred shares.\n\nA  non-U.S.  Holder  generally  will  be  exempt  from  these  information  reporting requirements and backup withholding tax, but may be required to comply with certain certification and identification procedures in order to establish its eligibility for such exemption.\n\n## Specified Foreign Financial Assets\n\nCertain U.S. Holders that own 'specified foreign financial assets' with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or US$75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required to file an information statement along  with  their  tax  returns,  currently  on  Form  8938,  with  respect  to  such  assets. 'Specified foreign financial assets' include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial  institution,  as  well  as  securities  issued  by  a  non-U.S.  issuer  (which  would include  our  common and preferred shares and ADSs) that are not held in accounts maintained  by  financial  institutions.  Higher  reporting  thresholds  apply  to  certain individuals  living  abroad  and  to  certain  married  individuals.  Regulations  extend  this reporting requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign financial assets based on certain objective criteria. U.S. Holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations for assessment of tax would be suspended, in whole or part. Prospective investors should consult their own  tax  advisors  concerning  the  application  of  these  rules  to  their  investment, including the application of the rules to their particular circumstances.",

The rate of withholding income tax in respect of interest payments is generally (in case of fixed yields - See 'Taxation of Dividends') 15%, unless (i) the holder of the notes  is  resident  or  domiciled  in  a  'tax  haven  jurisdiction'  (that  is  deemed  to  be  a country or jurisdiction which does not impose any tax on income or which imposes such tax at a maximum effective rate lower than 17% or where the local legislation imposes restrictions on disclosing the identities of shareholders, the ownership of investments, or the ultimate beneficiary of earnings distributed to the non-resident - 'tax haven jurisdiction'), in which case the applicable rate is 25% or (ii) such other lower rate as provided for in an applicable tax treaty between Brazil and another country where the beneficiary is domiciled. In case the guarantor is required to assume the obligation to pay the principal amount of the notes, Brazilian tax authorities could attempt to impose withholding income tax at the rate of up to 25% as described above. Although Brazilian legislation does not provide a specific tax rule for such cases and there is no official position  from  tax  authorities  or  precedents  from  the  Brazilian  court  regarding  the matter, we believe that the remittance of funds by us as a guarantor for the payment of the principal amount of the notes will not be subject to income tax in Brazil, because the mere fact that the guarantor is making the payment does not convert the nature of the principal due under the notes into income of the beneficiary.\n\nIf  the  payments  with  respect  to  the  notes  are  made  by  us,  as  provided  for  in  the guaranties, the non-resident holders will be indemnified so that, after payment of all applicable  Brazilian  taxes  collectable  by  withholding,  deduction  or  otherwise,  with respect to principal, interest and additional amounts payable with respect to the notes (plus any interest and penalties thereon), a non-resident holder will receive an amount equal to the amount that such non-resident holder would have received as if no such Brazilian  taxes  (plus  interest  and  penalties  thereon)  were  withheld.  The  Brazilian obligor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay additional amounts in respect of such withholding or deduction so that the non-resident holder receives the net amount due.\n\nGains on the sale or other disposition of the notes made outside of Brazil by a nonresident,  other  than  a  branch  or  a  subsidiary  of  Brazilian  resident,  to  another  nonresident are not subject to Brazilian income tax.\n\nIn  addition,  payments  made  from Brazil  are  subject  to  the  tax  on  foreign  exchange transactions (IOF/C\u00e2mbio), which is levied on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency and on the conversion of foreign currency into Brazilian currency at a general rate of 0.38% . Other IOF/ C\u00e2mbio rates may apply to specific transactions. In any case, the Brazilian federal government may increase, at any time, such rate up to 25% but only with respect to future transactions.\n\nGenerally, there are no inheritance, gift, succession, stamp, or other similar taxes in Brazil with respect to the ownership, transfer, assignment or any other disposition of the notes by a non-resident, except for gift and inheritance taxes imposed by some Brazilian states on gifts or bequests by individuals or entities not domiciled or residing in Brazil to individuals or entities domiciled or residing within such states.",

This summary is based upon the Code, its legislative history, existing  and  proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings by the IRS, and court decisions, all as in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not purport to discuss all aspects of the U.S. federal income taxation which may be relevant to special classes of investors, such  as  financial  institutions, insurance companies, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, securities traders who elect to account for their investment in notes on a mark-to-market basis, regulated investment  companies,  tax-exempt  organizations,  partnerships  or  partners  therein, holders that are subject to the alternative minimum tax, certain short-term holders of notes, persons that hedge their exposure in the notes or hold notes as part of a position in a 'straddle' or as part of a hedging transaction or 'conversion transaction' for U.S. federal tax  purposes,  persons  that enter  into  a  'constructive  sale'  transaction  with respect to the notes, nonresident alien individuals present in the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year, or U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. U.S. Holders should be aware that the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding the notes may be materially different for investors described in the prior sentence.\n\nIn addition, this summary addresses only U.S. federal income tax consequences and does not discuss any foreign, state or local tax considerations or the Medicare tax on net investment income or under special timing rules prescribed under section 451(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This summary only applies to original purchasers of notes  who  have  purchased  notes  at  the  original  issue  price  and  hold  the  notes  as 'capital  assets'  (generally,  property  held  for  investment).  U.S.  Holders  of  notes denominated in a currency other than US$ should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of foreign currency gain or loss rules to the notes and the treatment of any foreign currency received in respect of the notes.\n\nEACH  INVESTOR  SHOULD  CONSULT  ITS  OWN  TAX  ADVISOR  CONCERNING  THE OVERALL TAX CONSEQUENCES IN ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES  UNDER  LAWS  OTHER  THAN  U.S.  FEDERAL  INCOME  TAX  LAWS ADDRESSED HEREIN, OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES.",

        "page_content": "## Payments of Interest\n\nPayment of 'qualified stated interest,' as defined below, on a note (including additional amounts, if any) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income when such interest is accrued or is actually or constructively received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder's applicable method of accounting for U.S. federal tax purposes. In general, if a note is issued with an 'issue price' that is less than its 'stated redemption price at maturity' by more than a de minimis amount, such note will be considered to have 'original issue discount,' or OID. For this purpose, the 'issue price' generally is the first price at which a substantial amount of such notes is sold to investors for money. A U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the issue price for a note, in particular where the note has been issued pursuant to an exchange offer or a reopening or the note's terms have been amended. The stated redemption price at maturity of a note  generally  includes  all  payments  on  the  note  other  than  payments  of  qualified stated interest.\n\nIn general, each U.S. Holder of a note, whether such holder uses the cash or the accrual method  of  tax  accounting,  will  be  required  to  include  in  gross  income  as  ordinary interest income the sum of the 'daily portions' of OID on the note, if any, for all days during the taxable year that the U.S. Holder owns the note. The daily portions of OID on a note are determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a ratable portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. In general, in the case of an initial holder, the amount of OID on a note allocable to each accrual period is determined by (i) multiplying the 'adjusted issue price,' as defined below, of the note at the beginning of the accrual period by the yield to maturity of the note, and (ii) subtracting from that product the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to that accrual period. U.S. Holders  should  be  aware  that  they  generally  must  include  OID  in  gross  income  as ordinary interest income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income. The 'adjusted issue price' of a note at  the  beginning  of  any  accrual  period  will  generally  be  the  sum  of  its  issue  price (generally including accrued interest, if any) and the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual  periods,  reduced  by  the  amount  of  all  payments  other  than  payments  of qualified  stated  interest (if any)  made  with respect to such note in all prior accrual periods. The term 'qualified stated interest' generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least annually during the entire term of a note at a single fixed rate of interest, or subject to certain conditions, based on one or more interest indices.\n\nInterest income, including OID, in respect of the notes will constitute foreign source income  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes  and,  with  certain  exceptions,  will  be treated  separately,  together  with  other  items  of  'passive  category  income,'  for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable under the U.S. federal income tax laws. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder's particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits and the treatment of additional amounts.",

        "page_content": "## Sale or Disposition of Notes\n\nA  U.S.  Holder  generally  will  recognize  capital  gain  or  loss  upon  the  sale,  exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued qualified stated interest, which will be taxed as such) and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the note generally will equal the U.S. Holder's cost for the note increased by any amounts included in gross income by such U.S. Holder as OID, if any, and reduced by any payments other than payments of qualified stated interest on that note. Gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note generally will be U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless it is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business outside the United States and certain other conditions are met. The gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the notes were held for more than one year. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder generally is subject to taxation at preferential rates. Capital losses may be deducted from taxable income, subject to certain limitations.\n\n## Backup Withholding and Information Reporting\n\nA U.S. Holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to 'backup withholding' with respect to certain payments to that U.S. Holder, unless the holder (i) is an exempt recipient,  and  demonstrates  this  fact  when  so  required,  or  (ii)  provides  a  correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld under these rules generally will be creditable against the U.S. Holder's U.S.  federal  income  tax  liability.  While  non-U.S.  Holders  generally  are  exempt  from backup withholding, a non-U.S. Holder may, in certain circumstances, be required to comply  with  certain  information  and  identification  procedures  in  order  to  prove entitlement to this exemption.\n\nU.S.  Holders  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  about  any  additional  reporting requirements that may arise as a result of their purchasing, holding or disposing of the notes.",

'Specified foreign financial assets' include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial  institution,  as  well  as  securities  issued  by  a  non-U.S.  issuer  (which  would include the notes) that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individuals living abroad and to certain married individuals. Regulations extend this reporting requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign  financial  assets  based  on  certain  objective  criteria.  U.S.  Holders  who  fail  to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations for assessment of tax would be suspended, in whole or part. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the notes, including the application of the rules to their particular circumstances.",

Petrobras and subsidiaries ('the Company') as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for lease arrangements as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ('PCAOB') and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Assessment of the measurement of the defined benefit obligations for pension and health care plans\n\nAs discussed in notes 4.4 and 19 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension and health care plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits to its employees. As of December 31, 2020, the defined benefit obligations for these pension and health care plans were USD 16,069 million. The measurement of the Company's defined benefit obligations with respect to these plans requires the determination of certain actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include the discount rate and projected medical costs. The Company hires external actuarial professionals to assist in the process of determining the actuarial assumptions and the valuation of the defined benefit obligations for its pension and health care plans.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the measurement of the defined benefit obligations for the pension and health care plans as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required because minor changes to the discount rates and projected medical costs used to determine the defined benefit obligations can cause significant changes to the measurement of the defined benefit obligations for the pension and health care plans.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's process for determining the defined benefit obligations for pension and health care plans. This included controls related to the determination, review and approval of the discount rates and projected medical costs;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the scope of the work, competency, and objectivity of the external actuarial professionals hired by the Company to assist in the process of determining the actuarial assumptions and the measurement of the defined benefit obligations for the pension and health care plans. This included assessing the nature and",

The carrying amount of the exploration and production CGUs as of December 31, 2020 was USD 42,421 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the amount of impairment loss recognized in relation to the exploration and production CGUs was USD 7,316 million.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the impairment testing of exploration and production CGUs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of complexity and subjectivity of auditor judgment was involved in evaluating the Company's definition of these CGUs and the estimate of the recoverable amount. The definition of exploration and production CGUs requires auditor judgment in the consideration of operational factors that impact the interdependencies between oil and gas assets. These interdependencies alter the aggregation or segregation of the oil and gas assets into CGUs. The expected future cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount depend on certain assumptions about the future including average Brent oil price; exchange rate; capital and operating expenditure and volume and timing of recovery of the oil and gas reserves. The recoverable amount is also sensitive to minor changes in the discount rate. The assessment of these assumptions required significant auditor judgment.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's impairment assessment process. These included controls related to the review and approval of the Company's determination of the CGUs and of the key assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount;\n- \u00b7 for changes in exploration and production CGUs during the year, we assessed the operational factors considered by the Company when defining these changes by comparing to information obtained from internal and external sources;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the Company's projected recovery of oil and gas reserves by comparing it with estimated volumes certified by an external reservoir specialist hired by the Company and, for a selection of CGUs, with historical production;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the scope of the work, competency, and objectivity of the external reservoir specialists hired by the Company that certified the estimated reserve volumes. This included assessing the nature and scope of the work they were engaged to perform and their professional qualifications and experience;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated, for a selection of CGUs, the Company's projected future capital and operating expenditures by comparing these projections with the latest approved business and management plan and long-term budgets;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the Company's ability to accurately project cash flows by comparing, for a selection of CGUs, the prior years' estimated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 with actual cash flows in this year; and\n- \u00b7 in addition, we involved a valuation professional with specialized skill and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating certain assumptions used in the impairment testing such as the discount rates, average Brent oil prices and the exchange rates by comparing them against available external market data.\n\n## Evaluation of provisions and disclosures for certain specific labor, civil and tax lawsuits\n\nAs discussed in notes 4.5 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in labor, civil and tax lawsuits during the normal course of its activities. The Company records provisions for these lawsuits when it is probable that an outflow of resource embodying economic benefits will be required to settle a present",

The Company discloses a contingent liability whenever the likelihood of an outflow to settle a present obligation is considered possible, or when the likelihood is considered probable, but it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of the outflow.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the provisions and / or disclosures for certain specific labor, civil and tax lawsuits as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment and effort was required due to the subjective nature of the estimates and assumptions. Specifically, judgments about the likelihood of an outflow and estimates of the amounts of outflows.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's evaluation of lawsuits. These included controls related to the review and approval of the determination of the likelihood of an outflow to settle a present obligation and the estimate of amounts of outflows, as well as over the financial statement disclosures;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the scope of work, competency, and objectivity of the internal and external legal counsel that determined the likelihood of an outflow to settle a present obligation and the estimate of the amounts of outflows. This included assessing the nature and scope of the work performed by the internal and external legal counsel and their professional qualifications and experience;\n- \u00b7 we obtained and evaluated letters received directly from the Company's external legal counsel that included an assessment of the likelihood of loss and the estimate of the amounts of outflows. For certain specific legal proceedings, we compared these assessments and estimates to those used by the Company and evaluated the sufficiency of the Company's legal contingency disclosures; and\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate amounts to be paid related to labor, civil and tax lawsuits by comparing the amounts paid upon resolution of legal proceedings during the year to the provision amounts as of the prior year end.\n\n## Evaluation of the estimate of the provision for decommissioning costs\n\nAs discussed in notes 4.1(c), 4.6 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements the Company records a provision for decommissioning costs which reflects its obligations to restore the environment and dismantle and remove oil and gas production facilities upon abandonment. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of provision for decommissioning costs was USD18,780 million. The Company's estimate of the provision for decommissioning costs includes assumptions in relation to the nature and extent of the environmental restoration and the dismantlement and removal work as well as the cost and timing of this work.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimate of the provision for decommissioning costs as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was necessary to evaluate the key assumptions used in the estimate such as the extent of the decommissioning work that will be required by contract and regulations, the criteria to be met when the decommissioning actually occurs and the costs and related timing of the future payments that will be incurred in the decommissioning process.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:\n\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's process to estimate the provision for decommissioning costs. This included controls related to the determination, review and approval of the key assumptions, including estimates of the timing of abandonment and estimated costs of decommissioning;\n- \u00b7 we assessed the estimates of timing until abandonment used by the Company, by comparing the production curves and life of the oil and gas reserves used with estimated reserve volumes certified by external reservoir specialists hired by the Company;\n- \u00b7 we assessed the estimated costs of decommissioning by comparing certain key assumptions with external industry reports;\n\n<!-- image -->",

(Petrobras), hereinafter referred to as 'Petrobras' or 'Company,' is a partially state-owned enterprise, controlled  by  the  Brazilian  Federal  Government,  of  indefinite  duration,  governed  by  the  terms  and  conditions  under  the Brazilian Corporate Law (Law 6,404 of December 15, 1976), Law 13,303 of June 30, 2016 and its Bylaws.\n\nPetrobras' shares are listed on the Brazilian stock exchange (B3) in the Level 2 Corporate Governance special listing segment and, therefore, the Company, its shareholders, its managers and fiscal council members are subject to provisions under its regulation (Level 2 Regulation Regulamento de Listagem do N\u00edvel 2 de Governan\u00e7a Corporativa da Brasil Bolsa Balc\u00e3o - B3). The  provisions  of  the  Level  2  Regulation,  which  are  based  on  high  standards  of  corporate  governance,  shall  prevail  over statutory provisions in the event of harm to the rights of public offers investors provided for in the Company's Bylaws, except when otherwise determined by other regulation. On February 13, 2020, as requested, Petrobras had its disassociation from the B3 State-Owned Governance Program approved.\n\nThe Company is dedicated to prospecting, drilling, refining, processing, trading and transporting crude oil from producing onshore and offshore oil fields and from shale or other rocks, as well as oil products, natural gas and other liquid hydrocarbons. In addition, Petrobras carries out energy related activities, such as research, development, production, transport, distribution and trading of all forms of energy, as well as other related or similar activities.\n\nPetrobras may perform any of the activities related to its corporate purpose, directly, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, controlled companies, alone or through joint ventures with third parties, in Brazil or abroad.\n\nThe economic activities linked to its business purpose shall be undertaken by the Company in free competition with other companies according to market conditions, in compliance with the other principles and guidelines of Laws no. 9,478/97 and 10,438/02 (oil & gas and electricity sector regulations, respectively). However, Petrobras may have its activities, provided they are in compliance with its corporate purpose, guided by the Brazilian Federal Government to contribute to the public interest that justified its creation, aiming to meet national energy policy objectives when:\n\nI - established by law or regulation, as well as under agreements provisions with a public entity that is competent to establish such obligation, abiding with the broad publicly stated of such instruments; and\n\nII - the cost and revenues thereof have been broken down and disseminated in a transparent manner.\n\nIn this case, the Company's Investment Committee and Minority Shareholders Committee, exercising their advisory role to the Board of Directors,  shall  assess  and  measure  the  difference  between  such  market  conditions  and  the  operating  result  or economic return of the transaction, based on technical and economic criteria for investment valuation and specific operating costs and results under the Company's operations. In case a difference is identified, for every financial year, the Brazilian Federal Government shall compensate the Company.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Basis of preparation\n\n## 2.1. Statement of compliance and authorization of consolidated financial statements\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared and are being presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the  historical  cost  convention,  except  when  otherwise indicated.  The  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the  preparation  of  these  financial  statements  are  set  out  in  their respective explanatory notes.\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates based on assumptions and judgements, which may affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Although our management periodically reviews these assumptions and judgments, the actual results could differ from these estimates. For further information on accounting estimates, see note 4.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Company's Board of Directors in a meeting held on March 24, 2021.\n\n## 2.2. Discontinued operation\n\nAfter  the  additional  sale  of  the  Company's  interest  in  the  subsidiary  Petrobras  Distribuidora  (BR),  carried  out  through  a secondary public offering (follow-on) in July 2019, Petrobras is no longer the controlling shareholder of BR.\n\nFurthermore, all requirements were met to classify this investment as a discontinued operation, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, since it represented a separate major line of business. Thus, in the consolidated statement of income and cash flows, the net income, operating, investing and financing cash flows relating to BR are presented in separate line items, as a net amount for discontinued operations.\n\n## 2.3. Initial adoption of new accounting standard\n\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted IFRS 16 - Leases. Among the changes arising from IFRS 16, this standard eliminated the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases for lessees, providing for a single lessee accounting model in which all leases result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 16, lease payments under operating leases are not charged to the statement of income as a single expense item on an accrual basis. Instead, depreciation of the right to use a leased asset, as well as the finance expenses and foreign exchange gains or losses over the lease liability, are recognized in the statement of income.\n\nIn the statement of cash flows, the lease payments previously presented within operating and investing activities are presented as financing activities, comprising the settlement of lease liabilities. However, such change does not affect the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\n## 2.4. Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of Petrobras and all of its Brazilian subsidiaries is the Brazilian Real. The functional currency of the Petrobras direct subsidiaries that operate outside Brazil is the U.S. dollar.\n\nPetrobras has selected the U.S. dollar as its presentation currency to facilitate a more direct comparison to other oil and gas companies. The financial statements have been translated from the functional currency (Brazilian real) into the presentation currency (U.S. dollar). All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the closing exchange rate at the date of the financial statements; income and expenses, as well as cash flows are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. All exchange differences arising from the translation of the consolidated financial statements from the functional currency into the presentation currency are recognized as cumulative translation adjustments (CTA) within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity.\n\nDec-20\n\nSep-20\n\nJun-20\n\nMar-20\n\nDec-19\n\nSep-19\n\nJun-19\n\nMar-19\n\nDec-18\n\nSep-18\n\nJun-18\n\nMar-18",

Order of presentation of the explanatory notes\n\nAs  recommended in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, the expectations of users of financial statements regarding the Company's returns depend on their assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of (the prospects for) future  net  cash  inflows  to  the  entity  and  on  their  assessment  of  management's  stewardships  of  the  entity's  economic resources.\n\nTherefore, the order of the explanatory notes align the Company's financial statements with the users' view, in addition to emphasizing the importance of the Company's Strategic Management.\n\nThus, after the explanatory notes presenting the Company and its operations, and those related to the conceptual structure applied in the preparation of the financial statements, it proceeds with the explanatory note on Capital Management, followed by the other notes, separated by the activities as set out on the statement of cash flows.\n\n## 3. Significant accounting policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the annual financial statements of the Company, for the year ended December 31, 2020, are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the financial statements of the previous years. To aid cohesion and comprehension, the accounting policies are set out at the end of each explanatory note.\n\n## 4. Critical accounting policies: key estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial information requires the use of estimates and judgments for certain transactions and  their  impacts  on  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses.  The  assumptions  are  based  on  past  transactions  and  other relevant  information  and  are  periodically  reviewed  by  management,  although  the  actual  results  could  differ  from  these estimates.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and its effects over economic environment were considered in the preparation of these financial statements and the results of the revision of assumptions are presented in note 6.\n\nInformation about areas that require significant judgment or involve a higher degree of complexity in the application of the accounting policies and that could materially affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations is set out as follows.\n\n## 4.1. Oil and gas reserves\n\nOil and gas reserves are estimated based on economic, geological and engineering information, such as well logs, pressure data and  fluid  sample  data.  The  reserves  are  used  as  the  basis  for  calculating  unit-of-production  depreciation,  depletion  and amortization rates, impairment testing and decommissioning costs estimates, and for projections of highly probable future exports subject to the cash flow hedge.\n\nReserves estimates are revised at least annually, based on updated geological and production data of reservoirs, as well as on changes  in  prices  and  costs  used  in  these  estimates.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  the  Company's development strategy or in the production capacity.\n\nThe Company determines its oil and gas reserves both pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - SEC and the ANP/SPE  (Brazilian  Agency  of  Petroleum,  Natural  Gas  and  Biofuels  /  Society  of  Petroleum  Engineers)  criteria.  The  main differences between these criteria relate to the use of different economic premises and to the possibility, under the ANP/SPE criteria, to include volumes expected to be produced after the expiration of contracts related to the Brazilian fields, according to the ANP criteria.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAccording to the definitions prescribed by the SEC, proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscientific and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulation. Proved reserves are subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves.\n\nProved developed oil and gas reserves are those that can be expected to be recovered through: (i) existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, where the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new  well;  (ii)  installed  extraction  equipment  and  infrastructure  operational  at  the  time  of  the  reserves  estimate,  if  the extraction is by means not involving wells.\n\nAlthough the Company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory aspects and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels.\n\nDetailed information on reserves is presented as unaudited supplementary information.\n\n## a) Impacts of oil and gas reserves on depreciation, depletion and amortization\n\nEstimates of proved reserves volumes used in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization rates, under the unitof-production method, are prepared by the Company's technicians according to SEC definitions. Revisions to the Company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves impact prospectively the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortization recognized in the statement of income and the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties assets.\n\nTherefore,  considering  all  other  variables  being  constant,  a  decrease  in  estimated  proved  reserves  would  increase, prospectively, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, while an increase in reserves would reduce depreciation, depletion and amortization.\n\nNote 25.3 provides more detailed information on depreciation, amortization and depletion.\n\n## b) Impacts of oil and gas reserves on impairment testing\n\nThe measurement of the value in use of oil and gas exploration and development assets is based on proved and probable reserves pursuant to the ANP/SPE definitions. Note 25.3 provides further information on impairment testing.\n\n## c) Impacts of oil and gas reserves on decommissioning costs estimates\n\nThe timing of abandonment and dismantling areas is based on the length of reserves depletion, in accordance with ANP/SPE definitions.  Therefore, the review of the timing of reserves depletion may impact the provision for decommissioning cost estimates. Note 4.6 provides further information on other assumptions used in estimating the provision for decommissioning costs.\n\n## d) Impacts of oil and gas reserves on highly probable future exports subject to cash flow hedge accounting\n\nThe Company estimates highly probable future exports in accordance with future exports forecasted in the current Strategic Plan projections. Changes in the expected oil and gas production may affect future exports forecasts and, consequently, hedge relationship designations may also be impacted.\n\n## 4.2. Main assumptions for impairment testing\n\nImpairment testing involves uncertainties mainly related to its key assumptions: average Brent prices and Brazilian Real/U.S. dollar  average exchange rate. These assumptions are relevant to virtually all of the Company's operating segments and a significant  number  of  interdependent  variables  are  derived  from  these  key  assumptions  and  there  is  a  high  degree  of complexity in their application in determining value in use for impairment tests.\n\nThe markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and although prices can drop precipitously, industry prices over the long term tends to continue being driven by market supply and demand fundamentals.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)\n\nProjections relating to the key assumptions are derived from the Strategic Plan and are consistent with market evidence, such as independent macro-economic forecasts, industry analysts and experts. Back testing analysis and feedback process in order to continually improve forecast techniques are also performed.\n\nThe Company's oil price forecast model is based on a nonlinear relationship between variables reflecting market supply and demand fundamentals. This model also takes into account other relevant factors, such as the effects of OPEC decisions on the oil market, industry costs, idle capacity, the oil and gas production forecasted by specialized firms, the relationship between the oil price and the U.S. dollar exchange rate.\n\nThe Real/U.S. dollar exchange rate projections are based on econometric models that take into account long-term assumptions involving observable inputs, such as country risk, commodity prices, interest rates and the value of the U.S.  Dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies (U.S. Dollar Index - USDX).\n\nChanges in the economic environment may result in changing assumptions and, consequently, the recognition of impairment charges or reversals on certain assets or CGUs. For example, the Brent price directly impacts the Company's sales revenue and refining margins, while the Brazilian Real/U.S. dollar exchange rate mainly impacts our capital and operating expenditures.\n\nChanges in the economic and political environment may also result in higher country risk projections that would increase discount rates for impairment testing.\n\nIn addition, changes in reserve volumes, production curve expectations and lifting costs could trigger the need for impairment assessment, as well as capital expenditure decisions, which are also affected by the Company's plan to reduce its leverage, may result in postponement or termination of projects, reducing their economic feasibility.\n\nThe recoverable amount of certain assets may not substantially exceed their carrying amounts and, therefore, it is reasonably possible that outcomes in future periods that are different from the current assumptions may result in the recognition of additional impairment charges on these assets, as described in note 27.1.5.\n\n## 4.3. Identifying cash-generating units for impairment testing\n\nIdentifying cash-generating units (CGUs) requires management assumptions and judgment, based on the Company's business and management model. Changes in the aggregation of assets into CGUs may occur due to a review of investment, strategic or operational factors, which could result in changes in the interdependencies between those assets and, consequently, alter the  aggregation  or  breakdown  of  assets  into  CGUs  or  individual  assets.  Therefore,  this  change  could  result  in  additional impairment charges or reversals. The primary considerations in relation to identifying the CGUs are set out below:\n\n## a) Exploration and Production CGUs:\n\ni) Crude oil and natural gas producing properties CGUs: comprises exploration and development assets related to crude oil and natural gas fields and groups of fields in Brazil and abroad. At December 31, 2020, Exploration and Production CGUs had 132 fields and 30 groups of fields. Changes in the aggregation of CGUs are presented in note 27.\n\nii) Drilling rigs are not part of any CGU and are assessed for impairment separately.\n\n## b) Refining, transportation and marketing CGUs:\n\ni) Downstream CGU: comprises refineries and associated assets, terminals and pipelines, as well as logistics assets operated by Transpetro, with a combined and centralized operation of logistical and refining assets in Brazil.  These assets are managed with a common goal of achieving efficiency, profitability and strategic value long term on a nationwide basis.  They are not operated for the generation of profit by asset/location. The operational planning is made in a centralized manner and these assets are not managed, measured or evaluated by their individual results. The refineries do not have autonomy to choose the oil to be processed, the mix of oil products to produce, the markets in which these products will be traded, which amounts will be exported, which intermediaries will be received and to decide the sale prices of oil products. The operational decisions are analyzed through an integrated model of operational planning for market supply. This model evaluates the solutions to supply the market considering all the options for production, importing, exporting, logistics and inventories seeking a comprehensive optimum for Petrobras and not for the profit of each unit. The decision regarding a new investment is not based on the profitability of the project for the asset where it will be installed, but for Petrobras as a whole. The model that supports the",

Pipelines and terminals are an integral part and interdependent portion of the refining assets, required to supply the market.\n\n- ii) CGU Comperj: comprises assets of the first refining unit of Petrochemical Complex of Rio de Janeiro. The utilities plant that supports the natural gas processing plant (UPGN) of the route 3 integrated project is under construction. This asset is assessed for impairment separately;\n- iii) CGU Second Refining Unit of RNEST: comprises assets of the second refining unit of Abreu e Lima refinery;\n- iv) Transportation CGU: comprises assets relating to Transpetro's fleet of vessels. In 2020, the Cartola and Afaulfo Alves vessels were excluded from this CGU, because they ceased operations, and were tested for impairment separately;\n- v) PANAMAX CGU: comprises Panamax class vessels under construction (EI-512, EI-513 and EI-514);\n\nvi) Hidrovia CGU: comprises the fleet of vessels under construction of the Hidrovia project (transportation of ethanol along the Tiet\u00ea River);\n\nvii) SIX CGU: shale processing plant; and\n\n- viii) Other operations abroad defined as the smallest group of assets that generates independent cash flows.\n\n## c) Gas & Power CGUs:\n\n- i) Natural gas CGU: comprises natural gas pipelines, natural gas processing plants, consolidating the purchase, transportation and treatment of natural gas businesses, in order to enable the commercialization of natural gas and its liquids (LPG, NGL and ethane). In 2020, management decided to cease operations of UPGN Atalaia, which was tested for impairment separately;\n- ii) CGU nitrogen fertilizer plants: the nitrogen fertilizer plants have been assessed for impairment separately;\n- iii) Power CGU: comprises the thermoelectric power generation plants (UTEs);\n- iv) Termocama\u00e7ari CGU: the Termocama\u00e7ari thermoelectric plant was assessed for impairment separately because there is no expectation of future operation;\n- v) Other CGUs: operations abroad defined as the smallest group of assets that generates largely independent cash flows.\n\n## d) Biofuels business CGUs:\n\n- i) Biodiesel CGU: an integrated unit of biodiesel plants defined based on the production planning and operation process, that takes into consideration domestic market conditions, the production capacity of each plant, as well as the results of biofuels auctions and raw materials supply.\n- ii)  Quixad\u00e1 CGU: comprises the assets of Quixad\u00e1 Biofuel Plant. This plant is assessed for impairment separately due to its discontinued operation.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures, including goodwill, are assessed for impairment separately.\n\nFurther information on impairment testing is set out in note 27.\n\n## 4.4.

Estimates related to contingencies and legal proceedings\n\nThe  Company  is  defendant  in  arbitrations  and  in  legal  and  administrative  proceedings  involving  civil,  tax,  labor  and environmental issues arising from the normal course of its business, and makes use of estimates to recognize the amounts and the probability of outflow of resources, based on reports and technical assessments from  legal advisors and on management's assessment.\n\nThese estimates are performed individually, or aggregated if there are cases with similar characteristics, primarily considering factors such as assessment of the plaintiff's demands, consistency of the existing evidence, jurisprudence on similar cases and doctrine on the subject. Specifically for lawsuits by outsourced employees, the Company estimates the expected loss based on a statistical procedure, due to the number of actions with similar characteristics.\n\nArbitral, legal and administrative decisions against the Company, new jurisprudence and changes of existing evidence can result in changes regarding the probability of outflow of resources and on the estimated amounts, according to the assessment of the legal basis.\n\nNote 20 provides further detailed information about contingencies and legal proceedings.\n\n## 4.6. Decommissioning costs estimates\n\nThe Company has legal and constructive obligations to remove equipment and restore onshore and offshore areas at the end of  operations.  Its  most  significant  asset  removal  obligations  relates  to  offshore  areas.  Estimates  of  costs  for  future environmental  cleanup  and  remediation  activities  are  based  on  current  information  about  costs  and  expected  plans  for remediation. These obligations are recognized at present value, using a risk-free discount rate, adjusted to the Company's credit risk. Due to the long term until the abandonment, changes in the discount rate can cause significant variations in the recognized amount.\n\nThese estimates require performing complex calculations that involve significant judgment since: i) the obligations are longterm; ii)the contracts and regulations contain subjective definitions of the removal and remediation practices and criteria involved when the events actually occur; and iii) asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, along with regulations, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.\n\nThe  Company  conducts  studies  to  incorporate  technologies  and  procedures  to  optimize  the  process  of  abandonment, considering  industry  best  practices.  However,  the  timing  and  amounts  of  future  cash  flows  are  subject  to  significant uncertainty.\n\nNote 21 provides further detailed information about the decommissioning provisions.\n\n## 4.7. Deferred income taxes\n\nThe  recognition  of  deferred  taxes  involves  significant  estimates  and  judgments  by  the  Company.  Deferred  tax  assets  are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilized or it is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit in future periods. In evaluating whether it will have sufficient taxable profit in future periods to support the recognition of deferred tax assets, the Company uses future",

Future taxable profits projections are mainly based on the following assumptions: i) Brent crude oil prices; ii) foreign exchange rates; and iii) the Company's projected net finance expenses (income).\n\nChanges in deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented in note 17.\n\n## 4.8. Cash flow hedge accounting involving the Company's future exports\n\nThe Company determines its future exports as 'highly probable future exports' based on its current Strategic Plan. The highly probable future exports are determined by a percentage of projected exports revenue over the mid and long term, taking into account the Company's operational and capital expenditure optimization model, limited to a threshold based on a historical percentage of the oil production that is usually sold abroad. Future exports forecasts are reviewed whenever the Company reviews its Strategic Plan assumptions. The approach for determining exports as highly probable future exports is reviewed annually, at least.\n\nSee note 38.3 for more detailed information about cash flow hedge accounting and a sensitivity analysis of the cash flow hedge involving future exports.\n\n## 4.9. Write-off - overpayments incorrectly capitalized\n\nAs described in note 23, in the third quarter of 2014, the Company developed an estimation methodology and wrote off US$2,527 of capitalized costs representing the estimated amounts that Petrobras had overpaid for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Company has continuously monitored the results of the Lava Jato investigation and the availability of other information related to the scheme of improper payments. In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company  has  not  identified  any  additional  information  that  would  affect  the  adopted  calculation  methodology  and consequently require additional write-offs.\n\n## 4.10. Expected credit losses on financial assets\n\nExpected credit losses on financial assets are based on assumptions relating to risk of default, the determination of whether or  not  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  and  expectation  of  recovery,  among  others.  The  Company  uses judgment for such assumptions in addition to information from credit rating agencies and inputs based on collection delays.\n\n## 4.11. Leases\n\nThe Company uses incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of the lease payments, when the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. These incremental borrowing rates are determined mainly based on the Company's cost of funding based on yields of bonds issued by the Company, adjusted by currency and duration of cash outflows of the lease arrangements, economic environment of the country where the lessee operates and similar collateral.\n\n## 4.12. Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\n\nUncertainties over income tax treatments represent the risks that the tax authority does not accept a certain tax treatment applied  by  the  Company.  The  Company estimates the probability of acceptance of an uncertain tax treatment by the tax authority based on technical assessments by its legal advisors, considering precedent jurisprudence applicable to current tax legislation, which may be impacted mainly by changes in tax rules or court decisions which may affect the analysis of the fundamentals of uncertainty.",

Context, resilience measures and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n## 6.1. Context\n\nIn  January 2020, China reported having identified a new variant of coronavirus, causing the disease COVID-19, which was spreading quickly in its population. On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was a declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Social isolation measures arising from this pandemic affected the global economic environment, reducing the demand for oil and its oil products and triggering a shock in the oil and gas industry.\n\nTherefore, in early April, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing countries (OPEC+) announced a new agreement providing for the cut of their combined production by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for May and June 2020, after Brent prices present a material reduction in March and April, reaching the lowest price of the year (US$ 19.33 per barrel). In another meeting held in July 2020, OPEC+ members agreed to reduce their cuts from 9.7 million",

In December 2020, OPEC+ members decided to reduce their cuts to 7.2 million bpd, mentioning that additional and gradual increases in oil production may occur in the following months.\n\nThese events led the Company to bring forward, in the first quarter of 2020, the approval of a new set of assumptions for oil prices,  exchange rates and demand, since the short, medium and long-term estimates for these variables were no longer compatible with those approved in the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan. This new set of assumptions was reflected in the interim financial statements of the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThe  Company  regularly  monitors  realized  prices  in  relation  to  its  assumptions  and  observed  relevant  changes  in  market conditions compared to that approved in the first quarter of 2020, such as the recovery in Brent oil prices and the devaluation of the Real against the U.S. Dollar. Thus, events led the Company to incorporate, in its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan (approved in November 2020), new projections aiming at adjusting short and medium-term premises, but maintaining the convergence of Brent oil price to US$ 50 per barrel in the long-term.\n\n## 6.2. Resilience measures\n\nThe Company, in line with the recommendations of the WHO and the Ministry of Health, announced measures to preserve the health of its employees and support the prevention of contagion in its administrative and operational areas. Some of the measures includes home office for activities which can be realized remotely; temporarily changed work shifts in operational areas to minimize the number of workers commuting; rigorous cleaning of workplaces; distribution of face masks; testing, tracking  and  quarantine  for  covid-19;  measuring  body  temperature  and  testing  on  pre-shipment  for  oil  platforms  and periodically on onshore plants; health monitoring and access to telemedicine services.\n\nBrazilian governmental authorities, in turn, implemented a set of measures to address the economic side effects of the COVID19 pandemic, aimed at helping the productive sector, mainly: (a) Federal Government measures - (i) PIS/Cofins and INSSCompanies' Contribution - collections for the period from March to May 2020 were postponed to August until November 2020; (ii) FGTS - collections for the period from March to May 2020 were paid in six installments from July to December 2020; (iii) System S (employer contributions to social entities that train and support employees)  - 50% reduction in rates from April to June 2020; and (iv) IOF - reduction from 3% to 0% in operations carried out from April to December 2020; and (b) State of Pernambuco measures - (i) ICMS tax on fuel imports from April to December 2020 was deferred for up to 30 days.\n\nAs a result of the abrupt reduction in the demand and prices of oil and fuel, the Company adopted a set of measures aiming at reducing costs, postponing cash outflows and optimizing its working capital. The main measures are:\n\n- \u00b7 Draw down of revolving credit lines, amounting to US$ 8 billion, as well as other lines in the domestic banking market, in the total amount of US$ 698, in the first quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company repaid US$ 7.6 billion of revolving credit lines (see note 34).\n- \u00b7 postponement of payment of declared dividends based on 2019 earnings, paid on December 15, 2020;\n- \u00b7 postponement of judicial deposits to 2021, mainly relating to tax proceedings;\n- \u00b7 reduction and postponement of human resources expenses, with an emphasis on: (i) postponement of payment for the 2019 Performance Award Program to December 2020; (ii) postponement of the payment of 30% of the total monthly remuneration from April to June 2020 of the Board of Directors, President, Executive Officers and upper management, and postponement of the payment of between 10% to 30% of the monthly remuneration of lower management and consultants (which was subsequently paid in September 2020); and (iii) temporary change in workday regime from shift turn and standby work to administrative regime, reassessed on a monthly basis, depending on the return to regular operations;\n- \u00b7 a set of actions aiming at reducing capital expenditures scheduled for 2020 from US$ 12 billion to US$ 8.1 billion, mainly postponement of exploratory activities and interconnection of wells, as well as the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar;\n- \u00b7 reduction of 200 thousand bpd of oil production from April 2020 (including the reduction of 100 thousand bpd announced at the end of March 2020), and a reduction in the utilization factor of refineries from 79% to 60%, allowing the maintenance of reasonable surplus in the storage capacity, aiming at avoiding the adoption of costly measures such as the chartering of ships to store liquids.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nCompany opted for the gradual return to the previous level of average oil production, accompanied by an increase in the utilization factor of the refining facilities;\n\n- \u00b7 a set of actions intending to decrease operating expenses for 2020 by an additional US$ 2 billion, mainly by: (i) hibernation of platforms operating in shallow waters, which have higher lifting costs per barrel, and for which, due to the drop in oil prices, the Company estimates negative cash flows; (ii) lowering expenses with stoppages in wells and optimization of production logistics; and (iii) postponement of new relevant contracts for a period of 90 days (during the second quarter of 2020); and\n- \u00b7 as a result of the structural reduction in the demand for natural gas in the Brazilian market, with the consequent declaration of  force  majeure  by  all  local  natural  gas  distributors,  the  Company  declared  force  majeure  in  the  agreements  for  the purchase of natural gas from the Manati field and from Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), as provided for in these contracts. These measures resulted in a reduction of potential disputes, exempting the Company from complying with  the  take-or-pay  obligations.  In  September  2020,  with  the  resumption  of  consumption  from  our  customers,  both contracts were resumed in their normal supply conditions.\n\nIn addition, the global adverse scenario encouraged the Company to revise its main metric relating to indebtedness, contained in the Strategic Plan 2020-2024, replacing the Net debt / Adjusted EBITDA ratio with Gross debt. The target approved for Gross debt for 2020 is US$ 87 billion, the same level as December 31, 2019, which was achieved at December 31, 2020.\n\nAs a result of the implementation of the aforementioned measures, the Company, after simulating several stress scenarios, estimates that it will be able to balance its financing and cash flows. Thus, management believes that it has adequate resources to continue its operations for at least 12 months after the reporting date and, therefore, the Company comply with the going concern principle in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 6.3. Effects on these consolidated financial statements\n\nThe  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  economic  environment  were  considered  in  the  preparation  of  these consolidated financial statements. For information on key estimates and judgments that require a high level of judgment and complexity in their applications and that could materially affect the Company's financial condition and results, see note 4.\n\nThe results of the revision of assumptions (both in the first quarter of 2020 and in the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan), as well as the effects arising from the pandemic, are presented below:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment losses for 2020 amounted to US$ 7,339. Oil prices and expectations for the world economy growth presented a consistent decline in 2020, since the end of March 2020, as well as the demand for oil products was also severely affected in this period. As a result, in the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted a new set of assumptions adjusted from those approved in the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan, as well as decided to hibernate certain developed fields which management did not considered highly profitable. Thus, impairment losses were recognized in the first quarter of 2020 in the amount of US$ 13,371. In the last quarter of 2020, the Company approved its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, updating expected future production, project portfolio, economic assumptions, among other estimates. In this context, impairment reversals were accounted for in the last quarter, in the amount of US$ 6,019 (see note 27);\n- \u00b7 expected exports were impacted by the effects arising from the oil price shock in the first half of 2020 and effects arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, a portion of highly probable future exports whose exchange rate variations were designated  in  hedge  relationships  are  no  longer  considered  highly  probable,  but  are  still  expected  to  occur,  and  as  a consequence the hedge relationships were revoked in the first quarter of 2020, in the amount of US$ 35,774, significantly increasing the Company's U.S. dollar/real exposure at March 31, 2020. According to the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, there is an increase in expected exports compared to the expectation in the first quarter and consequently in highly probable future exports, but not in an amount equal to or greater than the finance debt and lease liabilities subject to designation as hedge instruments. As a result, the relevant increase in Dollar/Real exposure observed during 2020 remains at December 31, 2020. In 2020, US$ 548 was reclassified from Other comprehensive income to the Statement of income, mainly in the first quarter of 2020 (note 38.3);\n- \u00b7 inventories adjusted to net realizable value, accounting for a US$ 375 loss within cost of sales (note 15);",

For  financial  assets  whose counterparties have ratings published by credit risk agencies, when already reflecting the effects of the pandemic, the information was used to calculate the ECL. For other financial assets, in general, the expected effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were incorporated into the ECL by identifying the changes in default probability based on observable data by area of operation, type of product and region. No significant effects were identified (note 14.3);\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets were assessed for recoverability based on projections of future taxable profits (note 17);\n- \u00b7 with the approval of the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, new estimates of oil and gas reserves were incorporated to reflect the update on the Company's project portfolio, the technical uncertainties and the updated assumptions such as prices and costs. Therefore, the provision for decommissioning costs was adjusted by US$ 5,720 (note 21);\n- \u00b7 revenue recognition from contracts with customers had no changes in its assumptions. The expectation of satisfaction of the obligation by the customer remains at the maturity of each operation, considered highly probable. The Company's customers gave no indication about the intent to breach or revise the terms and conditions of contracts in effect as of December 31, 2020; and\n- \u00b7 the Company's litigation includes no cases related to COVID-19 with potential financial risk that directly impact this financial information. However, the Company is aware of some recent labor actions filed by certain unions, whose claims are related to  the  pandemic  and  the  resilience  measures  recently  announced  to  reduce  expenses,  as  follows:  (i)  two  temporary measures to contain personnel expenses; (ii) sufficiency of the preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 and the criteria used for removing people from the risk group; and (iii) the union's participation in the organizational response structure.  The best estimate for these claims as of the reporting date is that the likelihood of loss is not probable.\n\n## 7. Capital Management\n\nThe Company's objectives in its capital management is to achieve an adequate level of return on its capital structure in order to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, adding value to its shareholders and investors. Its main sources of funding have been cash provided by its operating activities and divestments.\n\nThe reduction in the cost of capital, by means of its liability management, is one of the pillars of the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan. The Company aims to mitigate risks by actively managing liabilities, maximizing shareholder return and optimizing working capital.\n\nGross debt (composed of finance debt and lease liability, current and non-current) is a top metric for the Company, allowing monitoring Petrobras's indebtedness, which management considers essential for increasing competitiveness with peers by reducing  our  cost  of  capital.  For  2021,  the  Company  seeks  to  reduce  its  gross  debt  to  US$ 67  billion.  In  addition,  the Shareholders Dividends Policy determines that, in case of a gross debt lower than US$ 60 billion (which is targeted for 2022), it  may  distribute  60%  of  the  difference  between  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  and  acquisition  of  PP&E  and intangibles assets, as set out in note 36.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, gross debt decreased to US$ 75,538, from US$ 87,121 as of December 31, 2019.",

These financial investments have maturities of more than three months and are generally classified as current assets due to their maturity or the expectation of their realization in the short term.\n\n## 8.3.1. Accounting policy for marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are initially measured at fair value and their subsequent measurement depends on their classification:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortized cost: when the contractual terms of the security give rise on specified dates to cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, and the business model's objective is to hold the security in order to collect contractual cash flows. The interest income is based on the effective interest method.\n- \u00b7 Fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income:  equity  instruments  not  held  for  trading  purposes  for  which  the Company  has  made  an  irrevocable  election  in  their  initial  recognition  to  present  changes  in  fair  value  in  other comprehensive income rather than within profit or loss;",

Sales revenues\n\n## 9.1. Revenues from contracts with customers\n\nAs  an  integrated  energy  company,  revenues  from  contracts  with  customers  derive  from  different  products  sold  by  the Company's operating segments, taking  into  consideration  specific  characteristics  of  the  markets  where  they  operate.  For additional information about the operating segments of the Company, its activities and its respective products sold, see note 13.\n\nThe determination of transaction prices derives from methodologies and policies based on the parameters of these markets, reflecting operating risks, level of market share, changes in exchange rates and international commodity prices, including Brent oil prices, oil products such as diesel and gasoline, and the Henry Hub Index.\n\nRevenues from sales are recognized at the moment the control is transferred to the client, that occurs upon delivery at the contractually agreed place or when the service is provided. Generally, prices for products and services are fixed prior to or shortly after delivery. Therefore, no significant changes in transactions prices are expected to be recognized in periods after the  satisfaction  of  the  performance  obligations,  except  for  some  exports  in  which  final  prices  are  linked  to  changes  in commodity price after their transfer of control. Sales proceeds are generally collected in the short-term, thus there are no significant financing components.\n\nIn addition, the Company acts as an agent in the biofuel business, where there is no control of the biodiesel purchased from the producers and sold to distributors at any time during the sale operation. Those revenues totaled US$ 37 in 2020 (US$ 46 in 2019).\n\n## 9.2.

These requests are substantially affected by Brazilian hydrological conditions. Thus, the table above presents mainly fixed amounts for the electricity to be available to customers in these operations.\n\n## 9.4. Contract liabilities\n\nThe balance of contract liabilities carried on the statement of financial position at December 31, 2020 amounted to US$ 69 (US$ 128 as of December 31, 2019). This amount is classified as other current liabilities and primarily comprises advances from customers in ship and take or pay contracts to be recognized as revenue based on future sales of natural gas or following the non-exercise of the right by the customer.\n\n## 9.5. Accounting policy for revenues\n\nThe Company evaluates contracts with customers that will be subject to revenue recognition and identifies the distinct goods and services promised in each of them.\n\nPerformance obligations are promises to transfer to the customer goods or services (or a bundle of goods or services) that are distinct, or series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.",

This  information  is presented by business activity, as used by the Company's Board of Executive Officers (Chief Operating Decision Maker - CODM) on the decision-making process of resource allocation and performance evaluation.\n\nThe  measurement  of  segment  results  includes  transactions  carried  out  with  third  parties,  including  associates  and  joint ventures,  as  well  as  transactions  between  operating  segments.  Transfers  between  operating  segments  are  recognized  at internal transfer prices derived from methodologies that take into account market parameters and are eliminated only to provide reconciliations to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company's business segments disclosed separately are:\n\nExploration and Production (E&P): this segment covers the activities of exploration, development and production of crude oil, NGL (natural gas liquid) and natural gas in Brazil and abroad, for the primary purpose of supplying its domestic refineries.

These transactions are measured by internal transfer prices based on international oil prices and their respective exchange rate impacts, taking into account the specific characteristics of the transferred oil stream.\n\nIn addition, the E&P segment revenues include transfers of natural gas to the natural gas processing plants within Gas and Power  segment.  These  transactions  are  measured  at  internal  transfer  prices  based  on  the  international  prices  of  this commodity.\n\nRevenue from sales to third parties mainly reflects services rendered relating to E&P activities, sales of the E&P's natural gas processing plants, as well as the oil and natural gas operations carried out by subsidiaries abroad.\n\nRefining, Transportation and Marketing (RT&M): this segment covers the refining, logistics, transport and trading of crude oil and oil products activities in Brazil and abroad, as well as exports of ethanol. This segment also includes the petrochemical operations, such as extraction and processing of shale and holding interests in petrochemical companies in Brazil.\n\nThis segment carries out the acquisition of crude oil from the E&P segment, imports oil for refinery slate, and acquires oil products in international markets taking advantage of the existing price differentials between the cost of processing domestic oil and that of importing oil products.\n\nIntersegment  revenues  primarily  reflect  the  sale  of  oil  products  for  the  distribution  segment  at  market  prices  and  the operations for the Gas and Power and E&P segments at internal transfer price.\n\nRevenues from sales to third parties primarily reflect the trading of oil products in Brazil and the export and trade of oil and oil products by foreign subsidiaries.\n\nGas and Power: this  segment covers the activities of logistic and trading of natural gas and electricity, transportation and trading of LNG (liquefied natural gas), generation and electricity by means of thermoelectric power plants, as well as holding interests  in  transporters  and  distributors  of  natural  gas  in  Brazil  and  abroad.  It  also  includes  natural  gas  processing  and fertilizers production.\n\nIntersegment revenues primarily reflect the transfers of natural gas processed, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and NGL to RT&M. These transactions are measured at internal transfer prices.\n\nThis segment purchases national natural gas from the E&P segment, from partners and third parties, imports natural gas from Bolivia and LNG to meet national demand.\n\nRevenues from sales to third parties primarily reflect natural gas processed to distributors, as well as generation and trading of electricity.\n\nCorporate and other businesses comprise items that cannot be attributed to the other segments, as well as distribution and biofuels businesses. Corporate items comprise those related to corporate financial management, corporate overhead and other expenses, including actuarial expenses related to the pension and medical benefits for retired employees and their dependents. Distribution business reflects the interest in the associate BR Distribuidora (investments and results in equityaccounted  investments),  as  well  as  the  distribution  of  oil  products  abroad  (South  America).  From  2018  to  July 2019,  for comparative  purposes,  it  also  includes  net  income  from  discontinued  operations.  Biofuels  business  reflects  production activities of biodiesel, its co-products and ethanol.",

In 2019, the write-offs primarily relate to the termination of a lawsuit relating to the electricity sector.\n\n## 14.4. Accounting policy for trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are generally classified at amortized cost, except for certain receivables classified at fair value through profit or loss, whose cash flows are distinct from the receipt of principal and interest, including receivables with final prices linked to changes in commodity price after their transfer of control.\n\nWhen the Company is the lessor in a finance lease, a receivable is recognized at the amount of the net investment in the lease, consisting of the lease payments receivable and any unguaranteed residual value accruing to the Company,   discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease.\n\nThe Company measures expected credit losses for short-term trade receivables using a provision matrix based on historical observed default rates adjusted by current and forward-looking information when applicable and available without undue cost or effort.\n\nThe Company measures the allowance for expected credit losses of other trade receivables based on their 12-month expected credit losses unless their credit risk has increased significantly since their initial recognition, in which case the allowance is based on their lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Company compares the risk of default on initial recognition and at the reporting date.\n\nRegardless  of  the  assessment  of  significant  increase  in  credit  risk,  a  delinquency  period  of  30  days  past  due  triggers  the definition  of  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  on  a  financial  asset,  unless  otherwise  demonstrated  by  reasonable  and supportable information.\n\nThe Company assumes that the credit risk on the trade receivable has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the receivable is considered to have low credit risk at the reporting date. Low credit risk is determined based on external credit ratings or internal methodologies.\n\nIn the absence of controversy or other issues that may result in the suspension of collection, the Company assumes that a default occurs whenever the counterparty does not comply with the legal obligation to pay its debts when due or, depending on the instrument, when it is at least 90 days past due.\n\nThe measurement of expected credit loss comprises the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate weighted by the probability of default.",

Accounting policy for inventories\n\nInventories are determined by the weighted average cost method adjusted to the net realizable value when it is lower than its carrying amount.\n\nNet  realizable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  of  inventory  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less  estimated  cost of  completion  and estimated expenses to complete its sale. Changes in sales prices after the reporting date of the financial statements are considered in the calculation of the net realizable value if they confirm the conditions existing on that reporting date.\n\nCrude oil and LNG inventories can be traded or used for production of oil products.\n\nIntermediate  products  are  those  product  streams  that  have  been  through  at  least  one  of  the refining  processes,  but still  need  further treatment, processing or converting to be available for sale.\n\nBiofuels mainly include ethanol and biodiesel inventories.\n\nMaterials, supplies and others mainly comprise production supplies and operating materials used in the operations of the Company, stated at the average purchase cost, not exceeding replacement cost.",

They also arise on the acquisition of assets for property, plant and equipment, which are offset in a straight line over 4 years.\n\nCurrent and non-current PIS/COFINS credits mainly refer to the acquisition of goods and services for assets under construction, since their use is permitted only after these assets enter into production, as well as to extemporaneous tax credits.\n\nProduction taxes are financial compensation due to the Brazilian Federal Government by companies that explore and produce oil and natural gas in Brazilian territory. They are composed of royalties, special participations, signature bonuses and payment for retention or occupation of area.",

        "page_content": "## 17.2. Exclusion of ICMS (VAT tax) from the basis of calculation of PIS and COFINS\n\nIn 2020, the Company obtained a favorable and definitive court decision regarding the exclusion of ICMS (VAT tax) in the basis of calculation of sales taxes PIS and COFINS, recognizing US$ 3,226 (R$ 16,764 million) as other recoverable taxes. These sales taxes credits refer to the ICMS included in the basis of calculation of PIS and COFINS, from October 2001 to August 2020, inappropriately paid during this period.\n\nThe Company recognized this credit as the realization of income was virtually certain and the inflow of economic benefits was highly probable, since: (i) the final decision in 2020 (with no possibility of appeal) constitutes a right that is no longer contingent at the date of that decision; and (ii) the measurement methodology adopted is accepted by the Federal Revenue of Brazil, resulting in an amount to be recovered by the Company.\n\nThus, a US$ 2,050 gain for the recovery of taxes was accounted for within other income and expenses, a US$ 1,516 gain for the inflation indexation within net finance income (expense). In addition, the Company accounted for an US$ 78 expense within other taxes and an US$ 1,097 expense within income taxes.\n\nIn 2020, the Company compensated US$ 1,857 (R$ 10,372 million) on the payment of federal taxes. As of December 31, 2020, the unused credit, updated by the SELIC interest rate, amounts to US$ 1,230 (R$ 6,392 million).\n\n## Recovery of PIS and COFINS\n\nThe Company filed civil lawsuits against the Brazilian Federal Government claiming to recover PIS and COFINS paid over finance income and foreign exchange variation gains, from February 1999 to January 2004.\n\nThe court granted to the Company, in all the lawsuits, the definitive right to recover those taxes, but it requires previous examination and approval by the court of the settlement reports (court-ordered liquidation stage). In 2017, there were a settlement reports issued in favor of the Company relating to the most significant amount to be recovered. However, final approvals by the court are still pending.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had non-current receivables of US$ 681 (US$ 820 as of December 31, 2019) related to PIS and COFINS, which are indexed to inflation.",

The disbursement was made in installments, having been fully settled, in accordance with the 2020 Terms of Adjustment of Tax Conduct entered into with the State of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n## State of Esp\u00edrito Santo\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the adhesion to a remission and amnesty program with the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo, entered into under the terms of the ICMS Agreement 146/2019 and Decree 4,709-R / 2020, payment of US$ 35 in  October 2020, to settle tax claims arising from differences in the appropriation of ICMS credits on property, plant and equipment and from differences in ICMS in oil and oil products operations. In addition, the presumed ICMS credit system was implemented, based on the ICMS the agreement, providing a definitive solution to this dispute.\n\n## 17.4.

Timing of reversal of deferred income taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets were recognized based on projections of taxable profit in future periods supported by the Company's 20212025 Strategic Plan, aiming at the maximization of returns on capital employed, reduction of cost of capital and search for low costs and efficiencies.\n\nManagement considers that the deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent the deferred tax liabilities are reversed and expected taxable events occur based on its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan.\n\nThe estimated schedule of recovery/reversal of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2020 is set out in the following table:\n\n|                                | Assets   |   Liabilities |\n|--------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| 2021                           | 2,257    |            49 |\n| 2022                           | 975      |            21 |\n| 2023                           | 764      |            20 |\n| 2024                           | 15       |            19 |\n| 2025                           | 14       |            44 |\n| 2026  and thereafter           | 2,426    |            42 |\n| Recognized deferred tax assets | 6,451    |           195 |\n\nIn addition, at December 31, 2020, the Company has tax loss carryforwards arising from offshore subsidiaries, for which no deferred taxes were recognized.\n\n|                                  | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|----------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Brazil                           | 35       | 2             |\n| Abroad                           | 1,369    | -             |\n| Unrecognized deferred tax assets | 1,404    | 2             |\n| Total                            | 7,855    | 197           |\n\nThese  tax  losses  arose  mainly  from  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  and  refining  activities  in  the  United  States  of US$ 1,295 (US$ 1,346 as of December 31, 2019).\n\nAn aging of the unrecognized deferred tax assets from companies abroad is set out below:\n\n|                                  |   2026 - 2028 |   2029 - 2031 |   2032 - 2034 |   2035 -2037 |   Undefined  expiration | Total   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| Unrecognized deferred tax assets |           205 |           708 |           320 |           62 |                      74 | 1,369   |\n\n## 17.7. Accounting policy for income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense for the period includes current and deferred taxes, recognized in the statement of income of the period, except when the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognized directly in equity. Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes based on the rates of 25% for income tax (IRPJ) and 9% for social contribution on net income (CSLL), and the offsetting of the carryforward of credit losses and negative basis of CSLL, limited to 30% of taxable income for the year. Since 2015, income tax expenses on profits arising from subsidiaries abroad are recognized as established by Law No. 12,973 / 2014.\n\n## 17.7.1. Current income taxes\n\nCurrent income taxes are computed based on taxable profit for the year, determined in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.",

Deferred income taxes\n\nDeferred income taxes are recognized on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount. They are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carryforward of unused tax losses or credits  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which  those  deductible  temporary differences can be utilized. When there are insufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, a deferred tax is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit in future periods, based on projections approved by management and supported by the Company's Strategic Plan.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied on the same taxable entity, when a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities exists and when the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity.",

Among the offshore employees, only one union had signed the agreement within the period defined by the ACT.\n\nThe current agreement for the PLR provides that only employees without managerial functions will be entitled to receive profit sharing, and it will be cumulative to the payment of the PPP.\n\nIn order for the PLR to be paid in the next two years, the following requirements must be met: (i) dividend distribution to shareholders approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) net income for the year, and iii) achievement of the weighted average percentage of at least 80% of a set of indicators.\n\nThe  maximum  amount  of  PLR  to  be  distributed  is  limited  to  6.25%  of  net  income  and  25%  of  dividends  distributed  to shareholders, in each year. There was no PLR expense for 2020 (US$ 43 for 2019 and US$ 442 for 2018).",

AMS Medical Plan\n\nThe Company maintains a healthcare plan for its employees in Brazil (active and retired) and their dependents: the AMS Medical Plan. The plan is managed by the Company and includes health prevention and health care programs. The plan is mainly exposed to the risk of an increase in medical costs due to new technologies, new types of coverage and to a higher level of usage of medical benefits. The Company continuously improves the quality of its technical and administrative processes, as well as the health programs offered to beneficiaries in order to mitigate such risks.\n\nThe employees make fixed monthly contributions to cover high-risk procedures and variable contributions for a portion of the cost  of  the  other  procedures,  both  based  on  the  contribution  tables  of  the  plan,  which  are  determined  based  on  certain parameters, such as salary and age levels. The plan also includes assistance towards the purchase of certain medicines through reimbursement, with co-participation of the employees. There are no health care plan assets.\n\nBenefits are paid by the Company based on the costs incurred by the participants. The financial participation of the Company and the beneficiaries on the expenses are provided for in the collective bargaining agreement, as follows:\n\n- i) Until 2020, this benefit was covered 70% by the Company and 30% by the participants;\n- ii) As from January 2021, this benefit will be covered 60% by the Company and 40% by the participants;\n- iii) As of January 2022, this benefit will be covered 50% by the Company and 50% by the participants, in compliance to the Resolution No. 23 of Commission for Corporate Governance and Administration of Participations of the Brazilian Federal Government (CGPAR).\n\nIn  case  of  a  change  or  revocation  of  CGPAR  Resolution  No.  23,  as  a  result  of  legal  acts  issued  by  the  Brazilian  Federal Government or the Brazilian Congress, the Company pre-agreed with the unions that the proportion will remain 60%- 40%, until further adjustment between the parties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, considering that changes in the AMS Plan costing proportion brought by the current collective bargaining agreement led to a change in the liabilities, the Company recognized a US$ 2,538 gain relating to past service cost, of which a portion was recognized in service cost (related to active participants) and other portion was recognized in other income and expenses (related to assisted and retired participants).\n\nThe average duration of the actuarial liability related to this plan, already considering the changes on the participation of the Company and the participants, as of December 31, 2020, is 15.26 years (21.64 as of December 31, 2019).",

        "page_content": "## 19.1.1. New healthcare management model\n\nOn April 28, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new management model for AMS. The management of this plan will now be carried out by a nonprofit civil association, nominated Petrobras Sa\u00fade, also through the self-management type,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  National  Supplementary  Health  Agency  ( Ag\u00eancia  Nacional  de  Sa\u00fade Suplementar - ANS).\n\nThis change will generate no change in benefit, coverage or scope on the plan, as well as no accounting effects.\n\nCurrently, the association is in the process of obtaining the required qualifications and registers for its operation, with an expected implementation of the new model in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n## 19.2. Pension plans\n\nThe Company's post-retirement plans are managed by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Petrobras de Seguridade Social (Petros Foundation), which was established by Petrobras as a nonprofit legal entity governed by private law with administrative and financial autonomy.\n\n## 19.2.1. Renegotiated and Non-renegotiated Petros Plans (PPSP-R and PPSP-NR)\n\nThese plans were established by Petrobras in July 1970 (originally solely Petros Plan) as a defined-benefit pension plan, in order to complement government social security benefits. The Petros Plan is closed to new participants since September 2002.\n\nPetros Foundation performs an annual actuarial review of its costs using the capitalization method for most benefits. The employers (sponsors) make regular contributions in amounts equal to the contributions of the participants (active employees, assisted  employees  and  retired  employees),  on  a  parity  basis.  Exceptionally  in  2020,  there  was  also  an  intermediate remeasurement of the actuarial liabilities for these plans, following the approval of the New PED.\n\n## New Deficit Settlement Plan (New PED)\n\nOn April 28, 2020, the New Deficit Settlement Plan for the PPSP-R and PPSP-NR (New PED) was approved by the Secretariat of Management and Governance of the State-owned Companies (SEST) and by the Superintendency of Post-retirement Benefits (PREVIC), also approving changes in regulation regarding the reduction of the lump sum death benefit.\n\nThe New PED covers 2015 and 2018 deficits and incorporates 2019 results. Total settlement amounts to US$ 6,485 (R$ 33.7 billion). Of the total amount, US$ 3,006 (R$ 15,620 million) will be paid by Petrobras, in compliance with contributory parity provided  for  by  relevant  legislation,  of  which  US$ 2,611  (R$ 13,566  million)  will  be  paid  through  lifelong  additional contributions and US$ 395 (R$ 2,054 million) as a counterpart contribution for the reduction of the lump sum death benefit.\n\nThis counterpart contribution will be paid in 40 semiannual installments for a period of 20 years, updated based on the fixed actuarial target of the plans, revised annually. As of December 31, 2020, the updated balance of this Company's obligation amounted to US$ 444 (R$ 2,206 million).\n\nThe rest of the deficit will be paid by other sponsors and participants of the PPSP-R and PPSP-NR plans.\n\nThe  current  model  differs  from  that  applied  in  PED-2015,  aiming  at  reducing  the  additional  contributions  of  most  of  the participants by: (i) extending the collection time from 18 years to a lifetime; (ii) specific fixed contribution rates for active and assisted employees; (iii) the implementation of an annual contribution of 30% on the 13th salary; and (iv) the reduction in the amount of the lump sum death benefit.\n\nThe New PED sets forth changes in some rights and regulation of the PPSP-R and PPSP-NR, in accordance with Resolution No. 25 of CGPAR, which establishes guidelines and parameters for federal state companies regarding the sponsorship of pension plans.\n\nIn May 2020, following the approval of the New PED and based on relevant regulation, the Company made an intermediate remeasurement of the actuarial liabilities of the PPSP-R and PPSP-NR plans, with a US$ 10 gain in profit or loss, as a net effect of a US$ 374 gain for the reduction on the lump sum death benefit, as well as other changes in the regulation of these plans, partially offset by a US$ 364 loss related to the contribution for the settlement of the deficit.",

As of December 31, 2020, the Company has provided crude oil and oil products pledged as security for the TFC totaling US$ 2,750 (US$ 3,525 as of December 31, 2019). The TFC is accounted for in the pension and medical benefits liabilities, within the statement of financial position.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, the Company prepaid the remaining balance of TFC relating to Pre-70 plans, in the amount of US$ 865 (R$ 4,493 million), of which U$ 468 relates to the PPSP-R Pre-70 and US$ 397 to the PPSP-NR Pre-70.

The plan asset portfolio must comply with the rules defined by the Brazilian National Monetary Council.\n\nThe Company uses the ATM - Asset and Liability Management model to resolve mismatches in the net cash flow of the benefit plans managed by Petros Foundation, considering parameters of liquidity and solvency, adopting a 30-year horizon in the simulations.",

Plano Petros 3 (PP-3)\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the submission of the PP-3 for analysis by the Secretariat of Management and Governance of the State-owned Companies (SEST) and to the Superintendency of Post-retirement benefits (PREVIC).\n\nThe PP-3 is a new pension plan with defined contribution characteristics and will be an exclusive option for voluntary migration of participants from the PPSP-R and PPSP-NR plans, not including pre-70.\n\nThe mentioned agencies have approved this plan after adjustments on its regulation, and is expected to begin operating in the second quarter of 2021. Then, the Company will carry out an actuarial review of the original plans to determine the effect of the past service cost, resulting from the reduction of such plans, to be accounted for in the Statement of income.\n\n## 19.5. Accounting policy for post-employment defined benefits\n\nActuarial commitments related to post-employment defined benefit plans and health-care plans are recognized as liabilities in the statement of  financial  position  based  on  actuarial  calculations  which  are  revised  annually  by  an  independent qualified  actuary  (updating  for  material changes in actuarial assumptions and estimates of expected future benefits), using the projected unit credit method, net of the fair value of plan  assets,  when  applicable,  from  which  the  obligations  are  to be  directly  settled. Under the projected  credit  unit  method,  each  period  of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to determine the final obligation. Actuarial assumptions include demographic assumptions,  financial  assumptions,  medical  costs  estimates,  historical  data  related  to  benefits  paid  and  employee contributions.\n\nService cost are accounted for within results and comprises: (i) current service cost, which is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current period; (ii) past service cost, which is the change in the present value of the defined  benefit  obligation  for  employee  service  in  prior  periods,  resulting  from  a  plan amendment  (the  introduction,  modification,  or withdrawal of a defined benefit plan) or a curtailment (a significant reduction by the entity in the number of employees covered by a plan); and (iii) any gain or loss on settlement.\n\nNet  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  is  the  change  during  the  period  in  the  net  defined  benefit liability  (asset)  that  arises from the passage of time. Such interest is accounted for in results.\n\nRemeasurement  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  is  recognized  in  shareholders'  equity,  in  other  comprehensive income,  and comprises:  (i)  actuarial  gains  and  losses  and;  (ii)  the  return  on  plan  assets,  excluding  amounts  included in  net  interest on  the  net  defined benefit liability (asset).\n\nThe Company also contributes amounts to defined contribution plans, that are expensed when incurred and are computed based on a percentage of salaries.",

On August 13, 2018, the  selected Rapporteur confirmed the decision of the president minister and extended its effects to the ongoing actions on the  matter, suspending all cases relating to this subject. | 6,679        | 7,732                  |\n| 2) Other labor matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1,500        | 2,002                  |\n| Total for labor matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 8,179        | 9,734                  |",

Class action in Netherlands\n\nOn January 23, 2017, the Stichting Petrobras Compensation Foundation ('Foundation') filed a class action before the district court in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, against Petrobras parent company and Petrobras International Braspetro B.V. (PIBBV), Petrobras Global Finance B.V. (PGF), Petrobras Oil & Gas B.V. (PO&G) and some former managers of Petrobras.\n\nThe Foundation allegedly represents the interests of an unidentified group of investors and alleges that based on the facts uncovered by the Lava Jato investigation the defendants acted unlawfully towards investors. Based on the allegations, the Foundation seeks a number of declaratory relieves from the Dutch court.\n\nThe Company filed their first response to the claim on May 3, 2017 (first docket date), presenting the law firms that will defend these companies and requesting a hearing to discuss some aspects of the case.\n\nOn August 23, 2017, a hearing was held at the District Court in Rotterdam ('Court') to establish the timeframe for proceedings. Petrobras (and other defendants) presented preliminary defenses on November 29, 2017 and the Foundation presented its response on March 28, 2018. On June 28, 2018, a hearing was held for the parties to present oral arguments. On September 19, 2018, the Court rendered its interim decision in the motion proceedings in which it accepted jurisdiction in most of 7 claims of the Foundation, without any assessment on the merits of the case.\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the Court determined that shareholders who understand Portuguese and / or who bought shares through intermediaries or other agents who understand that language, among other shareholders, are subject to the arbitration clause provided for in the Company's Bylaws, remaining out of the collective action proposed by the Foundation. The Court also considered the binding effect of the agreement signed to close the United States' Class action. In this way, the Foundation needs to demonstrate that it represents a sufficient number of investors to justify pursuing collective action in the Netherlands. The Foundation and the Company presented the oral arguments at a hearing held on January 26, 2021.\n\nThis collective action involves complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and depend on a number of factors such as the standing of the Foundation as the alleged representative of the investors' interests, the applicable rules to this complaint,  the  information  produced  the  evidentiary  phase  of  the  proceedings,  analysis  by  experts,  the  timing  of  court decisions and rulings by the court on key issues, and the Foundation only seeks declaratory reliefs in this collective action. Currently,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  if  the  Company  will  be  found  responsible  for  the  payment  of  compensation  in subsequent  individual  complaints  after  this  action  as  this  assessment  depends  on  the  outcome  of  these  complex  issues. Moreover, it is uncertain which investors will be able to file subsequent individual complaints related to this matter against the Company.\n\nIn addition, the allegations asserted are broad, span a multi-year period and involve a wide range of activities, and, at the current stage, the impacts of such allegations are highly uncertain. The uncertainties inherent in all such matters affect the amount and timing of the ultimate resolution of these actions. As a result, the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of  eventual  loss  arising  from  this  action.  The  company  is  victim  of  the  corruption  scheme  uncovered  by  the  Lava  Jato investigation and aims to present and prove this before the Dutch Court.\n\nThe uncertainties inherent in all such matters do not enable the company to identify possible risks related to this action. Compensation  for  the  alleged  damages  will  only  be  determined  by  court  rulings  on  complaints  to  be  filed  by  individual investors. The Foundation is not able to demand compensation for damages.\n\nThe Company denies the allegations presented by the Foundation and intend to defend themselves vigorously.\n\n## 20.4.2. Arbitrations in Brazil\n\nPetrobras  is  also  currently  a  party  to  seven  arbitrations  proceedings  before  the  Market  Arbitration  Chamber  ( C\u00e2mara de Arbitragem do Mercado - CAM), linked to the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3), brought by investors who purchased Petrobras' shares traded on B3. Six of these arbitrations were initiated by national and foreign investors. The other proceeding was brought  by  an  association  that  is  not  a  shareholder  of  the  Company  and  intends  to  be  a  collective  arbitration,  through representation of all minority shareholders of Petrobras that acquired shares on B3 between January 22, 2010 and July 28, 2015. Investors claim alleged financial losses caused by facts uncovered in the Lava Jato investigation.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThese claims involve complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties and depend on a number of factors such as the novelty of the legal theories, the timing of the Chamber of Arbitration decisions, the information produced in discovery and analysis by retained experts.\n\nMoreover, the claims asserted are broad and span a multi-year period. The uncertainties inherent in all such matters affect the amount and timing of their ultimate resolution. As a result, the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of eventual loss arising from such arbitrations.\n\nDepending on the outcome  of these complaints,  the  Company  may  have  to  pay  substantial  amounts,  which  may  have  a significant effect on its consolidated financial position, financial performance and cash flows in a certain period. However, Petrobras does not recognize responsibility for the losses alleged by investors in these arbitrations.\n\nMost of these arbitrations are still in the preliminary stages and a final decision is not expected in the near future. However, in relation to one of the arbitrations, proposed by two institutional investors, on May 26, 2020, a partial arbitral award was issued indicating the Company's responsibility, but not determining the payment of amounts by Petrobras, nor ending the procedure. This arbitration, as well as the other arbitrations in progress, are confidential and the partial arbitral award - which does not represent a CAM position, but only of the three arbitrators that make up this arbitration panel - does not extend to the other ongoing arbitrations.\n\nOn July 20, 2020, Petrobras filed a lawsuit for the annulment of this partial arbitral award, as the Company understands that the award contains serious flaws and improprieties. This lawsuit is still without any assessment on the merits of the case and its judgement is pending. On November 11, 2020, the 5th Business Court of Rio de Janeiro annulled the partial arbitration award, due to these serious flaws and improprieties pointed out by Petrobras. There is still appeal against this decision. In compliance  with  CAM  rules,  the  lawsuit  is  confidential  and  only  available  to  those  involved  in  the  original  arbitration proceeding. Petrobras will continue to defend itself in this and other arbitrations.\n\n## 20.4.3. Arbitrations in Argentina\n\nOn September 11, 2018,  Petrobras was served of an arbitral claim filed by Consumidores Financieros Asociaci\u00f3n Civil para su Defensa (\"Association\") against the company and other individuals and legal entities, before the 'Tribunal de Arbitraje General de la Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires'. Among other issues, the Association alleges Petrobras' liability for a supposed loss of market value of Petrobras' shares in Argentina, due to proceedings related to Lava Jato investigation.\n\nOn June 14, 2019, the Company informed that the Chamber of Arbitration recognized the withdrawal of the arbitration due to the fact that the Association had not paid the arbitration fee within the established period. The Association appealed to the Argentine  Judiciary  against  this  decision,  which  was  rejected  on  November  20,  2019.  The  Association  filed  a  new  appeal addressed to the Argentine Supreme Court, pending a final decision.\n\nPetrobras denies the allegations presented by the Association and intends to defend itself vigorously.\n\n## 20.5. Other legal proceeding in Argentina\n\nPetrobras was included as a defendant in criminal actions in Argentina:\n\n- \u00b7 Criminal action for alleged non-compliance with the obligation to publish 'press release' in the Argentine market about the existence of a class action filed by Consumidores Financieros Asociaci\u00f3n Civil para su Defensa before the Commercial Court, according to the provisions of the Argentine capital market law. Petrobras was never mentioned in the scope of the referred collective action. Petrobras presented procedural defenses in the criminal action but some of them have not yet been judged by the court. This criminal action is pending before the Criminal Economic Court No. 3 of the city of Buenos Aires;\n- \u00b7 Criminal action related to an alleged fraudulent offer of securities, when Petrobras allegedly declared false data in its financial  statements prior to 2015. Petrobras presented procedural defenses but some of them have not yet been judged by the court. On September 14, 2020, the judge accepted the defense presented by the Company and decided that Petrobras could not be sued in a criminal case before the Argentine Justice. The Association appealed this decision, and the appeal is pending judgment. This criminal action is pending before the Criminal Economic Court No. 2 of the city of Buenos Aires.",

Deduction of VAT tax (ICMS) from the basis of calculation of PIS and COFINS\n\nThe Company filed complaints against Brazilian Federal Government challenging the constitutionality of the inclusion, from 2001 to 2020, of ICMS within the calculation basis of PIS and COFINS. In 2020, the Company obtained a favorable and definitive court decision on this claim, and the Company recognized the corresponding credit, as set out in note 17.\n\nThe tax credit relates to the exclusion of the ICMS effectively collected when included in the basis of calculation of PIS and COFINS,  as  deliberated  by  the  Superior  Federal  Court  ( Superior  Tribunal  Federal -  STF).  In  relation  to  the  amounts corresponding to the difference between the criterion established in the regulation and the ICMS amount reported in the invoices, these were not recognized as tax credit, since it is still pending final decision of the STF.\n\n## 20.7. Accounting policy for provisions for legal proceedings, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nProvisions are recognized when: (i) the company has a present obligation as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligation,  and  (iii)  the  amount  of  the obligation can be reliably estimated.\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed in explanatory notes when the likelihood of outflows is possible, including those whose amounts cannot be estimated.\n\nThe methodology used to estimate the provisions is described in note 4.5.\n\nContingent  assets  are  not  recognized,  but  are  disclosed  in  explanatory  notes  when  the  inflow  of  economic  benefits  is considered probable. However, if the inflow of economic benefits is virtually certain, the related asset is not a contingent asset and it is recognized.\n\n## 21.

These are the main factors:\n\n- \u00b7 increase attributable to the devaluation of the Real against the US Dollar (from R$ 4.03 / US$ 1.00 in 2019, to R$ 5.20 / US$ 1.00 in 2020) , with a direct impact on dollar costs;\n- \u00b7 anticipation of timing the abandonments in some fields (mainly Tupi, Marlim Sul, Roncador and Jubarte);\n- \u00b7 reduction in the risk-adjusted discount rate from 4.22% p.a. in 2019 to 4.15% p.a. in 2020, due to an improvement in risk perception in the world panorama;\n- \u00b7 reduction due to the review of technical assumptions for wells and equipment.",

Accounting policy for decommissioning costs\n\nThe initial recognition of legal obligations to remove equipment and restore land or sea areas at the end of operations occurs after the technical and commercial feasibility of producing oil and gas in a field has been demonstrated. The calculations of the cost estimates for future environmental removals and recoveries are complex and involve significant judgments (as set out in note 4.6).\n\nThe estimates of decommissioning costs are reviewed annually based on current information on expected costs and recovery plans.  When  the  revision  of  the  estimates  results  in  an  increase  in  the  provision  for  decommissioning  costs,  there  is  a corresponding increase in assets. Otherwise, in the event that a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess shall be recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nIn the classification of non-current assets as held for sale, provisions for decommissioning costs related to these assets are also included. Any commitments assumed with future environmental removals and recoveries resulting from the sale of assets are recognized after the closing of the sale operation, in accordance with the contractual terms.",

The 'Lava Jato (Car Wash) Operation' and its effects on the Company\n\nThe Company has monitored the progress of investigations under the 'Lava Jato' Operation and, in the preparation of these annual consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2020, did not identify any additional information that would affect the adopted calculation methodology to write off, in the third quarter of 2014, amounts overpaid for the acquisition  of  property,  plant  and  equipment.  The  Company  will  continue  to  monitor  these  investigations  for  additional information in order to assess their potential impact on the adjustment made.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company  has  fully  cooperated  with  the  Brazilian  Federal  Police  ( Pol\u00edcia  Federal ),  the  Brazilian  Public Prosecutor's Office ( Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal ),  the  Federal  Auditor's  Office  ( Tribunal de Contas da Uni\u00e3o -  TCU) and the General Federal Inspector's Office ( Controladoria Geral da Uni\u00e3o ) in the investigation of all crimes and irregularities.\n\nDuring 2020, new leniency and plea agreements entitled the Company to receive funds with respect to compensation for damages, in the amount of US$ 155 (US$ 220 in 2019), accounted for as other income and expenses. Thus, the total amount recovered from Lava Jato investigation through December 31, 2020 was US$ 1,287.\n\n## 23.1. Investigations involving the Company\n\n## 23.1.1. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice inquiries\n\nOn September 27, 2018, the Company settled the open matters with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation, which encompassed the Company's internal controls, books and records, and financial statements from 2003 to 2012.\n\nThese agreements fully resolve the inquiries carried out by these authorities. Following this agreement, the Company paid US$ 85 to the DoJ in 2018 and the same amount to the SEC in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, the agreements also credit a remittance of US$ 683 to the Brazilian authorities, which Petrobras deposited in January 2019 into a court deposit account. The Company fully recognized the effects of these settlements as other income and expenses in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nThis resolution met the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, and eliminated uncertainties, risks, burdens and costs of potential litigations in the United States.\n\n## 23.1.2. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission - CFTC\n\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') contacted Petrobras with an inquiry regarding trading activities related to the Lava Jato Operation.  Petrobras reiterates that it continues to cooperate with the regulatory authorities, including the CFTC, regarding any inquiry.\n\n## 23.1.3. Order of civil inquiry - Brazilian Public Prosecutor's Office\n\nOn December 15, 2015, the State of S\u00e3o Paulo Public Prosecutor's Office issued the Order of Civil Inquiry 01/2015, establishing a civil proceeding to investigate the existence of potential damages caused by Petrobras to investors in the Brazilian stock market.

Commitment to purchase  natural gas\n\nThe GSA agreement (Gas Supply Agreement) entered into with Petrobras and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos YPFB was initially effective until December 31, 2019. In addition, according to agreement provision, after December 31, 2019, the GSA was automatically extended until the entire volume contracted is delivered by YPFB and withdrawn by Petrobras. On March 6, 2020, by means of a contractual amendment, the Parties changed the daily contracted quantity (QDC) from 30.08 million m\u00b3 per day to 20 million m\u00b3 per day, which became effective as from March 11, 2020.\n\nThus,  as  of  December  31,  2020,  the  total  amount  of  the  GSA  for  2021  is  nearly  7.30  billion  cubic  meters  of  natural  gas (equivalent to 20.00 million cubic meters per day) and corresponds to a total estimated value of US$ 1.06 billion. Based on the aforementioned extension clause, the Company expects purchases to continue through May 2024, on the same volume basis according to current indicators, representing an estimated additional amount of US$ 3.35 billion, for the period from January 1, 2021 to May 05, 2024.",

Accounting policy for Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at the cost to acquire or construct, including all costs necessary to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use and the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site, reduced by accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nA condition for continuing to operate certain items of property, plant and equipment, such as industrial plants, offshore plants and  vessels  is  the  performance  of  regular  major  inspections  and  maintenance.  Those  expenditures  are  capitalized  if  a maintenance campaign is expected to occur, at least, 12 months later.  Otherwise,  they  are  expensed  when  incurred.  The capitalized  costs  are  depreciated  over  the  period through the next major maintenance date.\n\nSpare parts are capitalized when they are expected to be used during more than one period and can only be used in connection with an item of property, plant and equipment. These are depreciated over the useful life of the item of property, plant and equipment to which they relate.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the costs of  these  assets.  General  borrowing  costs  are  capitalized  based  on  the  Company's  weighted  average  cost  of  borrowings outstanding applied over the balance of assets under construction. Loans, directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets are excluded from this calculation until the completion of all activities necessary to set the asset in conditions for use or sale intended by management. In general, the Company suspends capitalization of borrowing to the extent investments in a qualifying asset hibernates during a period greater than one year or whenever the asset is prepared for its intended use.\n\nAssets directly  associated  to  oil  and  gas  production of  a  contract  area without  useful  life  lower  than the  estimated length    of    reserves  depletion,  such  as  signature  bonuses,  are  depreciated  or  amortized  based  on  the  unit-of-production method.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nPETROBRAS\n\nThe  unit-of-production  method  of  depreciation  (amortization)  is  computed  based  on  a  unit  of  production  basis  (monthly production) over the proved  developed  oil  and  gas  reserves, except  for  signature  bonuses  for  which unit  of  production method  takes  into  account  the monthly production over the total proved oil and gas reserves on a field-by-field basis.\n\nAssets related to oil and gas production with useful lives shorter than the life of the field; floating platforms and other assets unrelated to oil and gas production are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are reviewed annually. Note 25.2 provides further information on the estimated useful life by class of assets. Lands are not depreciated.\n\nRight-of-use  assets  are  presented  as  property,  plant  and equipment  and,  according  to  the  useful  lives  of  their  respective underlying assets and the characteristics of lease agreements (term, asset transfer or exercise of call option), are depreciated using the straight-line method based on contractual terms.\n\n## 25.4. Concession  for  exploration  of  oil  and  natural  gas  -  Transfer  of  Rights  Agreement  ('Cess\u00e3o Onerosa')\n\nOn November 1, 2019, Petrobras signed with the Brazilian Federal Government the Amendment to the Transfer of Rights Agreement, which provides for the reimbursement to the Company of US$ 9,058, as established in the Resolution 5/2019 enacted in April 2019 by the National Energy Policy Council (Conselho Nacional de Pol\u00edtica Energ\u00e9tica - CNPE).\n\nAt this signing, the Company recognized accounts receivable offsetting property, plant and equipment, in the amount of US$ 8,319 (considering the average exchange rate prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2019). On December 11, 2019, the Brazilian Federal Government paid this amount to the Company, bearing interest at SELIC rate from the date of the signing, in the amount of US$ 43, accounted for as finance income in 2019.\n\n## 25.5. Oil and Gas fields operated by Petrobras returned to ANP\n\nIn  2020, the following oil and gas fields were returned to ANP: Agulha, Caioba, Camorim, Dourado, Guaricema, Piranema, Piranema  Sul,  Salgo  e  Tatu\u00ed.  These  fields  were  returned  to  ANP  mainly  due  to  their  economic  unfeasibility  and,  as  a consequence, the Company wrote off the amount of US$ 12 in addition to impairments recognized in prior years.\n\nIn 2019, the following oil and gas fields were returned to ANP: Juru\u00e1, Ira\u00fana, Barra do Ipiranga, Lagoa Branca, Nativo Oeste, Jacupemba, Mariricu Oeste, Rio Barra Seca, Rio Ita\u00fanas Leste, Rio S\u00e3o Mateus Oeste and Sul de Sapinho\u00e1. These fields were returned to ANP mainly due to their economic unfeasibility and, as a consequence, the Company wrote off the amount of US$ 74 in addition to impairments recognized in prior years.\n\nIn 2018, the following oil and gas fields were returned to ANP: Japiim, Camar\u00e3o Norte, part of Espadarte and part of Sibite. These fields were returned to ANP mainly due to their economic unfeasibility and, as a consequence, the Company wrote off the amount of US$ 0.1 in addition to impairments recognized in prior years.\n\n## 25.6. Capitalization rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization\n\nThe capitalization rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings that were outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the capitalization rate was 6.12% p.a. (6.40% p.a. for the year ended December 31, 2019).",

The total amount of the signature bonus paid was US$ 348.\n\nThere were no new bidding rounds in the concession regime during 2020.\n\n## Exploration Rights - Surplus Volume of the Transfer of Rights Agreement and Production Sharing contract\n\nOn November 6, 2019, the ANP held the Bidding Round for the Surplus Volume of the Transfer of Rights Agreement, when the Company acquired  90%  interest  in  the  exploration  and  production  rights  of  the  surplus  volume  of  B\u00fazios  field  from  the Assignment Agreement, in partnership with CNODC Brasil Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s Ltda. (5%) and CNOOC Petroleum Brasil Ltda. (5%) and 100% interest of the surplus volume of the Itapu field.\n\nThe signature bonus corresponding to the Company's interest was US$ 14,912, paid in December 2019.\n\nThe co-participation agreement is being negotiated and should be concluded by September 2021, final basis to the rights and obligations arising from the production sharing contract in B\u00fazios and Itapu. Since it was a special bidding round, related to the production surplus from fields with technical and commercial feasibility already defined, the values of the signature bonuses paid will be transferred from intangible assets to property, plant and equipment after the finalization of the co-participation agreement and eventual adjustments to the reserves volumes that will be incorporated by Petrobras.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOn November 7, 2019, the ANP held the 6 th Bidding  Round  under  the  production  sharing  regime.  Petrobras  acquired,  in partnership with CNODC Brasil Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s Ltda. (20%), the Aram block, located in the Santos Basin. Petrobras will  be the operator of the field with an 80% interest. The signature bonus corresponding to the Company's interest was US$ 982, paid in December 2019.\n\nThere were no new bidding rounds in the production sharing regime during 2020.\n\n## Assumption of additional participation in concession contracts\n\nDuring 2020, partner companies in some exploratory projects decided to leave the business and the company assumed their participation in the consortia. Assumption of rights was non-onerous, and did not imply disbursement by the company. Until December 31, 2020, the ANP had approved the signing of the additives to the concession contracts for the exploration blocks ES-M-596 (originally 50% Petrobras and 50% Equinor), ES-M-671 (40% Petrobras; 35% Equinor and 25% Total) and ES-M-743 (40% Petrobras; 35% Equinor and 25% Total), in which the company now holds 100% interest.\n\nThe transaction is similar to a donation, thus the installments related to the exploration rights assumed were assessed at fair value, taking as a parameter the total value of the bonus offered to these blocks in the 11th bidding round. The value of the signature bonus corresponds to the shares assumed and was recognized in intangible assets in the amount of US$ 25, and the corresponding income as other operating income. The company received the installments due by the partners in the minimum exploratory program ( Programa Explorat\u00f3rio M\u00ednimo - PEM).\n\n## 26.2. Accounting policy for intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are measured at the acquisition cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses and comprise rights and concessions, including the signature bonus paid for concessions and production sharing agreements for exploration and production of oil and natural gas (capitalized acquisition costs), public service concessions, trademarks, patents, software and goodwill.\n\nInternally-generated intangible assets are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred, except for development costs that meet the recognition criteria related to the completion and use of assets, probable future economic benefits, and others.\n\nWhen the technical and commercial feasibility of oil and gas production is demonstrated for the first field in an area, the value of the signature bonus corresponds to the right to explore, drill and produce oil and gas fields is reclassified to property, plant and equipment at their full value. While they are in intangible assets, they are not amortized. Other intangible assets with defined useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIf, when defining the first field of a block, there are exploratory activities being carried out in different locations in the block, so that oil and gas volumes can be estimated for other possible reservoirs in the area, then the value of the signature bonus is partially reclassified to PP&E, based on the ratio between the volume of oil and gas expected (oil in place - VOIP) of a specific reservoir and the total volume of oil and gas expected for all possible reservoirs in the area.\n\nHowever, if exploratory activities in the remaining areas do not result in technical and commercial viability, the corresponding value of the signature bonus is not written off, but transferred to PP&E and added to the value of the signature bonus related to the location that was previously assessed as technically and commercially viable.\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment. Their useful lives are reviewed annually.\n\n## 26.3. Exploration  rights  returned  to  the  Brazilian  Agency  of  Petroleum,  Natural  Gas  and  Biofuels  Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo, G\u00e1s Natural e Biocombust\u00edveis (ANP)\n\nIn  2020,  45  exploration  areas  were  returned  to  the  ANP,  in  Camamu-Almada,  Esp\u00edrito  Santo,  Jequitinhonha,  Potiguar, Rec\u00f4ncavo,  Pelotas,  Pernambuco-Para\u00edba,  Santos  and  Sergipe-Alagoas  basins  (12  in  2019  in  Sergipe-Alagoas,  Potiguar, Rec\u00f4ncavo and Parna\u00edba basins), totaling US$ 172 (US$ 3 in 2019), mainly due to the Peroba exploratory block US$ 154.",

        "page_content": "## 27. Impairment\n\nThe Company annually tests its assets for impairment or when there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nDuring 2020, impairment losses were mainly recognized in the first quarter, arising from significant and adverse effects on the oil and oil products market: (i) the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a sharp reduction in the circulation of people and in the world economic activity, causing a shock on demand of these products, and (ii) failure in negotiations between members of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, led by Russia, to define production levels, which contributed to an increase in the global oil supply with a reduction in price in early March.\n\nThese events led the Company to adopt a set of measures, in the first quarter of 2020, aiming at preserving cash generation, as well as to revise the key assumptions of the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan, such as Brent prices, exchange rates, oil product spreads, among others, whose effects were accounted for in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, management concluded and approved its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, considering a complete update of economic assumptions, as well as its project portfolio and estimates of reserve volumes, which support the impairment tests conducted in this reporting period.\n\nThe oil and gas production estimated in the scope of the plan indicates a continuous growth focused on the development of projects that generate higher value, with an increase in the participation of assets in the pre-salt layer, which present lower lifting costs. During this period, 13 new production systems are expected to enter into operation, all of which will be allocated to deep and ultra-deep water projects.\n\nThe expected investment considered in the plan for the five-year period is US$ 55 billion, 84% allocated to E&P segment (of which US$ 32 billion destined for pre-salt layer assets).\n\nThe table below shows impairment losses and reversals recognized within the statement of income in 2020, 2019 and 2018:",

This amount comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment losses totaling US$ 1,054 primarily related to CGUs Camorim (US$ 140), Linguado (US$ 139), Piranema (US$ 93), Guaricema (US$ 92), Juru\u00e1 (US$ 91), Bicudo (US$ 83), Caioba (US$ 61), Pper-1 group (US$ 49), Garoupinha (US$ 39), Frade (US$ 39), Castanhal (US$ 36) and Papa Terra (US$ 35). These losses were substantially due to higher estimates of future decommissioning costs driven by costs related to subsea facilities and equipment and depreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar.\n- \u00b7 Reversals of impairment totaling US$ 530 primarily from the CGUs Cvit group (US$ 158), Urugu\u00e1 group (US$ 151), Cear\u00e1 Mar group (US$ 50), Dom Jo\u00e3o (US$ 23), Miranga group (US$ 16), Fazenda Bel\u00e9m group (US$ 13) and Bijupir\u00e1-Salema group  (US$  13),  due  to  upward  revision  in  the  estimated  production  curves  following  a  review  of  certain  projects investments, as set out in the BMP 2019-2023.\n\n## b1) Oil and gas production and drilling equipment in Brazil - 2020",

However, the construction of the first refining unit facilities that would also support the natural gas processing plant (UPGN) was in progress as the facilities were  part  of  the  infrastructure  for  transporting  and  processing  natural  gas  from  the  pre-salt  layer  in  the  Santos  Basin. Nevertheless, due to the interdependence between such infrastructure and the first refining unit, the Company recognized additional impairment charges, totaling US$ 47 in 2018.\n\n## d1) Second refining unit of RNEST - 2020\n\nThe cash flows to measure the value in use of the second refining unit of RNEST take into account the postponing of the beginning of the operation, triggering impairment losses in the amount of US$ 22.\n\n## d2) Second refining unit of RNEST - 2019\n\nThe cash flows to measure the value in use of the second refining unit of RNEST took into account the postponing of the beginning of the operation, triggering impairment losses in the amount of US$ 534.\n\n## d3) Second refining unit of RNEST - 2018\n\nThe impairment assessment over the second refining unit of RNEST resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss amounting to US$ 22, as the beginning of operation had been postponed (real discount rate applied was 7.3% p.a. post-tax discount rate for the refining business).\n\n## e) Corporate facilities - 2020\n\nThe Company decided to hibernate a corporate building, in the state of Bahia, due to its permanent vacancy, resulting in a US$ 161 impairment loss on the right of use asset.",

Thus, a US$ 103 reversal of impairment was accounted for in 2019.\n\n## f2) Transpetro's fleet of vessels - 2018\n\nThe lower freight rates projected in PNG 2019-2023 significantly affected impairment assessment of the Transpetro's fleet of vessels, resulting in the recognition of impairment losses in the amount of US$ 428 in 2018 (post-tax discount rates applied to the transportation sector ranged from 3.8% p.a. to 6.6% p.a.).\n\n## g1) Fertilizer plant - UFN III - 2019\n\nFollowing the Company's decision to quit the conclusion of this plant located in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, this asset was written-off, in the amount of US$ 200.\n\n## g2) Fertilizer plant - UFN III - 2018\n\nAn impairment loss of US$ 114 was recognized for the fertilizer plant UFN III due to its lower fair value.\n\n## h) Oil and gas production and drilling equipment abroad - 2019\n\nIn January 2020, the sale of drillship Sonda Vit\u00f3ria 10,000 (NS-30), owned by Drill Ship International B.V. - DSI, a subsidiary of PIB BV, was closed. Thus, impairment losses in the amount of US$ 333 were recognized, due to the difference between the expected sale value and its carrying amount.\n\n## i) Producing properties relating to oil and gas activities abroad - 2018\n\nThe Company recognized an impairment loss in the amount of US$ 715 with respect to producing properties of oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily driven by changes in operational assumptions and discount rate considering the terms of the agreement between the Company and Murphy Oil Corporation in order to establish a joint venture through such assets.\n\n## j) GASFOR II - 2018\n\nIn 2018, management decided to halt the development of the GASFOR II project, carried out by TAG. Accordingly, this asset was excluded from the Natural Gas CGU and its impairment test was performed separately. Due to its halt, it is not possible to estimate future cash flows arising from the use of this asset, resulting in the recognition of impairment losses in the amount equal to the carrying amount thereof (US 59).\n\n## 27.1.4. Assets most sensitive to future impairment\n\nWhenever the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU falls below the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The following table presents the assets and CGUs most sensitive to future impairment losses, presenting recoverable amounts close to their current carrying amounts. The analysis presented below considers the estimated impairment losses or reversals if there was a 10% reduction or increase in the recoverable amount of the CGUs, arising from changes in material assumptions:",

Accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets with definitive lives are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets are assessed for impairment at the smallest identifiable group that generates largely independent cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (CGU). Note 4.3 presents detailed information about the Company's CGUs.\n\nAssets related to development and production of oil and gas assets (fields or group of fields) that have indefinite useful lives, such as goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment.\n\nConsidering the existing synergies between the Company's assets and businesses, as well as the expectation of the use of its assets for their remaining useful lives, value in use is generally used by the Company for impairment testing purposes. When specifically indicated, the Company assesses differences between its assumptions and assumptions that would be used by market participants in the determination of the fair value of an asset or CGU.\n\nReversal of previously recognized impairment losses may occur for assets other than goodwill.\n\n## 27.2. Assets classified as held for sale\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  recognized  reversals  in  the  amount  of  US$ 17  arising  from  the  fair  value  of  assets,  net  of  disposal expenses, with the most significant relating to: the sale of Rec\u00f4ncavo group of fields (14 concessions located onshore and in shallow waters) in the amount of US$ 35; the sale of Rio Ventura group of fields (8 concessions located onshore) in the amount of US$ 18; the sale of Fazenda Bel\u00e9m group of fields, in the amount of US$ 14; partially offset by a US$ 62 impairment loss relating to Cartola and Ataulfo Alves vessels.\n\nIn 2019, as a result of the sale of several assets of the E&P segment, the Company recognized reversals in the amount of US$ 558,  considering  the  net  fair  value  of  disposal  expenses,  mainly:  US$  494  relating  to  Pampo  and  Enchova  Project  (10 concessions located in shallow waters); US$ 84 relating to Bispo project (in Frade field); US$ 67 relating to Mangalarga project (in Maromba field), partially offset by a US$ 89 impairment loss recognized on the sale of Petrobras Oil & Gas B.V. (PO & GBV).\n\nIn 2018, following the Company's Board of Director approvals for the disposal of certain assets, impairment reversals were accounted for amounting to US$ 115 for assets held for sale, including the effects arising from the sale of onshore producing fields located in Potiguar basin.\n\nThe accounting policy for assets and liabilities held for sale is set out in note 32.",

        "page_content": "## 27.3. Investments in associates and joint ventures (including goodwill)\n\nValue in use is generally used for impairment test of investments in associates and joint ventures (including goodwill). The basis for estimates of cash flow projections includes: projections covering a period of 5 to 12 years, zero-growth rate perpetuity, budgets, forecasts and assumptions approved by management and a post-tax discount rate derived from the WACC or the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) models, specific for each case.\n\n## 27.3.1. Accounting policy for impairment of associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are tested individually for impairment. When performing impairment testing of an equity-accounted investment, goodwill, if it exists, is also considered part of the carrying amount to be compared to the recoverable amount.\n\nExcept when specifically indicated, value in use is generally used by the Company for impairment testing purposes in proportion to the Company's interests in the present value of future cash flow projections via dividends and other distributions.\n\n## 27.3.2. Investment in publicly traded associate\n\n## Braskem S.A.\n\nBraskem's shares are publicly traded on stock exchanges in Brazil and abroad. As of December 31, 2020, the quoted market value  of  the  Company's  investment  in  Braskem  was  US$ 1,375  based  on  the quoted  values  of  both  Petrobras'  interest  in Braskem's common stock (47% of the outstanding shares), and preferred stock (22% of the outstanding shares). However, there is extremely limited trading of the common shares, since non-signatories of the shareholders' agreement hold only approximately 3% of the common shares.\n\nGiven the operational relationship between Petrobras and Braskem, the recoverable amount of the investment for impairment testing purposes was determined based on value in use, considering future cash flow projections and the manner in which the Company can derive value from this investment via dividends and other distributions to arrive at its value in use. As the recoverable amount was higher than the carrying amount, no impairment losses were recognized for this investment.\n\nCash flow projections to determine the value in use of Braskem were based on estimated prices of feedstock and petrochemical products reflecting international trends on prices, petrochemical products sales volume estimates reflecting projected Brazilian and global G.D.P. growth, post-tax discount rate (excluding inflation) of 8.7% p.a., considering cash flows from dividends, and decreases in the EBITDA margin during the growth cycle of the petrochemical industry in the next years and declining in the long-term. Estimated exchange rates and Brent prices are the same as those set out in note 27.1.2.\n\n## Petrobras Distribuidora S.A.\n\nIn July 2019, with the additional sale of the Company's interest in the subsidiary Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. (BR Distribuidora), carried out through a secondary public offering (follow-on), BR Distribuidora became an associate. Considering the fair value as the market value of its shares, at December 31, 2020, the Company estimated this investment was recoverable.\n\nOn August 26,  2020  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  disposal  of  the  remaining  interest  in  this  Company. Accordingly,  the  recoverable  value  of  this  investment  took  into  account  the  value  in  use,  including  the  disposal  value, considering the intention to sell the shares.  Thus, impairment testing resulted in a US$ 459 loss.\n\nThe post-tax discount rate in constant currency applied was is 11.1% p.a., considering the cost of equity.\n\n## 27.3.3. Investments in state-controlled natural gas distributors\n\nIn 2020, impairment assessments on investments in state-controlled natural gas distributors did not give rise to any indication that these assets would be impaired, which carrying amount is US$ 1,108. Post-tax discount rate (excluding inflation) used in such assessment was 5.7% p.a..",

More information on intangible assets accounting policy, see note 27.\n- \u00b7 Costs directly attributable to exploratory wells, including their equipment and installations, pending determination of proved reserves are capitalized within property, plant and equipment. In some cases, exploratory wells have discovered oil and gas reserves, but at the moment the drilling is completed they are not yet able to be classified as proved. In such cases, the expenses continue to be capitalized if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and progress on assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is under way (for more information see note 28.2). An internal commission of technical executives of the Company reviews these conditions monthly for  each  well,  by  analysis  of  geoscience  and  engineering  data,  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and government regulations. For additional information on proved reserves estimates, see note 4.1.\n- \u00b7 Costs related to exploratory wells drilled in areas of unproved reserves are charged to expense when determined to be dry or uneconomic by the aforementioned internal commission.\n- \u00b7 Costs related to the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities, such as drilling of development wells, construction of platforms and natural gas processing units, construction of equipment and facilities for the extraction, handling, storing, processing or treating crude oil and natural gas, pipelines, storage facilities, waste disposal facilities and other related costs  incurred  in  connection  with  the  development  of  proved  reserve  areas  are  capitalized  within  property,  plant  and equipment.\n\n## 28.2.

        "page_content": "## 30.2. Unitization Agreements\n\nPetrobras has Production Individualization Agreements (AIP) signed in Brazil with partner companies (Shell, Petrogal, Repsol and Total) in E&P consortiums. These agreements result in reimbursements payable to (or receivable from) partners regarding expenses and production volumes related to Tupi, S\u00e9pia, Atapu, Berbig\u00e3o, Sururu, Albacora Leste and other fields.\n\n## Berbig\u00e3o, Sururu, Albacora Leste and others\n\nThe table below presents changes on the reimbursements payable relating to these fields:\n\n|                                    | 12.31.2020   | 12.31.2019   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Opening balance                    | 113          | 159          |\n| Additions/(Write-offs) on PP&E     | 278          | 50           |\n| Indexation charges                 | -            | 4            |\n| Payments made                      | (17)         | (92)         |\n| Other income and expenses          | (50)         | (2)          |\n| Cumulative translation adjustments | 46           | (6)          |\n| Closing balance                    | 370          | 113          |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Petrobras has reimbursements payable amounting to US$ 370 (US$ 113 on December 31, 2019). In 2020, these agreements resulted in payments and recognition of additions and write-offs in PP&E, in addition to other net expenses, reflecting the best available estimate of the assumptions used in calculating the calculation base and the sharing of relevant assets in areas to be equalized.\n\n## Tupi, S\u00e9pia and Atapu\n\nOn April 30, 2020, Petrobras and partner companies in E&P consortiums in Tupi, S\u00e9pia and Atapu fields signed the Agreements for the Equalization of Expenses and Volumes (AEGV). Thus, on May 29, 2020, as a result of the increase in interest in these three consortiums, Petrobras received from partner companies the amount of US$ 441, in addition to US$ 284 in PP&E, totaling US$ 725 within other income and expenses.\n\nAlso as a result of these agreements, on May 1, 2020, the wholly owned subsidiary Petrobras Netherlands BV (PNBV) signed Share Purchase Agreements acquiring an additional  interest in Tupi BV, for US$ 84, and an additional interest in Iara BV (Atapu) for US$ 805, subject to price adjustments. The computation of the acquisition price was based on the fair value of the acquired assets and related liabilities, bringing a net increase of US$ 889 mainly in PP&E.\n\nThe  price  adjustment  relating  to  the  acquisition  of  interest  in  Tupi  BV  occurred  on  September  15,  2020,  resulting  in  an additional payment of US$ 13, registered as property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 30.3. Accounting Policy for unitization agreements\n\nA unitization agreement occurs when a reservoir extends across two or more license or contract areas. In this case, partners pool their individual interests in return for an interest in the overall unit and determine their new stake in the single producing unit.\n\nEvents that occurred prior to the unitization agreement may lead to the need for compensation between the partners. At the signing of the AIP, an amount to be reimbursed to the Company will be recognized as an asset only when there is a contractual right to reimbursement or when the reimbursement is practically certain. An amount to be reimbursed by the Company will be recognized as a liability when it derives from a contractual obligation or, when the outflow of funds is deemed probable and the amount can be reliable estimated.",

Accounting policy for investments in subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial information of Petrobras and the entities it controls (subsidiaries), joint operations (at the level of interest the Company has in them) and consolidated structured entities.\n\nControl is achieved when Petrobras: i) has power over the investee; ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee; and iii) has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained until the date that such control no longer exists, by using accounting policies consistent with those adopted by Petrobras. Note 11 sets out the consolidated entities and other direct investees.\n\nInvestments structured through a separate vehicle are set up so that the voting rights, or similar rights, are not the dominant factor  to  determine  who  controls  the  entity.  At  December  31,  2020,  Petrobras  controls  and  consolidates  the  following structured entities: CDC (U.S.A., E&P); CDMPI (Brazil, RT&M) and FIDC (Brazil, Corporate, others).\n\nIntragroup balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in the consolidation of the financial statements.\n\n## Investments in other companies\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and  operating  policy  decisions  of  the  investee  but  not  the  ability  to  exercise  control  or  joint  control  over those  polices.  The definition of control is set out in note 4.1.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nA  joint  arrangement  is  an  arrangement  over  which  two  or  more  parties  have  joint  control  (pursuant  to  contractual provisions).  A  joint arrangement  is  classified  either  as  a  joint  operation  or  as  a  joint  venture  depending  on  the  rights and  obligations  of  the  parties  to  the arrangement.\n\nIn a joint operation, the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities related to the arrangement, while in a joint venture the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Some of the Company's activities in the E&P segment are conducted through joint operations.\n\nProfit or loss, assets and liabilities related to joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method. In a joint operation the Company recognizes the amount of its assets, liabilities and related income and expenses.\n\nAccounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been adjusted, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by Petrobras. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\n\n## Business combination and Goodwill\n\nA  business  combination  is  a  transaction  in  which  the  acquirer  obtains  control  of  another  business, regardless  it  legal form. Acquisitions  of businesses  are  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition  method  when  control  is  obtained.  Combinations of  entities  under  common  control  are  accounted  for  at  cost.  The  acquisition  method requires  that  the  identifiable  assets acquired and the liabilities assumed be measured at the acquisition-date fair value, with limited exceptions.\n\nGoodwill  is  measured  as  the excess  of  the  aggregate  amount  of:  (i)  the  consideration  transferred;  (ii)  the  amount  of any   non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree;  and  (iii)  in  a  business  combination  achieved  in  stages,  the  fair  value  of  the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree at the acquisition-date; over the net of the amounts of the identifiable assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed.  When  this  aggregate  amount  is  lower  than  the  net  of  the  amounts  of  the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in the statement of income.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control of the subsidiary are equity transactions. Any excess of the amounts  paid/received,  including directly  attributable  costs,  over  the  carrying  value  of  the  ownership interest  acquired/disposed of is recognized in shareholders' equity as changes in interest in subsidiaries.\n\n## 32. Disposal of assets and other changes in organizational structure\n\nThe Company has an active partnership and divestment portfolio, which takes into account opportunities for disposal of nonstrategic assets in several areas in which it operates, whose development of transactions also depends on conditions beyond the  control  of  the  Company.  The  divestment  projects  and  strategic  partnerships  follow  the  procedures  aligned  with  the guidelines of the Brazilian Federal Auditor's Office ( Tribunal de Contas da Uni\u00e3o - TCU) and the current legislation.\n\nThe major classes of assets and related liabilities classified as held for sale are shown in the following table:",

Accounting Policy for assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nNon-current assets, disposal groups and liabilities directly associated with those assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will, principally, be recovered through the sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\nThe condition for classification as held for sale is met only when the sale is approved by the Company's Board of Directors and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and there is the expectation that the sale will occur within 12 months after its classification as held for sale. However, an extended period required to complete a sale does  not  preclude  an  asset  (or  disposal  group)  from  being  classified  as  held  for  sale  if  the  delay  is  caused  by  events  or circumstances beyond the Company's control and there is sufficient evidence that the Company remains committed to its plan to sell the assets (or disposal groups).\n\nAssets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale and the associated liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial position.\n\nWhen a component of the Company is disposed of or classified as held for sale, and it represented a separate major line of business, the disposed interest is considered a discontinued operation, thus its net income, operating, investing and financing cash flows are presented in separate line items until the date of the closing of the operation.",

Accounting policy for financial liabilities\n\nLoans and finance debt are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to its issue and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. When the contractual cash flows of a financial liability measured at amortized cost are renegotiated or modified and this change is not substantial, its gross carrying amount will reflect the discounted present value of its cash flows under the new terms using the original effective interest rate. The difference between the book value immediately prior to such modification and the new gross carrying amount is recognized as gain or loss in the statement of income. When such modification is substantial, the original liability is extinguished and a new liability is recognized, impacting the statement of income for the period.\n\n## 35.

Such payments are not included in the measurement of the lease obligations. Variable lease payments in the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to US$ 785, representing 13% in relation to fixed payments (US$ 671 and 13% in the same period of 2019).\n\nAll extension options were included in the measurement of lease obligations.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized lease expenses in the amount of US$ 118 relating to shortterm leases (US$ 674 in the same period of 2019).\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the balance of lease agreements for which the lease term has not commenced, as they relate to assets under construction or not yet available for use, is US$ 67,408 (US$ 50,130 at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of financial instruments subject to exchange variation is presented in note 38.3.\n\n## 35.1. Accounting policy\n\nLease liabilities, including those whose underlying assets are of low value, are measured at the present value of lease payments, which includes recoverable taxes, non-cancellable periods and options to extend a lease when they are reasonably certain. These payments are discounted at the Company's nominal incremental rate on loans, as the interest rates implicit in lease agreements with third parties usually cannot be readily determined.\n\nLease remeasurements reflect changes arising from contractual rates or indexes, as well as lease terms due to new expectations of lease extensions or terminations.\n\nUnwinding of discount on the lease liability is classified as finance expense, while payments reduce their carrying amount. According to the Company's foreign exchange risk management, foreign exchange variations on lease liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars are designated as instruments to protect cash flow hedge relationships from highly probable future exports (see note 38.3).\n\nIn the E&P segment, some activities are conducted by joint operations where the company is the operator. In cases where all parties to the joint operation are primarily responsible for the lease payments, the Company recognizes the lease liability in proportion to its share. In addition, underlying assets arising from a specific contract in which the Company is solely responsible for the lease payments may be used in a joint operation. In such cases, the lease liabilities remain fully recognized and the partners are charged in proportion to their interests.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases (term of 12 months or less) are recognized as an expense over the term of the lease.",

Profit retention reserve\n\nIt Includes funds intended for capital expenditures, primarily in oil and gas exploration and development activities, as per the capital budget of the Company, pursuant to article 196 of the Brazilian Corporation Law.\n\n## 36.5. Distributions to shareholders\n\nPursuant to Brazilian Corporation Law, the Company's shareholders are entitled to receive minimum mandatory dividends (and/or interest on capital) of 25% of the adjusted net income for the year in proportion to the number of common and preferred shares held by them.\n\nTo the extent the Company proposes dividend distributions, preferred shares have priority in dividend distribution, which is based on the highest of 3% of the preferred shares' net book value or 5% of the preferred share capital. Preferred shares participate under the same terms as common shares in capital increases resulting from the capitalization of profit reserves or retained earnings. However, this priority does not necessarily grant dividend distributions to the preferred shareholders in the event of loss for a year.\n\nThe payment of dividends may be made only to preferred shareholders if the priority dividends absorb all the adjusted net income for the year or reach an amount equal to or greater than the mandatory minimum dividend of 25%.\n\nThe Company's policy on distributions to shareholders defines that in the event of total debt lower than US$ 60,000, the Company  may  distribute  to  its  shareholders  60%  of  the  difference  between  net  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  and acquisition of PP&E and intangibles assets (except for signature bonuses paid for exploration of crude oil and natural gas). In the  event  of  total  debt  exceeding  US$  60,000,  the  Company  may  distribute  to  its  shareholders  the  minimum  mandatory dividends provided for by relevant regulation and the Company's bylaws.\n\nIn addition, on October 27, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved the revision of the Shareholders Compensation Policy, in order to enable management to propose the payment of dividends according to the Company's cash generation, even when presenting losses in a fiscal year.\n\n## 36.5.1. Accounting policy on distributions to shareholders\n\nDistributions to shareholders are made by means of dividends and interest on capital, determined in accordance with the limits defined in the Brazilian Corporation Law and in the Company's bylaws. Interest on capital is a deductible expense in the income tax calculation, while is dividend is not deductible.\n\nThe dividends portion provided for in the bylaws or that represents the minimum mandatory dividends is recognized as a liability in the financial statements. Any excess must be maintained in shareholders' equity, as additional dividends proposed, until its approval on the Annual General Shareholders Meeting.\n\n## 36.5.2. Proposed dividends\n\nProposed distribution to shareholders sent by management for approval at the Annual General Shareholders Meeting, in the amount of US$ 1,977, includes the minimum mandatory dividend to preferred shareholders (US$ 849) and the additional dividends proposed (US$ 1,128) to ordinary shareholders, arising from the remaining portion of the net income for the year and the profit retention reserve, considering cash generation in the year and the Company's preserved financial sustainability.\n\nDistributions to shareholders for 2019 amounted to US$ 2,687, most of it proposed as interest on capital, consistent with the minimum mandatory dividend of 25% of the adjusted income and withholding income tax rate of 15%.\n\n## 36.5.3. Dividends payable\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  consolidated  balance  of  dividends  payable,  within  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial position, based on the 2020 earnings, is US$ 858 (US$ 1,558 as of December 31, 2019). Dividends payable attributable to shareholders of Petrobras amounts to US$ 849 as of December 31, 2020 (US$ 1,530 as of December 31, 2019), while dividends payable to non-controlling shareholders for US$ 9 (US$ 28 as of December 2019).",

        "page_content": "## a) Crude oil\n\nIn March 2020, in order to preserve the Company's liquidity, Petrobras approved a hedge strategy for exported oil already shipped but not priced mainly due to the high volatility of the current context, both due to the effects of the oil price drop and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global oil consumption.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  strategy,  from  April  2020,  transactions  using  forward  and  futures  contracts  were  carried  out.  Forward transactions  do  not  require  initial  disbursement,  whereas  future  transactions  require  margin  deposits,  depending  on  the volume contracted.\n\n## b) Crude oil, diesel and gasoline - 2019\n\nCrude oil - results relate to put options referenced in the average Brent oil prices, with strike price of US$ 60/barrel to protect production. However, in the third quarter of 2019, based on the significant reduction in cash flow uncertainties concerning the Business and Management Plan for 2019, Petrobras sold the put options.\n\nDiesel and gasoline - results relate to non-deliverable forwards (NDF) derivatives contracted in 2018 as a hedge strategy for gasoline and diesel prices and foreign exchange rates, aiming at giving additional flexibility to the pricing policy at that time.\n\n## c) Other commodity derivative transactions\n\nPetrobras, by use of its assets, positions and market knowledge from its operations in Brazil and abroad, occasionally seeks to optimize some of its commercial operations in the international market, with the use of commodity derivatives to manage price risk.\n\n## 38.3. Foreign exchange risk management\n\nThe Company's Risk Management Policy provides for, as an assumption, an integrated risk management that extends to the whole corporation, pursuing the benefit from the diversification of its businesses.\n\nBy managing its foreign exchange risk, the Company takes into account the cash flows derived from its operations as a whole. This concept is especially applicable to the risk relating to the exposure of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar, in which future cash flows in U.S. dollar, as well as cash flows in Brazilian Real affected by the fluctuation between both currencies, such as cash flows derived from diesel and gasoline sales in the domestic market, are assessed in an integrated manner.\n\nAccordingly, the financial risk management mainly involves structured actions encompassing the business of the Company.\n\nChanges in the Real/U.S. dollar spot rate, as well as foreign exchange variation of the Real against other foreign currencies, may affect net income and the statement of financial position due to the exposures in foreign currencies, such as high probable future transactions, monetary items and firm commitments.\n\nThe  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  the  effect  of  potential  variations  in  the  Real/U.S.  dollar  spot  rates  mainly  raising  funds denominated  in  US  dollars,  aiming  at  reducing  the  net  exposure  between  obligations  and  receipts  in  this  currency,  thus representing a form of structural protection that takes into account criteria of liquidity and cost competitiveness.\n\nForeign exchange variation on future exports denominated in U.S. Dollar in a given period are efficiently hedged by the US dollar debt portfolio taking into account changes in such portfolio over time.\n\nThe foreign  exchange risk  management strategy  may involve the use of derivative  financial instruments to hedge  certain liabilities, mitigating foreign exchange rate risk exposure, especially when the Company is exposed to a foreign currency in which no cash inflows are expected, for example, the Pound Sterling.\n\nIn  the short-term, the foreign exchange risk is managed by applying resources in cash or cash equivalent denominated in Brazilian Real, U.S. Dollar or in another currency.",

The foreign exchange variation accounted for these operations within other comprehensive income up to the end of the first quarter remains in shareholders' equity, and will be reclassified to the statement of income when exports occur.\n\nAccording to the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, there is an increase in expected exports compared to the expected in the first quarter and consequently in highly probable future exports, but not in an amount equal to or greater than the finance debt and lease liabilities subject to designation as hedge instruments. As a result, the relevant increase in Dollar/Real exposure observed during 2020 remains at December 31, 2020, as presented in item (c) below.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a US$ 1 gain within foreign exchange gains (losses) due to ineffectiveness (a US$ 9 gain in 2019).\n\nIn  addition,  a  portion  of  exports  designated  for  hedge  relationships,  from  April  to  December  2020  and  from  August  to December 2021, were no longer expected to occur, and the corresponding foreign exchange variation were recycled from shareholder's equity to the statement of income in 2020, in the amount of US$ 572 (of which US$ 510 was redesignated in the first quarter of 2020).\n\nThe average ratio of future exports for which cash flow hedge accounting was designated to the highly probable future exports is 100%.\n\nA roll-forward schedule of cumulative foreign exchange losses recognized in other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2020 is set out below:",

Only a portion of the Company's forecast exports are considered highly probable.\n\nThe Company's future exports are exposed to the risk of variation in the Brazilian Real/U.S. dollar spot rate, which is offset by the converse exposure to the same type of risk with respect to its debt denominated in US dollar.\n\nThe  hedge  relationships are assessed  on  a  monthly  basis  and  they  may  cease  and  may  be  re-designated  in  order  to achieve  the  risk management strategy.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses relating to the effective portion of such hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income within finance income (expense) in the periods when the hedged item affects the statement of income. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in finance income (expense).\n\nWhenever  a  portion  of  future  exports  for  a  certain  period,  for  which  their  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  hedging relationship has been designated  is  no  longer  highly  probable,  the  Company  revokes  the  designation  and  the  cumulative foreign  exchange  gains  or  losses  that have been recognized in other comprehensive income remain separately in equity until the forecast exports occur.",

Likewise, whenever a  hedged  transaction  effectively  occurs,  its  financial  instrument  previously  designated  as  a  hedging  instrument  may  be designated for a new hedge relationship.\n\nThe gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in finance income (expense). Ineffectiveness may occur as hedged items and hedge instruments have different maturity dates and due to discount rate used to determine their present value.\n\n## b) Information on ongoing contracts\n\n## Cross currency swap - Pounds Sterling x Dollar\n\nIn 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Petrobras Global Trading B.V. (PGT), entered into cross currency swaps maturing in 2026 and 2034, with notional amounts of \u00a3 700 million and \u00a3 600 million, respectively, in order to hedge its Pounds/U.S. Dollar exposure arising from bonds issued amounting to \u00a3 1,300.\n\n## Non Deliverable Forward (NDF) - Euro x Dollar and Pounds Sterling x Dollar\n\nIn 2018, the Company, also through PGT, entered into non deliverable forwards, in other to reduce its euro x dollar and pounds x dollar exposures raised by bonds issued.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, net notional amount of pounds x dollars derivative changed to \u00a3 354 million, while the position in Euros was terminated.\n\n## Swap contracts - National consumer price index (IPCA) x Brazilian interbank offering rate (CDI) and CDI x Dollar\n\nIn  September  2019,  Petrobras  contracted  a  cross  currency  swap  aiming  to  protect  against  exposure  arising  from  the  7th issuance of debentures, settled on October 9, 2019, maturing in September 2029 and September 2034, and for CDI x U.S. Dollar operations, maturing in September 2024 and September 2029.\n\nChanges in future interest rate curves (CDI) may have an impact on the Company's results, due to the market value of these swap contracts. A sensitivity analysis on CDI with a constant increase (parallel shock) of 100 basis points, all other variables remaining constant, would result in a US$ 71 loss, while a constant reduction (parallel shock) of 100 basis points, would result in a US$ 70 gain.\n\n## c) Sensitivity analysis for foreign exchange risk on financial instruments\n\nA  sensitivity  analysis  is  set  out  below,  showing  the  probable  scenario  for  foreign  exchange  risk  on  financial  instruments, computed based on external data along with stressed scenarios (a 25% and a 50% change in the foreign exchange rates), except for  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  subsidiaries,  when  transacted  in  a  currency  equivalent  to  their  respective  functional currencies.",

Interest rate risk management\n\nThe Company considers that interest rate risk does not create a significant exposure and therefore, preferably does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, except for specific situations faced by certain subsidiaries of Petrobras.\n\n| Risk     |   Probable  Scenario (*) |   Reasonably  possible   scenario |   Remote   Scenario |\n|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| LIBOR 1M |                       10 |                                12 |                  14 |\n| LIBOR 3M |                       13 |                                15 |                  17 |\n| LIBOR 6M |                      414 |                               463 |                 512 |\n| CDI      |                       83 |                               104 |                 125 |\n| TJLP     |                       84 |                               105 |                 126 |\n| IPCA     |                       77 |                                96 |                 115 |\n|          |                      681 |                               795 |                 909 |\n\n## 38.5. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk management in Petrobras aims to mitigate risk of not collecting receivables, financial deposits or collateral from third parties or financial institutions through efficient credit analysis, granting and management based on quantitative and qualitative parameters that are appropriate for each market segment in which the Company operates.\n\nThe commercial credit portfolio is broad and diversified and comprises clients from the domestic and foreign markets. Credit granted to financial institutions is related to collaterals received, cash surplus invested and derivative financial instruments. It is spread among 'investment grade' international banks rated by international rating agencies and Brazilian banks with low credit risk.",

Thus, for the definition and monitoring of credit limits, management evaluates the customer's field of activity, commercial relationship, financial relationship with Petrobras and its financial statements, among other aspects.\n\n## b) Other financial assets\n\nCredit quality of cash and cash equivalents, as well as marketable securities is based on external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. The credit quality of those financial assets, that are neither past due nor considered to be credit impaired, are set out below:\n\n|               | Cash and cash equivalents   | Cash and cash equivalents   | Marketable securities   | Marketable securities   |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|               | 12.31.2020                  | 12.31.2019                  | 12.31.2020              | 12.31.2019              |\n| AA            | 1,995                       | 1,053                       | -                       | -                       |\n| A             | 2,363                       | 1,173                       | -                       | -                       |\n| BBB           | 168                         | 41                          | -                       | -                       |\n| BB            | 4,154                       | 3,591                       | -                       | 838                     |\n| AAA.br        | 673                         | 80                          | 652                     | 33                      |\n| AA.br         | 1,960                       | 1,224                       | 43                      | 48                      |\n| Other ratings | 398                         | 210                         | 8                       | 27                      |\n|               | 11,711                      | 7,372                       | 703                     | 946                     |\n\n## 38.6. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe possibility of a shortage of cash or other financial assets in order to settle the Company's obligations on the agreed dates and is managed by the Company based on policies such as:\n\n- \u00b7 centralization of cash management, optimization of the level of cash and cash equivalents held and reduction of working capital;\n- \u00b7 maintenance of an adequate cash balance to ensure that cash need for investments and short-term obligations is met even in adverse market conditions;\n- \u00b7 increase in the average debt maturity, increase in funding sources from domestic and international markets (new markets and financial products); and\n- \u00b7 funds under the partnership and divestment program.\n\nFollowing  its  liability  management  strategy,  the  Company  regularly  evaluates  market  conditions  and  may  enter  into transactions to repurchase its own securities or those of its affiliates, through a variety of means, including tender offers, make whole exercises and open market repurchases, in order to improve its debt repayment profile and cost of debt.\n\n## 38.6.1. Measures to protect the Company's liquidity\n\nAs a result of the sharp reduction in prices and demand for oil and oil products caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in  the  economy  around  the  world,  the  Company  adopted  a  set  of  measures  to  reduce  disbursements  and  preserve  cash generation, in order to reinforce its financial strength and the resilience of its businesses.\n\nThese measures are described in note 6.",

        "page_content": "## 38.7. Insurance\n\nThe Company's insurance strategy involves acquiring insurance to cover risks that may produce material impacts and  to cover risks that are subject to compulsory insurance coverage (pursuant to legal or contractual requirements). The remaining risks are self-insured and Petrobras intentionally assumes the entire risk by abstaining from contracting insurance. The Company assumes a significant portion of its risk, by entering into insurance policies that have deductible clauses up to the equivalent to US$180.\n\nAdditionally, the Company has indemnify clauses in its bylaws, as set out in note 39.\n\nThe main information concerning the insurance coverage outstanding at December 31, 2020 is set out below:\n\n| Assets                                                                    | Types of coverage                               | Amount insured   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Facilities, equipment inventory and products inventory                    | Fire, operational  risks and engineering  risks | 124,493          |\n| Tankers and auxiliary vessels                                             | Hulls                                           | 3,341            |\n| Fixed platforms,  floating production systems and offshore drilling units | Oil risks                                       | 48,786           |\n| Total                                                                     |                                                 | 176,620          |\n\nPetrobras does not have loss of earnings insurance or insurance related to automobiles and pipeline networks in Brazil.\n\n## 39. Related-party transactions\n\nThe Company has a related-party transactions policy, which is annually revised and approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Company's by-laws.\n\nIn order to ensure the goals of the Company are achieved and to align them with transparency of processes and corporate governance best practices, this policy guides Petrobras while entering into related-party transactions and dealing with potential conflicts of interest on these transactions, based on the following assumptions and provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Prioritization of the Company's interests regardless of the counterparty;\n- \u00b7 Arm's length basis;\n- \u00b7 Compliance  with  market  conditions,  especially  concerning  terms,  prices  and  guarantees  or  with  adequate compensatory payment;\n- \u00b7 Accurate and timely disclosure in accordance with applicable authorities.\n\nThe Audit Committee must approve in advance transactions between the Company and its associates, entities controlled by key management personnel or by their close family members, the Brazilian Federal Government, including its agencies or similar  bodies and controlled entities, taking into account the materiality established by this policy. The Audit Committee reports monthly to the Board of Directors.\n\nTransactions with the Brazilian Federal Government, including its agencies or similar bodies and controlled entities, which are under  the  scope  of  Board  of  Directors  approval,  must  be  preceded  by  the  Audit  Committee  and  Minority  Shareholders Committee assessment and must have prior approval of, at least, 2/3 of the board members.\n\nThe related-party transactions policy also aims to ensure an adequate and diligent decision-making process for the Company's key management.",

Petroleum and alcohol account - receivables from the Brazilian Government\n\nPursuant  to  Provisional  Measure  2,181  of  August  24,  2001,  the  Brazilian  Federal  Government  may  settle  the  balance  of receivables  related  to  the  Petroleum  and  Alcohol  accounts  by  using  National  Treasury  Notes  in  an  amount  equal  to  the outstanding  balance,  or  allow  the  Company  to  offset  the  outstanding  balance  against  amounts  payable  to  the  Federal Government, including taxes payable, or both.\n\nFollowing several negotiation attempts at the administrative level, the Company filed a lawsuit in July 2011 to collect the receivables.\n\nOn November 30, 2020, since there was no possibility of impugnment because the decision was final, the precatory was sent to the Federal Regional Court of the 2nd Region. The amount of US$ 476 (R$ 2,473 million), will be indexed up to the date of the effective payment. The Company expects to receive the amount in the first half of 2022.\n\nAccordingly, the Company recorded the amount of US$ 235 within net finance income (expense), including inflation indexation and interests, of which US$ 228 arises from the update relating to the difference between the Reference Rate and the IPCA-E of the outstanding balance.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the balance of receivables related to the Petroleum and Alcohol accounts is US$ 482 (US$ 304 as of December 31, 2019), recorded within non-current assets. Thus, no amounts remain classified as a contingent asset as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## 39.3. Compensation of key management personnel\n\nThe criteria for compensation of employees and officers are established based on the relevant labor legislation and the Company's Positions, Salaries and Benefits Plan (Plano de Cargos e Sal\u00e1rios e de Benef\u00edcios e Vantagens).",

The Company transfers substantially all of its Brazilian crude oil and gas production to the Refining, Transportation & Marketing segment in Brazil. The internal transfer prices calculated by the Company's model may not be indicative of the price the Company would have realized had this production been sold in an unregulated spot market. Additionally, the prices calculated by the Company's model may not be indicative of the future prices to be realized by the Company. Gas prices used are those set out in contracts with third parties.\n\nProduction costs are lifting  costs  incurred  to  operate  and  maintain  productive  wells  and  related  equipment  and  facilities, including operating employees' compensation, materials, supplies, fuel consumed in operations and operating costs related to natural gas processing plants.\n\nExploration  expenses  include  the  costs  of  geological  and  geophysical  activities  and  projects  without  economic  feasibility.

The project  to  extract  the  hydrocarbons  must  have  commenced  or  there  must  be  reasonable  certainty  that  the  project  will commence within a reasonable time. Reserves estimate involves a high degree of judgment and complexity and its application affects different items of these Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's estimated net proved oil and gas reserves and changes thereto for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented in the following table. Proved reserves are estimated in accordance with the reserve definitions prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nProved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered: (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is done by means not involving a well.\n\nProved reserves for which substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required are named proved undeveloped reserves.\n\nReserve estimates are subject to variations due to technical uncertainties in the reservoir and changes in economic scenarios. A summary of the annual changes in the proved reserves of oil is as follows (in millions of barrels):\n\n|                                               | Consolidated Entities    Equity Method Investees   | Consolidated Entities    Equity Method Investees   | Consolidated Entities    Equity Method Investees   | Consolidated Entities    Equity Method Investees   | Consolidated Entities    Equity Method Investees   |                               |                      |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| Proved developed and  undeveloped reserves(*) | Crude oil  in Brazil                               | Crude Oil  in South   America                      | Crude Oil  in North   America                      | Synthetic Oil  in Brazil                           | Consolidated  Total                                | Crude Oil  in North   America | Crude Oil  in Africa | Total   |\n| Reserves at December 31, 2017 (1)             | 8,249.4                                            | 1.2                                                | 114.6                                              | 6.0                                                | 8,371.3                                            | -

Future  price  changes  are  limited  to  those  provided  by  contractual arrangements existing at the end of each reporting year. Future development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures  necessary  to  develop  and  produce  year-end  estimated  proved  reserves  based  on  current  costs,  assuming continuing economic conditions. Estimated future income taxes (including future social contributions on net income - CSLL) are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. The amounts presented as future income taxes expenses reflect allowable deductions considering statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10% midperiod discount factors. This discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when the future expenditures will be incurred and when the reserves will be produced.\n\nThe valuation prescribed under Codification Topic 932 - Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an indication of Petrobras' future cash flows or the value of its oil and gas reserves.",
