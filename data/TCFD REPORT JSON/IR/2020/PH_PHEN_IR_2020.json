In Alaminos and Palauig, a total of 8, 645 kg of plastic waste from solar panel packaging have been recycled into eco bricks to be used as construction materials for solar plant facilities.\n\n## Protecting the Turtles\n\nIn the coastal town of Bangui, species of endangered marine turtles have been observed laying eggs and nesting along the shoreline of the bay. Through awareness campaigns and continuous coordination with the locals, the danger of poaching and smuggling of the eggs have signi fi cantly decreased, with the residents acting as guardians of the endangered species, becoming partners of AC Energy in turtle conservation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLand protected and restored\n\n910 hectares\n\nSustainability Investments\n\n/peso\n\nfrom 2018 to 2020\n\n151.51M\n\n## Capacity Building\n\nWith various training workshops to build their skills, local residents learn sustainable farming techniques such as contour hedgerow and watershed systems at AC Energy's model farm in Ilocos Norte. They are also taught how to produce mushrooms, ginger, ube, and other root crops, fruits and vegetables. Today, there are close to 2,000 fruit trees of cacao, co /ff ee, calamansi and cashe w fl ourishing in the farm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Birds of the Conservation Estate\n\nIn Ilocos Norte, residents have discovered the value of protecting nature, and have become stewards of AC Energy's Conservation Estate. The forests witness an increase in biodiversity as AC Energy and its wind farms, North Luzon Renewables and NorthWind, with the help of the locals, create an ecologically diverse landscape. The forest is now home to 117 species of birds, 33 of which are endemic, and four are classi fi ed as vulnerable.",

Amidst the continuing challenges, we recognize the tremendous sacri fi ce and service of our many healthcare and economic frontliners. We deeply appreciate all that you continue to do for the country.\n\n## Strong Bayanihan spirit\n\nOn behalf of the entire Ayala Group, we give our sincere thanks to the entire AC Energy team for its unwavering commitment to go the extra mile to ensure stable and reliable access to power for our communities, especially during these times. We extend our deepest gratitude to our various energy frontliners, some of whom have had to stay at our powerplants and away from their families for several months in order to provide power for commerce, industry and everyone working and schooling from home.\n\nWe also thank our colleagues at AC Energy for going beyond the call of duty and contributing resources in th e fi ght against COVID-19. Your assistance in establishing treatment facilities early during the pandemic was greatly appreciated. We are delighted to see the strong spirit of Bayanihan in our organization, and hope that we can sustain this moving forward.\n\nAs our understanding of the pandemic deepens, we believe that there is now a renewed appreciation of the interconnectedness of communities and the infrastructure that hold these together. We recognize that complex global issues, such as the pandemic, economic inequality, and climate change, trace their roots to failures in fully integrating sustainability principles to decision-making and operations. In the same vein, embracing sustainability will be our way forward in addressing these intricate global challenges. We are encouraged that several governments and private institutions, including many in the Philippines, are renewing their commitments to these same principles.\n\n## Green-led recovery\n\nAmidst plans to revive our economy, we believe that we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to 'build back better' towards a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive future as we steadily move the post-COVID world. Sustainable recovery is now seen as perhaps our best and only way forward to achieve our environmental goals to mitigate climate change, to create jobs, build economic resilience, and ultimately, improve the well-being of people. We are delighted that AC Energy has made signi fi cant progress along these fronts and continues to be recognized as a key contributor to sustainable growth and development.\n\nFor the past year, AC Energy Corporation or ACEN, remained focused on its renewables growth strategy through continuous renewable energy investments. Despite the di /ffi cult year, the company earmarked /peso 10 billion in CAPEX and augmented its generating capacity with the construction of two new solar plants, battery storage an d fi rming facilities in Luzon.  This brings ACEN's total attributable capacity to 1,034 MW, with almost half of the capacity coming from renewable sources. Our 2020 investments created more than 3000 jobs within our host communities and continue to be vital pieces towards reigniting the economy and creating economic activity.\n\nAs the country looks ahead to bounce back quickly from the pandemic, ACEN remains strongly committed to our vision of a sustainable energy future. In fact, we believe that this commitment to a green-led recovery is more important now than ever. Towards this end, we built our sustainability framework on three focus areas embedded across our business operations, governance, and culture. We aim to have a low carbon portfolio by 2030, protect the environment, and invest in our host communities.",

Plant availability increased by 29 percentage points for its thermal assets. These improvements were borne out of the plant renewal initiatives that the company carried out when it started the transformation journey in the middle of 2019.\n\nSecond, the company signi fi cantly improved its operating margins. This was largely driven by the ability to secure longer term contracts that provide more stable cas h fl ows. The company's agile energy portfolio also allowed the strategic sourcing of competitive priced electricity and fuel to help improve margins. Third, the company successfully completed the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMW\n\nTotal Attributable Capacity 1,034\n\nTotal Renewables Capacity\n\n491 MW\n\nAC Energy's exceptional performance in 2020 was driven by three factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet Income /peso 3.75B\n\nacquisition of additional stakes in three renewable projects in early 2020: the North Luzon Renewables wind farm in Ilocos Norte and Sacasol and Islasol solar farms in Negros Occidental. These acquisitions, with a total investmen t of /peso 7.4 billion pesos, were earnings accretive given the operational status of the power plants.\n\nTo further augment its generating capacity and notwithstanding the pandemic, the company carried out the constructio n of fi ve projects through 2020 totaling around 374 MW of gross capacity.\n\nThese projects include the 120 MW solar project and the 40 MWh battery storage project in Alaminos, Laguna, the 60 MW solar project in Palauig, Zambales, and the 150 MW quick response thermal plant in Pililia, Rizal. Th e company is also constructing a renewable energy laboratory in Mariveles, Bataan equivalent to a 4 MW hybrid solar plant integrated with an energy storage system, which will test various new technologies in solar and battery storage. This will help the company select the best technologies as it scales up its investments in solar and storage in the coming decade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSig nifi cantly improved operating margins\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuccessfully completed the acquisition of additional stakes in three renewable projects\n\nSig nifi cantly improved operating e /ffi ciencies and reliability",

We expect the share of renewables to signi fi cantly grow over time as the company focuses on scaling up its investments in solar and wind farms.\n\nThe company has also recently rea /ffi rmed the March 2020 Board decision to infuse the international assets of its parent, AC Energy and Infrastructure Corporation.\n\nThe international assets is comprised of approximately 1,400 MW of attributable capacity in operation and under construction across multiple geographies including Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia a nd India. 100% of these capacities are from renewable sources particularly solar, wind and geothermal.\n\nAfter the infusion is completed, this will increase AC Energy's attrib utable capacity to 2,400 MW, of which over 1,800 MW or 77% is from renewable sources. This puts AC Energy in an excellent position to attain its vision of reaching 5 GW of renewables by 2025, and realize its aspiration of becoming the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn order to achieve its bold ambition, the company is further strengthening its balance sheet and augmenting its cash position. In January 2021, the company completed its stock rights o /ff ering that raised /peso 5.4 billion from the issuance of 2.27 billion primary shares. This was followed by the successful completion of a private placement of 4 billion primary shares to GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. The private placement added aroun d /peso 11.9 billion of cash, resulting in a tota l of /peso 17.3 billion pesos of additional cash in th e fi rst quarter of 2021.\n\nThe planned infusion of the international assets and the recent fund raising will further grow the company's balance sheet by about three and a half times.\n\nOur strong balance sheet is complemented by a robust pipeline of renewable projects, and a highly capable and motivated team. This places AC Energy in an excellent position to play a meaningful role in the green-led recovery and to continue this journey as we all work towards our aspiration of becoming the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia.\n\nWe thank the entire AC Energy organization and its management team for a milestone 2020, despite the many challenges. We still have quite a journey ahead towards our full recovery, but encouraged that we have built a solid platform from which to continue our growth as a company, while contributing to the progress of the country.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, the management, and our entire team, our sincere appreciation to our shareholders and our many stakeholders for your continued trust and support. We remain committed to play a meaningful role in the green-led recovery, as we accelerate our investments in the midst of the sustainable energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In early 2020, AC Energy set to achieve ISO certi fi cation in the areas of Quality Management System (ISO 9001:2015), Environmental Management System (ISO 14001:2015) and Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001:201), with the aim to implement e /ff ective and robust processes to increase plant e /ffi ciency and productivity while generating consistent, measured and monitored output. AC Energy is targeting to secure the certi fi cations within 1H 2022.\n\nIn July 2020, Power Barge 102 in Iloilo had an unfortunate accident which led to an oil spill of about 268,000 liters of bunker fuel o /ff t he Iloilo strait.  The oil spill had been subsequently contained and collected using the Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Technique conducted by a third-party service provider. AC Energy collaborated with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources - Environment Management Bureau Region 6, the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation and Brand Marine Consultants to conduct continuous monitoring of the environment through the University of the Philippines Visayas. AC Energy places the health and safety of its people on top of its agenda.\n\n## PLANT OPTIMIZATION AND RELIABILITY\n\nFor its wind farms, AC Energy tapped WindESco for assessment studies to be conducted and enhancements to be implemented on its wind turbine operations, resulting in increase in energy yield for up to 95%. Detailed maintenance of its substations, feeders, switchgears and transmission lines also contribute to the improved availability of the plants.\n\nConsistently implementing health and safety protocols in its operations, SacaSol and IslaSol achieved 1 million safe manhours without LTA, alongside strict health protocols to address the threat of COVID-19 at the workplace.\n\n## HEALTH AND SAFETY AT THE FOREFRONT\n\nIn October of 2020, a senior executive was appointed to lead health and  safety and an immediate focus ensued to establish an enterprisewide health and safety progra m. The program aims to elevate and transform the  company's health and safety culture, review and  enhance policies, and establish proactive metrics.\n\nThe centerpiece of the program is a focused and plant-exclusive two-day Boot Camp to which leaders of each plant  were invited and exposed to various experiential and instructio nal sessions that underscore the importance of foundational health and safety practices such as stop-work authority, hazard identi fi cation, and empowerment.\n\nConstant, enjoyable, and rigorous weekly interactions between plant  and corporate Health and Safety Leads, meant to rei nforce the learnings and enhance collaboration, followed  the various Boot Camps.\n\nMost of all, the health and safety is a priority for plant leadership and demonstrated, among other ways, by the fact that it is their biggest deliverable, weight-wise, for 2021. Furthermore, the functional H&S leads deployed at each plant and site now feel they have strong corporate backing and support in the programs they need to implement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company conducts biodiversity assessments periodically to determine the types of species on these project sites and their vulnerability status, and invests on habitat protection and restoration. Since 2018, AC Energy has spent over \u20b1 34.87M towards initiatives that aim deliver a positive impact on biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nForestlands protected\n\n910 hectares\n\nInvestment on Environment\n\n/peso 34.87M\n\nTrees planted at the Conservation Estate\n\n~400,000\n\n## The Conservation Estate in Ilocos Norte\n\nSince reforestation initiatives began in the 700-hectare Conservation Estate, close to 400,000 seedlings have been planted, including endemic and fruit-bearing trees. The area has become an important wildlife habitat in the Northern Luzon region, and the forests witness an increase in biodiversity as AC Energy, with the help of the locals, create an ecologically diverse landscape through analogue forestry. And as the trees grow, the animals return - the forest is now home to 117 species of birds, 33 of which are endemic, and four are classi fi ed as vulnerable. Additionally, studies identi fi ed the presence of near-threatened monkey species, bats and other animals. AC Energy is constantly working with local communities, creating awareness on coastal environment protection, turtle conservation and biodiversity, to help them understand how their livelihood is directly linked to the natural resources and wildlife.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other Environmental Initiatives\n\nIn Bulacan, th e fi ve-year, 50-hectare Bininit Reforestation has been completed in partnership with the Bulacan Dumangat Community Association and MENRO-Bulacan, planting around 19,000 seedlings. In Guimaras, th e fi ve-year, 27-hectare Aroboretum Project has been completed, planting over 6,000 trees in the forest with the objective to be an educational resource for students. In Alaminos, in partnership with PUNLA, AC Energy has set a target to turnover around 132,000 seedlings in three years.",

In March 2021, AC Energy's Guimaras Wind signed an agreement with the Dumangas local govern ment to develop a fish sanctuary through the  placement of artificial reefs to supplement the habitat of marine life in the area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Integrating Circular Approach\n\nTo help reduce the environmental impact in its construction sites and host communities, AC Energy developed a program to sustainably use its resources, and eliminate waste by reusing or recyc ling them. In Alaminos and Pal auig construction sites, a total of 8,645 kg of plastic from solar panel packagi ng were upcycled into eco-bricks, which were then used as construction materials for the plant facilities.\n\nAC Energy aims to extend this circular approach and close the loop within its project locations through the development of Eco-hub recycling facilities. This program will not only help manage the issues on community plastic wastes, but will also create income and livelihood for the community. A partnership with the Provincial Government of Ilocos Norte is underway for implementation this year. It will be th e fi rst of many that AC Energy envisions to create within its developments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since 2014, the program has already produced 12 graduates.\n\n## Disaster Assistance Programs\n\nWith the increase in force and frequency of natural disasters, along with recovery costs, AC Energy has always ensured the quick implementation of measures to mitigate these events and leverage on the Ayala Group's strengths. AC Energy supported the a /ff ected communities of the Taal Volcano eruption by donating solar lamps to families who were living without access to electricity. In December 2020, in lieu of holiday festivities, AC Energy donated \u20b1 2.1M to Ayala Foundation in support of families in Luzon who were greatly impacted by typhoons Rolly and Ulysses. The company also mobilized truckloads of water and sent sacks of rice and medical supplies to the communities.

been commissioned by the management of AC Energy Corporation ('AC Energy' or 'the Company', SEC Identi fi cation Number: 069-039274) to undertake an independent assurance of the sustainability/nonfi nancial disclosures in AC Energy's 2020 Integrated Report (the 'Report') in its printed format for the year ended 31st December 2020. The intended users of this Assurance Statement are the management of the Company.\n\nWe performed this assurance engagement using DNV's assurance methodology VeriSustainTM, which is based on our professional experience, international assurance best practice including International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised*, along with the Global Reporting Initiative's ('GRI's') Principles for De fi ning Report Content and Report Quality and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board's ('SASB's') industry-speci fi c Standards. The veri fi cation engagement was carried out during December 2020 - April 2021.\n\nWe understand that the reporte d fi nancial data a nd related information are based on statutory disclosures and Audited Financial Statements#, which are subject to a separate independent statutory audit process. We did not revie w fi nancial disclosures and data a s they are not within the scope of our assurance engagement.\n\nWe planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion related to assurance of nonfi nancial sustainability disclosures in this Report. We are providing a 'limited level' of assurance based on DNV's VeriSustain, and no external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this assurance engagement.\n\nThe engagement excludes the sustainability management, performance, and reporting practices of AC Energy's suppliers, contractors, and any third parties mentioned in the Report. The Company's position statements, the statements for the management approach, and case studies and examples are excluded from the scope of our work.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Management of AC Energy Corporation and of the Assurance Provider\n\nThe Board of AC Energy has sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report and is responsible for all information provided in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting the information presented in the Report. AC Energy has stated that this Report has been prepared based on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework (the '<IR> Framework') and has adopted general disclosures and selected topic-speci fi c disclosures related to identi fi ed material topics from the GRI Standards 2016, selected GRI Standards (2018 and 2020) as well as the SASB Standards 2018 (Electrical Utilities) and disclosures related to the Task Force for Climate-Related Disclosures.\n\nDNV's assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data a nd information provided by the Company to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith, true, and free from material misstatements. Because of the selected nature (sampling) and other inherent limitation of both procedures and systems of internal control, there remains the unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities, possibly signi fi cant, may not have been detected. DNV was not involved in the preparation of any statement or datum included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement.  DNV expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Assurance Statement.\n\nOur veri fi cation engagement included a limited level of veri fi cation of sustainability performance disclosures for the identi fi ed material topics of AC Energy. This is as identi fi ed under the reporting boundary which has been brought out in the Report in the section 'Materiality', that is, covering entities over which AC Energy has operational control or has seconded employees in operations. Our veri fi cation applies a \u00b15% uncertainty threshold towards errors and omissions for the performance data brought out in the Report.",

As part of our assurance engagement, we adopted a risk-based approach, i.e. we concentrated our veri fi cation e /ff orts on the issues of high material relevance to AC Energy and its key stakeholders. A multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed nonfi nancial disclosures related to the Head O /ffi ce at Makati City, and selected entities of AC Energy (South Luzon Thermal Energy Corporation (SLTEC) and North Luzon Renewables Corp. (NLR) in the Philippines), based on DNV's sampling plan. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions, we carried out remote assessments as one-to-one discussions and onsite location assessments were not feasible. We undertook the following activities:\n\n- \u25cf Review of the nonfi nancial sustainability disclosures in this Report;\n- \u25cf Review of approaches to materiality determination and stakeholder engagement; DNV did not have any direct engagement with external stakeholders;\n- \u25cf Review of information provided to us by the Company on its reporting and management processes related to sustainability performance for the reporting year based on the reporting framework adopted by AC Energy;\n- \u25cf Interviews with selected members of leadership team, and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability issues and review of selected evidence to support issues discussed. We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with overall responsibility for the programmes to deliver the targets for medium- and long-term vision, mission and milestones;\n- \u25cf Performed desk review of selected sustainability parameters for sampled entities, an d fi ndings were discussed and resolved with the Corporate Sustainability Team;\n- \u25cf Carried out remote assessments with teams at SLTEC and NLR to review the processes and systems for preparing site level sustainability data a nd implementation of sustainability strategy. We were free to choose the sites for remote assessment or veri fi cation;\n- \u25cf Review of supporting evidence for key claims and data disclosed in the Report. Our veri fi cation processes were prioritized based on our risk-based approach, i.e. relevance of identi fi ed material topics and sustainability context of the business; and\n- \u25cf Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating the performance data a nd, for a sample, checking the data consolidation at site and corporate levels.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are shorter in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. During the assurance process, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement.\n\n## Opinion and Observations\n\nOn the basis of the assurance engagement undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that AC Energy's 2020 Integrated Report does not properly describe the nonfi nancial performance of identi fi ed material topics based on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework ('<IR> Framework'). Without a /ff ecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations against the principles of VeriSustain:\n\n## Stakeholder Inclusiveness\n\nThe participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to Sustainability.\n\n## Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness.\n\nThe Report brings out investors and shareholders, customers, business partners and suppliers, government and regulators, employees and community as the key stakeholder groups with whom the Company actively engages and collaborates to create long term shared value. The Report explains the various formal and informal modes of engagement through which AC Energy understands various needs and concerns of stakeholders and involve them in business processes.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe process of determining the issues that are most relevant to an organization and its stakeholders.\n\n## Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Materiality.\n\nThe Report presents a description of how the Company carried out a materiality assessment exercise considering the SASB Materiality Map, GRI Standards and other global environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, as well as the Company's business strategy, capitals and stakeholder concerns. The process also involved prioritization of the topics identi fi ed for bringing out within the Report, considering views from various internal stakeholders and validation and review by the senior management teams.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nThe extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues.\n\n## Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Responsiveness.\n\nThe Report brings out AC Energy's responses and strategies related to identi fi ed material topics and key stakeholder concerns through disclosures on management approach, governance, policies and appropriate performance indicators from selected GRI Topic Speci fi c Standards and SASB accounting metrics. The Report also bring about the Company's creation of value across the six capitals of <IR> framework and how it measures its impact on the economy, society and environment; however, the Company may strengthen its disclosures related to interconnectedness of di /ff erent capitals as well as disclosures on long-term targets and strategies towards value creation related to identi fi ed material topics.\n\n## Reliability\n\nThe accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying data management systems.\n\n## Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Reliability.\n\nThe majority of the performance disclosures veri fi ed through o /ff site veri fi cation, i.e. at the Head O /ffi ce and sampled sites, and through desk reviews and remote veri fi cation, were found to be fairly accurate, reliable, identi fi able and traceable to the source. Considering the limited sampling, we did not detect any major errors related to data collection or aggregation. We also reviewed the calculations and related assumptions used for its suitability, taking into account the principle of Reliability. Some of the data inaccuracies identi fi ed during the veri fi cation process were found to be attributable to interpretation and aggregation errors. These identi fi ed errors were communicated, and the responses and corrections made to the reported data a nd information were reviewed.\n\n## Completeness\n\nHow much of all the information that has been identi fi ed as material to the organization and its stakeholders is reported.\n\n## Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Completeness.\n\nThe Report brings out the Company's nonfi nancial disclosures considering the Content Elements of the <IR> framework while its performance during the reporting period related to its identi fi ed material issues for the identi fi ed boundary of operations in the Philippines are brought out using appropriate GRI Topic Speci fi c Standards and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) accounting metrics.\n\n## Neutrality\n\nThe extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organization's performance, delivered in a neutral tone.",

We have complied with the DNV Code of Conduct   during the assurance engagement and maintain independence wherever required by relevant ethical requirements.\n\nThis engagement work was carried out by an independent team of sustainability assurance professionals. DNV was not involved in the preparation of any statement or datum included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement. DNV maintains complete impartiality toward internal stakeholders interviewed during the assurance process.\n\nDNV has provided assurance to Ayala Corporation, Manila Water Company Inc., Ayala Land Inc., Globe Telecom, Inc and the Bank of Philippine Islands. In our opinion, there is no con fl ict of interest in the assurance engagement provided to the business units of Ayala Group. DNV did not provide any service to AC Energy in 2020 that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our work.\n\n7th April 2021, Manila, Philippines\n\nDNV GL AS Philippines Branch is part of DNV - Business Assurance, a global provider of certi fi cation, veri fi cation, assessment and training services, helping customers to build sustainable business performance. www.dnv.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Report of the Audit Committee to the Board of Directors For the Year Ended 31 December 2020\n\nThe Board-approved Audit Committee ('the Committee') Charter de fi nes the duties and responsibilities of the Committee.
