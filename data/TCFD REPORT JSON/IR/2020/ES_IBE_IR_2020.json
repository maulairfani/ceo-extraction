Gal\u00e1n\n\nChairman & CEO of Iberdrola\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe year 2020 has marked a turning point in terms of the convergence towards sustainable development  worldwide.  The  plans  devised to  overcome  the  health  and  economic  crisis coincide in their focus on a transition to safer, cleaner and more competitive energy systems as the best way of jump-starting the economy and creating quality jobs. The European Union has once again shown its leadership in this field by embracing the Green Deal, approved at the beginning of the year, as one of the main tools for recovery on the Continent.\n\nThis  scenario  confirms  Iberdrola's  pioneering commitment  to  the  generation  of  sustainable value for the triangle formed by shareholders, employees and society. Based on investments\n\nin renewable energy, smart grids and storage, our model has enabled us to cement our position as a world leader in the energy industry, and Iberdrola is now one of the three largest electricity companies worldwide and the company with the largest weight on the Spanish stock exchange.\n\n## Outlook 2020-2025\n\nIn November 2020, Iberdrola unveiled the most ambitious investment plan in its history, totalling 75,000  million  euros  until  2025.  51%  of  this amount  will  be  allocated  to  promoting  clean energy,  with  the  aim  of  doubling  the  group's renewable capacity in only 5 years and reaching 60,000 MW by the end of the period. Electrical grids, the backbone of the ecological transition, will  receive  the  second-largest  share  of  the investment, accounting for 40% of the total, in order to grow that our base of grid assets by 150%. The remaining 9% will be invested in new  products  and  services  that  address  the needs of our customers in a context of evergrowing electrification of energy uses along with increased digitalisation.\n\nThe plan will also help to strengthen the group's internationalisation: the organic investments in all our markets are in addition to the integrations of PNM Resources in the United States, Aalto Power in France, CEB-D in Brazil, and Infigen in Australia, as well as the entry into new countries like  Sweden,  Japan  and  Poland  through  the acquisition of a portfolio of offshore wind projects.\n\nIberdrola is committed to the creation of sustainable value for shareholders, employees and society.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Along these lines, we will intensify our efforts to promote gender equality, with a view to reaching the target of 30% of women in management positions in comparison with the current 20%.\n\nThe expected growth in business will also enable us to continue increasing our tax contribution, currently standing at approximately 7,500 million euros.\n\nIn the environmental area, we will continue to reduce our emissions (which now come to only 98 g/kWh and are thus two-thirds lower than the  European  average),  achieving  emission neutrality in Europe by 2030.\n\nIn  order  to  continue  to  foster  the  company's sustainability,  efficiency  and  competitiveness, we will strengthen our commitment to R&D and\n\nwill further increase the investment in innovation, currently coming to 300 million euros per year.\n\nThese initiatives fit  within  our  Governance and Sustainability System, which endorses the best corporate governance practices.\n\nIn view of all of the foregoing, Iberdrola sees the coming years as an opportunity to strengthen its sustainable enterprise, in order to continue to create value for our shareholders, our employees and the society we serve.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Confronting this serious threat requires not only the commitment of companies and consumers, but also that of regulators and public institutions, which should adopt appropriate energy policies and regulations.\n\nThe year 2020 saw the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, in which it was agreed to limit the increase in the global temperature to less than 2\u00baC by the end of the century and to continue the efforts to limit the increase to 1.5\u00baC, with a commitment to reach peak GHG emissions as soon as possible and begin to reduce them until achieving carbon neutrality. Since then a total of 189 countries have signed this Agreement.\n\nThe energy sector is an important player, responsible for over 75% of CO2 emissions, for  which  reason  its  contribution  is  essential  to  achieving  the  Paris  Agreement's decarbonisation targets, and neutrality by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Current energy context\n\nAccording to the IPCC 1 , achieving this goal will require a 45% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to those in 2010 and achieving zero net emissions by 2050. This puts electricity from renewable sources at the epicentre of decarbonisation, with the need to electrify sectors like transport and buildings, in which polluting energies still play a predominant role.\n\n## Increase in electricity demand\n\nSeveral  bodies,  including  the  International  Energy Agency (IEA), emphasise that progressive electrification  of  the  economy  will  cause  global demand for electricity to increase over the period, reaching 41,000 TWh 2 by 2050.\n\n## Electrification of final demand\n\nElectricity's share of total energy consumption is thus expected to rise from 20% this year to 37% by 2050 2 .\n\n## Mass use of renewable resources\n\nThis  electrification  of  consumption  will  require  2.5 times current renewable capacity, to around 7,000 GW, by the end of this decade 3 , in order to replace existing  thermal  capacity  and  meet  the  demand arising from new uses like transport, buildings and industry, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Global Warming of 1.5 \u00baC.\n- (2) Source: Data calculated internally based on the Sustainable Development scenario in the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2020.\n- (3) Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) (2020).

Major institutions and social and political leaders are proposing that the recovery is an opportunity to drive the transition towards a new socioeconomic model that is climate-neutral, resilient, sustainable and inclusive. This is known as the Green Recovery, a vision to which the Iberdrola group is fully committed.\n\nThe transformative tendencies of the energy sector are intensifying, while action in the fight against climate change is growing around the world:\n\n- \u25cf The urgent need to drive decarbonisation , a key element of which is widespread use of renewable energy and investment in electrical networks.\n- \u25cf The gradual green  electrification of energy uses and demand for new services will empower customers, putting them at the centre of the transition.\n- \u25cf Innovation and technological progress will accelerate a reduction in the cost of renewables, which, together with greater digitalisation and efficiency, will allow for the acceleration of electrification.\n\n## Challenges and opportunities\n\n## Challenges\n\n- \u25cf Higher demand for cleaner and more sustainable energy within a scenario of decarbonisation of the entire economy.\n- \u25cf Management  of  higher  electricity  consumption due to  the  electrification  of  the  economy,  which will require increased grid usage.\n- \u25cf Management  of  a  competitive  scenario  for electricity prices over the medium and long term.\n- \u25cf Implementation  of  a  historic  investment  plan aimed at strengthening the company's business model, based on more renewable energy, more networks, more storage and more smart solutions for its customers.\n- \u25cf Reaching  higher  levels  of  efficiency  both  in production and in the improved use of electricity by  customers,  by  innovating  to  improve  the technology and digitalisation in operations.\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- \u25cf Strong  and  diversified  business  model in  all areas: by businesses (continually adjusting units and products to compete in different scenarios), geographies and technologies and market access.\n- \u25cf Global expansion by countries and businesses, focused  on  those  with  ambitious  climate  and energy targets.\n- \u25cf Proven management and implementation capabilities, with a track record of growth based on preservation of know-how, focus on customers and  ESG,  and  an  efficient  combination  of  a global model with local capabilities. The company will continue to strengthen its leadership in the environmental,  social  and  governance  areas (ESG) through 2025.\n- \u25cf Tremendous  experience  in  the  development and  construction  of  renewables  and  networks (maintaining control of key activities and operations to ensure growth), as well as in retail sales.\n- \u25cf Leader  in efficiency , based  on  digitalisation, the  exchange  of  best  practices  and  exploiting economies  of  scale,  as  well  as  a  culture  of innovation.\n- \u25cf Green  hydrogen  is  becoming  a  new  growth opportunity, as a strategic vector for the industrial segment  and  for  sectors  that  are  difficult  to decarbonise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, over 5,000 MW of solar photovoltaic and onshore wind capacity will be placed into operation during the period. In Networks, construction  of  the  $950  million  New  England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission line continues, with placement into operation in mid-2023. There are also multiple growth opportunities, totalling more than \u20ac11,000 million Added to all this will be the assets of PNM Resources, as the acquisition is expected to be formalised in the second half of 2021.\n\n## Brazil :\n\nThe company has acquired a lot in the electricity transmission line auction held in December 2020, which is in addition to the eleven lots won in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 auctions. ANEEL also plans to  hold  auctions  in  the  2021-2025  period,  which present  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  more  than 44,000 million reais of organic growth in Brazil. In January  2021  the  Brazilian  competition  regulator CADE  approved  Neoenergia's  acquisition  of  the electricity distribution arm of Companhia Energ\u00e9tica de Brasilia. In renewables, installed capacity in wind and photovoltaic projects will increase by 2,700 MW over the 2020-2025 period.\n\n## United Kingdom:\n\nThe  East  Anglia  ONE  offshore  wind  project  was brought into operation in 2020, and new offshore wind auctions are being held.\n\nOver 1,700 MW of onshore wind and photovoltaic capacity will also be placed into operation.\n\n## Spain :\n\n7,500 MW of renewable capacity is expected to be added over the 2020-2025 period. Of this, almost 6,500 MW will be photovoltaic, the main projects being Francisco Pizarro, Ceclav\u00edn, Arenales, Puertollano and Campo Ara\u00f1uelo.\n\nThis is in addition to the construction of the largest green hydrogen plant for industrial use in Europe, with 800 MW\n\n## International:\n\nInstalled capacity will increase by nearly 7,000 MW over the period, notably due to the growth in solar and onshore wind in Australia, together with the St. Brieuc (France) and Baltic Eagle (Germany) offshore wind projects. More than 1,100 MW in hydroelectric capacity will also be added in Portugal.\n\n## Efficiency in operations and investments\n\n- \u25cf Over the years, Iberdrola has maintained a constant focus on operational excellence as well as on the efficiency of its investments by optimising processes, standardisation and capturing synergies over the lifetime of the investment.\n- \u25cf Building on the progress made last year, efficiencies of almost \u20ac1,500 million are expected to be achieved over the 2020-2025 period, of which \u20ac1,000 million will be in 2023-2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This will lead to an Iberdrola that is more efficient, more sustainable, more international, more profitable and ultimately better prepared to continue responding to these trends and to drive the recovery in the economy and in employment.\n\n## Balanced growth\n\nThe company will carry out a number of initiatives to implement this strategy, which are described below:\n\n- \u25cf The policies on decarbonisation and technological progress play an important role, as they drive significant investments in renewable generation, as do the deployment and strengthening of networks, which have an essential role in the integration of both large-scale and distributed renewable generation, as well as helping to increase the electrification of energy demand and the requirement of new services.\n- \u25cf In light of these forecasts, the company has launched a historic investment plan of up to \u20ac75,000 million (gross) over the 2020-2025 period (6 years), of which \u20ac68,000 million are organic investments and \u20ac7,000 million for the acquisition of PNM Resources.\n- \u25cf Annual organic investment thus increases from an average \u20ac7,000 million in 2017-2019 to an average of \u20ac10,000 million in 2020-2022 and \u20ac13,000 million in 2023-2025.\n- \u25cf 75% of total organic investment (\u20ac50,000 million) is allocated to growth, of which 70% is assured up to 2025 (close to 90% in networks and 60% in renewables).\n- \u25cf Investment is concentrated in countries with climate ambitions and A ratings. Geographically, 85% is allocated to Europe and the United States and, overall, more than 83% to countries with A ratings.\n- \u25cf In terms of businesses. the present plan strengthens the commitment to invest in networks and renewables. Thus, 51% of this organic growth, more than \u20ac34,000, will be allocated to renewables, concentrated mainly in the United States, the countries of Iberdrola Energ\u00eda Internacional (European countries other than the United Kingdom and Spain, and Australia) and Spain. 40%, more than \u20ac27,000 million, will be allocated to networks, with growth centred mainly in the United States and Brazil.\n\nGross organic investment by business and country 2020-2025\n\n## Gross organic investment of the Businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross organic investment by country",

To make progress with this scale of ambition, the UK Government published in late 2020 a 'Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution' and an Energy White Paper which start to set out long-term decarbonisation plans for the UK.\n\n## Spain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 In January  2020  Spain  sent  to  the  European Commission  its National  Integrated  Energy  and Climate Plan (Plan Integrado de Energ\u00eda y Clima) (PNIEC)  proposing  ambitious  national  goals  for decarbonisation of the economy by 2030, which has been well received by Brussels.\n- \u00b7 A Draft Law on Climate Change and Energy Transition , a tool for incorporating the objectives of the PNIEC into the legal system, has begun to be processed, and  the 2050  Decarbonisation  Strategies  and  the Renewable Hydrogen Roadmap , among others, have been published.\n- \u00b7 To offset the effects of the pandemic, the government has  published  various  legal  provisions  to  protect domestic  consumers,  the  industry  and  companies, including compensation to reduce the impact on the electricity sector.\n- \u00b7 The  CNMC  has  published  the  Circular  on  toll methodology. The application of the new access tariffs is pending government approval of the methodology for calculating and allocating charges.\n- \u00b7 The Ministry has approved the Royal Decree regulating access and connection to the network, though the CNMC has still to publish the Circular establishing capacity assignment standards, among other things.\n- \u00b7 A  hearing  was  held  on  the  draft  bill  creating  the National Fund for the Sustainability of the Electricity System (Fondo  Nacional  para  la  Sostenibilidad del  Sistema  El\u00e9ctrico) (FNSSE),  which  will  allow for the cost of the policies to promote renewables, cogeneration  and  waste  (RECORE)  to  be  shared among all energy sources (oil, gas and electricity).\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 In the framework of the Communication on A European Green Deal , which is a package of measures to be implemented  over  the  next  5  years  to  efficiently transform the European Union into a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, consultations and studies have been  launched  to  modify  the  legislation  and  in particular to set a legally binding zero net emissions target for the EU by 2050. This will strengthen the 2030 emission reduction target to at least 55%, as adopted by the European Council in December 2020, (as compared to the current 40%), and the targets for renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  (currently 32% and 32.5%, respectively) will subsequently be revised.\n- \u00b7 In parallel, the Commission has published various strategies  for  the  Green  Deal's  regulatory  priorities. These include the New European Industrial Strategy (reforms to state aid, determination of key projects of  European  interest  and  a  border  carbon  pricing adjustment mechanism), Renovation Wave (energy renovations in buildings), Hydrogen Strategy (objective of 40 GW of electrolysers by 2030), and Strategy on Energy System Integration (commitment to electrification and the efficient development of clean hydrogen in niche sectors), Offshore Wind Strategy (objective of 60 GW installed by 2030, infrastructure planning,  and  market  integration  model)  and  the Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy (electrification of transport, with 30 million zero-emission cars by 2030).\n- \u00b7 The  launch  of  the  debates  and  studies  coincided with  the  COVID-19  crisis  and  the  EU's  response. A Recovery Plan has been approved that will involve \u20ac750,000 million to support the countries most affected by  the  crisis  (Spain  is  to  receive  approximately \u20ac140,000  million)  through  direct  aid  and  credits, especially for the energy (Green Deal) and digital translations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Biden administration has set out an ambitious agenda to address what they call the climate crisis, and is moving quickly using executive orders and other executive powers. In the first days in power, the administration returned to the Paris Agreement , revoked the executive order allowing the Keystone XL oil pipeline, set goals for a carbon-free electricity industry by 2035, began reshaping the way environmental impacts are considered, and began to reverse previous regulations that are inconsistent with these goals.\n\nThe administration also plans to leverage the federal government's purchasing power to support the use of electric vehicles, renewable energy contracts and the development of new technologies. Following this initial activity, the administration will face challenges, as any legal changes will have to go through the regulatory process.\n\n## Mexico\n\n- \u00b7 During 2020 changes in energy policy and regulation have been promoted in the country that are contrary to foreign private investment and the development of renewables. In this context:\n- \u00b7 In  May  2020  the  CRE  approved  an  increase  in the  transmission  rates  for  renewable  and  efficient cogeneration  plants  (transition  stamp),  and  in  the transmission rates for conventional technologies.\n- In  May  2020  two  regulations  on  reliability  were published. Due to the pandemic, the National Energy Control Centre published a Resolution to Guarantee the  Reliability  of  the  National  Electricity  System , establishing  strategies  and  measures  prohibiting pre-operational tests of wind and photovoltaic plants. The  Energy  Secretariat  subsequently  published  a Policy on Reliability, Security, Continuity and Quality in the National Electricity System . The Policy provides for  changes  regarding  hedging  contracts,  existing generation  permits  and  new  requests,  and  new interconnection requirements.\n- \u00b7 In October 2020 the CRE published a modification of the rules for self-supply and cogeneration companies dedicated  to  Electricity  Generation.  It  prohibits  the registration of load centres that have entered into a basic supply contract under the Electricity Industry Law (Ley de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica) (LIE), preventing changes in beneficiaries. It also restricts the rights of permit-holders to return to the previous system after they have migrated to the Wholesale Electricity Market.\n\n## Brazil\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The COVID-19 pandemic affected all segments of the electricity market, giving rise to various government measures  to  ensure  supply  and  avoid  the  financial collapse of the industry. The most significant measure was  the  creation  of  a  finance  mechanism  in  the form of a bank credit known as the COVID Account, guaranteed by tariff credits to the distributors, which will  allow  for  maintaining  payment  flows  between distribution, transmission and generation companies.\n- \u00b7 Resolution No 895, which sets out the regulations under Law 14,052/20 providing for the renegotiation of the hydrological risk assumed by the hydro generators since  2012,  was  approved  on  3  December  2020. The outstanding financial value will be quantified and reimbursed by the granting of a concession. Once all required actions stipulated in the ANEEL timetable have been completed, the short-term market, where there had been a deficit in the settlements, will return to normal operation.\n- \u00b7 The  short-term  market  price  will  be  hourly  (PLDh) beginning in January 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The IGR  measures  the  financial  prudence  of  regulated activities,  weighting  5  financial  ratios.  i-DE  broadly meets all ratios, so the 2020 IGR is 1.\n- \u00b7 Royal  Decree  23/2020  was  published  in  2020, increasing the investment limit from 0.13% to 0.14% of GDP for the period 2020-2022.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 In December 2020 a final decision on the new RIIO-T2 regulatory framework was approved for transmission activities, and will enter into effect from April 2021 until March 2026. It establishes a cost of equity of 4.25%, a cost of debt of 1.82% and an annual TOTEX of \u00a31,433 million (nominal). Companies may appeal this decision to the Competition Market Authority in the 20 working days following publication of the terms of the new license on 4 February.\n- \u00b7 Ofgem continues the process of designing the RIIOED2 regulatory framework for transmission, which will be applicable from 2023.\n- \u00b7 During 2020, SP Transmission Ltd. as well as SPD Ltd. and SPM Plc continued to do business under the RIIO-T1  and  RIIO-D1  tariff  frameworks,  complying with  all  investment  and  quality  goals  agreed  with Ofgem.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7 New tariff conditions entered into force in February 2020 for the electricity distribution company CMP (Maine), with a recognised ROE of 9.25% (with a temporary adjustment based on four customer service metrics) and an equity percentage of 50%.\n- \u00b7 In  November  2020  new  tariff  conditions  were approved  for  the  distributors  in  New  York  state (NYSEG and RG&E), with retroactive effect to 17 April 2020 and valid until 30 April 2023. A ROE of 8.8%, an equity percentage of 48% and a $4,275 million four-year investment plan were recognised.\n- \u00b7 The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved changes to the formula for the recovery of New England transmission providers costs  in  tariffs  (Formula  Rate).  This  represents significant improvements in the automatic recovery of costs, such as the elimination of volume risk for transmission  companies.  The  changes  will  take effect for tariffs as from 1 January 2022.\n\n## Brazil\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 In March 2020 ANEEL approved the new methodology for the annual definition of the regulatory distribution WACC.\n- \u00b7 There was a regular annual readjustment in April for Coelba, Cosern and Celpe, the application of which was postponed until the end of June in order to avoid increasing rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a tariff asset being created to be recovered at the next tariff  revision.  The  increase  in  tariffs  mainly  reflects the change in the General Price Index and recognises the  improvement  in  supply  quality.  The  Elektro readjustment was carried out in August as normal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Three Lines Model, published on 20 June 2020 by the Institute of Internal Auditors, updates the previous Three Lines of Defense Model, and is based on an assurance system combined around three lines, providing a comprehensive view of how the different parts of the organisation interact in an effective and coordinated manner, increasing the efficiency of the processes for management and internal control of the entity's significant risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on the document 'The IIA's Three Lines Model 2020. An update of the Three Lines of Defense'. IIA 2020.\n\n## Iberdrola adopts the Three Lines Model to ensure its internal control system.\n\n## Principle 1: Governance\n\nIberdrola's governance has structures and processes that enable:\n\n- \u00b7 Accountability by the Board of Directors to stakeholders  for  organisational  oversight  though integrity, leadership and transparency.\n- \u00b7 Actions (including managing risk) by management to achieve the objectives of the strategic plan through riskbased decision-making and application of resources.\n- \u00b7 Assurance and advice by an internal audit function to provide clarity and confidence and to promote and facilitate  continuous  improvement  through  rigorous research and insightful communication.\n\n## Principle 2: Governing body roles\n\nIberdrola's Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensures that appropriate structures and processes are in place for effective governance.\n- \u00b7 Ensures that organisational objectives and activities are  aligned  with  the  prioritised  interests  of  the stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Delegates  responsibility  and  provides  resources to  management  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the organisation  while  ensuring  legal,  regulatory  and ethical expectations are met.\n- \u00b7 Establishes and oversees an independent, objective and competent internal audit function to provide clarity and confidence on progress toward the achievement of objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Principle 3: Management and first and second line roles\n\nManagement's  responsibility  to  achieve  organisational objectives comprises both first and second line roles. The management team and the professionals of Iberdrola and its group are the direct managers of the entity's risks. Thus, the company's Management is responsible for maintaining effective control and for implementing procedures to control risks on a continuous basis, based on the Internal Control objectives of the COSO model (operational, reporting and compliance  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations, May 2013).\n\n## Significant risks facing Iberdrola's primary businesses / Pages 54, 58, 62\n\nThe primary assurance functions within Iberdrola, within their respective areas of responsibility, are: (i) the group's Risk Division, within the framework of its duties within the Comprehensive Risk Control and Management System; (ii) the Internal Assurance Division, belonging (like the Risk Division) to the Risk Management and Internal Assurance area,  in  its  responsibilities  relating  to  the  internal  risk management  and  control  systems  in  relation  to  the preparation of financial information (Internal Control over Financial Reporting System, or ICFRS) and non-financial information (Internal Control over Non-Financial Reporting System, or ICNFRS) and the SAP environment; (iii) the Compliance  Unit,  which  is  responsible  for  proactively ensuring the effective operation of the Compliance System (notwithstanding which, in the financial  and  non-financial information processes it is considered to have a third line role as it provides independent assurance regarding the risk of non-compliance with the legal framework); and (iv) the Cybersecurity Division within the Corporate Security Division, through the supervision, monitoring and reporting of cybersecurity risks.\n\n- Comprehensive Risk Control and Management System / Page 90\n- Compliance Unit / Page 93\n\n## Principle 4: Third line roles\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  area  proactively  ensures  the  proper operation of the internal control, risk management and governance  systems,  systematically  auditing  the  roles of  the  first  and  second  lines  in  the  performance  of  their respective duties of management and control.\n\nTo ensure its independence, the director of the Internal Audit Area reports hierarchically to the chairman of the Board of Directors and functionally to Iberdrola's Audit and Risk Supervision Committee (ARSC).\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committees (ACC) and Internal Audit divisions of the various country subholding companies have this same positioning, and are coordinated under the framework of the Basic Internal Audit Regulations. These regulations, approved by the Board of Directors, form part of the Governance and Sustainability System and establish the rules, duties, competencies and powers of Internal\n\nAudit, as well as its framework of relations within the group. The  2020  annual  activities  plans  of  Iberdrola's  Internal Audit Area and of the Internal Audit divisions of the group, with a risk-based focus, responded to the requirements established by the ARSC and the respective ACCs of the country subholding companies, and included:\n\n- \u00b7 Half-yearly reviews of the operation of the most critical ICFRS controls, as well as reviews of the various cycles of financial information preparation, within the framework of the revision of the entire ICFRS over a 5-year period.\n- \u00b7 Audits of key corporate and business process and risks, based on the Risk Policies approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis.\n- \u00b7 Audits of the compliance programmes.\n\nIberdrola satisfactorily completed the Quality Assurance evaluation performed by the Internal Auditors Institute of Spain in 2020.\n\n## Principle 5: Third line independence\n\nInternal  audit's  independence  from  the  responsibilities of management is critical to its objectivity, authority and credibility. At Iberdrola this is established by: accountability to the Board of Directors; unfettered access to people, resources  and  data  needed  to  complete  its  work;  and freedom from bias or interference in the provision of audit services.\n\n## Principle 6: Creating and protecting value\n\nAt Iberdrola, all of the roles are aligned with each other and with the interests of the stakeholders, contributing to the creation and protection of value.\n\n## External assurance providers\n\nRegulators  establish  requirements  to  strengthen  the organisations'  controls  and  perform  an  independent oversight role. The powers of the ARSC and the ACCs include  striving  to  preserve  the  independence  of  the statutory  auditors,  who  provide  assurance  of  the  true picture provided by Iberdrola's financial information..\n\nAudit Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

The listed country subholding companies, and companies with significant interests held by other shareholders, approve their own policies under their own special framework of strengthened autonomy.\n\n## Principal risk factors of the Iberdrola group\n\nThe group is exposed to various risks inherent in the different countries, industries and markets in which it operates, and which may prevent it from achieving its objectives and implementing its strategies. These risks are grouped into:\n\nCorporate governance risks: those that endanger the corporate interest and the strategy of the company.\n\nMarket risks: exposure to volatility in variables like prices of electricity and other energy commodities, emission rights, exchange rate, interest rate, etc.\n\nCredit risks: possibility of contractual breach by a counterparty, causing economic or financial losses, including liquidation and replacement cost risks.\n\nBusiness risks: deriving from uncertainty as to the behaviour of variables intrinsic to the business (characteristics of demand, hydraulic resources, wind, solar, etc.).\n\nRegulatory and political risks: coming from regulatory changes made by the regulators that can affect remuneration of the regulated businesses, environmental or tax provisions, etc.\n\nOperational, technological, environmental, social and legal risks: losses resulting from external events, inadequate internal procedures, technical failures, human error, pandemics, climate change, technological obsolescence, cybersecurity, fraud and corruption, litigation, etc.\n\nReputational risks: potential negative impacts on the company's reputation arising from situations or events that fail to meet the expectations of its Stakeholders.\n\nGiven the multidimensional nature of the risks, the taxonomy defined in the system contemplates additional classification variables for better monitoring, control and reporting of such risks. These additional categories include the classification of risks into Structural Risks, Hot Topics and Emerging Risks, the latter being understood as potential new threats, the impact of which is as yet uncertain and the probability of which undefined, but which are growing and could become significant for the group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral Risk Policy\n\nRisk Policies and Limits\n\nof the Businesses and\n\nCorporate Functions\n\nSpecific risk procedures and reports\n\n## ERM management system\n\nStrategic positioning towards risk.
