        "page_content": "## Letter from the Group Executive Chairman\n\nDear shareholder:\n\nThe year 2020 was marked by COVID-19, a global pandemic with severe health and economic consequences. From the very beginning, BBVA has stepped up to protect the health and well-being of everyone: employees, customers and society in general, with a donation of more than \u20ac35 million to purchase medical equipment and support particularly vulnerable groups, and research on the disease.\n\nWe have continued providing an essential service and supporting our customers when they needed it most thanks to our digital capabilities and remote managers. We have alleviated the financial burden on families and businesses through \u20ac38 billion of deferrals and flexible payments and our active participation in government aid programs, financing \u20ac25 billion. With all of this support, we have helped three million customers overcome this crisis, preserving jobs and contributing to the recovery.\n\nI am very proud of the Bank's response and of all of the teams' hard work to make it possible, in line with our purpose: to bring the age of opportunity to everyone.\n\nThe health crisis has led to sharp declines in GDP around the world. In particular, the countries where BBVA operates have posted a -7.2% fall as a whole, according to BBVA Research estimates. The rapid response from central banks and governments, with monetary and fiscal stimulus measures like assistance programs, government-backed lines of credit or measures to support jobs have prevented the crisis from having an even greater impact.\n\nAlthough early 2021 continues to be affected by the same uncertainties we faced at the end of the previous year, growth will be greater in the second half of the year if vaccination plans are fulfilled. An effective, rapid and global vaccination campaign will be critical to making mobility restrictions more flexible and allowing the sectors of the economy that were hit the hardest to return to a certain level of normality.\n\nDespite this environment and the high level of uncertainty, the Bank reported good results in 2020 , posting a net attributable profit for the year of \u20ac3.08 billion excluding one-offs, thanks to the hard work of our team in a highly complex environment. Following a first quarter affected by the significant efforts to front-load provisions for the impact of COVID19, the Bank's results have shown a growing trend, reaching \u20ac1.32 billion in the last quarter of the year. The efforts made in provisions in 2020 allow us to be better prepared for the challenges of 2021, with an 81% NPL coverage ratio - the highest of the past decade. Operating income rose 11.7% at constant exchange rates, and we continue to lead our European peers in terms of efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe pandemic we are facing has accelerated trends on which our strategy is based, such as digitization . Our pioneering commitment is paying off, and has given us an advantage over our competitors that has allowed us to better serve our customers, even in a context as complex as the present, and largely operating remotely.  Over 34 million customers do their banking with us via smartphone, which represents 59% of the total customer base. In 2020, nearly two-thirds of the Group's sales took place on digital channels.\n\nWe have also made great strides in our commitment to environmental and social sustainability - one of our strategic priorities. In this regard, BBVA has been recognized as the most sustainable bank in Europe, and the second most sustainable bank in the world, according to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index .\n\nOur commitment to sustainability is structured around several pillars. First, we help our clients in their transition toward a sustainable and inclusive future , with advice, financing and new innovative solutions. A strategy that allows us to take advantage of the enormous business opportunity that sustainable investment represents - especially related to climate change. In 2020, we mobilized a total of \u20ac11 billion in sustainable wholesale loans and bonds , which positions us as one of the leading banks in Spain and Europe. This financing is part of our Pledge 2025, of which we have already mobilized over \u20ac50 billion in just three years, meaning we are well ahead of our total goal of \u20ac100 billion by 2025.\n\nWe have also made great progress in our commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Since 2020, we have been carbon neutral in the emissions directly generated by our own activity and we have moved forward in aligning our investment portfolio to this agreement (also taking into account the impact our clients have on emissions). This will be a key issue at the next COP 26, which will be held in Glasgow this year. BBVA will certainly play a highly active role in this event.\n\nFurthermore, in order to be successful in the fight against climate change and inequality, it is critical to have adequate information.  For  this  reason, in  2020  we  published  our  first TCFD ('Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial Disclosure') report on the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. We also made the commitment to publish the ESG metrics promoted by the World Economic Forum's International Business Council in order to establish international standards to measure, compare and manage performance in sustainability.",

        "page_content": "Finally, I would like to emphasize the great work that we have been directly carrying out in social action. In 2020, BBVA allocated over \u20ac140 million to social initiatives and programs to support education, culture, science, entrepreneurship and alleviate the effects of COVID-19, benefiting more than 12 million people. But also through our foundations, which promote  research,  culture  and  education,  such  as  the  BBVA  Foundation  or  the  BBVA  Foundation  Mexico,  and development funding in the case of the BBVA Microfinance Foundation. The efforts of the latter were awarded for a second year in a row as the second largest private philanthropic initiative in the world, and the largest in Latin America, by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nWithout a doubt, the other major milestone in BBVA's strategy in 2020 was the sale of our United States business. A historic transaction with very attractive multiples that value our United States subsidiary at nearly 20 times its 2019 profit.\n\nThe operation allows us to bring out the tremendous value of this business, generating \u20ac8.5 billion in capital. This puts at an unparalleled position of strength in the sector and gives us a wide range of strategic options .\n\nFollowing the United States sale, the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio stands at 14.6% - well above our capital target of 11.5 to 12%. It also positions us as one of the European banks with the greatest distance between the capital ratio and the minimum requirement.\n\nThis excess capital allows us to advance in our clear commitment to create value for shareholders. With regards to the year 2020, we will propose to the Annual General Meeting a payment of 5.9 euro cents gross per share in April 2021 ; and expect to resume our dividend distribution policy of a 35 to 40% payout for the year 2021.\n\nIn addition, this solid capital position opens to the door to other forms of extraordinary distribution to our shareholders. Our goal is to put in place a plan to buy back around 10% of the Group's shares after the United States sale. All subject to market conditions and the necessary approvals.\n\nUltimately, BBVA looks to 2021 with the same commitment to society that we have had in 2020 . Thanks to our great strength, we will continue providing our support to overcome this crisis and in the recovery phase.\n\nThank you for your support and confidence as a shareholder in such a complex year. It motivates us to continue working for a better future.\n\nCarlos Torres Vila\n\nBBVA's Group Executive Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear shareholders,\n\n2020 has been a challenging year, marked by the strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with severe health and economic consequences. In this context, our priorities have remained clear and unchanged: protecting the health of our employees, clients and society as a whole, providing an essential service to the economy, and financial support to individuals and businesses.\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, the global economy shrunk, according to BBVA Research estimates, by around 2.6% in terms of GDP in 2020. This impact is heterogeneous across the countries in which BBVA is present, with a decline of 11.0% in Spain, 9.1% in Mexico, 3.6% in the United States, and 6.8% in South America 1 as a whole, and all this despite fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures swiftly implemented by central banks and governments. Turkey closed the year with a slight growth of 1.0% in 2020. As for 2021, we expect strong recovery across our footprint, even though uncertainty remains high.\n\nDespite this challenging scenario, BBVA once again has demonstrated the strength of its business model, and has reported solid financial results in a context of high uncertainty, with operating income growing at double digit and remaining at the forefront of its European peer group in terms of profitability.\n\nThe net attributable profit of BBVA Group in 2020, excluding one-offs, stood at \u20ac3.08 billion, 27.2% less than in the previous year, at constant euros, as a result of front-loading of provisions and impairments during the first half of the year. Taking into account the impact of the goodwill impairment from BBVA USA and the net capital gains from the agreement reached with Allianz, the net attributable profit stood at \u20ac1.31 billion.\n\nI would also like to comment on other major milestones we achieved in 2020, the historic sale agreement of our business in the United States, which has allowed us to emerge the tremendous value of the unit and which offers ample strategic optionality. This transaction confirms our clear commitment to creating shareholder value, placing the proforma fully-loaded CET1 capital ratio at 14.58%. Excluding the impact of this sale, the ratio closed the year at 11.73%, within the target range and almost flat compared to 2019, after recovering from a sharp drop in the first quarter due to the pandemic.\n\nIn terms of shareholder value creation, the tangible book value per share plus dividends closed the year at \u20ac6.21, a level similar to that of 2019. And yet for another year, our profitability metrics remained at the top of our peer group . Excluding the year's one-offs, i.e. the impact of the goodwill impairment and net capital gains from the Allianz agreement, the return on equity closed at 6.9% and the return on tangible equity at 7.8%.\n\nAll this will allow us to submit, for the consideration of shareholders and supervisors, the proposal to resume shareholder distribution with a payment of 5.9 euro cents gross per share in April 2021.\n\nIt is also worth noting the solid performance of our recurring income, which despite the complexity of the environment, grew by 2.7%, at constant exchange rates - i.e. without taking into account the impact of the exchange rate -; and the discipline in controlling expenses, which, for the first time in many years, fell to 2.6%, at constant euros, despite significant inflation rates in some of the countries where BBVA is present. As a result, the efficiency ratio improved by 342 basis points, to 46.8%, leading, for yet another year, our group of comparable competitors. All of this led to an operating income growth of 11.7% compared to last year, in constant euros.\n\nRegarding risk indicators, it should be noted that, following front-loaded provisions in the first half of the year as a result of the pandemic, they behaved better than expected. Cost of risk stood at 1.51%, at the bottom end of the expected range announced by the Bank in the first quarter of the year. The NPL rate rose slightly to 4.0%, while the coverage ratio remained at very high levels, closing the year at 81%.",

        "page_content": "As for the main business areas, I would like to underline the following:\n\n- \u25cf In Spain , the net attributable profit stood at \u20ac606 million, down 56.3% from the previous year, due to provisions related to the pandemic. However, operating income grew 4.7%, driven by revenues from fees and commissions and the drop in operating expenses. The cost of risk improved as the year progressed, after a first half impacted by significant provisioning efforts, to finish at 0.67%. The NPL ratio improved to 4.27% and the NPL coverage ratio closed the year at 67%. BBVA's coverage ratio is the highest in Spain's banking sector.\n- \u25cf In the United States , the net attributable profit stood at \u20ac429 million in 2020, after declining 25.5% from 2019, at constant euros, due mainly to the increase in loan-loss provisions. As for the top lines, it is worth underscoring the 4.4% growth of the operating income, driven by growth in fees and commissions and net trading income and by the decline in operating expenses. Cost of risk closed at 1.18%, a significantly lower level than expected in the third quarter.\n- \u25cf In Mexico , net attributable profit reached \u20ac1,769 million, a figure that represents a 25.8% year-on-year decline, at constant euros, as a result of the loan-loss provisions recorded to face the pandemic, partially offset by cost containment  efforts,  which  kept  expenses  well  below  inflation.  Risk  indicators  closed  the  year  in  line  with expectations, after a first half of the year impacted by strong provisioning efforts.\n- \u25cf In Turkey , the net attributable profit reached \u20ac563 million. Excluding the currency fluctuations during the year that is, in constant terms - this figure represents a 41% increase from the preceding year. It is worth noting the positive performance of the net interest income, driven by investment growth and solid price management practices, as well as net trading income and cost containment efforts.\n- \u25cf In South America , it is worth noting the solid performance in the main countries: Argentina, Colombia and Peru. The area's attributable profit stood at \u20ac446 million in 2020, down 22.6% at constant terms, as a result of provisions related to the pandemic.\n\nI would like to end by expressing my gratitude to the Group's more than 123,000 employees for their constant dedication, their continuous effort and their contribution to these results in a particularly difficult year for everyone. It is thanks to each one of these individuals that we are able to work as one team. And of course, I would also like to thank you, the shareholders, for your trust and your constant support that drives us to deliver on our purpose: to bring the age of opportunity to everyone.\n\nOnur Gen\u00e7 BBVA's Chief Executive Officer",

Supply, demand and financial factors caused an unprecedented fall in GDP in the first half of 2020. Supported by strong fiscal and monetary policy measures, as well as greater control over the spread of the virus, global growth rebounded more than expected in the third quarter, before slowing down in the fourth, when the number of infections rose again in many regions, mainly in the United States and Europe. As for 2021, the unfavorable evolution of the pandemic is expected to adversely affect activity in the short term, while new fiscal and monetary stimuli, as well as the administering of coronavirus vaccines, are expected to support recovery from mid-year onwards.\n\nFollowing  the  massive fiscal  and  monetary  stimuli to  support  economic  activity  and  reduce  financial  tensions, government debt has increased across the board and interest rates have been cut, and are now at historical low levels. Additional countercyclical measures may be required. Similarly, a significant reduction in current stimuli is not expected, at least until the recovery takes hold.\n\nTensions in the financial markets have moderated rapidly since the end of March 2020, following the decisive actions taken by the main central banks and the fiscal packages announced in many countries. In recent months, the markets have shown relative stability and, at certain times, risk-taking movements. Likewise, progress related to the development of COVID-19 vaccines and prospects for economic recovery should pave the way for financial volatility to persist at relatively low levels in general going forward.\n\nBBVA Research estimates that global GDP contracted by around 2.6% in 2020 and will expand by around 5.3% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022. Activity will recover gradually and heterogeneously among countries. Various epidemiological, financial and geopolitical factors are also contributing to the persistent exceptionally high uncertainty.\n\n## GLOBAL GDP GROWTH AND INFLATION (REAL PERCENTAGE GROWTH)\n\n|                    | 2020   | 2020      | 2021   | 2021      |\n|--------------------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|\n|                    | GDP    | Inflation | GDP    | Inflation |\n| World              | (2.6)  | 3.4       | 5.3    | 3.3       |\n| Eurozone           | (7.3)  | 0.3       | 4.1    | 0.8       |\n| Spain              | (11.0) | (0.3)     | 5.5    | 0.7       |\n| The United States  | (3.6)  | 1.3       | 3.6    | 2.6       |\n| Mexico             | (9.1)  | 3.4       | 3.2    | 3.3       |\n| South America  (1) | (6.8)  | 8.8       | 4.7    | 10.4      |\n| Turkey             | 1.0    | 14.6      | 5.0    | 10.5      |\n| China              | 2.2    | 2.5       | 7.5    | 1.7       |\n\nWith regard to the banking system , in an environment in which much of the economic activity has been at a stand still for several months, the services provided have played an essential role, basically for two reasons: firstly, the banks have ensured the proper functioning of collections and payments for households and companies, thereby contributing to the maintenance of economic activity; secondly, the granting of new lending or the renewal of existing lending has reduced the impact of the economic slowdown on household and business income. The support provided by the banks over the months of lockdown and public guarantees have been essential in softening the impact of the crisis on companies' liquidity and solvency, meaning that banking has become its main source of funding for most companies.\n\nIn terms of profitability , European and Spanish banking have deteriorated, primarily because many entities recorded high provisions for impairment on financial assets in the first two quarters of 2020 as a result of the worsening macroeconomic environment following the pandemic outbreak. Pre-pandemic profitability levels remained far from the levels prior to the previous financial crisis. This is in addition to the accumulation of capital since the previous crisis and the very low interest rate environment that we have been experiencing for several years. Nevertheless, the banks are facing this situation from a healthy position and with solvency that has been constantly increasing since the 2008 crisis, with reinforced capital and liquidity buffers and, therefore, with a greater lending capacity.",

        "page_content": "## Europe\n\nIn Europe, the European Commission (hereinafter EC) approved the European Recovery Fund (Next Generation EU, hereinafter NGEU) in the amount of \u20ac750,000m (5.4% of EU GDP), through subsidies and loans to support investment and reforms. The NGEU is an important step in supporting the recovery that could increase the EU GDP between about 1.5 and 2% above the trajectory predicted for 2024, according to EC estimates, but also poses a challenge in terms of absorbing resources and investing in effective projects. Furthermore, the extension of support measures by countries to the most affected sectors is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2021 at the least. For its part, the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ECB) approved a package of accommodative measures at its December meeting. In particular, it expanded the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) and extended the purchasing timeline until at least March 2022, readjusted the conditions of the TLTRO III liquidity auctions, and expanded the measures to relax eligibility criteria for collateral. In terms of growth , following a rebound in the Eurozone GDP of up 12.5% quarterly in the third quarter of 2020, the resurgence of COVID-19 infections since the fall, and the consequent stricter social restrictions in general, are negatively affecting activity in the fourth quarter of 2020 and are likely to extend into the first half of 2021. The new lockdown measures are, however, more selective, and both manufacturing and exports appear to be more resilient, which is also thanks to recovery in global demand, especially from China. This could partially offset the sharp decline in activity in the consumer and service sectors. BBVA Research expects Eurozone's GDP to contract around 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in an annual fall in GDP of 7.3% in 2020, while weaker stimulus in the first half of 2021 should result in slower-than-expected recovery for the year as a whole (4.1%), though vaccine distribution and the EU fiscal program should underpin growth from the second half of 2021 and in 2022 (4.4%). Moreover, national fiscal policies, the extension of support measures to the most affected sectors and support from the ECB should prevent more-persistent negative effects, which could arise in supply, but also in weaker demand or increased financial tensions.\n\n## Spain\n\nIn terms of growth , according to BBVA Research estimates, Spanish GDP could contract 11.0% in 2020 and grow by 5.5% in 2021. With regard to 2020, performance in the third quarter was somewhat better than expected in terms of activity, but Spain's GDP was close to stagnation in the fourth quarter. BBVA Research predicts that accelerated economic activity in the second half of this year will lead to 7% GDP growth in 2022, assuming that both private consumption and investment (public and private) benefit from the mass vaccination campaign, from expansionary fiscal policy and from favorable financing conditions. Mass vaccinations will result in reduced health uncertainty, eased restrictions on the mobility of workers and families, and will allow businesses in the service sector to open. These factors will be key to boosting consumption and reducing savings accumulated during the crisis period. The funds associated with NGEU will have an increasing impact over time, especially on investment, which will also contribute to economic acceleration. Estimates of the impact that these funds will have on the economy continue to point to a significant effect in 2021 and the next two years (1.5 percentage points on average per year).\n\nAs regards the banking system , according to the latest Bank of Spain data available, the total volume of lending to the private sector recovered slightly in October 2020 (up +2.4% year-on-year) as a result of the growth of new business lending transactions since April, within the framework of the public guarantee programs launched by the government to combat COVID-19. For their part, asset quality indicators have continued to improve (the NPL ratio was 4.57% in October 2020). Profitability entered negative ground in the first nine months of 2020 due to the increase in provisions resulting from the coronavirus crisis and, more importantly, the extraordinary negative results recorded in the first half of the year associated with the deterioration of goodwill in some entities. In addition, the low interest rate environment has kept profitability under pressure. Spanish institutions maintain comfortable levels of capital adequacy and liquidity.\n\n## United States\n\nAfter contracting by 9.0% in the second quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter, GDP increased by 7.4% in the third quarter, above expectations. Activity indicators suggest that the recovery process slowed significantly in the fourth quarter of 2020, in an environment of a sharp increase in COVID-19 infections. In 2021 the progressive vaccination of the population and the highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are expected to provide increasing support for economic activity. The Federal Reserve will most likely remain committed to supporting financial stability and the recovery process, mainly through its zero interest rate policy and asset purchase program. Counter-cyclical fiscal measures, which already amount to around 23% of GDP, could soon be expanded. According to BBVA Research estimates, GDP could expand by 3.6% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2022, after falling by around 3.6% in 2020. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to reach 5.4% at this year-end and 4.8% at next year end, well below the 14.7% rate recorded in April 2020 after the first wave of COVID-19 infections impacted the economy, though still above the average unemployment rate of 3.7% observed  in  2019.  Likewise,  GDP  and  unemployment  could  improve  more  than  expected  if  the  newly  elected Administration and Congress adopt additional fiscal stimulus measures.\n\nIn the banking system as a whole, the most recent activity data provided by the Fed (November 2020) shows the effects of the programs launched to combat COVID-19, with year-on-year lending and deposit growth rates of 3.63% and 20.37% respectively for the system. NPLs remain under control, with the NPL ratio standing at 1.58% in the third quarter of 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Mexico\n\nFollowing a rebound in growth during the third quarter of the year, Mexico's economic recovery slowed in the last quarter, which was also influenced by the announcement of new mobility restrictions during November and December. BBVA Research estimates that the Mexican economy will contract by 9.1% in 2020 and will grow by 3.2% in 2021. In this sense, the lack of sufficient fiscal stimuli can result in slow recovery. On the other hand, Mexico has acquired vaccine doses from different suppliers, which implies an impetus for economic activities to resume. In terms of inflation , this will remain close to the center of the Bank of Mexico's target range, and BBVA Research estimates that the central bank will continue with the decreasing cycle of monetary policy rate gradually in February from the current 4.25% to 3.5% in May 2021.\n\nRegarding the banking system , according to CNBV data as of November 2020, loans decreased by 0.79%, whereby an increase was only observed in the mortgage portfolio, while deposits increased by 11.4% year-on-year (demand and term deposits). The NPL ratio increased year-on-year (4.01% in November 2020) and capital indicators were comfortable.\n\n## Turkey\n\nFor Turkey, BBVA Research estimates that GDP grew by 1% in 2020, and is expected to increase by 5.0% in 2021 and by 4.5% in 2022. GDP in the third quarter of 2020 grew more than expected and the services sector contributed positively, while other key sub-sectors also showed a strong rebound. The central bank (CBRT) continued to tighten its monetary policy through various different channels in the third quarter of 2020. But in November, at its monetary policy meeting following the appointment of a new governor, CBRT raised the official interest rate (one-week repo) by 475 basis points to 15% and reinforced this stance at the December monetary policy meeting by raising the policy rate another 200 basis points to 17%. BBVA Research predicts that CBRT will start to lower rates gradually in the fourth quarter of 2021. Inflation estimates have been adjusted to 10.5% for 2021.\n\nBased on data from November 2020, the total volume of lending in the banking system increased by 38.4% year-on-year. These growth rates include the effect of inflation. The NPL ratio stood at 3.97% at the close of November 2020.\n\n## Argentina\n\nIn Argentina, GDP in the third quarter of the year was a positive surprise, driven by eased mobility restrictions, with moderation observed in the last quarter of 2020. BBVA Research estimates that GDP has contracted by 11% in 2020 and will partially recover to around 6% in 2021. Inflation closed the year at 36.1%, and BBVA Research believes that 2021 will see authorities maintain the preference for avoiding abrupt exchange rate adjustments, the freezing of public service fees and the extension of closures to contain the pandemic, though they will be partial. Therefore BBVA Research estimates that inflation will close the year at 50%. With regard to fiscal policy, some savings measures were implemented at the end of 2020 so that the primary deficit would close the year at around 6.5% of GDP, significantly below our previous estimates. BBVA Research believes that an agreement will be reached with the IMF by the second quarter to refinance loans in excess of USD 50,000m.\n\nIn the banking system , the positive trend for both lending and deposit growth has continued in 2020, although notably influenced by high inflation. Based on data from October 2020, profitability indicators have deteriorated significantly (ROE: 15.0% and ROA: 2.2%) due to the effect of COVID-19, after reaching record highs at the end of 2019. For its part, the NPL ratio fell slightly to 4.3% in October 2020.\n\n## Colombia\n\nBBVA Research estimates a contraction of 7.2% in 2020 and a partial recovery of 4.8% in 2021. The growth dynamic this year will be driven by housing construction, which is one of the pillars of the government's recovery policies. Recovery will, however, be limited due to the effect of new closures given the outbreaks of the pandemic and due to the effect of the probable tax reform, which could entail a higher VAT. In terms of inflation, prices recorded their lowest change since the 50s, closing 2020 at 1.6%, resulting from low demand and the low level of exchange rate transfer to prices. By 2021, BBVA Research estimates that inflation will remain low until April, with a significant rebound thereafter, to around 2.8% at year end. BBVA Research believes that with inflation under control and activity beginning to normalize, the Central Bank could keep the monetary policy interest rate stable at its current level of 1.75% until the second quarter of 2022.\n\nTotal lending in the banking system grew by 5.95% year-on-year at the end of September 2020, due to the growth in the commercial portfolio driven by government-approved letters of lending and guarantee programs during the pandemic. The system's NPL ratio as of October 2020 was 5.04%. Total deposits increased by 15.47% year-on-year in the same period.",

        "page_content": "## Peru\n\nPeru's GDP was a positive surprise in the last quarter of 2020 with a contraction of close to 3.3%, much lower than estimated. This improved dynamic was the result of the continued reopening of the economy following the lockdown measures adopted to limit the spread of the pandemic. BBVA Research estimates that the GDP contracted by 11.5% in 2020. For 2021, BBVA Research estimates that growth will stand at 10%, and that the mining and construction sectors will drive this recovery. Meanwhile, the political tensions experienced at the end of the year have diminished, but the elections scheduled for April will bring about political uncertainty, at least during the first part of the year. In terms of inflation , it closed the year at 2%, within the central bank's target. BBVA Research expects a declining profile in the coming months, influenced by weak demand and closing the year at 1.6%. The Central Bank has reduced the monetary policy rate to the lowest level in history, 0.25%. BBVA Research estimates that this interest rate level will remain throughout the year and predicts that the first increase to the interest rate will not occur until the first half of 2022.\n\nThe banking  system showed  high  year-on-year  growth  rates  for  lending  and  deposits  (up  14.0%  and  up  23.6% respectively, at the end of November 2020), due to the strong momentum of the Plan Reactiva Per\u00fa ; the system presented lower profitability levels due to the current crisis (ROE: 5.39% as of November 2020) but with contained NPLs (NPL ratio: 3.22% as of November 2020) due to the payment deferrals applied.\n\n| INTEREST RATES (PERCENTAGE)   |        |        |        |                                                                      |        |        |        |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                               |        |        |        | 31-12-20  30-09-20  30-06-20  31-03-20  31-12-19  30-09-19  30-06-19 |        |        |        |\n| Official ECB rate             | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00                                                                 | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00   |\n| Euribor 3 months  (1)         | (0.54) | (0.49) | (0.38) | (0.42)                                                               | (0.39) | (0.42) | (0.33) |\n| Euribor 1 year  (1)           | (0.50) | (0.41) | (0.15) | (0.27)                                                               | (0.26) | (0.34) | (0.19) |\n| USA Federal rates             | 0.25   | 0.25   | 0.25   | 0.25                                                                 | 1.75   | 2.00   | 2.50   |\n| TIIE (Mexico)                 | 4.25   | 4.25   | 5.00   | 6.50                                                                 | 7.25   | 7.75   | 8.25   |\n| CBRT (Turkey)                 | 17.00  | 10.25  | 8.25   | 9.75                                                                 | 12.00  | 16.50  | 24.00  |\n\nForeign exchanges have also been subject to volatility in other markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The strong monetary and fiscal response at the global level, in addition to idiosyncratic factors in some of the geographic areas in which the Group operates, have conditioned the performance of currencies. The euro has generally appreciated against major currencies. The Mexican peso suffered a sharp depreciation following the COVID-19 outbreak in the first quarter of the year, but has subsequently recovered ground, closing the year with a depreciation of 13.1% against the euro. The U.S. dollar has also weakened in the second part of the year and closed 2020 with an 8.5% decline against the euro. The Turkish lira has ended with a negative variation by 26.7%. Other currencies depreciated against the euro as follows: Colombian peso (down 12.6%), Peruvian sol (down 16.3%), Chilean peso (down 3.6%) and Argentine peso (down 34.8%).\n\nFor information on the BBVA Group's exchange rate risk management policies, see the \"Risk Management\" chapter of this report.\n\n## EXCHANGE RATES (EXPRESSED IN CURRENCY/EURO)\n\n|                     | Year-end exchange rates   | Year-end exchange rates   | Year-end exchange rates   | Average exchange rates   | Average exchange rates   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                     | 31-12-20                  | \u2206 % on  31-12-19          | \u2206 % on  30-09-20          | 2020                     | \u2206 % on  2019             |\n| U.S. dollar         | 1.2271                    | (8.5)                     | (4.6)                     | 1.1418                   | (2.0)                    |\n| Mexican peso        | 24.4160                   | (13.1)                    | 7.2                       | 24.5301                  | (12.1)                   |\n| Turkish lira        | 9.1131                    | (26.7)                    | (0.2)                     | 8.0501                   | (21.0)                   |\n| Peruvian sol        | 4.4470                    | (16.3)                    | (5.3)                     | 3.9923                   | (6.5)                    |\n| Argentine peso  (1) | 103.2543                  | (34.8)                    | (13.7)                    | -                        | -                        |\n| Chilean peso        | 872.41                    | (3.6)                     | 5.3                       | 903.06                   | (12.9)                   |\n| Colombian peso      | 4,212.02                  | (12.6)                    | 7.8                       | 4,216.81                 | (12.9)                   |",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory Environment\n\n## Banking after COVID-19\n\nThe regulatory environment of the financial industry during 2020 has been marked by the COVID-19 health crisis and the changes  that  have  occurred  in  the  lives  of  companies,  consumers,  workers  and,  ultimately,  in  society  as  a  whole. Throughout this financial year, the rapid reaction of supervisors and regulators has been particularly notable, as they did not wait for the situation to deteriorate before adopting strong response measures, allowing them to relax some existing regulatory requirements and implement regulatory changes and measures to adapt to the challenges posed by this pandemic and the challenges it could pose in the coming months, since, unlike during the previous crisis, banks were in a solid position in terms of solvency and liquidity this time around.\n\nThis section analyzes the regulatory milestones set due to COVID-19 (regulatory flexibility, payment deferrals, restriction of dividend distribution and use of capital buffers), as well as other measures taken for trends prior to its emergence, such as those aimed at improving the situation in the markets (with projects such as the Capital Markets Union and reference indices reforms), the challenge of financial sustainability with the fulfillment of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria and the transformation toward an increasingly digital business model where regulation must aid innovation and change processes and systems so that banks can compete in the new ecosystem of financial service providers that are highly efficient, technologically advanced and subject to less-demanding regulation.\n\n## Regulatory response to COVID-19 (payment-deferrals, dividends, NPL buffers)\n\nThe economic consequences of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak have been met by an agile, forceful response from national and international regulatory authorities. These measures have highlighted the fundamental role that banks play as finance providers in extraordinary situations such as the one experienced, which entails strong liquidity stress.\n\nThe set of measures taken by the global, European and Spanish regulatory authorities during 2020 to reduce pressure on banks in the midst of the global pandemic has enabled institutions to channel their efforts and resources more efficiently and swiftly in order to contribute to a rapid economic recovery.\n\nAt the global level, the Financial Stability Board (hereinafter FSB) encouraged competent authorities to use the flexibility of international standards. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) announced a delay in implementing the Basel III package (until 2023) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a guide on the application of IFRS 9 in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThese measures have been aimed at maintaining the provision and extension of credit in exceptional circumstances. However, this extension necessarily requires proper recognition of potential impairments. In this regard, both prudential and accounting authorities have made it clear that the flexibility that has been included in the rules should be used so as to avoid automatisms in the reclassification of exposures. This has been particularly relevant in cases where payments have been made on certain loans.\n\nAmong the measures announced by European agencies , the most significant have been those related to the possibility of using prudential buffers, for both capital and liquidity. In this regard, the European Commission, the European Banking Authority (hereinafter, EBA) and the ECB have had to adjust their initial work plans to allow financial institutions to devote more resources to stimulating the real economy.\n\nThe ECB stated that entities could operate under capital and liquidity buffers, and called on banks to apply restrictions on dividend distribution and share buybacks until September 30, 2021, as well as to exercise caution when paying variable remuneration. For its part, the EBA updated its work program for 2020 to reflect all the changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on its activities. The EBA therefore only engaged in new consultations that were considered critical, postponed the publication of the final technical standards based on their degree of completion and the time frame envisaged for their implementation, and suspended the data collections normally used for ad-hoc analyses. The EBA also provided operational relief to financial institutions by postponing the 2020 stress test and recommending that authorities make use of the regulatory flexibility. It has also published guidelines on the handling of public and private payment deferrals and other national measures. Additionally, the EBA has published guidelines regarding the treatment of public and private payment deferrals, which have been extended until March 31, 2021, as well as its reporting and other national measures for the banks to continue to grant loans at the same time as recognizing any solvency issue, ensuring by the latter, that problematic loans are adequately reflected in the banks' accounts.\n\nThe European Commission published in December 2020 its Action Plan about non-performing loans (NPLs) in which it highlights the need to act rapidly and not incurring the same situation lived during the last crisis to guarantee the protection of clients and especially vulnerable debtors. This action plan is based on four points: i) Development of secondary markets for the impaired assets; ii) network of bad banks (AMCs); iii) Frameworks for insolvency, restructuring and debt recovery; and iv) NPLs management via a crisis management framework and governmental support programs.",

        "page_content": "In terms of regulations affecting the banking sector , the main changes to the prudential framework of the Capital Requirements Regulation (known as \"CRR Quick Fix\") intended to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and ensure the flow of credit have been as follows: i) extension of the transitional agreement to mitigate the effect of IFRS 9 on capital; ii) modification of the prudential backstop of provisions for loans with public guarantees, bringing it in line with the beneficial treatment received by other guaranteed exposures; iii) anticipation of support factors for SMEs and infrastructure, which allow the risk weighting of these exposures to be reduced; (iv) early implementation of the EBA decision on software deduction; and (v) prudential filtering for sovereign bond exposures so as to reduce the effects of potential volatility in these instruments on entities capital.\n\nAs  regards  the  regulation  of  the bank  resolution framework,  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Single  Resolution  Board (hereinafter SRB), in response to the pandemic, the deadlines for banks to report the creation of the minimum required eligible liabilities (MREL) required by European standards have been extended. The body, however, has decided not to extend the deadline for banks to make their annual contribution to the future Single Resolution Fund and has encouraged the early adoption of the Resolution Directive and Regulation (known as BRRD2/SRMR2 respectively). The European Commission published a consultation paper on the roadmap for the crisis management framework and its intention to carry out an impact assessment on the potential modification of the crisis management framework and the deposit guarantee fund framework (BRRD/SRMR/DGSD) for a legislative initiative in 2021.\n\nOn a purely national level , within the temporary framework of state aid from the European Commission, the Spanish authorities approved a mortgage payment deferral and a credit facility with a \u20ac100,000m public guarantee. The Bank of Spain, in line with international and European authorities, also issued several statements recommending not to pay dividends, in addition to statements on the flexibility of the accounting regulation regarding provisions.\n\nLastly,  operational  measures  have  also  been  adopted,  mainly  related  to  reporting and  information  disclosure requirements, which aim to relieve entities from part of the operational burden resulting from regulatory and supervisory processes, thus allowing them to focus on their main activity, the granting of loans.\n\n## Financial markets: Capital Markets Union, securitization and reference indices.\n\n## 1. Capital Markets Union\n\nThe European Commission published an ambitious new Action Plan to boost the EU's Capital Markets Union (hereinafter, CMU), proposing 16 specific measures to make real progress toward completing the CMU in the coming years. The EU's main priority in 2020 has been to ensure that Europe can recover from the unprecedented economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and, in this sense, it is considered that the CMU can act as a lever to boost private finance as an essential factor in this recovery, to boost the transition toward a sustainable economy, to put the capital markets at the service of people and to project the global competitiveness of the EU economy by strengthening the international role of the euro. The Action Plan has three key objectives: i) to ensure that the EU's economic recovery is green, digital, inclusive and solid by making finance more accessible to European businesses, particularly to SMEs; ii) to make the EU an even safer place for individuals to save and invest in the long term; and iii) to integrate national capital markets into a genuine single EU-wide capital market.\n\nAs part of this plan, the European Commission has proposed the Capital Markets Recovery Package , which contains specific adjustments to the Prospectus Regulation, MiFID II and securitization rules. The Commission has proposed creating an \"EU Recovery Prospectus,\" a kind of shortened prospectus, for companies that already have a track record in the public market. It is also introducing some specific modifications to MiFID II requirements in order to reduce some of the administrative burdens that investors have faced in their business-to-business relations. At the same time, it also proposes to readjust requirements to ensure that there is a high level of transparency with respect to the customer, while simultaneously  guaranteeing  the  highest  standards  of  protection  and  acceptable  compliance  costs  for  European companies. Lastly, specific modifications to the securitization rules have been proposed to amend the Securitization Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation in order to enhance the securitization market as a balance sheet management tool for risk reduction and NPL management as a result of COVID-19. Its final version will not be available until the beginning of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Reference indices reform\n\nThroughout 2020, the public and private sectors continued to work in coordination on the reform of the financial market interest reference indices and on the transition toward new alternative indices. The FSB has called on financial and nonfinancial sector entities in all jurisdictions to continue their efforts to make wider use of risk-free rates in order to reduce dependence on IBORs (such as LIBOR, EURIBOR and TIBOR), and in particular to eliminate the remaining dependence on the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR), which could disappear by the end of 2021, by publishing a roadmap setting out a timetable of actions for financial and non-financial entities to ensure an orderly transition.\n\n- In Europe , the Commission proposed amending EU rules on financial reference indices in July. The purpose of the amendments is to create a framework that allows for the application, at the request of the European Commission, of a legal substitute rate when a systemically important reference index such as LIBOR or others ceases to be published or becomes unrepresentative.  This  will  reduce  legal  uncertainty  surrounding  existing  contracts  that  do  not  contain  adequate replacement indices and will avoid risks to financial stability.\n\nThe United Kingdom has also presented a legislative proposal that seeks to reduce the risk of litigation linked to potential disputes  in  contracts  linked  to  LIBOR  that  cannot  be  renegotiated  before  the  LIBOR's  date  of  disappearance  or unrepresentativeness in order to change the rate or include suitable substitutes. Among other issues, the regulatory proposal allows the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to urge a change in the methodology of an index (\"synthetic benchmark\") and prohibit its use by supervised entities in the United Kingdom except for certain types of contracts, which have yet to be specified (\"tough legacy\").\n\nLastly, various policy proposals have been made in the United States, some of which are limited to New York State and some of which are nationwide, but, thus far, none have been as successful as hoped.\n\nGreater coordination between the various legislators would be very conducive to ensuring an orderly transition.\n\n## 3. Anti-Money Laundering (AML)\n\nThere  is  a  strong  global  consensus  on  the  need  to  improve  policies  on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing . To this end, the European Commission iniciated consultation on an action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (PMLTF). The plan aims to implement an improved, robust and efficient regulatory framework that is adapted to innovation and ensures harmonized supervision, in all member states. Legislative proposals are expected for 2021.\n\n## Sustainable finance: Toward integration in regulation and prudential supervision\n\nThroughout 2020, progress has continued to be made so that the ESG criteria reach the entities' policies and their financial and risk departments specifically, so that these criteria fully integrate into their actions and corporate culture. The pandemic appears to have been an accelerator in this area as well.\n\nAt  the  global  level,  the  FSB  published  its  assessment  of  financial  authorities'  experience  in  including  physical  and transitional weather risks as part of their financial stability monitoring. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (hereinafter, TCFD), created by the FSB, has published a consultation paper with the objective of gathering feedback on climate-related forward-looking metrics that are useful for decision-making in the financial sector. The TCFD has also published important documents on sustainability: its third progress report in which it highlights the growth of disclosures in companies linked to the TCFD Recommendations; a guide on the analysis of climate-related scenarios and on the integration of climate-related risks in existing risk management processes; and a guide on the analysis of climaterelated scenarios for non-financial companies.\n\nThe EU continues to integrate sustainability into the financial system and continues to make progress in developing regulations for this purpose. The European Commission therefore consulted on its renewed sustainable finance strategy, which is expected to be published in early 2021. It has also consulted on a possible initiative on sustainable corporate governance principles. For their part, the Commission, Council and Parliament agreed on the taxonomy of sustainable activities with a common classification system applicable from the end of 2021 for adaptation and mitigation objectives. The European supervisory authorities (ESAs) published a consultation paper with a set of disclosure standards on ESG information. The survey is part of EBA's work to develop a draft Technical Implementation Standard (TIS) on the disclosure of prudential information regarding ESG risks. It will also be used to monitor the short-term expectations specified in the EBA Action Plan on Sustainable Finance. The EBA has also published for consultation the document on management and monitoring of ESG risks, which covers a wide range of topics (definition of ESG risks and factors, quantitative and qualitative indicators). Lastly, the ECB published its final guidelines on its supervisory expectations regarding climate change and environmental risks at the end of the year.",

        "page_content": "## Regulation in the field of digital transformation of the financial sector\n\nThe regulatory environment in the framework of digital transformation has also been significantly influenced by the COVID-19 health crisis, which has helped to establish the pre-existing trends in the economy's digitalization. The lessons learned during this crisis about the benefits of digitalization have fueled the authorities' work during this year, whereby they have updated their priorities and defined new action plans to maximize the benefits of digitalization for the economy. In the European Union, this has resulted in the publication of new strategies and initiatives, both throughout the economy as a whole and specifically for the financial sector.\n\nIn February, the European Commission published a strategy to shape the European Union's digital future. This digital strategy is based on two main pillars: strengthening the use of data, and developing and regulating artificial intelligence (hereinafter AI). As regards the first pillar, the data strategy , the European Commission announced a series of measures and new regulations, to be adopted between 2020 and 2021, aimed at facilitating the reuse of data, with a focus on public and business data. Among these measures, the Data Governance Regulations published in November will regulate the socalled \"data spaces,\" aimed at facilitating the aggregation of data from certain sectors and the development of frameworks for data sharing. Furthermore, although the strategy is not especially focused on personal data, it contemplates that the right  to  data  portability  established  in  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulations  could  be  improved  in  another  new regulatory  initiative  (Data Act),  to  be  published  in  2021.  These  initiatives  can  certainly  contribute  to  increasing  the European Union's competitiveness, allowing European citizens and companies to extract more value from their data.\n\nIn the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence -the second pillar of the digital strategy- the European Commission proposed measures to encourage research and investment in AI, and raised the possibility of introducing new regulation for certain applications of this technology in sectors designated as high risk, such as health or transport. The European Commission is expected to publish its proposal to regulate AI in the first quarter of 2021. In Spain, on December 2, 2020, the Government published the National Strategy of Artificial Intelligence aligned with the European initiatives.\n\nIn their effort to ensure a digital, competitive European economy, the authorities have also worked on revising the competition rules during 2020, to ensure that they are appropriate to the challenges of the digital age. With this objective, on December 15, the European Commission published a new legal proposal which aims to establish new obligations for large digital platforms, as part of a new regulation of digital services. The modernization of competition policy has also been a priority in the United States in 2020, as shown by the report published by Congress in October discussing the state of competition in digital markets and proposing options for updating competition policy.\n\nThe work plans of the European authorities to promote the digitalization of the financial sector have also been renewed this year. In September, the European Commission published its new strategy for digital finance, which outlines the roadmap until 2024. In addition to pursuing a regulatory framework that encourages innovation, the strategy seeks to eliminate barriers to the digital single market by implementing, among other things, a new cross-border framework for digital  identity.  Furthermore,  largely  motivated  by  the  emergence  of  new  financial  service  providers  (FinTechs and BigTechs), the strategy proposes a review of the financial sector's regulatory and supervisory framework to ensure compliance with the \"same activity, same risk, same regulation\" principle.\n\nIn line with the growing importance of data in the digital world, another key objective of this new strategy is to move toward a  more data-driven financial  sector.  To  this  end,  the  European  Commission,  in  collaboration  with  the  European Supervisory Authorities, will study how to facilitate the use of AI in the financial sector and the possibility of extending the data-sharing principles of open banking regulations such as the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) to other financial services and products. We still have to wait until 2022 to find out the authorities' proposals on the latter point; i.e. once the new  rules  to  promote  data  sharing  in  the  digital  economy  have  been  developed  (within  the  framework  of  the aforementioned data strategy).\n\nAlongside this strategy for digital finance, the European Commission proposed a new Regulation on Digital Operational Resilience to harmonize requirements across the EU. This new Regulation establishes requirements for technological risk management and proposes the creation of a direct monitoring framework for critical third parties (e.g. cloud computing service providers).\n\nThe year 2020 has also been very significant for the payments sector. On July 2, 16 major banks in the Eurozone, including BBVA, announced the beginning of the implementation phase of the European Payments Initiative (EPI). The objective of this initiative-to create a comprehensive pan-European payment solution enabling instant payments-is shared by European authorities. This is demonstrated by the European Commission's new retail payments strategy, published in September, which, among other things, aims to promote pan-European payment solutions and immediate payments in the \"new normal.\" The intention to revise the aforementioned PSD2 at the end of next year has also been announced as part  of  this  strategy.  At  the  global  level,  following  the  G20  mandate,  the  Committee  on  Payments  and  Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the FSB published a roadmap in 2020 setting out actions to be implemented in the coming years to improve cross-border payments.",

        "page_content": "Another area that attracted a lot of attention from international bodies and European regulators during 2020 was that of cryptoassets . At the global level, the FSB published a report in October with high-level recommendations for the regulation and supervision of global stablecoin schemes. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) also worked throughout 2020 to strengthen its standards to address the money laundering risks of this type of activity.\n\nAt the European level, the Commission published several legislative proposals on this matter in September, including the proposal for regulation to govern the cryptoasset markets (known as MiCA). This proposal includes rules to regulate the issuance of previously unregulated cryptoassets (including stablecoins) and related service providers, such as the custody or exchange of cryptoassets. For its part, the ECB published a report and a consultation paper in October on the possible issuance of a \"digital euro,\" an official digital currency, at the retail level, which would complement cash. The Eurosystem has not made a decision on its issuance, but wants to be prepared to do so in the future, if necessary.\n\nThe year 2020 has also been a year of much regulatory action on the digital plane in all countries. In Spain , the most notable development has been the approval of legislation in November to create a regulatory sandbox for the financial sector. In Turkey , a new payment rule came into force in January, which introduced a new open banking framework, similar to the one introduced by the aforementioned PSD2 in Europe. Turkish authorities worked throughout 2020 to develop the exact rules for implementing this framework. Meanwhile, Mexico's financial authorities also continued to develop the body of regulations derived from the Fintech Act throughout the year.",

In 2020, BBVA made progress in the development of its strategy, based on its Purpose , the six Strategic Priorities , and its Values , all of which are fundamental pillars of the Organization's overall strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The COVID-19 crisis validates our strategic vision\n\nDuring 2020 an unprecedented sanitary crisis has been suffered, with major economic and social implications. This unique situation has accelerated some relevant trends some of which are expected to remain, as outlined below:\n\n- \uf0b7 More challenging macroeconomic environment with a strong GDP contraction in 2020 whose recovery is still uncertain. This tougher context will impact directly on the banking sector with lower expected loan growths, lower interest rates for longer and higher Cost of Risk.\n- \uf0b7 Acceleration of client digitization. Social distancing has led to a massive use of e-commerce and other remote services (tele-health, e-learning, etc.). This acceleration has also been perceived in the banking sector with higher usage of online and remote assistance channels.\n- \uf0b7 Higher  concern  for  sustainability,  both  in  the  climate  and  social  field .  Social  component  has  gained momentum due to the social urgency derived from the economic crisis while climate action remains a key topic for all stakeholders.\n- \uf0b7 Acceleration of innovation . The pandemic has made evident the vulnerability of economies to external shocks. In  order  to  look  for  a  greater  resilience,  governments,  public  institutions  and  the  private  sector,  see  the recuperation plans as an opportunity to advance faster in terms of innovations (such as the investment in 5G, AI, data, etc.).",

The pandemic has and continues to adversely affect the global economy and the economic conditions and activity of the countries in which the Group operates, driving many of these countries into an economic recession.\n\nAfter following the latest news about the virus at the beginning of 2020, the Bank's Corporate Continuity Committee decided on March 9 to create a global war room , a crisis management team with a global overview of what was happening at each moment, and with the operational capacity to make swift decisions, in order to meet two of the Bank's fundamental and priority objectives: first of all, to preserve the health of all employees and customers, and secondly to ensure business and service continuity. The continuous and efficient coordination with the countries' war rooms, as well as continuous reporting to the Group's management and governance bodies, have facilitated the rapid and effective adoption of the measures required at any given time.\n\nThis swift decision-making, combined with digital and remote management capabilities, has allowed the BBVA Group to continue providing its services in all of the geographical areas in which it operates throughout the pandemic, and to provide its  customers  with  the  necessary  support  to  meet  their  financing  needs  and  alleviate  their  burden  through  various initiatives such as payment deferrals or making payments more flexible. All this has been accompanied by continuous monitoring and management of the main impacts of the crisis on the Bank's business and risks, such as the financial impacts on the income statement, capital or liquidity.\n\nIn this context, BBVA's strategy regarding the relationship model and digital capabilities has been reaffirmed and has proven to be an asset in this environment, allowing it to be closer to customers when they have needed it most.\n\n2020 was an extraordinary year that required a rapid and efficient response. Despite this tough environment and thanks to the agility of the Organization, BBVA has been able to take an important step in the promotion and evolution of the six strategic priorities .",

Improving our clients' financial health\n\nBBVA aspires to be the trusted financial partner for its clients helping them with personal advice in their decision-making and management of their finances in order to help them achieve their vital and business goals.\n\nIn this sense, during 2020, BBVA continued enhancing its differentiated value proposition by developing financial health global solutions, launching initiatives to be present in its clients' day to day transactionality and evolving its digital offer to enterprise clients, taking advantage of its international presence.\n\nFor more information, see the chapters \"The customer comes first\" and \"Contribution to society\" included in this report.\n\n## 2.  Helping our clients transition towards a sustainable future\n\nBBVA is aware of the remarkable role of banks in the transition toward a more sustainable and inclusive future , through its financing operations and advisory services. For this reason, BBVA is committed to align its activity to the Paris Agreement, and it wants to use its role to help its clients transition toward a more sustainable future, inspiring itself in the Sustainable Development Goals selected.\n\nFor BBVA those Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are priority in which the Group can have a greater positive impact by harnessing the multiplier effect of banking.\n\nIn this regard, BBVA is implementing this strategic priority through two ways:\n\n- \uf0b7 Climate Action : mobilizing the appropriate resources to manage the challenge of climate change tackling those SDGs involved, i.e. Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and Climate action (SGD 13).\n- \uf0b7 Inclusive Growth : mobilizing the investments needed to build inclusive infrastructures and support inclusive economic development. In this case, the SDGs that BBVA wants to foster are: Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9).\n\nFor more information, see the chapter 'Sustainability at BBVA' included in this report.\n\n## 3.  Reaching more clients\n\nBBVA looks to grow by being where the client is. It aims to accelerate the profitable growth, supporting itself on its own and third party channels with a special focus on digital and most profitable segments.\n\nIn this sense, during 2020, and despite the tough environment, BBVA has been able to increase strongly its clients in all its footprint (+ 3.6% with respect to 2019). This growth has been boosted by the digital channels. The number of customers acquired through these channels has increased in 56% with respect to 2019.\n\nBBVA not only has carried out successful strategies to gain clients but also has set the grounds for future growth in the coming years. On the one hand, it has strengthened its open market capabilities in its own channels (e.g. biometric own verification technology improvement, E2E digital onboarding channel optimization, etc.). On the other hand, it has reinforced the acquisition of customers with attractive partnerships with third parties.\n\nFor more information, see the chapter 'The customer comes first' that follows.\n\n## 4.  Driving operational excellence\n\nBBVA wants to provide the best customer experience, with simple and automated processes, and maintaining its focus in the solid management of risks and the optimum capital allocation.\n\nIn this regard, BBVA is focusing on a simpler, more scalable and productive model leveraging on BBVA's digital capabilities where customers could access products and services remotely. BBVA wants to perform this service with an efficient and productive operational model with simple and automated processes on account of new technology and data analytics.\n\nThis operational excellence has to be performed with a robust risk management , taking into account both financial and non-financial risks. In this regard, BBVA is working on enhancing its global platforms to improve its Retail and SMEs risk management. Additionally, the optimum capital allocation is still a key factor for BBVA.\n\nFor more information see the chapters 'The customer comes first', 'Technology and innovation', 'The best and most engaged team', 'Ethical behavior' and 'Contribution to society' and 'Risk management' included in this report.",

The Bank's objectives are my own and I do everything in my power to achieve them and make our Purpose a reality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe values are reflected in the main levers for the Bank's transformation and in the Talent & Culture processes: from the selection  of  new  talent  to  the  roles  allocation  procedures,  people  development,  training  and  inducement  for  goals attainment. One of the main actions to promote the living of the Values at BBVA is the Values Day, a global event in the cultural transformation of BBVA that aims to approach the values of the Entity to all the Group employees, creating conversation spaces about them. In 2020, the Bank has held the third Values Day edition, which, due to the COVID-19 context, has been 100% digital. Despite the distance, the employees have remained more united than ever thanks to the Values, and that has been the motto this year: 'United by our values'. More than 90,000 employees, 80% of the workforce, has logged in at any time during the day in order to take part in the activities performed. Around 6,800 global workshops have been carried out with nearly 58,000 participants from the 19 countries where BBVA has headquarters. The 100% digital format has resulted in an increase in the participation in the activities in more than a 55% with respect to the previous year.\n\nIn addition, at the beginning of 2020, one of the Group priorities was launched: a new leadership program called 'We lead together', which is linked with the purpose and the values of BBVA, and which seeks to make all the employees leaders and  that  this  leadership  is  exercised  with  integrity.  This  new  model  aims  to  boost  three  skills:  entrepreneurship, empowerment and accountability, which are incorporated into the intrinsic skills catalogue, and become part of the",

A leader at BBVA is, above all, somebody that lives the values of the Group with integrity and honesty, who has an entrepreneurial spirit and who seeks new ways of doing things, who empowers the teams and assumes the responsibility of his decisions and its results.\n\nAnother priority for the Bank is the commitment of all employees. BBVA's goal is to improve the commitment because, the greater it is, the higher is the satisfaction of employees at their workplace and company, and better is the answer to the customer's needings. Annually, BBVA carries out the Employee Engagement Survey, managed by Gallup. In 2020, 94.2% of the employees have participated in the survey, 4.4 percentage points more than in 2019 (89.8%). The most relevant aspect is the significant improvement of the Grand Mean, the strategic KPI which measures the progress made in the strategic priority 'The best and most engaged team', and which is obtained by the average of the twelve main questions of the survey. Thus, this last year a value of 4.25 out of 5 was reached, which represents an improvement compared to last year (4.11 points). In the same way, the BBVA employee engagement index, which is calculated by dividing the percentage of engaged employees by that of actively unengaged employees, improved in 2020 to 10.17 (6.63 in 2019).",

The materiality matrix is one of the sources that feeds the Group's strategic planning and determines the priority issues to report on.\n\nThis analysis includes the perspective of the stakeholders of the main countries where the Group operates: Spain, Mexico, the United States, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia and Peru.\n\nThe materiality analysis phases have been as follows:\n\n- 1. Identification of the material issues in 2020 . Based on the material issues of 2019, the different tools for listening to the stakeholders managed by the Bank were reviewed, as well as the most recent trend studies and this list was updated. As the main novelty, the management of COVID-19 appears as a new issue.\n- 2. Prioritization  of  issues  according  to  their  importance  for  stakeholders .  BBVA  carried  out  a  series  of interviews and ad-hoc surveys in the countries covered by the study in order to learn the priorities of various stakeholders. Datamaran was used as a data analysis tool for other stakeholders in all countries except in Turkey, where local Turkish sources were used. Together, the sources that made it possible to complete the analysis of the stakeholders, global trends and key issues in the sector are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3.

This requires an adequate management of risks and opportunities.\n- \uf0b7 Solvency and financial results : The stakeholders expect BBVA to be a robust and solvent bank, thus contributing to the stability of the system. They also expect BBVA to be a bank with good results over time. That is, they demand a sustainable business model in the current context characterized by the continuous development of disruptive technologies and the consolidation of Big Tech as competitors. A more competitive environment, with more opportunities and also with more risks.\n- \uf0b7 Easy,  fast  and  do  it  yourself  (DIY): The  stakeholders  expect  BBVA  to  continue  putting  technology  and digitalization at the service of customers and the business. Thus, it will be more agile and more simple for customers to operate with the Bank any time and from anywhere (mobile banking, fully digital contracting processes, etc.). In addition, new technologies will allow BBVA for greater operational efficiency, generating value for shareholders.\n- \uf0b7 Financial health and personalized advice to customers : The stakeholders expect the Bank to get to know its customers and, where appropriate, propose personalized solutions and recommendations to better manage their financial health and achieve their vital objectives, all this proactively.\n\nBBVA has set goals related to the material issues of the previous materiality matrix.

In addition, the use of digital channels and remote managers was encouraged. BBVA also launched support initiatives throughout 2020 focused on the most affected customers, whether they be companies, SMEs, the selfemployed workers or individuals, and which include, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 In Spain , support for SMEs, the self-employed workers and companies through credit lines guaranteed by the Spanish Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO ), grace periods on loans to individuals (up to 12 months in residential mortgages for primary residence and up to 6 months in consumer finance) and moratorium of 3 months for citizens on social rental housing under the Social Housing Fund;\n- \uf0b7 In the United States , flexibility in the repayment of the loans for small business and for consumer finance has been extended and certain fees and commissions for individual customers has been eliminated;\n- \uf0b7 In Mexico , BBVA granted various supports with personalized characteristics based on the needs of each of the customer segments, offering personalized solutions in a wide variety of products ranging from a grace period of 6 months in capital and/or interest in various lending products to the suspension of Point of Sale (POS) fees to support  retailers  with  lower  turnover,  as  well  as  different  support  plans  aimed  at  each  situation  for  larger businesses customers;\n- \uf0b7 In Turkey , delay of loan repayments, interests and amortizations until June, 2021, without any penalty  for individual customers and extension of up to 6 months in the payment of principal on credits to companies;\n- \uf0b7 In South America , Argentina has provided micro-SMEs and SMEs with access to credit facilities to purchase remote  working  equipment,  funding  facilities  for  payroll  payments  and  the  refinancing  unpaid  credit  card balances in 9 installments; Colombia has frozen the repayment of loans for individuals and companies for up to 6 months, and is offering a special working capital facility for companies; and in Peru , several measures were approved  to  order  to  support  SMEs  and  customers  with  consumer  loans  or  credit  cards,  including  debts rescheduling, extending the payment periods.\n\n## Solutions for customers\n\nIn recent years, BBVA has focused on offering the best customer experience , distinguished by its simplicity, transparency and speed, and increasing the empowerment of customers and offering them a personalized advice.\n\nIn order to continue improving customer solutions, the Group's value proposition evolved throughout the year 2020 around seven axes on which global programs developed, related to both retail and corporate projects:\n\n- \uf0b7 Growth in customers through own and third-party channels.\n- \uf0b7 Growth in revenue with a focus on profitable segments.\n- \uf0b7 Value proposition, differentiation through customer advice.\n- \uf0b7 Operational efficiency.\n- \uf0b7 Data-focused capabilities and enablers.\n- \uf0b7 New business models.\n- \uf0b7 A Global Entity.\n\nThese solutions can be divided into two large groups: Those that allow the customer to access the services in a more convenient and simple way (Do It Yourself, DIY) and those that provide customers with personalized advice , offering them products or information specific to their current situation. These last two items are particularly important in the new strategy related to the commitment to improve customers' financial health .",

        "page_content": "Solutions for 2020 customers include the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 In individual banking , the ' GLOMO' DIY mobile banking platform stands out, whose development continues, reaching Peru and Argentina. This solution is being continuously enhanced by features such as ' Valora auto ' for advice on the purchase and sale of second-hand cars in Spain. BBVA continues to deploy these capabilities in all of its geographical areas, where it has developed various journeys and digital advisory tools to help improve the financial health of its customers, such as warnings and advice for certain events such as a duplicate receipt or the possibility of investing in Spain or Turkey, help to control their finances on a day-to-day basis through analysis of expenses and income (Personal Financial Management, PFM) in Peru and Colombia, tools for effortless savings, such as ' Metas ' in Peru or investment advisory tools such as 'Invest' in Mexico.\n\nWith the aim of enhancing security, financing, loyalty and offering value added features, BBVA has transformed its value proposal into cards, as it is the case with the launch of a new family of pioneering cards in Spain, 'Aqua', where  the  personal  account  number  (PAN)  and  expiration  date  are  not  printed  on  the  card,  and  the  card verification value (CVV) is dynamic, preventing possible fraudulent use of these data.\n\n- Furthermore, high digital capacities have been brought to all the geographical areas in which the Group operates and the sustainability panel has been introduced, which focuses on offering customer guidance on the concept of sustainability and on how to reduce their impact on the emission of greenhouse gases in their business activity.\n- \uf0b7 As part of its commitment to promoting the use of technology in order to improve its customer relationship, BBVA has developed 'Blue', the virtual assistant that uses various artificial intelligence tools to help users both to perform tasks within the BBVA app and to obtain detailed and personalized information about their accounts.\n- \uf0b7 In the SME and retailer segment, BBVA continues to make strong progress in delivering solutions that enables customers to interact with the Bank in the most convenient way for their needs. A significant example of these developments are the new digital signature capabilities, which prevents the customers from having to go to the branches.\n\nWith regard to SMEs and self-employed workers , relationship and management models are being reinforced in order to be able to manage them according to their needs across the different channels. This meant that the Bank was awarded second place as \" SME Global Bank of the Year \" by the SME Finance Forum (International Finance Corporation - World Bank, IFC-WB). Among other achievements, the tool \" Banco de Barrio \" has been implemented in Mexico, a model that seeks even closer relationships with SMEs. Progress has also been made in the remote customer management model with, for example, the creation of the transactional SMEs managerial figure in Spain.\n\nIn terms of digital channels, the launch of the BBVA Empresas app (GEMA) in Mexico and its extension to Peru are particularly notable, allowing SMEs and the self-employed workers to manage and run their businesses from their cell phones more quickly and easily. Among other features, customers can request a POS advance, a pioneer product  in  the  Mexican  market,  based  on  the  customer's  transactions.  Furthermore,  within  the  COVID-19 environment,  the  Bank  has  helped  SMEs  to  sell online  and  100%  digital  registration  processes  have  been developed in Spain.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Bank's commitment to globalization, the range of services for companies operating in various geographical areas continues to grow, such as the incorporation of BBVA USA into the global payment and collection platform ('OneBank Hub'), thus completing its deployment in all the countries in which BBVA operates, in addition to offering new services such as global balances and transactions (Global MT940) and payments from third parties (Global MT101), among others, together with the new ' Global NetCash' app. A new supply chain finance solution has also been launched to compete with and drive business in South America, the United States and Europe.\n\n- \uf0b7 As part of its commitment to sustainability guidance , BBVA has also added a new feature to the OneView financial aggregator that allows companies to know the volume of emissions they emit into the atmosphere through their activity.\n\nThe development of new business models allows BBVA to reach new customers in third-party channels, where it is worth highlighting:\n\n- \uf0b7 The launch, together with an insurance company and a representative organization of the official vehicle dealers association, of the NIW platform in Spain, a website for buying and selling used cars that integrates with BBVA Automik's digital solution for car financing.\n- \uf0b7 Agreements with third parties which have enabled BBVA to reach more users, such as the agreement with a company which offers vehicles for hire in Mexico to offer a co-branded account to its drivers, or with a Chinese international online shop in Spain which enables Chinese tourists to pay at Spanish retailers using , the world's leading payment platform .\n\nBBVA's customer solutions are leveraged on the improvement of design capabilities or the use of data for analysis. They also contribute positively to increasing digital sales and improving the main customer satisfaction indicators, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS), shown in the following section, and the drop-out ratio.",

At the end of the year, BBVA's digital customers accounted for 63% of the total and customers operating with the bank through their mobile phones accounted for 59% across the entire Group.\n\n## Net Promoter Score\n\nThe  internationally  recognized Net  Promoter  Score  (NPS) methodology,  measures  customers'  willingness  to recommend a company and therefore, the level of satisfaction of BBVA's customers with its different products, channels and services. This index is based on a survey that measures on a scale of zero to ten whether a bank's customers are promoters (a score of nine or ten), passives (a score of seven or eight) or detractors (a score of zero to six) when asked if they would recommend their bank, a specific channel or a specific customer journey to a friend or family member. This information is vital for checking for alignment between customer needs and expectations and implemented initiatives, establishing plans that eliminate detected gaps and providing the best experiences.\n\nThe Group's consolidation and application of this methodology over the last ten years provides a common language both internally and with customers that facilitates everyone's involvement and the integration of the voice of customers in everything the Bank does, from the beginning. This has led to a steady increase in customers' level of trust, as they recognize BBVA to be one of the most secure and recommendable banking institutions in every country where it operates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, BBVA has remained the leader in the retail NPS indicator in Spain, Mexico, Colombia and Peru. In Uruguay, it has climbed one position with respect to 2019, reaching the top position.  In Turkey, BBVA ranked second, maintaining its position with respect to 2019, whereas in Argentina the customer's perception has been affected by the incidences in digital channels and the blocking of the call center due to an increase in the use of these channels as a result of the pandemic. To reverse it, different action plans have been boosted by Top Management.\n\nMeanwhile, in the commercial NPS indicator BBVA maintained the leading position in four countries: Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay. In Spain and Argentina, BBVA ranked second.\n\n## Transparent, Clear and Responsible Communication: a lever to improve financial health\n\nTransparency, clearness and responsibility (hereinafter, TCR ) are three principles which BBVA systematically integrates into the design and implementation of the main solutions, deliverables and experiences for customers in order to help them make the best decisions for themselves and thus take care of their financial health.\n\nThe objective pursued is, as well as helping customers make good life decisions, to maintain and increase their confidence in the Bank and increase their recommendation rates.\n\nThree work lines are developed to turn these principles into reality:\n\n- \uf0b7 Implementing  the  TCR  principles  in  new  digital  solutions  through  the  participation  of  TCR  experts  in  the conceptualization  and  design  of  these  solutions,  especially  in  massive  impact  digital  solutions  for  retail customers.\n- \uf0b7 Incorporating the TCR principles into the creation and maintenance of key content for customers (product sheets, contracts, sales scripts. responses to claim letters, communication regarding COVID-19, etc).\n- \uf0b7 Awareness-raising and training on TCR throughout the Group, through  a virtual community, workshops and online activities, and a virtual community with more than 24,000 training activities since 2014 (7,827 in 2020). In 2020, a new course about financial health has been launched for all the employees of the Group.\n\nIn 2020, greater efforts have also been concentrated on one of the principles of Clearness (accessibility) and mechanisms are being generated so that global solutions are accessible.\n\nThe project is coordinated by a global team working together with a network of local owners located in the main countries in which the Group is present, and various departments and individuals from the Entity participate in its implementation.\n\n## Indicators\n\nBBVA uses an indicator to measure its performance in TCR, the Net TCR Score (NTCRS), which is calculated following the same methodology of the NPS and allows measuring the degree to which customers perceive BBVA as a transparent and clear bank, compared to its peers, in the main countries where the Group is present.",

The approach that BBVA is following covers both all the new developments as well as legacy systems and protection follows a prioritization system where key data assets are identified and protection plans are put into place. This, together with the renewed focus on Identity and Access Management and on managing risks on the Bank's third parties forms a comprehensive strategy around data security, privacy and protection.\n\n## Strategy\n\nBBVA's security Strategy resides on 3 fundamental pillars: cybersecurity, data security and security in business processes and fraud. A program has been designed for each of these three pillars, with the aim to reduce the risks identified in the developed  taxonomy.  These  programs,  that  consider  security  industry  best  practices  established  by  internationally accepted security standards, are periodically reviewed to evaluate the progress and the effective impact on the Group risks.\n\nDuring 2020, within the framework of the implementation of the security strategy, security measures adopted with the aim to ensure an adequate protection of BBVA's information and assets that support business processes have been reinforced. The implementation of these measures, necessary to mitigate the security risks BBVA Group is exposed to, has been performed with a global perspective and an integral approach, considering not only the technological approach but also the people, processes and security governance approach.\n\nRegarding the reinforcement of the security measures, the following could be highlighted: Measures established with the aim to ensure end-to-end protection of business processes, considering logical and physical security, privacy and fraud management: measures established to ensure compliance of the 'security and privacy by design principles'; and to improve client access control and authentication services related to online services, from a security and user experience perspective, using the mobile device as the main element, in line with BBVA's digital transformation strategy.\n\nSome of the main initiatives performed during 2020 to improve BBVA's security and client protection, that are being implemented throughout the Group are the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 Aqua card launch, the first card without printed card number (PAN), with dynamic CVV, reinforcing security, since not having these data prevents possible fraudulent use of them.\n- \uf0b7 Implementation  of  Strong  Customer  Authentication  in  e-commerce,  requiring  two  of  the  three  possible authentication mechanisms. Implementation of the 'Where is my card?' functionality, that allows the customer to have an overview of all e-commerce or platforms where they have registered their bank cards.\n- \uf0b7 Implementation of new behavior biometrics and malware protection for digital clients to reinforce analytical and fraud detection capabilities in mobile channels.\n- \uf0b7 Enhancement of the section with security advice and recommendations in BBVA's application to make clients aware of the main risks they are exposed to, so that they can prevent or act against possible threats.\n\nAdditionally,  BBVA  has  continued  performing  the  training  and  awareness  initiatives  related  to  security  and  privacy, performing training actions and awareness campaigns for BBVA's employees, clients and society in general.\n\nAmong the main campaigns and awareness initiatives performed and recommendations included in BBVA's application, online channels and social networks, the following could be highlighted: Secure password management, phishing and other technical attacks detection, detection of scams, security in online purchases and protection of personal information.\n\nOther lines of action also include the adequate training of BBVA's Board members in the area of security and incident management, as well as the periodic performance of global and local simulation exercises in order to raise the level of",

This Committee meets each two months in order to guarantee an adequate security management, analyze the possible new risks to which the Entity is exposed as a result of the digital transformation, and to adopt the necessary measures for its management.\n\nIn addition, each of the areas which compose the Corporate Security area has Committees and work groups responsible for the management of the different spheres related to information security (transactions security, security associated with technology, physic security, security in business processes, security related to staff, etc.) The most relevant issues are those that are afterwards submitted to the Information Security Steering Committee.\n\nOn the other hand, the governance model is composed by the Committees responsible for the information protection and fraud management, where both the Corporate Security area and the rest of the concerned areas of the Entity participate.\n\nLastly, there is the Technology and Cybersecurity Commission, composed by the Chairman of BBVA and members of the Executive Committee.  This Commission is responsible for the oversight of the Group's technological and cybersecurity strategy and allows the Board of Directors to be informed of the main technological risks to which the Group is exposed, as well as current cybersecurity and technology trends and any relevant security event that can affect the Group.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nIn the actual context, it is vital to ensure effective protection for BBVA's assets and customers' data.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has detected an increase in the number of attacks, accentuated by the presence of organized crime groups specialized in the banking sector and working in a multi-country environment.\n\nFurthermore, COVID-19 pandemic has been used by cybercriminals to increase the scope of social engineering attacks through e-mail, SMS, instant messaging systems and social networks. It has also contributed to the emergence of new risks and challenges for companies, like the ones related to security in remote working and the increase on the attack surface.\n\nThe  Global  Computer  Emergency  Response  Team  (CERT)  is  the  Group's  first  line  of  detection  and  response  to cyberattacks aimed at global users and the Group's infrastructure, combining information on cyber threats from our Threat Intelligence unit. The Global CERT, which is based in Madrid, operates 24 hours 7 days a week and provides services in all countries where the Group operates, under a scheme of managed security services, with operation lines dedicated to fraud and cybersecurity.\n\nAs cyberattacks evolve and become more sophisticated, the Group has strengthened its prevention and monitorization efforts.\n\nTherefore, system monitoring capabilities have been reinforced, with particular attention to the critical assets that support business processes in order to prevent threats from materializing and, if necessary, to immediately identify and respond to any security incident that may occur. Incident prevention, detection and response capabilities have also been strengthened  through  the  use  of  integrated  information  sources,  improved  analytical  capabilities  and  automated platforms.\n\nMeasures implemented have improved information security management from a predictive and proactive approach, based on the use of digital intelligence and advanced analytical capabilities. The main objective of these measures is to ensure an immediate and effective response to any security incident that can occur, with the coordination of different business and support areas involved, the reduction of the possible negative impact and, if necessary, the report in a timely manner to the corresponding supervisory or regulatory authorities.\n\nBBVA routinely reviews, reinforces and tests its security processes and procedures through simulation exercises in the areas of physical security and digital security. Specialized teams periodically perform security technical tests in order to detect and correct possible security vulnerabilities. These tests include technical tests of technological platforms as well as malicious users simulated attacks performed by the 'red team'. The outcome of such exercises is a fundamental part of a feedback process designed to improve the Group's cybersecurity strategies.",

All the initiatives are performed guaranteeing compliance of the security and privacy regulatory requirements applicable, especially those related to personal data protection.\n\nAll activities related to the data protection program are reviewed by the Data Protection Committee, where all relevant stakeholders of the organization are represented.\n\nFor more information about personal data protection, see the section 'Data protection' within the chapter 'Ethical Behavior'.\n\n## Security in business processes and fraud\n\nCybersecurity efforts are frequently undertaken in close coordination with our fraud prevention efforts and there are considerable interactions and synergies between the relevant teams. As part of the efforts to monitor fraud evolution and to actively support the deployment of adequate anti-fraud policies and measures, a Corporate Fraud Committee has been created, that oversees the evolution of all external and internal fraud types in all countries where the Group operates. Its functions include: (i) actively monitoring fraud risks and mitigation plans; (ii) evaluating the impact thereof on the Group's business and customers; (iii) monitoring relevant fraud facts, events and trends; (iv) monitoring accrued fraud cases and losses; (v) carrying out internal and external benchmarking; and (vi) monitoring relevant fraud incidents in the financial industry.\n\nBoth BBVA and its subsidiaries have cybersecurity and fraud insurance, subject to certain loss limits, deductions and exclusions.\n\n## Business Continuity\n\nTo conclude, during 2020 the Business Continuity continued to be reinforced from a holistic perspective, paying special attention to the Bank's resilience.\n\nIn this way, the evolution from a model mainly oriented to guarantee the continuous provision of products and services in situations with high impact and low probability to a model where the organization has the ability to absorb and adapt to situations with an operative impact due to disruptions of different nature (such as pandemias, cyber incidents, natural disasters or technological failures) is consolidated. This transition has implied an intense activity of the Business Resilience Office that, in conjunction with the Group Crisis Management Committees and Continuity Committees have had a relevant role in the management of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemia.\n\nThe Business Resilience Office provides coherence to the whole BBVA's Continuity Management System, and allows to keep  the  different  management  levels  coordinated  (both  the  operational,  which  affect  Business  Continuity  critical processes, and the non-operational) and managed in an integrated and organized manner. BBVA has documented procedures for the management of crisis situations, which detail, among other issues, the crisis qualification and scaling procedures, the responsibilities assignment, the governance model and the general answer procedures to these kind of situations.\n\nFor more information about issues related to technology and technological innovations, see chapter 'Technology and innovation'.",

It also resolves those related to insurance and other financial products that BBVA Group Customer Care Service considers appropriate to escalate, based on the amount or particular complexity, as established under article 4 of the Customer Protection Regulation. And in the second instance, the Customer Ombudsman is made aware of and resolves the complaints and claims that the customers decide to submit for their consideration after their claim or complaint has been dismissed by the Customer Care Service.\n\n## Activity report on the Customer Care Service in Spain\n\nThe Customer Care Service works to detect recurring, systemic or potential problems in the Entity, in compliance with European claims guidelines established by the relevant authorities (ESMA and EBA) . Its activity, therefore, goes beyond merely managing claims, but rather, it works to prevent them and in cooperation with other BBVA departments.\n\nDuring 2020, as a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, the Customer Service has worked from the beginning to implement the necessary measures for the continuity of the service and to limit its impact. The objective has been and is to ensure that the service is provided as normally as possible and complying with the legal deadlines in responding to claims.\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis, the Customer Service has been actively participating in the different analysis groups of the new types of claims arising as a result of the COVID-19 measures.\n\nFurthermore, in order to guarantee adequate knowledge of the managers, all the Customer Care Service team has received in 2020 training on bank transparency, investor protection, and risk operations (for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing).\n\nClaims of customers admitted to BBVA's Customer Care Service in Spain amounted to 102,119 cases in 2020, 95,244 of which were resolved by the Customer Care Service itself and concluded in the same year, which represents 93% of the total (85,879; 82,531 and 96% in 2019, respectively). As of December 31, 2020 6,875 were pending analysis. On the other hand, 13,571 claims were not admitted for processing as they did not meet the requirements set out in OM ECO/734.\n\n## COMPLAINTS HANDLED BY THE CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE BY COMPLAINT TYPE (PERCENTAGE)\n\n| Type                                      |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Resources                                 |     38 |     35 |\n| Assets products                           |     26 |     24 |\n| Insurances                                |      3 |      3 |\n| Collection and other services             |      4 |      5 |\n| Financial counselling and quality service |      4 |      5 |\n| Credit cards                              |     17 |     16 |\n| Securities and equity portfolios          |      1 |      1 |\n| Other                                     |      7 |     11 |\n| Total                                     |    100 |    100 |\n\n|                                                           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In favor of the person submiting the complaint            | 44,820 | 38,045 |\n| Partially in favor of the person submitting the complaint | 12,669 | 11,449 |\n| In favor of the BBVA Group                                | 37,755 | 33,037 |\n| Total                                                     | 95,244 | 82,531 |",

This change entailed that remote connections were multiplied by five in less than two weeks and videoconferences were multiplied by eight. The transition was carried out successfully, guaranteeing that employees were 100% operational without any term of inactivity thanks to the working in the cloud possibilities.\n\nIn addition, the change has accelerated an increasing and structural tendency of remote working, making possible to reduce the necessary space in the offices.\n\n## Technological purpose\n\nBBVA aspires to be the most trusted bank to give financial advice to all of its customers. To achieve this goal, technology plays a key role, making available to the business areas the necessary capacities to meet this challenge and offering customers reliable and secure solutions. Thus, technology allows to offer reliable and secure solutions to all customers, from the most digitized to the most traditional.\n\nBBVA's transformation focuses on incorporating new technological capabilities and making them available to customers while operating in the most efficient and reliable way possible. BBVA's strategic priorities underpin this transformation process:\n\n- \uf0b7 Operational excellence\n- o Technology also helps BBVA to achieve operational excellence through initiatives to streamline and automate processes.\n- o Reliability and productivity, that is, to obtain the best technological performance and to do it reliably, guaranteeing the highest quality standards.\n- \uf0b7 The best and most engaged team\n- o The cultural and skills transformation of the BBVA technology team, based on initiatives such as Ninja Academy or Tech University, is a key element in this process.\n- \uf0b7 Data and technology\n- o Based  on  the  new  technological  stack  that  allows  BBVA  to  offer  customers  the  most  advanced technology and the most adjusted service to their needs in a timely manner.\n- o A strong cybersecurity strategy to face the increase in cybercrime threats.\n\nBBVA's technology area is also actively collaborating to drive the Bank's other strategic priorities: 'Improving the clients' financial health', 'Helping the clients transition towards a sustainable future' and 'Reaching more clients', while helping to ensure the successful portfolio performance of other areas by providing the necessary skills and resources. In this regard, BBVA is creating digital factories that are key to enabling the incorporation of technology in the rest of the areas.",

Since 2017, initiatives that are reporting solid improvements are being carried out throughout the Group to reduce the operating load in the business areas. The objective is to achieve the automation of end-to-end processes as from 2020. Additionally, the area led the agile transformation in the Bank, which has enabled it to be more productive while reducing the time to market in development of solutions.\n\n## Reliability and productivity\n\nOne of the main results of BBVA's digital transformation is to improve the reliability of the services provided to customers and to increase the productivity of both day-to-day operations and the ability to create new products. For this, the technology with which the Bank works is transformed in terms of:\n\n## \uf0b7 Processing\n\n- o BBVA's strategy is based on the use of a hybrid cloud (with in-house and public cloud processing). In 2020, a total of five countries are processing data based on this infrastructure, headed by Spain and Mexico.\n- o These parts are already available, being used globally, and have been optimized to ensure that they can continue to operate reliably during their lifetime and with decreasing unit costs.\n- \uf0b7 Software development : global and multilocal functionalities have been developed, which have been reused by the different banks of the Group, and the degree of automation of the technological stack continues to increase.\n\nIn addition, the creation of a network of strategic alliances that contributes to the progress of the transformation continues to be promoted from the Engineering & Organization area. In this sense, an ecosystem of strategic agreements with some of  the  reference  companies  in  their  respective  fields  has  been  established,  ensuring  the  adoption  of  innovative technologies, the digitalization of the business, the speed of action and global deployment of solutions. In recent years, alliances have been established with industry leaders, who have helped to operate and optimize BBVA's current technology globally, and with start-up companies that, due to their potential, aimed at becoming market leaders in specific capacities.\n\n## The best and most engaged team\n\nBBVA is building the skills of its team with the aim of leading the transformation within the financial industry and keeping up with the relentless pace of technological progress. Notable talent development initiatives include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Ninja Academy : a learning community that seeks to foster a culture of continuous learning and help technical profiles keep up with the latest technological trends within the market.\n- \uf0b7 Tech University : an internal university offering programs in different formats, levels and featuring specialized content that allow technical employees to jump the technological gap from legacy technologies to new ones. It includes several learning itineraries to cover BBVA's various strategic needs.\n\nFor more information regarding the Group's cultural transformation and the employees skills, see chapter 'The best and most engaged team' below.",

As a result, BBVA is now launching developments in new, more global and reusable technologies to increase productivity. This new technology stack shares the cloud attributes of flexibility and stability that are demanded by the digital world, while ensuring strict compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe new technology platform makes cutting-edge technologies available globally for immediate use and incorporation into both global and local projects.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nIn  the  current  context  of  increased  threats  associated  with  cybersecurity,  BBVA  focused  on  protecting  both,  the information systems of the business areas and data.\n\nIn this sense, traditional capabilities that focus on the protection of the perimeter and information systems, have been maintained and advanced threat intelligence and adaptive cybersecurity capabilities have been introduced to protect the human  factor  (employees,  customers  and  other  stakeholders),  which  are  considered  the  weakest  links  in  any cyberdefense system and implement security system with a holistic approach that covers the entire life cycle of business processes.\n\nFurthermore, defense, resilience and recovery strategies to protect data have been put in place in three key areas: data representing  financial  assets,  data  relating  to  Bank  processes  and  the  lists  containing  the  identities  and  personal information of customers and employees.\n\nFor more information on cybersecurity, see section \"Security and customer protection\" within the chapter 'Customer comes first'.",

        "page_content": "## The best and most engaged team\n\n## Response to COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic  is  posing  an  unprecedented  social  and  humanitarian  challenge.  With  regard  to  people management, recommendations  from  health  authorities  have  been  followed,  including  taking  an  early  stance  on promoting remote working. For that purpose, platforms have been provided, carrying out a risk assessment of this type of work and developing existing applications to adapt them to the needs generated. The priority in BBVA's return plan is to protect the health of employees, customers and society in general. The return plan is being carried out following five principles in mind: 1) cautiousness; 2) gradual return; 3) work shift; 4) strict hygiene and safety measures; and 5) creation of  early  identification  protocols.  The  crisis  is  being  managed  in  a  dynamic  way;  adapting  the  procedures  in  each geographical area which the Group is present to the current situation, based on the latest data available regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the business and the level of customer service, in addition to the guidelines set by local authorities.\n\nThis pandemic is accelerating many of the trends that the Group had anticipated in the future of working life:\n\n- \uf0b7 Elements  such  as  social  responsibility,  purpose,  resilience  and  commitment  become  more  relevant  in  this environment  of  uncertainty  and  remote  work,  which  reinforces  the  importance  of  organizations  becoming increasingly \"more human.\"\n- \uf0b7 Ways of working based on attendance and hierarchies have become obsolete and, therefore, the transformation toward a more agile world which began a few years ago and toward leadership models based on employee empowerment and trust have become even more important in this context.\n- \uf0b7 Lastly, in a severely damaged economic environment, having the best talent is the key to companies' success, and even survival being highly important to be able to attract, retain and develop the best talent.\n\nIn order to guarantee adequate conditions in terms of labor health and safety, measures have been developed to respond to the pandemic generated by COVID-19. Likewise, specific departments have been created to control the actions carried out due to the pandemic. For more information, see the section 'Labor health and safety'.\n\n## People management\n\nThe team remains a strategic priority ( 'The best and most engaged team' ) and BBVA therefore continues promoting the commitment and performance of the employees to achieve its purpose, accompanying its transformation strategy with various different initiatives in matters related to staff, such as:\n\n- \uf0b7 The creation of a professional development model in which BBVA's employees are the main players, and which is more transversal, transparent and effective, in such a way that each employee can play the role that best suits their profile in order to contribute the greatest value to the Organization in a committed manner and with a focus on their training and professional growth.\n- \uf0b7 The strengthening of the agile organization model, in which teams are directly responsible for what they do, working based on customer feedback, and are focused on delivering the solutions that best meet current and future customer needs.\n- \uf0b7 The reinforcement of new knowledge and skills that were not previously common in the financial sector, but which  are  key  to  the  new  phase  in  which  the  Group  finds  itself  (data  specialists,  customer  experience, sustainability, etc.).\n- \uf0b7 The strengthening of a corporate culture of collaboration and entrepreneurship, which revolves around a set of values and behaviors that are shared by all those who make up the Group and which generate certain identity traits that differentiate it from other entities.\n\nAll this makes BBVA a purpose-driven organization, that is, a company that defines its position in order to improve the world and that encourages its employees to feel proud in their workplace, guiding them in the practice of the Bank's values and behaviors in order to achieve its purpose.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the BBVA Group had 123,174 employees located in more than 30 countries, 53.7% of whom were women and 46.3% were men. The average age of the staff was 38.2 years. The average length of service in the Organization was 11.1 years, with a turnover of 6.6% during the year.",

All Group employees were invited to participate in this system in a 360\u00ba review. The assessments resulting from this process are the basis for building the BBVA talent map , on which the BBVA employees differentiated management policies rests.\n\nThe above, together with the identification and assessment of the existing roles in the Group, makes it possible to get to know the professional possibilities of the employees even better, as well as to establish individual development plans, which promote functional mobility and professional growth.\n\nDuring 2020 BBVA has completed its professional development model, which empowers employees to own and drive their own career. Among the various initiatives launched, two innovative solutions, based on technology and data and inspired by the best digital players, are particularly notable: in October 2020, Open Mentoring was launched globally, a new mentoring format based on affinity algorithms between mentor and mentee, large scale and geared toward developing future capabilities; and Opportunity was launched during the last quarter of the year, representing a milestone in BBVA's value proposal to employees, as it begins to treat employees the same way it treats its customers, becoming their professional advisor, generating insights based on data and technology. These are pioneering solutions based on cuttingedge technologies (Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc.) and developed internally, which is a competitive advantage.",

The  non-realization  of  face-to-face  training throughout the majority of 2020 has not meant any inconvenience, but rather quite the opposite, thanks to the assessment that employees have made of this training.  The interest for training has significantly increased, resulting in a growth in training resources that have been completed by the employees of BBVA throughout 2020.",

Subjects such as data, agile, tech, sustainability, design, digital sales & marketing or cybersecurity have registered 79,909 participations by employees who have been able to broaden their knowledge in these areas and enhance their skills.  In 2020, BBVA launched a sustainability training for its more than 123,000 employees. A key part in this offering is the basic course on sustainability, compulsory for all the teams, and which includes basic contents about the issue. A course on financial health was also launched in 2020.\n\nBBVA Campus, as an open and decentralized model, has incorporated resources and innovative methodologies to its training programs, which have facilitated the practical application of what has been learned, allowing professionals to share their expertise with other colleagues. These type of sessions have involved 12,547 employees from all geographic areas.\n\nIt is also worth noting that BBVA promoted the certification of its professionals' knowledge in 2020. Thanks to internal certifications or official external certifications, professionals have been able to accredit specialized knowledge in the main business matters.\n\n| BASIC TRAINING DATA (BBVA GROUP)                                       |        |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                        | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Total investment in training (millions of euros)                       |   31.8 |   47.8 |\n| Investment in training per employee (euros)  (1)                       |  258   |  376   |\n| Hours of training per employee  (2)                                    |   41.4 |   42.4 |\n| Employees who received training (%)                                    |   92   |   90   |\n| Satisfaction with the training (rating out of 10)                      |    9.3 |    9.2 |\n| Average participations per employee                                    |   33   |   26   |\n| Amounts received from FORCEM for training in Spain (millions of euros) |    1.2 |    3.2 |\n\n## TRAINING DATA BY PROFESSIONAL CATEGORY AND GENDER (BBVA GROUP. 2020)\n\n|                      | Number of employees with training   | Number of employees with training   | Number of employees with training   | Training hours   | Training hours   | Training hours   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                      | Total                               | Male                                | Female                              | Total            | Male             | Female           |\n| Management team  (1) | 3,077                               | 2,098                               | 979                                 | 64,826           | 43,126           | 21,700           |\n| Middle controls      | 9,768                               | 5,162                               | 4,606                               | 255,076          | 137,242          | 117,834          |\n| Specialists          | 36,692                              | 17,648                              | 19,044                              | 1,242,055        | 572,230          | 669,825          |\n| Sales force          | 43,487                              | 18,745                              | 24,742                              | 2,192,527        | 968,162          | 1,224,365        |\n| Base positions       | 20,559                              | 8,747                               | 11,812                              | 1,348,223        | 511,307          | 836,916          |\n| Total                | 113,583                             | 52,400                              | 61,183                              | 5,102,707        | 2,232,066        | 2,870,641        |\n\n## TRAINING DATA BY PROFESSIONAL CATEOGRY AND GENDER (BBVA GROUP. 2019) (1)\n\n|                      | Number of employees with training   | Number of employees with training   | Number of employees with training   | Training hours   | Training hours   | Training hours   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                      | Total                               | Male                                | Female                              | Total            | Male             | Female           |\n| Management team  (2) | 1,395                               | 1,071                               | 324                                 | 61,020           | 47,125           | 13,895           |\n| Middle controls      | 7,183                               | 4,310                               | 2,873                               | 254,386          | 149,743          | 104,643          |\n| Specialists          | 28,152                              | 14,068                              | 14,084                              | 1,109,995        | 586,271          | 523,724          |\n| Sales force          | 35,940                              | 16,517                              | 19,423                              | 2,398,443        | 1,055,769        | 1,342,673        |\n| Base positions       | 21,236                              | 7,991                               | 13,245                              | 671,504          | 259,553          | 411,951          |\n| Total                | 93,906                              | 43,957                              | 49,949                              | 4,495,348        | 2,098,462        | 2,396,886        |\n\n- (1) Excluding Turkey.",

BBVA is committed to diversity in its workforce as one of the key elements in attracting and retaining the best talent and offering the best possible service to its customers.\n\nIn terms of gender diversity , women represent 31.6% of senior management and 43.4% of management positions, 32.2% of technology and engineering positions and 57.4% of business and profit generation positions.\n\nSeveral initiatives were launched in 2020 to support gender diversity:\n\n- \uf0b7 Setting gender diversity targets at the area and country level : a target has been established for each area in relation to the percentage of women to be promoted to higher responsibility categories in the next five years, with a quarterly follow-up. This goal will be supported by a specific diversity plan developed by each of the areas, which must ensure that these objectives are met.\n- \uf0b7 Working even more actively to incorporate more women into talent recruitment processes: in order to ensure equity and neutrality in the recruitment and professional growth processes, the capacity to identify the women in BBVA with the greatest potential has been improved through the new \"Talent Map\" tool and through greater proactiveness on the part of talent managers when it comes to offering these employees new professional challenges. As part of this effort, the \"Rooney Rule\" has been extended to more levels of the organization, the gender  component  has  been  introduced  in  succession  plans  and  training  and mentoring  plans  have  been enhanced.\n- \uf0b7 Continuing to work for a flexible working environment in which men can assume their family responsibilities to the same extent as women, so that this does not represent a professional obstacle for women. The \"Work Better, Enjoy Life\" initiative launched at the end of 2019 with the aim of achieving a more flexible and productive target-based work environment with a reduced presence in the workplace, has continued to grow in 2020 with a major focus on diversity. Among other initiatives, campaigns have been carried out to encourage men to make full use of their paternity leave.\n\nFurthermore, in order to ensure a diverse and inclusive working environment , BBVA is working on various initiatives to support the LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people) community through the ERG (Employee Resource Group) Be Yourself campaign, which is driven by the employees themselves. Among the initiatives launched this year are include the joining of REDI ( Red Empresarial por la Diversidad e Inclusi\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a , the Corporate Network for Diversity and LGBTI inclusion in Spain, the commitment to the United Nations \"Standards of Conduct for Business on Tackling Discrimination against LGBTIQ+ people\" and the adjustment of the Group's diversity policies.\n\nEfforts to promote diversity and equal opportunities between men and women were not only limited to BBVA collaborators but work was also done in order to improve the inequality between girls and young women through support for prestigious organizations in the societies in which BBVA operates.\n\nIn 2020, BBVA signed a global collaboration agreement with Inspiring Girls to promote equality by putting girls and young women in contact with female mentors in various areas. The objectives of the agreement also include helping Inspiring Girls to grow in the countries in which BBVA operates.\n\nOther initiatives aimed at reducing the technological gender gap between men and women have also been supported, such as Technovation, Girlsgonna or Node Girls.\n\nBBVA's efforts to promote diversity have earned it for the third consecutive year a place in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, a ranking of the 100 global companies in terms of gender diversity. BBVA is also a signatory of the Diversity Charter at European level and of the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles. Likewise, the UN selected one of BBVA's initiatives, \"Work Better, Enjoy Life,\" to make a business case in this regard and include it on its website relating to best practices on diversity and inclusion within the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEP) program.\n\nRegarding the question in the Employee Engagement Survey, managed by Gallup, which says \"BBVA always values diversity,\" a score of 4.52 out of 5 was obtained in 2020, exceeding 2019 results (4.41).\n\nThroughout 2020, three global events were held for BBVA employees related to diversity and inclusion: International Women's Day in March, International LGBTI Pride Day in June, and \"Diversity Days\" in the first week of December, whereby the progress made in this area by the various different geographical areas was shared and various online conferences and workshops were held so that employees could increase their knowledge of the subject. Some of these workshops were held by members of the ERGs (employee resource groups - groups of employees working for greater diversity).\n\nThis year, BBVA also published a manual, entitled \"Normalizing differences'', with the aim of providing all members of the Bank with basic knowledge of the LGBTI community. This manual defines concepts such as \"heteronormativity,\" explains the differences between sex, identity, orientation and gender expression, and offers a series of recommendations on how to handle the diversity that exists within the trans community itself.",

        "page_content": "- In Spain , BBVA presented to the Ministry of Equality in 2020 the 8th Maintenance Annual Report of the Seal of Distinction for Equality in the Company awarded by the Ministry of Equality to companies that are committed to equality between women and men. Negotiations also commenced with employee representatives on a new Equality Plan with the aim of bolstering BBVA's commitment to equality, diversity and the promotion of co-responsibility and adapting it to current applicable regulations. The Family-friendly Company certificate was also renewed, awarded to BBVA by the M\u00e1s Familia Foundation for being a proactive company in terms of its policies on equality of treatment and reconciliation of work, family and personal life, and was included in the Variable D2019 report that lists the 30 companies in Spain with best practices on diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn addition, the Talent & Culture management team was trained in inclusive job offers, reaching an agreement for the implementation of the Rooney Rule ; and a volunteer work agreement was signed with the Inspiring Girls Foundation so that, during the 2019-2020 school year, more than 80 women from BBVA were able to act as role models for school-age girls and demonstrate that the fact of being a woman is not a limitation for holding leadership positions in areas related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM subjects). BBVA was also chosen as one of the 15 pioneering Spanish companies in LGBT diversity management by the FELGTB ( Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de lesbianas, gays, trans y bisexuales - Spanish Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Trans and Bisexuals).\n\nIn the United States , BBVA has publicly shown its commitment to the fight against racism, promoting equality and social justice. These initiatives include support for the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement and the letter by which BBVA urged the United  States  Congress  to  promote  legislation  regulating  transparency,  equality  and  public  safety.  Also,  in commemoration of Freedom Day (Juneteenth), all BBVA USA branches remained closed and talks were organized among employees to raise awareness about the fight against racial discrimination.\n\n- In Mexico , support for gender equality and women's empowerment materialized in 2020 through initiatives such as participating in the #UnD\u00edaSinNosotras (#ADayWithoutUs) march on March 9 on the occasion of International Women's Day and the launch of the Domestic Violence Hotline in September 2020 to provide emotional, medical and legal support to its employees, directing them to public and health agencies specializing in this field. For its part, during the months of June and July 2020 initiatives to support the LGBTI Community were developed, in commemoration of LGBTI History Month, through active communication to raise awareness both internally and externally.\n\nSimilarly, with the aim of ensuring equality in recruitment processes and internal mobility, both a manual and training have been created for those involved in the talent acquisition process.\n\nIn  order  to  develop  the  culture  of  diversity,  knowledge  has  been  enhanced  and  standardized  through  training  on unconscious biases and diversity through Campus, whereby there are 9,522 registered collaborators, and 14 webinars have been held by experts on Diversity and Inclusion, with more than 3,105 collaborators connected. The creation of the Diversity Council, made up of the 21 managers representing each business area, has also formalized Management's commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n- In Turkey , two online training modules on unconscious bias have been launched and are mandatory for all employees, and job offers containing inclusive language have been implemented.\n\nWith the goal of empowering women leaders and increasing their recognition in internal networks, the \"Women Leadership Mentorship\" program has completed its third year, with more than 80 women executives receiving mentoring from executive committee members.\n\nThis year, the maternity policy has been changed and paternity leave has been increased to two weeks. The Bank has also commenced a program to promote gender equality in the home and committed paternity.\n\nThe Bank has had a dedicated domestic violence policy and hotline since 2016. In 2020, a program to raise awareness of the effects of domestic violence on children was launched, and more than 2,000 employees engaged with this program.\n\nAs a result of all these initiatives and gender equality practices undertaken for employees, customers and society in general, Garanti BBVA is one of the two Turkish companies included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.\n\n- In Colombia , work has been done across several lines of action to create an internal diversity and inclusion policy that has resulted in a commitment to diversity from members of the Management Committee and from line managers. This has also allowed the creation of 9 ERGs, which have focused their actions on the spheres of female talent, LGBTI, ethnic groups and people with different abilities. In the field of female talent, the gender focus has been enhanced in the internal mobility process so as to allow Talent & Culture area to promote the training of women in order to develop the necessary competencies to promote the development of their career in the organization.\n\nEach of the ERGs is led by a member of the Management Committee, which allows them to propose specific initiatives to ensure that diversity and inclusion are achieved.",

Enjoy Life' global plan was launched in 2019, which was established to reflect a culture based on high performance, productivity, team empowerment and balance between professional and personal life, i.e. work-life balance.\n\nThroughout 2020, BBVA has continued to work on these principles, adapting to the \"new normal\" resulting from the lockdown imposed as a result of COVID-19 and the fact that the vast majority of BBVA staff had to work from home for a prolonged period of time.\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with policies on work-life balance and to keep colleagues properly informed and engaged during this unprecedented situation, the \"BBVA at Home\" website was launched.\n\nThis website, which has been created in both Spanish and English, has been one of the main channels of communication with  and  between  BBVA  employees.  The  site  has  been  visited  by  137,200  people  since  its  launch,  including  BBVA employees and external parties, generating a total of 434,498 visits.\n\nSome of the most notable content on the site included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Emotional well-being : a section on the site that offers more than 20 self-help videos starring psychologists Silvia \u00c1lava and Marta Romo, experts in emotional management.\n- \uf0b7 #Yomeformoencasa : BBVA's training initiative (meaning #ITrainAtHome) for its employees, with dozens of courses, webinars and personalized content for each country.\n- \uf0b7 Virtual events (more than 10 virtual events): a talk about \"Fake News\" with Mario Tasc\u00f3n; Dr. Jordi Vila clears up doubts regarding COVID-19; a talk about childhood sleep with Dr. Gonzalo Pin and four talks from BBVA Open Talks University with experts in education and entrepreneurship.\n- \uf0b7 #ShareYourTalent : an initiative where BBVA employees shared videos showcasing their most surprising talents.\n- \uf0b7 One team stories : inspirational stories in which BBVA employees shared how they have overcome lockdown and all the good things that have come out of this difficult period.\n- \uf0b7 Travel without leaving home: content developed jointly with countries so that others can explore their regions.\n- \uf0b7 Art & Culture : a page dedicated to discovering the best works in the BBVA collection, with full weekly updates.\n- \uf0b7 Families : a section proposing more than 120 activities for the whole family.\n\nBBVA in Spain has also signed an agreement with leading trade union representatives in September 2019 on working time registration and the right to digital disconnection, being the first financial institution to sign a collective agreement under these terms. The agreement was reached within the framework of the legal obligation established for companies in Royal Decree-Law 8/2019, of March 8, on urgent measures for social protection and the fight against precariousness in the workplace, and with the aim of moving toward an organizational culture of work based on efficiency and results, as opposed to attendance and staying at work beyond established working hours.\n\nIn order to fulfill this agreement, an ad-hoc tool was created, \"Register your working day,\" an application where every employee in Spain registers their working hours on a daily basis, by entering the time they start and finish work. In order to increase the knowledge of what it means to register the working day and how to use the tool, all employees have an online training course on this subject. For BBVA, the creation of this tool represents a means of promoting, strengthening and taking a further step toward cultural change and changes to work practices.\n\nWith regard to the right to digital disconnection , the agreement with trade union representation also recognizes this right to workers as a fundamental element in achieving better organization of working time in order to respect private and family life, to improve the balance between personal, family and working life and to contribute to the optimization of workers' occupational health . This right takes the form of specific measures, such as:\n\n- \uf0b7 Avoid communications between 7 pm and 8 am the next day, nor during weekends and holidays.\n- \uf0b7 From Monday to Thursday, avoiding meetings that end after 7 pm, or after 3 pm on Fridays and the day before a public holiday.",

Dialog and negotiation are part of how to address any dispute or conflict within the Group, for which there are specific procedures for consultation with trade union representatives across different countries, including the issues concerning labor health and safety.\n\n- In Spain , the banking sector collective agreement is applied to the entire workforce (except for members of senior management  and  top-level  positions),  complemented  by  the  company  collective  agreements  which  build  upon  and improve the provisions of sector agreement, and which are entered into on behalf of workers. Employee representatives are elected every four years by personal, free, direct and secret ballot, and are informed of the relevant changes that may occur in the organization of work in the Entity, under the terms provided in accordance with the legislation in force.\n- In Mexico , freedom of association and local representation are respected. In accordance with the reform of the Federal Labor Law, in force as of May 2019, the Bank has a process to comply, in accordance with the parameters indicated by the legislation  itself,  with  the  requirements  on  collective  matters  that  were  incorporated  for  trade  union  organizations consisting of free, secret and direct voting. By the end of the year, 33% of the workforce was covered by a collective agreement.\n- In Argentina , freedom of association and commitment to labor rights are respected, and dialog and collective negotiation are much valued when it comes to reaching consensus and conflict resolution. All staff are covered by agreement, maintaining a seamless communication with the internal trade commissions at the local level and with sections of the banking association at the national level.\n\nIn other South American countries, the Group's employees are covered by some form of collective agreement, and 100% of the workforce is covered by an agreement in Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay.\n\nOn the other hand, the regulations in force in the United States and Turkey do not require the same application of agreements to their workforces.\n\n## Health and labor safety\n\nBBVA considers the promotion of health and safety as one of its basic principles and fundamental goals, which is addressed through the continuous improvement of working conditions.\n\nIn this regard, the work risk prevention model at BBVA Spain is legally regulated and employees have the right to consult on and participate in these areas, which they exercise and develop through trade union representation on the different existing committees, where consultations are presented and matters relating to health and safety in the workplace are dealt with, monitoring any and all activity related to prevention.\n\nThe Bank has a preventive policy applicable to 100% of its staff, which is carried out primarily by the Occupational Risk Prevention Service. This service has two lines of action: a) the technical-preventive line, which involves, among other activities, the carrying out of evaluations of occupational risks, which are periodically updated, the preparation of action plans to eliminate/minimize the risks detected, the monitoring of the implementation of action plans,  and implementation of  emergency  and  evacuation  plans,  training  in  health  and  safety,  and  coordination  of  preventive  activities;  and  b) occupational medicine , which involves carrying out staff medical examinations , providing protection for particularly sensitive employees and equipping workplaces with appropriate ergonomic equipment, as well as carrying out preventive activities and campaigns to maintain and improve workers' health and contributing to the development of a culture of prevention and the promotion of healthy habits.\n\nNevertheless, this year, the actions undertaken to face the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 must be emphasized, including the role of the Prevention Service.\n\nSince the beginning, measures concerning the work organization and commuting were established, as well as guidelines and protocols for the employees of BBVA, following the instructions of the corresponding authorities, such as, for example, in Spain, the Ministry of Health, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nLikewise, work centers were adapted:\n\n- \uf0b7 Signage  about  hygienic  procedures,  methacrylate  screens,  facial  screens,  disinfection  kits  for  branches' employees, and Individual Protection Equipments and face masks for employees at certain work centers such as the CPD (by its acronym in Spanish, Centro de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos -Data Protection Center-).\n- \uf0b7 Supply of masks and hand-sanitizing gels, as well as gloves in customer service branches.",

In all cases, the health status of the affected employees has been monitored, both those who were in their homes, as well as those hospitalized, with the families of these employees being monitored.\n\n| OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH (BBVA SPAIN.

Garanti BBVA is the first and only bank which has won this award in its sector in Turkey. In 2020, many studies were carried out on Emergency Management titles such as  earthquakes  and  pandemics.  Lots  of  best  practices  such  as  training,  patient  tracking  systems,  communication campaigns and risk management applications were implemented. During the year, 887 technical-preventive actions were carried out, 316 preventive actions for improving working conditions, and an absenteeism rate of 1.5% was recorded. 100% of employees continued to be represented on relevant platforms through employee representatives and health and safety committees.\n\nIn the United States , during 2020, 1 technical-preventive procedure was carried out and an absenteeism rate of 1.95% was recorded.\n\nIn order to protect the health and safety of employees in the context of COVID-19, various initiatives have been carried out: it has evolved towards a remote work model, providing them with equipment and technical capabilities, and processes have been established for the identification of employees considered as population at risk and for the self-assessment of COVID-19 symptoms and close contacts, in addition to tracking systems. Customer service hours were also modified, implementing a service model by previous appointment. In corporate buildings, security measures were increased, limiting entry points and allowing access exclusively to essential employees, also establishing the mandatory nature of a mask and social distancing measures, and business trips were restricted following the warnings of the Center for Disease Control of the United States (CDC). On the other hand, to respond to the needs of the pandemic, the conditions under which a leave or absence could be requested were extended and the terms of monetary compensation to the employee during said time of absence were defined. Likewise, essential medical programs have been offered at no additional cost to employees and medical services have been extended, covering 100% of COVID-19 treatment, in addition to the corresponding tests. In response to the voluntary legal provisions established due to the pandemic, the contribution plans and medical benefit programs  have  been  modified,  allowing  employees  to  use  their  retirement  savings  to  compensate  for  the  financial difficulties derived from COVID-19. At all times, the Bank has opted for active communication with employees to keep them informed.",

Policies  for  the  prevention  of psychosocial risks and the promotion of a favorable organizational environment at the national level were also developed and implemented. Questionnaires were applied to identify psychosocial risk factors to employees, in addition to working on the inclusion of regulatory compliance with the Health Safety Guidelines for all employees, including service providers. In the year, 1 technical-preventive procedure was carried out and an absenteeism rate of 1.52% was registered.\n- In South America , there is no uniform occupational health and safety management model for the entire region.\n\nThe most relevant local initiatives carried out in Argentina focused on the creation of the COVID-19 site, launching of dissemination campaigns, publications by internal communications, remote talks, an online course on COVID-19, as well as the planning of psychological sessions by virtual means.\n\nIn Venezuela, among the initiatives taken to respond to COVID-19, suspicious and positive cases were monitored, plans and protocols were developed, safe conduct, principles of prevention of unsafe and unhealthy conditions in the workplace, newsletters weekly, home care in case of COVID-19, talks on the correct use of the mask and teleconsultation for the network of offices.\n\nBy country, no technical-preventive actions were taken in Argentina, Peru, Uruguay whereas 1,992 were carried out in Colombia, 28 in Venezuela, and 19 in Paraguay throughout the year.

This policy is applied in all countries in which the Group is present.\n\nCorporate volunteer work activities empower the development of employees, channeling their spirit of solidarity, allowing them to make a contribution of their time and knowledge in order to help the people who need it most. This results in an improvement  of  self-esteem,  increasing  the  sense  of  pride  in  belonging  to  the  company,  and,  consequently,  in  the attraction and retention of talent. Volunteer work generates a positive impact in society, and as recognized by the 2030 Agenda, they are an efficient tool to achieve the SDG.\n\nCOVID-19 has accentuated the vulnerability situations and the inequality among people, making the volunteers' work more important than ever. In order to grant both the Bank's volunteers and beneficiaries' security, on-site activities have been reduced, and have been substituted, when possible, by remote volunteering activities.\n\nOverall, about 9,734 BBVA employees participated in more than 16,000 volunteer work initiatives promoted by the different subsidiaries of the Group in 2020, having dedicated more than 73,991 hours (28% during working hours and 72% outside working hours). The impact of these actions has directly benefited 24,454 people.\n\n- In Spain , more than 1,673 employees participated in about 45 volunteer work activities organized by the Bank, focusing on the following lines of action: financial education, training in new technologies, training for employment, the environment and sustainability, and community investment.\n\nIn the United States , more than 1,900 employees have participated in volunteer activities mainly within the Blue Elf program in order to promote financial education among families and people pertaining to the low-income segment, which was developed online this year, and Volunteer Chapter Orientation. It is the country which has suffered the most significant decrease in the number of volunteers, due to the major impact that COVID-19 has had on the on-site activities.\n\n- In Mexico , 83 employees took part in activities that were carried out to improve outside areas and refurbish public school's classrooms. Likewise, more than 5,000 employees participated as mentors accompanying scholars from the BBVA Foundation program in Mexico. The total number of volunteers amounted to 5,135, maintaining the level of participation with respect to 2019.\n- In Turkey , Garanti BBVA employees have continued working in the voluntary clover club, whose mission is to improve social and environmental awareness and responsibility, chiefly through projects related to education, children, animals and the environment, of different social organizations in the country. 855 employees participated in these initiatives.\n\nIn  certain South American countries, although COVID-19 has significantly impacted on the development of on-site volunteering, employees have carried out actions mainly related to social assistance.",

        "page_content": "The differences observed in the average remunerations of certain professional categories arise from factors such as the length of service and they are not representative of the wage gap. This is due to the fact that only four professional categories are being used, and in each of them very diverse positions with very different remunerations are included. Therefore, the average remuneration of each category is affected by issues such as the different distribution between men and women in the most valued positions, or the higher proportion of women in countries where the average remuneration is lower.\n\nIn addition, the large differences among the different reported groups with respect to the previous year are due to the exchange rate evolution in the main geographies where the Group operates throughout 2020. Likewise, during 2020, and as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the wage reviews have been limited in all the geographical areas, except in countries with very high inflation rates (Argentina and Venezuela) and, to a lesser extent, in Turkey.\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board is set out in Note 54 of the accompanying Group's Consolidated Financial Statements, on an individual basis and by remuneration category. As of 2020, for senior management members, the average total remuneration was \u20ac1,807 thousand for men and \u20ac1,535 thousand for women.\n\n## Wage gap\n\nGroup's Remuneration Policy promotes equal opportunities for men and women, and does not set or encourage wage differentiation. The remuneration model is designed to promote responsibility and career development, while ensuring internal fairness and external competitiveness.\n\nThe equal pay ratio is calculated as the difference in the average total remuneration between women and men of the same professional category, expressed as a percentage of the average remuneration of men, as reflected in the table above (Remuneration by professional category, gender and countries with significant operations) on average remuneration by professional categories and gender. This ratio does not take into account the concept of a position of equal value in the Group.\n\nBBVA's remuneration policy defines certain positions, on which compensation pivots. Each of these positions has a single theoretical price determined based on different factors, such as the level of responsibility, complexity of the function, impact on results, etc. In the same way, each position has a defined unique value linked to the achievement of the objectives.\n\nThe concept of a position of equal value is reflected in the calculation of the wage gap that compares the total remuneration received by men and women who occupy positions of equal value in the Group.\n\nFor each of the aforementioned positions, the median of the total remuneration received by all the men and women who occupy said positions is calculated. The wage gap for the position is calculated as the percentage resulting from dividing the difference between the median salaries of men minus the median salaries of women by the median salaries of men. The Group's salary gap is calculated as the weighted average of the gaps obtained in each of the positions.\n\nThe total remuneration considered includes the fixed remuneration and the target bonus linked to objectives. Items such as  allowances,  social  benefits,  etc.  are  not  included,  the  amount  of  which  is  very  unrepresentative  within  the  total remuneration of employees, and whose award criteria and amounts are clearly defined, not discriminating between men and women.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the wage gap by homogeneous professional categories is the following 4 :\n\n|                  | WAGE GAP (PERCENTAGE)   | WAGE GAP (PERCENTAGE)   |\n|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                  | 2020                    | 2019                    |\n| BBVA,S.A (Spain) | 4.3                     | 4.3                     |\n| Mexico           | (0.3)                   | (0.1)                   |\n| Turkey  (1)      | (0.7)                   | (0.4)                   |\n| BBVA GROUP       | 1.1                     | 1.3                     |\n\nIn order to balance professional opportunities between men and women, BBVA is continuing to launch various initiatives to  continue  making  progress  toward  gender  equality  such  as:  make  women's  talent  visible,  eliminate  biases  in  key processes and match the playing field (see more detail in the 'Diversity and Inclusion' section). These initiatives are contributing to the increase of women occupying positions of greater responsibility.",

For 2019, this ratio does not apply due to a change in the position occupied by the best paid person. In the case of Mexico, the drop in total annual compensation for the highest paid person was 7.8 times greater due to the same reason (5.9 times in 2019). With respect to Turkey, in 2020 there has been a decrease of 3.6% in the total annual compensation of the highest paid person, and an 8.6% increase in total median annual compensation for the workforce.\n\n## Ratio of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage\n\nThe wage ratio of the standard initial category is established by level and the nature of the function to be performed, and does not distinguish by gender.

To achieve this, the cornerstones of the BBVA compliance system are the Code of Conduct, which is available on the BBVA corporate website (www.bbva.com), the internal control model and the Compliance function.\n\nThe Code of Conduct establishes the behavioral guidelines that, according to the principles of the BBVA Group, ensure that conduct adheres to the internal values of the Organization. To this end, it establishes the duty of respect for applicable laws and regulations for all its members in an integral and transparent manner, with the prudence and professionalism that correspond to the social impact of the financial activity and to the trust that shareholders and customers have placed in BBVA.\n\nBBVA's internal  control  model ,  built  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  and  recommendations  of  regulators  and supervisors and the best international practices, structured on three lines of defense, is intended to identify, prevent and correct the situations of risk inherent to the performances of its activity in the areas and locations in which BBVA operates. For more information on the three-line-of defense model, see Note 1.7 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the BBVA Code of Conduct, Compliance is a global unit integrated within the second line  of  defense that  is  entrusted  by  the  Board  of  Directors  with  the  function  of  promoting  and  supervising,  with independence  and  objectivity,  measures  to  ensure  that  BBVA  acts  with  integrity,  particularly  in  areas  such  as  the prevention of money laundering, conduct with customers, conduct in the securities market, the prevention of corruption and other aspects of corporate conduct.\n\nThe Compliance function has a Statute, approved by the Board of Directors and subject to a prior analysis by the Risks and Compliance Committee, which details the main elements established by BBVA for managing the aforementioned issues as well as the basic elements that comprise the Compliance System and Function. The Compliance Statute has evolved in 2020 to a better alignment with regulatory and supervisory developments and expectations related to the function.\n\n## Mission and scope of action\n\nThe tasks of the Compliance function include:\n\n- \uf0b7 promoting a culture of integrity and compliance within BBVA, as well as the knowledge by its members of the external and internal rules and regulations applicable to the above matters, through the development of internal regulation, advisory, dissemination, training and awareness programs, fostering the proactive management of compliance and conduct risk; and\n- \uf0b7 defining and promoting the implementation and total ascription of the Organization to the risk management frameworks and measures related to these issues.\n\nIn order to perform its functions adequately, Compliance maintains a configuration and systems of internal organization in accordance with the principles of internal governance established under the European guidelines for this matter and in its configuration, and development of the activity is attached to the principles established by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as well as the reference regulations applicable to Compliance and Conduct Issues.\n\nIn order to reinforce these aspects and, specifically, the independence of the control areas, BBVA has the Regulation & Internal Control area, which reports to the Board of Directors through the Risks and Compliance Committee and in which the Compliance unit is integrated. Its activity is periodically supervised by the Risks and Compliance Committee.\n\n## Organization, internal government and management model\n\nThe Compliance function is handled globally at BBVA, and is composed of a corporate unit, with a transversal scope for the entire Group that is directed by a global manager and by local units which, sharing the mission entrusted to them, perform their duties in the countries where BBVA carries out its activities that are directed by local managers of the function.\n\nThe function carried out by the various Compliance officers relies on a set of departments specialized in different activities, which, in turn, have their own designated officers. Thus, among others, the function is addressed by individuals responsible for each discipline related to Compliance and Conduct Issues, for the definition and articulation of the strategy and the management model of the function, or for execution and continuous improvement of the area's internal operational processes.",

This makes it necessary to have internal mechanisms that establish transversal management programs for this risk in a homogeneous and integral manner.\n\nFor this purpose, Compliance has a global model for estimating and managing said risk, which, with an integral and preventive approach, has evolved over time to reinforce the elements and pillars on which it is based and to anticipate the developments and initiatives that may arise in this area.\n\nThis model starts from periodic cycles of identification and assessment of compliance risk, upon which its management strategy is based. This results in the review and updating of the multi-year strategy and its corresponding annual action lines, both of which are aimed at strengthening the applicable mitigation and control measures, as well as improving the model itself. These lines are incorporated into the annual Compliance plan, the content of which is reported to the Risks and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe basic pillars of the model the following elements:\n\n- \uf0b7 A  suitable  organizational  structure  with  a  clear  assignment  of  roles  and  responsibilities  throughout  the Organization.\n- \uf0b7 A set of policies and procedures that clearly define positions and requirements to be applied.\n- \uf0b7 Mitigation processes and controls applied to enforce these policies and procedures.\n- \uf0b7 A technology infrastructure focused on monitoring and geared toward ensuring the previous objective.\n- \uf0b7 Communication and training systems and programs implemented to raise employee awareness of the applicable requirements.\n- \uf0b7 Indicators that allow for the supervision of global model implementation.\n- \uf0b7 Independent periodic review of effective model implementation.\n\nThroughout 2020, work continued on strengthening the documentation and management of this model by reviewing and updating the global typologies of Compliance and Conduct risks both at a general level and across the various different geographical areas. The framework for conduct and compliance indicators also continues to be strengthened in order to improve the early detection of this type of risk.\n\nThe effectiveness of the model and compliance risk management is continuously subject to various different and extensive annual verification processes, including the testing activity carried out by the Compliance units, BBVA's internal audit activities, the reviews carried out by prestigious auditing firms and the regular or specific inspection processes conducted by the supervisory bodies in each of the geographies.\n\nOn the other hand, in recent years, one of the most relevant axes of application of the compliance model focuses on digital transformation of BBVA. For this reason, in 2020, the Compliance unit continued to maintain governance, supervision and advisory mechanisms for the activities of the areas that promote and develop business initiatives and digital projects in the Group.",

The BBVA Group's commitment to improving the various social environments in which it operates is also a constant in the objectives it peruses.\n\nIn addition, the Group is exposed to the risk of breaching the AML regulation and the restrictions imposed by national or international  organizations  to  operate  with  certain  jurisdictions  and  individuals  or  legal  entities,  which  could  entail sanctions and significant economic fines imposed by the competent authorities of the various geographical locations in which the Group operates.\n\nAs a result of the above, as a global financial group with branches and subsidiaries operating in numerous countries, BBVA applies the compliance model described above for AML risk management in all the entities that make up the Group. This model  takes  into  account  the  regulations  of  the  jurisdictions  in  which  BBVA  is  present,  the  best  practices  of  the international financial industry regarding this matter, and recommendations issued by international bodies, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nThis management model is constantly evolving. Thus, the risk analysis that are carried out annually allow BBVA to tighten controls and to establish, where appropriate, additional mitigating measures to enhance it. In 2020, the regulated entities of the Group carried out this AML risk assessment exercise under the supervision of the corporate AML area.\n\nThe BBVA Code of Conduct, in sections 4.1 and 4.2, establishes the basic guidelines for action in this area. In line with these guidelines, BBVA has established a series of corporate procedures that are applied in each geographical area, including the Corporate Procedure of Action for the Establishment of Business Relations with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), the Corporate Procedure of Action for the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorist Activities in the Provision of Cross-Border Correspondent Services, or the Standard that establishes the Operational Restrictions with Countries, Jurisdictions and Entities designated by National or International Organizations. All applicable standards are available for consultation by employees in each geography.\n\nDuring 2020, BBVA continued with the deployment of the new monitoring tool which allows advanced functionalities in Mexico, the United States, Portugal, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Malta and Cyprus, having already deployed the tool in Spain and Turkey. Likewise, the Group continued with its strategy to apply new technologies to its AML processes (machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.), in order to reinforce both the capabilities of the Group's various comprising entities to detect suspicious activity, as well as the efficiency of said processes.\n\nIn 2020, the BBVA Group handled 167,127 investigation files that resulted in 82,361 reports of suspicious transactions sent to the corresponding authorities in each country, mainly in jurisdictions such as Mexico, the United States and Turkey.\n\nIn terms of training related to AML, each of the BBVA Group entities offers an annual training plan for employees. This plan, defined according to the needs identified, establishes training actions such as face-to-face or e-learning courses, videos, brochures, etc. for both new hires and employees. Likewise, the content of each training action is adapted to the target group, including general concepts derived from the regulation of applicable AML standards, both internal and external, as well as specific issues that affect the functions performed by the target group of the training. In 2020, 97,573 attendees participated in AML training activities; this figure includes 18,838 employees belonging to the most sensitive groups from the perspective of AML.\n\nThe AML risk management model is subject to a continuous independent review . This review is complemented by internal and external audits carried out by local supervisory bodies, both in Spain as well as in other jurisdictions. In accordance with Spanish regulations, an external expert performs an annual review of the Group's parent company. In 2020, this external expert concluded that BBVA does indeed have an AML model to monitor the risk of being used as a vehicle for money laundering or terrorist financing and that said model meets the regulatory requirements in this regard. In turn, the internal control body, which BBVA maintains at the holding level, meets periodically and oversees the implementation and effectiveness of the AML risk management model within BBVA Group. This supervision scheme is also replicated at the local level, through the committees corresponding to each geography.\n\nIt  is  important  to  mention  BBVA's collaboration work  with  the  different  government  agencies  and  international organizations in this field: Attendance at the meetings of the Executive Committee Financial Crime Strategy Group of the AML & Financial Crime Committee and the Financial Sanctions Expert Group of the European Banking Federation, member of the task forces on KYC/RBA (Know Your Customer/Risk-based Approach) and Information Sharing of the European Banking  Federation,  member  of  the  AML  Working  Group  of  the  IIF,  participation  in  initiatives  and  forums  aimed  at increasing and improving the exchange of information for AML purposes, such as the Europol Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership (EFIPPP), as well as contributions to public consultations issued by national and international bodies (European Commission, GAFI-FATF, European Supervisory Authorities, among others) and the IIF Machine Learning Governance Survey.",

Thus, BBVA aspires to be the trusted partner of its customers in management and control of their finances on a day-to-day basis, based on personalized advice. The objective is to improve the financial health of its customers, as a factor of differentiation of the Group's strategy.\n\nTo achieve this objective, BBVA has product governance policies and procedures that establish the principles to be observed when evaluating the characteristics and risks of products and services, as well as when defining their distribution conditions and their monitoring, so that based on the knowledge of the customer, their interests are taken into account at all  times  and  they  are  offered  products  and  services  in  accordance  with  their  financial  needs  and  compliance  with applicable regulations on customer protection is ensured. BBVA has also implemented processes geared toward the prevention, or, when this has not been possible, the management of potential conflicts of interest that may arise in the marketing of its products.\n\nIn 2020, the new regulatory requirements on customer protection resulting from the health crisis caused by COVID-19, and aimed, in particular, at protecting customers in a vulnerable situation as a result of the crisis, have become one of the main focuses of the Compliance units. During the course of the pandemic, the Compliance Function monitored these regulatory developments and their proper implementation. In this regard, it identified 104 new regulations, corresponding to 12 countries and at a supranational level to the EU, which incorporated new requirements related, for example, to loan extensions or moratoriums, the granting of loans with public guarantees, facilities associated with banking transactions and payment channels, exemption from fees, or redemption of pension funds and funds or other savings products.\n\nAt the same time, progress continued throughout 2020 on a global customer compliance model, which aims to improve the homogeneity of the framework of conduct standards which must be respected in customer relationships, applicable in all of the Group's jurisdictions and in line with the principles of the Code of Conduct. The deployment of the model contributes to a better customer experience at BBVA, and continues to be in line with increasingly standardized regulations on customer protection at a global level and best practice standards in commercial relations with customers. Throughout the  year,  BBVA  focused  on  reviewing  the  frameworks  for  mitigating  and  controlling  risks  relating  to  conduct  with customers, singularly addressing the issues of transparency in information for customers, as well as strengthening indicators related to such risks, paying special attention to customer complaints and preventing and identifying poor sales practices.\n\nOther measures geared toward customer protection during 2020 included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Continuous analysis of the characteristics, risks and costs of BBVA's new products, services and activities from a customer perspective through a number of different Operational Risk Admission and Product Governance Committees that operate in the Group. Over the course of the year, these committees analyzed more than 500 new Group products, services or activities.\n- \uf0b7 Continuous collaboration with wholesale and retail product and business development units, focusing on digital banking initiatives, with the aim of including the customers' point of view and investor protection in its projects from the outset.\n- \uf0b7 Enhancement of the training processes required by the MiFID II regulations and the Law regulating real estate loan contracts in Spain. These certification requirements for providing financial services to customers are also present in the regulations applicable in other geographies and, in this regard, the number of certified sales forces in the Group, following the requirements of local regulations in each country, amounts to 25,766 employees in investment products and services and 23,829 employees in all other products as of December 31, 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Training on identifying, managing and logging situations of potential conflict of interest during the provision of services to customers. In this respect, a total of 22,800 Group employees completed this training during 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Promoting communication activities for commercial networks, both through direct communications on products or services, as well as through specific training actions.\n- \uf0b7 Follow-up of new customer protection requirements arising from the new regulation with regard to ESG factors.\n- \uf0b7 Adaptation of the Advertising Communication Policy to the Bank of Spain Circular on advertising.\n\n## Conduct on securities markets\n\nThe BBVA Code of Conduct includes the basic principles for action aimed at preserving the integrity of the markets, setting the standards to be followed aimed at preventing market abuse, and guaranteeing transparency and free competition in the professional activity carried out on the market by the BBVA collective.\n\nThese basic principles are specifically developed in the Policy on Conduct in the Field of Securities Markets (\"the Policy\"), which applies to all the individuals who form a part of the BBVA Group. Specifically, this policy establishes the minimum standards that are to be respected with the activity carried out in the securities markets in terms of privileged information, market manipulation and conflicts of interest. The Policy is supplemented in each jurisdiction by a rule or Internal Code of",

        "page_content": "Conduct (ICC) aimed at the target group with the greatest exposure in the markets. The ICC develops the contents established in the Policy, adjusting them, where appropriate, to local legal requirements.\n\nBoth BBVA's Policy and ICC are widespread throughout the Group. In order to manage this regulation, BBVA has the GESRIC tool, which is in continuous development and has been implemented throughout the entire Group for over a decade. The degree of adhesion to the new ICC approached 100% of the individuals in question.\n\nWith  respect  to  the market abuse prevention ,  the  reinforcement  of  the  programme  continued,  implementing  and extending the tools for detecting operations suspected of market abuse continued, in order to improve the analysis capabilities. As part of this reinforcement, in several of the Group's jurisdictions, the communications control framework of the market areas was reinforced through the implementation of new communications analysis tools which provide support in the analysis of suspicious transactions.\n\nThese measures enable the further improvement of the process of detecting suspicious transactions, leading to the communication of possible market abuse practices to the relevant authorities in each country.\n\nThe training program on market abuse was also reinforced in 2020 through the launch of a global course on insider information and market manipulation, which will complement the various training activities held by the Group on market conduct.\n\nLikewise, training for employees operating in derivatives with customers affected by the US Dodd-Frank Act under the license of Swap Dealer). This training will be mandatory from January 31, 2021, and will be provided by the competent supervisory authority ('National Futures Association').\n\nIn relation to the Unites States regulation known as the \"Volcker Rule,\" BBVA has adapted its compliance program to the new simplified version of the rule (\"Volcker 2.0\"), which continues to maintain the highest international standards. In 2020, annual training on the Volcker Rule was undertaken by a group of 2,067 employees in the Group, which represents almost all of the group affected by the regulation.\n\nLikewise, the Policy for Discretionary Treasury Stock Trading has also been updated with the aim of adapting it to the new control model of the Group and reinforcing the transparency of this activity. Following this update, the guidelines followed by BBVA for its discretionary treasury stock trading have been published on the Bank's investor and shareholder website. A communication containing relevant information concerning this operation is also published quarterly to strengthen the market transparency of this activity.\n\n## Personal data protection\n\nThe BBVA Group has a set of Personal Data Protection Principles that establish the guidelines for compliance in the matter of personal data. They are applicable to all geographies in which BBVA operates, particularly in the areas of compliance control, training, incident management and personal data processing (transparency, data quality, etc.). These guidelines mean that BBVA has, in accordance with its own local legislation, data privacy policies or notices in each geography explaining how the Group's entities collect, process and protect the personal data of their customers, suppliers and employees, as well as of any other persons who provide their personal data to the relevant Group company.\n\nBBVA, S.A. makes the policy it follows regarding personal data protection available to its customers through its website, at www.bbvapoliticadeprotecciondedatospersonales.com. This includes information on:\n\n- \uf0b7 Who is responsible for processing personal data;\n- \uf0b7 The legitimate basis (or bases) that allows BBVA to process the personal data collected;\n- \uf0b7 The purposes for which said personal data is to be used;\n- \uf0b7 The data retention period;\n- \uf0b7 Whether the data will be transferred;\n- \uf0b7 The mechanisms in place so that the user can escalate data privacy issues, such as how to contact the Data Protection Officer;\n- \uf0b7 How to exercise rights of access, rectification, deletion, opposition, limitation of processing, transferability and the right not to be the subject of automated individual decisions.\n\nThe BBVA Code of Conduct establishes that data protection breaches may lead to the application of disciplinary sanctions in accordance with labor legislation.\n\nThe Data Protection Office (hereinafter DPO) has continued to strengthen its monitoring and control processes throughout 2020. This is mainly achieved through reinforcing protocols and testing processes and activities that have an impact on personal data protection, as well as following up on and resolving the recommendations arising from internal audits conducted to assess all activity in this field.",

        "page_content": "At the same time, the current exceptional situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great challenge in terms of personal data protection. The adaptation of the protocols implemented within the BBVA Group to combat infections and safeguard the health of employees and customers has required a greater focus on the accelerated and urgent adaptation of data protection requirements to this new reality.\n\nFurthermore, in order to improve the integration of the scope and duties of the DPO in the Group's Control Model, in the last quarter of 2020, BBVA made the decision to incorporate these duties into the Compliance unit while maintaining all the competencies of the DPO, in accordance with data protection legislation.\n\n## Other conduct standards\n\nOne of the main mechanisms for managing the Compliance and Conduct risk in the Group is the Whistleblowing Channel, where the members of BBVA as well as other third parties not belonging to BBVA can communicate confidentially and, if they wish, by anonymous signature those behaviors that are separated from the Code or that violate the applicable legislation, including complaints related to human rights. The Compliance Function aims to ensure that complaints are handled  diligently  and  promptly,  guaranteeing  the  confidentiality  of  the  investigation  processes  and  the  absence  of retaliation or any other adverse consequence of good faith communications. The Code of Conduct, is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nBBVA has 14 whistleblower channels accessible to employees in all its main countries, which can be accessed through email and most of them also by telephone. BBVA has a corporate whistleblowing channel to which all employees in the jurisdictions where the Group is present have direct access. In 2020, 1,417 complaints were received in the Group, whose main aspects reported relate to the categories of conduct with colleagues (49.8%), and conduct with the company (34.1%). Approximately 42% of reports processed during the year ended with disciplinary action being taken.\n\nAmong the work carried out in 2020 by the Compliance area, ongoing advice on the application of the Code of Conduct is particularly noteworthy. Specifically, the Group formally received 547 individual consultations, written and telephone queries, such as the resolution of possible conflicts of interest, the management of personal assets, or the development of other professional activities. Over the year 2020, BBVA continued with the work of communication and dissemination of the Code of Conduct, as well as the training on its contents, which has been carried out by a total of 115,334 employees.\n\nAnother  key  element  in  the  management  of  Conduct  risk  in  BBVA  is  the  Group's General Anti-Corruption Policy (approved  by  the  BBVA  S.A.  Board  of  Directors  in  September  2018),  which  develops  the  principles  and  guidelines contained, primarily, in Section 4.3 of the 2015 Code of Conduct and conforms to the spirit of national and international standards on the subject, taking into consideration the recommendations of international organizations for the prevention of corruption and those established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). In May 2020 this Policy was reviewed and its update approved by the BBVA S.A. Board of Directors and communicated again to all employees and member of the Group's main governing bodies. The general guidelines of the BBVA's General Anti-Corruption Policy are available to both business partners and other third parties on BBVA's shareholders and investors website.\n\nAdditionally, BBVA has an internal regulatory body that complements the General Anti-Corruption Policy in the matter that regulates.\n\nAmong the most prominent policies are the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 General Policy on Conflicts of Interest,\n- \uf0b7 General Policy on Anti-Corruption,\n- \uf0b7 Policy on the Prevention and Management of conflicts of interest at BBVA (customer area),\n- \uf0b7 General Procurement Principles,\n- \uf0b7 Policy on Events and the Acceptance of gifts related to major sporting events,\n- \uf0b7 Corporate Travel Policy, and\n- \uf0b7 Corporate Event Management Policy.\n\nLikewise, regarding to other internal developments , the following stand out:\n\n- \uf0b7 Management model for corporate and travel expenses for personnel,\n- \uf0b7 Management model for Expenses and Investment,\n- \uf0b7 Code of Ethics for the Recruitment of Personnel,\n- \uf0b7 Code of Ethics for Suppliers,\n- \uf0b7 Rules relating to the Acquisition of Goods and Services,\n- \uf0b7 Rules relating to Gifts for employees from persons/entities outside the Bank,\n- \uf0b7 Rules for delivery of gifts and organization of promotional events,\n- \uf0b7 Rules for authorizing the hiring of consultancy services,\n- \uf0b7 Rules on dealing with individuals of public importance in matters of finance and guarantees,\n- \uf0b7 Rules for delegating credit risk,\n- \uf0b7 Corporate rules for managing donations and contributions to non-profit organizations,\n- \uf0b7 Corporate rules for managing commercial sponsorships,",

In this sense, it is noteworthy the launch of a corporate online course in most of the jurisdictions in which BBVA is present. At the closing of 2020 financial year, this course had been taken by a total of 77,184 employees.\n\nWhat's more, the framework for preventing conflicts of interest was reinforced in July 2020 complementing the existing internal regulation through the issuance of a new general policy, applicable to the entire Group, which reinforces the principles and main measures that all BBVA members, must assume and follow in order to identify, prevent and manage conflicts of interest. The policy has been established in the context of the principles under which the BBVA Group operates, which include integrity, prudent risk management, transparency, the achievement of long-term sustainable business and compliance with applicable legislation. It also addresses several different aspects, such as specific measures that help prevent the emergence of conflicts, general guidelines for action should they emerge, or governance and monitoring mechanisms at various different levels of the organization.\n\nRegarding  antitrust,  BBVA's  competition  policy  was  approved  in  July  2019,  which,  if  extended  to  the  entire  Group, represents a step forward in the development of conduct standards in this regard. The policy elaborates on Principle 3.14 of the BBVA Code of Conduct on free competition and covers the most sensitive risk areas identified by national and international bodies, horizontal agreements with competitors, vertical agreements with non-competing companies, as well as possible abusive practices. Various training activities were conducted in this regard during 2020.\n\n## Crime prevention model\n\nSince the introduction in Spain of the criminal liability regime of legal persons, BBVA has been developing a criminal risk management model, based on the general internal control model, with the aim of specifying measures directly aimed at preventing the commission of crimes through a government structure suitable for this purpose. The criminal prevention model is structured around three elements: a prevention system, a governance structure and a periodic review of its application.\n\nThe prevention system is aimed at (i) identifying the activities carried out in BBVA that represent a risk of incurring criminal liability of the legal entity, (ii) identifying the elements of control, prevention and mitigation of said risks and (iii) developing a specific risk management program for each type of crime likely to attract responsibility for BBVA. In this sense, for each of the identified criminal risks a specialized control area ('assurance providers') is designated which, as part of the criminal risk management program and for each of the identified criminal types, draws up a map of risks and a series of mitigation measures and action plans.\n\nThe purpose of the governance structure is the supervision and control of the model, the identification of the responsible units and the periodic information to the BBVA governing bodies of the results of the monitoring of the system and of the incidents or possible relevant non-compliances.\n\nThis model, periodically subject to independent review processes, is configured as a dynamic process in continuous evolution, so that the experience in its application, the modifications in the activity and in the structure of the Entity and, in particular in its model of control, as well as the legal, economic, social and technological developments that occur, are taken into account in a way that contributes to their adaptation and improvement.\n\nIn this context, from 2017 onward, BBVA has been awarded the AENOR certificate, which accredits that its criminal compliance management system complies with the UNE 19601:2017 standard.",

This commitment applies to all of the relationships that BBVA establishes with its customers, suppliers, employees and with the communities in which it conducts its business and activities.\n\nSince 2007, BBVA has had a commitment to human rights, which was updated in 2020, that seeks to ensure respect for the dignity of all people and their inherent rights.\n\nThe commitment is part of the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Policy and is aligned with BBVA's Code of Conduct. This commitment takes the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a reference. Its purpose is to guide the Group in its strategic vision and its operative, as well as in the relationship with its stakeholders.\n\nBBVA's commitment to human rights is also reflected in other milestones, such as the publication in 2005 of the first defense sector standard or the publication of sector standards in the energy, mining, agriculture and infrastructure sectors in 2018, and its subsequent update in 2019, which has been substituted by the Environmental and Social Framework in 2020.\n\nBBVA was also the first Spanish entity to adhere to the Equator Principles in 2004 and the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2008, and has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002, all of which are international alliances in favor of human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder this perspective, BBVA decided to identify the social and labor risks that derive from its activity in the various different areas and countries in which it operates in order to manage their potential impacts through processes designed specifically for this purpose (for example, due diligence processes in project finance under the Equator Principles) or through existing processes that encompass the human rights perspective (such as the supplier evaluation process).\n\nAt the same time, the methodology for evaluating the risk to BBVA's reputation discussed in the \"Reputational Risk\" section within the chapter 'Risk management', is an essential companion to this management, since assessing reputational risk highlights that issues related to human rights have the potential to affect the Bank's reputation.\n\nIn order to comply with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and under the responsibility to prevent, mitigate and repair potential human rights impacts , a due diligence process was carried out in 2017. The procedure used to identify and assess these risks or impacts was based on the framework of the above Principles and helped to enhance risk detection and assessment from a human rights perspective. This due diligence process is scheduled to take place again in 2021.\n\nAs a result of the process, the potential impacts of the operations on human rights were identified and mechanisms were designed within the Entity to prevent and mitigate said impacts, making the adequate channels and procedures available to the affected party in order to ensure that, in case of any violation, the appropriate mechanisms remain in place to ensure all necessary repairs. During this process, certain key issues were identified that could potentially serve as levers to improve the management system within the Group. These issues are grouped into four areas that serve as the basis and foundation of the Group's 2018-2020 Human Rights Action Plan , which is public and is updated every year.",

For this update, the Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights guidelines, backed on June 16, 2011 by the United Nations Human Rights Council, and the results of the global due diligence process itself, were taken as a reference.\n\nThis commitment is articulated around the stakeholders with which BBVA is related: employees, customers, suppliers and society; and it includes the three pillars on which the aforementioned Guiding Principles are based, which are:\n\n- \uf0b7 States' duty to protect,\n- \uf0b7 The responsibility of companies to respect human rights,\n- \uf0b7 And the joint duty to implement mechanisms that ensure the repair of possible human rights abuses.\n\nAll the individuals employed in the Group are responsible for making this commitment a reality on a day-to-day basis. Each area and employee has the duty to be familiar with all matters that pertain to them that may imply a violation of human rights, and to implement the due diligence measures to avoid this. However, BBVA has a structured governance model following the internal control model, composed of three lines of defense:\n\n- \uf0b7 The first line of defense consists of the Group's units directly responsible for managing these risks.\n- \uf0b7 The second line of defense is composed by the specialist unit of each risk, with the support of the Responsible business department, which is, as well, responsible for designing and coordinating the implementation of this commitment and its development.\n- \uf0b7 The third line of defense is the Internal Audit area.\n\n## Training and cultural transformation\n\nWith regard to the due diligence process, it is advisable to integrate the human rights perspective into:\n\n- \uf0b7 The internal and external communication plan,\n- \uf0b7 The plan on diversity and work-life balance, and\n- \uf0b7 A general and specialized training plan for employees.\n\nRespect for the equality of people and their diversity is reflected in the corporate culture and management style, it is a guiding  principle  for  interactions  with employees ,  especially  in  the  recruitment,  development  and  remuneration processes, which ensure non-discrimination on the basis of gender, race or religion, and, as such, is included in the BBVA Code of Conduct.\n\nThus, this Code, among other matters, covers how to handle discrimination, harassment or intimidation in labor relations, objectivity in recruitment, hiring and promotion that avoids discrimination or conflicts of interest, among other issues, as well as health and safety in the workplace, whereby employees must communicate any situation they become aware of that poses a risk to their health or safety at work.\n\nFurthermore, BBVA's commitment to human rights assumes the commitment to apply, for example, the content of the fundamental conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) , such as those relating to the elimination of all forms of forced labor; the effective abolition of child labor (minimum age and worst forms of child labor); and the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation, among other commitments.\n\nIn 2020, this section was enhanced through the launch of a global training site on sustainability that includes specific content on human rights training.\n\n## Process improvement\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned process, the importance of enhancing the supplier evaluation process, as well as the functioning and scope of the repair mechanisms, became evident.\n\nFrom a supplier perspective, BBVA has a Code of Ethics for Suppliers that, in 2018, enhanced compliance with the commitment to human rights by integrating the human rights prism into the supplier evaluation process.\n\nIn  2020,  the  General  Procurement  Principles  (which  replace  the  previous  Responsible  Procurement  Policy)  were published, demonstrating the commitment to responsible business by raising awareness of sustainability and social responsibility among personnel, suppliers and other stakeholders involved in the BBVA Group's procurement process, as a key element in ensuring compliance with applicable legal requirements in the areas of human, labor and environmental rights.",

An example of an external channel is the national contact points of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (hereinafter OECD), the objective of which is to admit and resolve claims related to losses of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nWith  regard  to  employees,  suppliers  and  society  in  general,  the  BBVA  Code  of  Conduct  expressly  mentions  the commitment to human rights and provides a whistleblower channel to report possible breaches of the code itself.\n\n## Business and strategy alignment\n\nThe analysis performed recommended the inclusion of human rights criteria in the Group's strategic projects, such as the due diligence process in the acquisition of companies or the social and environmental framework.\n\nFurthermore, as signatories to the Equator Principles , BBVA complies with the requirement to conduct a due diligence analysis of potential human rights impacts in project finance operations. When identifying potential risks, the operation must include an effective form of management of these risks, as well as operational mechanisms to support claims management.\n\nAlso within the framework of the Equator Principles, BBVA actively promotes the inclusion of Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), not only in emerging countries, but also in projects in countries where a robust legislative system is presupposed, which guarantees the protection of the environment and the social rights of its inhabitants.\n\nBBVA is also a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact Principles , maintaining ongoing dialog and exchange of experiences with other signatory entities (companies, SMEs, third sector entities, educational institutions and professional associations).  Along  the  same  lines,  BBVA  encourages  dialog  with  NGOs  concerning  its  fiscal  responsibility,  and participates in various meetings with investors and stakeholders in which it follows up on issues related to human rights.\n\nBBVA participates in various different work groups related to human rights and is in constant dialog with its stakeholders. At a sectoral level, BBVA has formed part of the Thun Group since 2012. The Thun Group is a group of global banks that works to understand how to better apply the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in the practices and policies of financial institutions, and across various banking businesses.\n\nThe Principles of Responsible Banking were signed in 2019 following their launch in 2018, to which BBVA has adhered as one of the promoters and founders of the initiative. Under the auspice of the United Nations, these Principles are put forth with the aim of providing a sustainable financing framework and supporting the sector in a manner that shows its contribution to society. In this regard, the implementation guidelines expressly mention the suitability of integrating the Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights into the implementation of the six principles, which are: i) Alignment, ii) Impact  and  goal  setting,  iii)  Customers,  iv)  Stakeholders,  v)  Governance  and  culture,  and  vi)  Transparency  and accountability. Lastly, in addition to these initiatives, and taking into account the importance of the Spanish mortgage market, BBVA generated a social housing policy in 2012.\n\n## Spanish Social Housing Policy\n\nIn line with the above, and taking into account the importance of the Spanish mortgage market, BBVA has a Social Housing Policy that goes beyond what is legally established and emphasizes the commitment to human rights and the SDGs, mainly in terms of SDG 1 \"No Poverty\" and SDG 10 \"Reduced Inequalities.\"\n\nAt present, more than 750.000 families live in BBVA-financed housing in Spain.\n\nBBVA's Social Housing Policy aims to offer solutions tailored to customers who have mortgages and are struggling to meet their repayments. BBVA pursues every re-financing option available in accordance with the customers' ability to pay, in order to allow them to keep their homes and agreeing to make payment in kind in case their financial situation prevents them from paying.\n\nIn addition, any situation can be referred for review by the Committee for the Protection of Mortgage Debtors, which analyzes cases in which the customers or their families face the risk of exclusion without legal protection, while providing individual solutions in accordance with each family's specific circumstances.\n\nIn February 2012, BBVA decided to voluntarily adhere to the Code of Best Practices approved by the Spanish government, the objective of which is to seek the viable restructuring of the mortgage debt of holders of loan or credit contracts secured by  a  real  estate  mortgage  on  their  main  residence  who  are  experiencing  extraordinary  difficulties  in  meeting  their repayments, because they are at the \"exclusion threshold.\" In 2019, on the occasion of the entry into force of Law 5/2019, which regulates real estate loan contracts, BBVA ratified its adherence to the Code of Best Practices under the terms of this new law, which broadens the potential beneficiaries of these measures.",

Since the financial crisis began in 2008 and through to December 2020, of those contributed to the Social Housing Fund, the BBVA Group made almost 7,000 homes available in Spain for social renting, the social rentals granted to customers in what had been their home and homes ceded to the Government of Catalonia and C\u00e1ritas Barcelona.\n\nCurrently, BBVA has signed collaboration agreements with public entities for more than 1,000 social housing properties.\n\nBBVA has also established internal mechanisms that allow it to implement a real social housing policy that pays special attention to particularly vulnerable families who are BBVA mortgage customers and are at risk of social exclusion:\n\n- \uf0b7 Re-financing agreements in force: More than 85,000refinancing agreements in force as of December 31, 2020, which have helped families since the crisis first began.\n- \uf0b7 Payments in kind: More than 29,600 payments in kind have been carried out since the crisis began through to December 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Mortgage Debtor Protection Committee: More than 2,200 situations analyzed to respond to mortgage debtors or their families.\n\nSince the socio-economic crisis caused by COVID-19 began, BBVA has been aware of the importance of supporting citizens in facing its consequences. On March 17, 2020, Royal Decree Law 8/2020 was published with urgent and extraordinary measures to address the socio-economic impact of COVID-19. This outlines the conditions for requesting a payment deferral on home mortgage loan payments. Customers with a mortgage at BBVA who met the conditions of vulnerability due to COVID-19 were able to take advantage of this payment deferral. BBVA, together with other financial institutions, has also voluntarily established a payment deferral of up to twelve months.\n\nWith regard to social housing tenants, the financial institutions that are members of the Social Housing Fund, including BBVA, took the initiative on March 23 to grant a deferment of up to three months in social rentals to those tenants who were in a vulnerable situation due to COVID-19, in anticipation of the regulations on support for tenants approved by the government in Royal Decree Law 11/2020 published on April 1.\n\nBoth the legal measures indicated and all their subsequent modifications affecting mortgage debtors or social housing tenants were adapted and implemented as quickly as possible, with the aim of helping to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable groups.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability at BBVA\n\n## BBVA, a bank committed to sustainability\n\nBBVA is a bank guided by one purpose: \"Bringing the age of opportunity to everyone.\" A purpose that seeks to have a positive impact on the lives of individuals, businesses and society as a whole. BBVA's firm and long-term commitment to sustainability is perhaps one of the clearest ways of achieving this purpose, and as it has already been mentioned, 'helping our clients transition towards a sustainable future is one of the six Bank's strategic priorities, which is implemented through two ways: climate action and inclusive growth.\n\nThis commitment to sustainability has a long background. BBVA joined the UN Global Compact in 2002 and to the Equator Principles in 2004.\n\nIts drive for sustainable finance began in 2007, when it took part in the first issue of a green bond placed by the European Investment Bank (hereinafter, EIB), and when in 2008 its employee pension plan manager was the first to adhere to the Principles  for  Responsible  Investing  in  the  market.  Since  then, the Bank has been promoting sustainable solutions, ensuring their direct impact and integrating environmental and social risk into the management process.\n\nIn 2018, BBVA unveiled its 2025 Pledge to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and overcome the challenges arising from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. This commitment is based on three lines of action:\n\n- 1. To finance . Originating new funding to combat climate change and support the SDGs by channeling \u20ac100,000m into green activities, sustainable infrastructure, agribusiness, entrepreneurship and financial inclusion between 2018 and 2025.\n- 2. To manage . Minimizing the environmental and social risks associated with the Bank's activity and their potential direct and indirect negative impacts, as well as progressively aligning its business with the Paris Agreement. The Bank has set itself the target of ensuring that 100% of the energy supplied to the BBVA Group is renewable by 2030.\n- 3. To Engage . Engaging all stakeholders to collectively promote the financial sector's contribution to sustainable development.\n\nIn 2019, the Bank carried out a process of strategic reflection to continue deepening its transformation and adapt to the major trends that are changing the world and the financial industry. As a result, faced with two of the main trends identified, such  as  the  fight  against climate  change  and  the  growing  relevance  of  social  inclusion ,  BBVA  incorporated sustainability as one of its six strategic priorities: helping our clients in the transition towards a sustainable future.\n\nDuring 2020, it has continued to advance in the development of this priority, integrating sustainability transversally in management and  internal  processes  and  also  in  the  relationship  with  clients  and  other  stakeholders,  highlighting milestones such as the approval of the General Sustainability Policy, the creation of the Global Sustainability Office (hereinafter the GSO) or the publication of the Group's first TCFD report.\n\n## Governance model\n\n## BBVA's corporate governance\n\nBBVA's corporate governance bodies have devised and promoted a strategy which includes sustainability and climate change as one of its priorities, approving its basic elements and regularly monitoring its implementation across the Group. This task is carried out by the Board of Directors, BBVA's highest representation, administration, management and surveillance body, with the assistance of its specialized committees.\n\nThe Executive Committee and the Risk and Compliance Committee specifically play the most active role in assisting the Board on sustainability and climate change issues, as detailed below.\n\nBBVA's Board of Directors has long considered the progress and main impacts of sustainable development and the fight against climate change as important matters, and these have become even more important issues to monitor in recent years.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility policy in 2020, subsequently amending it to adapt to any new developments over the years. This policy reflects the Group's commitment to draw up and implement a climate change and sustainable development strategy for the achievement of the SDGs, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, among other considerations.",

        "page_content": "To this end, the Board fostered the Group's commitment to sustainability with the '2025 Pledge' described in this chapter. Its progress and development have been regularly monitored by the Board of Directors, at least on an annual basis, and by its Executive Committee, at least on a biannual basis.\n\nIn 2019, BBVA's Board of Directors led the strategic reflection process carried out within the Group, which identified the need to make sustainability one of the pillars of its strategy for the coming years.\n\nThis strategic reflection performed in 2019 had a special implication of the corporate governance bodies, in particular the Board and the Executive Committee who directly participated in the drafting and approval of the Group's new strategic plan (discussed in several meetings throughout the year). A process to monitor the plan's implementation and execution was defined with measures including holding specific meetings focused on strategy or the establishment of KPIs to implement the strategic plan.\n\nAn essential element of this strategic approach determined by the Board is the integration of sustainability and the fight against climate change into the Group's business and functions and which will be managed by establishing objectives to facilitate their implementation, oversight and monitoring of progress.\n\nIn addition, in 2020, the Board, with the prior analysis of the Executive Committee, approved the Group's Sustainability Policy, which defines and sets out the general principles and the main management and control objectives and guidelines to be followed by the Group on sustainable development.\n\nLikewise, the GSO, responsible unit for promoting and coordinating sustainability initiatives within the Group, given that it is the responsibility of all Group areas to incorporate sustainability on a cross-cutting basis, was created in 2020, and is relying on the support of the most senior executive managers of the various Bank's areas at a global and local level.\n\nThe Board of Directors will oversee the policy's implementation directly or through the Executive Committee, on the basis of periodic or ad-hoc reports received by the GSO, the Head of Corporate & Investment Banking (who is responsible for this policy at the senior management level), the Bank's areas that will incorporate sustainability into their day-to-day businesses and operations and, where appropriate, the Heads of BBVA's control functions.\n\nAt least once a year, or in the event of any event requiring changes to this Policy, the Global Sustainability Office will revise and submit to the Bank's corporate governance bodies any updates and modifications deemed necessary or appropriate at any time.\n\nThe above approach allows the corporate governance bodies to define the basic lines of action for the Group as regards the management of opportunities and risks arising from sustainability in their businesses. It also allows the execution to be overseen by the executive areas in all spheres of the entity's operations.\n\nIn addition to the above and in order to achieve the best performance of its duties in this matter, the Board considered it necessary  to  strengthen  its  own  knowledge  and  experience  in  sustainability,  by  onboarding  people  with  extensive knowledge and experience and by a continuous training program to include sustainability-related subjects (such as sustainable finance or main trends that are being developed in the market on this matter).\n\n## Transversal integration of sustainability into the executive sphere\n\nBBVA incorporates sustainability as part of its daily activities and everything it does, encompassing not only relations with customers but also internal processes.\n\nIn this sense, the definition and execution of the strategy, which includes sustainability and climate change as one of its priorities, has a transversal nature, being the responsibility of all areas of the Group to incorporate it progressively into their strategic agenda and their work dynamics.\n\nTaken into account the two main focal points of action in relation to sustainability, the Group has set itself some specific targets (hereinafter the \" Group's sustainability targets \"), which at the time of this report are as follows:\n\n- 1. To  promote  the  development  of  sustainable  solutions :  Identifying  opportunities,  developing  sustainable products and offering advice to individual customers and companies.\n- 2. To integrate sustainability risk into its processes : Making climate change risks, whether physical or transitory, part of the Group's management processes.\n- 3. To  build  a  single  agenda  with  stakeholders :  Fostering  transparency  in  commitments  and  performance, reducing the direct impact and promoting active involvement with all stakeholders to drive sustainability within the financial sector.\n- 4. To develop new competencies in the sphere of sustainability : Leveraging the Group's capabilities in the field of data and technology to drive the development of the strategy, which includes sustainability and climate change as one of its priorities, across the Organization, and promoting as well the training on this subject among all employees.",

In this context, the GSO has held regular meetings with these managers to review the various different lines of work, with the aim of accelerating their implementation and ensuring proper alignment between the Group's various different units.\n\nFinally, a network of experts has been established, comprising sustainability specialists from different areas of the Group (Client Solutions, Corporate & Investment Banking, Global Risk Management, Communication & Responsible Business) and coordinated by the GSO. These experts are responsible for building knowledge in the field of sustainability at the Group. This knowledge is then used to provide customer guidance, support areas in developing new value propositions in the sphere of sustainability, make climate risks part of risk management, and draw up a public agenda and set of sustainability standards.\n\n## Implementing the strategy\n\nAs described in the chapter 'Strategy and business model', helping the clients transition toward a sustainable future is one of the strategic priorities of BBVA.\n\nTo achieve this, BBVA has prioritized those SDGs in which the Group can generate a greater positive impact by harnessing the multiplier effect of banking, implementing this strategy through the two lines of action: climate action and inclusive growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the sustainable bond market, BBVA issued in May 2020 the first COVID-19 social bond by a European financial institution for the amount of \u20ac1,000m and issued the first AT1 green bond in the sector, also for the amount of \u20ac1,000m, in June 2020. For its part, the Bank published the first follow-up report on its green bonds issued in 2018 and 2019. The renewable energy, efficient building, sustainable transport and water and waste management projects, which helped reduce its carbon footprint by nearly 724,006 tons of CO2  and generate 2,300 GW/hour of renewable electricity, and have contributed to manage sustainably more than 290,000 tons of waste and treat nearly 7 million m 3 of residual water.\n\nThroughout 2020, BBVA has spearheaded 43 green, social and sustainable bond issuances for customers in the United States, Latin America and Europe, with a volume of more than \u20ac21,760m and a disintermediated volume of \u20ac4,180m. This activity has solidified BBVA's position as the most active Spanish institution in the disintermediation of this type of asset for the fifth consecutive year. The participation in the inaugural operations carried out in Europe in the automotive, energy and telecommunications sectors stands out; and in the United States in the energy sector. During 2020, BBVA has actively worked in the advice and placement of social COVID-19 bonds (whose funds are aimed at mitigating the negative effects of the pandemic). Thus, BBVA has led to the disintermediation of the ICO social bond and the \u20ac52m health social bond of the Community of Madrid. On the other hand, and also in Spain, BBVA has supported the \u20ac700m inaugural issuance of the green bond of the Community of Madrid, which has been the first green bond issuance of a public administration in Spain.\n\nLastly, BBVA continues to support the development of the green bond market in other regions, such as Mexico or Argentina. In Mexico it has led two sustainable issuances of the Fondo Especial de Financiamientos Agropecuarios (FEFA, Special Fund for Agricultural Financing): a green bond that it placed in June and a social gender bond that it placed in October, which is a major milestone as it has been the first bond with a focus on gender equality to be issued in the country. BBVA has also led the inaugural bond of a real estate investment trust issued in Mexico. The resources from this bond will be used for financial inclusion and to provide access to financing for women in the agricultural sector. In Argentina, BBVA has  led  the  first  green  bond  of  an  entity  mainly  dedicated  to  the  distribution  of  materials  for  construction  and  the exploration and production of oil and gas, amounting to USD 50m, which has been aimed at wind energy projects.",

Furthermore, BBVA  has  been  also  a  pioneer  in  closing  the  first sustainable financing with the backing of the ICO. As such, BBVA has consolidated its position as the leading institution as a sustainable coordinator/structuralist in syndicated and bilateral operations for the fourth consecutive year. Outside Spain, BBVA has spearheaded several landmark operations, including the first sustainable financing in Colombia, and one of the main syndicated loans in Germany and two in Italy. Avenues were also opened in Argentina through closing the first social operation in the country. BBVA continues to work with its customers to develop new and demanding formats to link its long-term commitment to sustainability and to the objectives set by the European taxonomy and the Paris Agreement respectively.\n\nFurthermore, BBVA remained active in the financing of sustainable projects throughout 2020, participating in 20 operations which has involved BBVA mobilizing more than \u20ac1,184m of sustainable financing in three main areas:\n\n- \uf0b7 Financing of renewable projects , in which BBVA has consolidated its position as one of the world's leading banks, having closed a total operations, including the financing to one of the first offshore wind farms in the world, and that shows the support of BBVA to new sustainable technologies, and the funding of the biggest wind energy project contracted under a Power Purchase Agreement (hereinafter PPA) in Spain.\n- \uf0b7 Social projects : BBVA has continued its activity in the health sector. It has also been particularly active in financing telecommunications projects, given the key role they play from a societal perspective as facilitators in accessing  new  technologies,  digitalization and  their  contribution  to  economic  development.  BBVA  has participated as a leading bank in the financing of 8 operations in this sector, focused on the field of health and the deployment of optical fiber networks.\n- \uf0b7 Sustainable infrastructure projects , where BBVA is a pioneer both in operations related to sustainable transport and in buildings that reduce the environmental impact.\n\nAdditionally, BBVA has mobilized \u20ac4,895m of corporate financing to customers that take part in green classified sectors , in accordance with the Green Bond Principles (renewable energies, waste management, sustainable transport and energetic efficiency), or in social sectors, in accordance with the Social Bond Principles (health, education, social assistance and social housing).\n\nLikewise, BBVA took part in 27 operations, which means a \u20ac762m mobilization in fixed-purpose loans certified by an accredited independent third party, where the purpose of the funding has positive environmental and social impacts.\n\nLikewise, under its sustainable transactional banking framework, BBVA has signed 41 operations amounting \u20ac961m. Furthermore, new products (such as confirming lines and deposits) have been launched under this framework, which includes a new approach to certifying products as linked to sustainability. The market for financial products linked to sustainability is relatively new and it is growing rapidly, thereby allowing companies and sectors searching for ways to start or expand their sustainable trajectory to gain access to sustainable financing. Products linked to sustainability are intended to facilitate and support economic activity and growth in both environmental and social spheres. This new approach allows BBVA to actively support its customers in the transformation toward more sustainable business models.\n\n## Sustainable solutions for retail customers\n\nBBVA wants to support its retail customers in adopting more sustainable habits that help them to reduce their emissions. It  wants  to  do  so  proactively,  by  investing  in  data-based  tools  and  solutions  that  help  customers  to  control  their consumption and emissions. To this end, it is working on making a wide range of products available to customers, both for investment and financing, to help them in this transition, adapting to the situation in each of the regions in which it operates.\n\n- In Spain , following the expansion of the catalog of sustainable solutions available in 2019, financing lines for businesses are already being offered for purchasing hybrid and electric vehicles, installing renewable energies and improving energy efficiency in buildings.\n\nAs such, a specific funding line was launched for SMEs for the renewal of their vehicle fleet with electric or hybrid plug-in models. Furthermore, with regard to housing, a line of loans to property developers was launched, specifically aimed at developments with high energy certifications, which includes the innovative possibility that retail customers who purchase these homes will be able to benefit from an interest rate subsidy on their mortgage.\n\nAt the individual level, the aim is also to promote low emission mobility through granting loans for electric cars and providing insurance relating to this type of vehicle.\n\nLikewise, a green offering has been launched for mortgages for homes with energy rating A. On the investment side, BBVA has a range of sustainable funds, such as the conservative multi-asset fund BBVA Futuro Sostenible ISR (BBVA SRI Sustainable Future), BBVA Bonos sostenibles ISR (BBVA sustainable SRI Bonds) and the international equity fund BBVA Bolsa Desarrollo Sostenible (BBVA Sustainable Development Fund). The Bank launched its first individual pension plan managed with SRI criteria, the BBVA Plan Sostenible Moderado ISR (BBVA ISR Moderate Sustainable Plan) in 2019.",

It currently offers \"Mi vivienda verde\" (\"My green home\"), a state-subsidized mortgage loan granted for purchasing a home certified as a green project that includes sustainability criteria in its design and construction. A line of sustainable financing for electric and hybrid cars was launched in 2020.\n- In Mexico , advances in equipment leasing linked to sustainability are notable, whereby an agreement was also signed with the IFC to promote this product in 2019. It also offers individuals products for financing low-emission cars and insurance for such vehicles.\n\nIn 2020, BBVA Mexico has joined the C Solar program, an initiative coordinated by the Secretariat of Energy, with the aim of fostering the energy transition of SMEs in the country through NAFIN-secured financing to generate photovoltaic solar energy. Agreements have also been reached with the main distributors of solar panels to finance the installation of this type of energy in private homes, and BBVA is participating in the Cofinavit mortgage program with the aim of granting mortgages to homes that include energy efficiency improvements.\n\nIn the United States , financing lines for purchasing hybrid and electric vehicles are being offered to individuals and work is underway to launch a green offering for homes with sustainable certifications before the end of the year.\n\nAlong the same lines a line of financing has been launched aimed at SMEs, the purpose of which is to improve energy efficiency in buildings or the acquisition of properties with good energy ratings. In the last quarter of 2020, a line of financing aimed at this segment for purchasing electric and hybrid vehicles has been launched.\n\n- In Argentina , in addition to offering consumer loans aimed at improving energy efficiency in homes, BBVA focused on promoting electric mobility by offering different products for financing cars, bicycles and electric scooters.\n\nLastly, Colombia has provided a boost to sustainability by launching both a line of financing for electric and hybrid cars and a certified sustainable home mortgage with differentiated rates and conditions in the last quarter of 2020. Insurance for this type of car and home is also included in its product portfolio.\n\nAs far as the circular economy is concerned, BBVA is committed to ensure that all of its cards are made from recycled material. The first of these has been launched in Spain, using 76% recycled plastic for the young-customer segment, while work is underway to extend this to the rest of the cards in Spain and rest of geographical areas.\n\n## ESG Advisory\n\nFurthermore, to complete the sustainable portfolio, the ESG Advisory service was created in 2020 to assist global customers in their transition toward a sustainable future. This involves data-driven assessments and guidance to assist customers in undertaking commitments, each from a different starting point, to align with the Paris Agreement and make progress in terms of the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Agenda. BBVA offers value-added information on regulation, best practices and the challenges and opportunities faced in their sectors on their journey toward sustainability. It also provides an overview of the whole range of sustainable products and services that can be offered from CIB, both in terms of debt and equity. Efforts are being focused on specific sectors such as oil & gas, utilities, automotive and infrastructure along with cross-cutting issues such as energy efficiency.\n\n## Socially responsible investment\n\nIn the area of socially responsible investment (SRI), BBVA assumed its commitment to SRI in 2008 when it joined the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) through the employee pension plan and one of the Group's main asset managers, Gesti\u00f3n de Previsi\u00f3n y Pensiones (Social Security and Pensions Management) in Spain. The goal then was to start building BBVA's own responsible investment model from the ground up, with the initial implementation focused on employment pension funds, to then be extended to the rest of the Group's managers.\n\n- In 2020, BBVA Asset Management (BBVA AM), the Group's investment management unit that brings together all its asset management activities around the world, developed its sustainable investment plan , which marks a significant leap in the goal of integrating sustainability, setting itself the target of incorporating sustainability practices into all investment portfolios and products. This plan will be developed over the next few years, and its implementation and deliverables will materialize in BBVA's various asset management businesses over several phases. The pillars of action for incorporating sustainability into the business are as follows:\n- \uf0b7 Integrating ESG criteria into the investment process, carried out through the development of its own model that integrates  extra-financial  criteria  into  management.  To  this  end,  BBVA  AM  will  create  an  internal  ESG measurement rating for all instruments in the portfolio, whether issuances of government debt, corporate debt or equity, and mutual funds; this part will be carried out with the support of Quality Funds, BBVA's department of analysis and selection of third-party funds.",

In relation to the latter point, the Defense Performance Standard applies to all units and subsidiaries of the BBVA Group, and therefore to all vehicles that are managed within the BBVA AM business in all geographical areas. For its application, BBVA uses exclusion lists of companies and countries, drawn up and updated periodically, with the help of an independent expert advisor. These lists include companies and countries related to defense equipment, military, police and security armaments, ammunition, explosives, etc., which are automatically excluded from the list of companies in which BBVA can invest.\n- \uf0b7 Involvement and voting policy: Development of its own voting policy based on BBVA's best practices and beliefs on how to promote the sustainable creation of long-term value for companies. In 2020, BBVA AM exercised its political rights through attending 151 general shareholders' meetings (of Spanish companies and European and US foreign companies whose securities are held in the portfolios of the various investment vehicles managed by BBVA AM). BBVA AM will make use of dialog with the companies in which it invests to encourage them to incorporate  the  most  important  sustainability  issues  into  their  strategic  plans.  Likewise,  it  is  committed  to gradually joining agreements and collaborating with organizations that promote the principles of responsible investment.\n\nIn  2020,  in  the  field  of  Socially  Responsible  Investment,  \u20ac906m  net  of  reimbursement  have  been  raised  through sustainable funds.\n\n|                               | 31-12-20   | 31-12-19   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Total assets under management | 109,355    | 113,651    |\n| Europe                        | 72,376     | 75,645     |\n| Mexico                        | 26,034     | 27,708     |\n| South America                 | 7,433      | 6,341      |\n| Turkey                        | 3,512      | 3,957      |\n| SRI strategy applied          |            |            |\n| Exclusion  (1)                | 109,355    | 113,651    |\n| Vote  (2)                     | 72,376     | 75,645     |\n| Integration  (3)              | 9,053      | 8,844      |\n\n## Financial inclusion and entrepreneurship\n\nBBVA believes that greater financial inclusion has a positive impact on the well-being and sustained economic growth of countries. The fight against financial exclusion is therefore consistent with its ethical and social commitment, as well as with its medium- and long-term business objectives. At the close of 2020, BBVA has mobilized \u20ac2,148m within the financial inclusion and entrepreneurship sector.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  BBVA  Microfinance  Foundation  promotes  the  sustainable  economic  and  social  development  of vulnerable entrepreneurs. It has two lines of action: to build a group of sustainable and innovative microfinance entities and to promote the transformation of the microfinance sector. It also promotes education and developing financial and management skills. In 2020, it provided financial education and technical training to 396,601 people.",

However, technological progress in the fields of energy efficiency, renewable energies, efficient mobility and the circular economy will continue to generate new opportunities for all.\n\nOn the other hand, customers, markets and society as a whole not only expect large companies to create value, but to also make a positive contribution to society. In particular, that the economic development to which they contribute with their activity is inclusive.\n\nBBVA is aware of the key role that banking plays in this transition toward a more sustainable world through its financial activity, has adhered to the Principles for Responsible Banking promoted by the UN, the Katowice Commitment and the Collective Commitment to Climate Action and is keen to play a central role, as demanded by society, and to help its customers in their transition toward this sustainable future.\n\nAs a financial institution, BBVA has an impact on the environment and society directly through the consumption of natural resources and its relationship with stakeholders; and indirectly (and most importantly) through its credit activity and the projects it finances.\n\nThere are two type of risks that impact the business:\n\n- \uf0b7 Transition risk : which are those risks pertaining to the transition to a low-carbon economy, and which arise from changes in legislation, the market, consumers, etc., to mitigate and address the requirements of climate change.\n- \uf0b7 Physical risk: which arise from climate change and can originate from increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events or long-term weather changes, and which may imply physical damage to companies' assets, disruptions in supply chains or increase in the expenses needed to face such risks.\n\n## Integrating climate change into risk planning\n\nClimate-change related risks (transition and physical risks) are considered an additional factor impacting those risk categories  already  identified  and  defined  in  the  BBVA  Group.  These  are  managed  through  the  risk  management frameworks of the Group (credit, market, liquidity and operational, and other non-financial risks).\n\nAs a result, the integration of climate-change related risks into the risk management framework of the BBVA Group is based on their incorporation into the governance and processes currently in place, taking into account regulation and supervisory trends. 5",

These last two aspects are integrated into the management through processes such as admission frameworks or the establishment of risk limits.\n\nAs part of its General Risk Management and Control Model, the Group develops periodic risk identification and assessment processes to, among other things, identify material risks that could have a negative impact on its risk profile and to manage those risks actively and proactively. These processes cover all types of risks faced by the Group in its daily activity, including those risks that are more difficult to quantify.\n\nThrough the Risk Assessment process, which is updated at least once a year, a global assessment by type of risk and business area is carried out to identify both the strengths and main vulnerabilities of the BBVA Group, with a forwardlooking view. The matrix of events of the assessment carried out in 2020 is included below (see Chart 04). Risk Assessment exercises are used to set the risk appetite. The events are ordered according to their severity, which is estimated on the basis of the likelihood allocated to each event and their estimated impact on the BBVA Group. The 2020 Risk Assessment has deepened the analysis, incorporating a first qualitative assessment of the climate change factor materiality for those risks where it could be relevant.\n\nThe following risk events have been identified throughout the 2020 financial year:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The analysis carried out distinguishes between the impacts that physical and transition risks have at different time horizons (short, medium and long-term) on the main types of risks (financial and nonfinancial). The main risks are focused, first on credit portfolios, especially the wholesale portfolio and, secondly, the retail mortgage and auto portfolios. The most relevant risks, in a first phase, are transition risks, affecting fossil fuels from a triple point of view: regulation, technological change and market factors. Market portfolios are hardly affected given the low volume in relative terms of the trading portfolio, its daily management and the high diversification of the portfolios .In terms of liquidity risk, the high quality of the liquidity buffer leads to an immaterial risk of a decline in the volume of liquid assets resulting from central bank restrictions on the eligibility of certain securities due to environmental reasons; the risk of loss of value of available collateral as a result of potential negative impacts on the market price of securities is also considered immaterial. The risk of physical climate events is considered low in terms of outflows of client resources or instability of wholesale resources (companies).\n\n## Risk assessment climate change 2020\n\n|                       | Tranisition risks   | Tranisition risks   | Tranisition risks   | Physical risks   | Physical risks   | Physical risks   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | ST                  | MT                  | LT                  | ST               | MT               | LT               |\n| Wholesale credit      |                     |                     |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Retail credit         |                     |                     |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Liquidity and funding |                     |                     |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Markets               |                     |                     |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Operational           |                     |                     |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Insurance             |                     |                     |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n\nNote.

In addition, metrics are identified at the client level to assess their vulnerability and to integrate this aspect into risk and client support decisions.\n\nThe estimation of the transition risk-sensitivity level is based on the qualitative analysis of the amount of exposure to regulatory,  technological  and  market  changes  caused  by  decarbonization  that  may  have  a  financial  impact  on  the companies  of  the  industry  and  on  the  estimation  of  the  time  horizon  impact  of  these  effects.  Thus,  industries  are categorized according to their level of sensitivity to transition risk: high, moderate or low sensitivity.\n\nThe industries identified as most sensitive to transition risk are energy or fossil fuel generation sectors (energy, utilities, coal mining), emission-intensive basic industries (steel, cement) and activities that are final users of energy through their products or services (vehicles manufacturers, air and sea transportation).\n\nAs a result of this exercise, with data at 31 December 2020, 17.1% of the exposure measured by EAD of the wholesale portfolio (equivalent to 9.1% of the Group's portfolio) has been identified as corresponding to sectors defined as 'transition risk sensitive', with an intermediate, high or very high level of exposure to this risk. This calculation was made on a portfolio of \u20ac223,620m (of the Group's total EAD of \u20ac422,494m), corresponding to the EAD of the wholesale lending portfolio.\n\nThe percentage of exposure measured by EAD of the sectors sensitive to the transition risk of the wholesale portfolio over the EAD of the wholesale portfolio at December 31, 2020 are as follows:",

It includes the percentage of exposure (exposure at default) of activities internally defined as 'transition risk sensitive' over the EAD of the wholesale portfolio at December 31, 2020 (Paraguay, Uruguay Venezuela and Chile not included). The 'transition risk sensitive' portfolio includes activities that generate energy or fossil fuels (energy, utilities - excluding renewable generation and water and waste treatment -, coal mining), basic industries with emission-intensive processes (steel, cement) and final activities users of the energy through their products or services (vehicles manufacturers, air and sea transportation), with an intermediate, high or very high level of sensitivity to this risk.\n\nIn addition, climate and environmental risk impact has been incorporated into country risk analysis since 2019, as an additional input for establishing risk policies affecting exposures to private or sovereign administrations of all the countries with which the bank has some type of risk (+100 countries) .\n\nTo this end, a Climate Vulnerability Index (hereinafter, the CVI) has been created for more than 190 countries, which captures the physical risk and, to a lesser extent, the transition risk of each country, based on international indicators (e.g., Global Adaptation Index of the University of Notre Dame, ND-GAIN, and the Energy Transition Index, ETI, produced by the World Economic Forum). Subsidiarily, vulnerability indices issued by other international organizations and by the three rating agencies are also taken into account.\n\nThe methodology establishes 5 climate vulnerability levels, which are a comparative classification, as all countries have a certain level of vulnerability given the global nature of this phenomenon. The CVI has been integrated into risk management by including a specific section in country risk reports, so it is a factor that is taken into account when establishing risk limits (particularly in the most vulnerable countries). It is also taken into account in setting country ratings and outlooks.\n\nIn 2020 a methodology has also been launched to determine climate vulnerability at the sub-national level (regions, provinces,  cities).  To  this  end,  indicators  developed  by  internationally  renowned  institutions  such  as  the  Andean Development Corporation (CAF), the EU or BBVA Research. Work has also been done to incorporate transition risk to a greater extent in the CVI.\n\n## Risk appetite Framework (RAF)\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework of the BBVA Group, approved by the corporate governance bodies, determines the risk levels that BBVA is willing to assume to achieve its targets, considering the business' organic evolution. The Framework has a general statement that sets out the general principles of the risk strategy and the target risk profile. The current statement includes the commitment to sustainable development as one of the elements defining BBVA's business model. This statement is complemented and detailed with an appetite quantification through metrics and thresholds that provide clear and concise guidance on the defined maximum risk profile. For the climate change risk, a new category has been included in 2021, called 'High Transition Risk', which measures the EAD in relation to capital of activities internally defined as 'transition risk sensitive' with a 'high' or 'very high' intensity, in accordance with BBVA's taxonomy. With respect to this metric, the Board of Directors has approved thresholds at a Group and business area level, which set the maximum appetite to climate change risk.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis enables  the  assessment  of  the  risk  factors'  impact  on  the  metrics  defined  in  the  Risk  Appetite Framework. In this regard, and within climate change and environmental risk management, alternative scenarios are being defined, based on those laid out by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The objective is to try to capture the uncertainty around the different types of transition (ordered, disordered) towards a low carbon economy and/or the effects derived from the physical risk of potential climate events in certain geographies. BBVA uses the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and the Stated Policies Scenario (SPS) of the International Energy Agency, to analyze how regulatory, technological or demand changes in those sectors particularly sensitive to transition risk, may affect the Bank's portfolio. This analysis allows BBVA to include in the industry frameworks information on the possible behavior of the sector, and to determine which clients may be better prepared in environmental terms to face the coming years.",

        "page_content": "## Integrating climate change into risk decision-making\n\nOnce climate risk is incorporated into the Risk Appetite Framework and the business strategy, it also must be included in the day-to-day risk management, which is a part of the risk decision making that supports the Bank's clients.\n\nFor that purpose, the integration of this risk into existing management frameworks and processes is required, including the adaptation of policies, procedures, tools, risk limits and risk controls in a consistent manner. In a first phase, adaptation is focused on the integration of this risk in the industry frameworks, a basic tool in the definition of our risk appetite in wholesale credit portfolios, and in the Mortgage and Auto Operating Frameworks in retail credit.\n\n## Wholesale banking\n\nThe need to decarbonize the economy, as a consequence of climate change, requires a reallocation of resources between more emission intensive activities and those less affected. This dynamic between sectors can be further accelerated in those industries where transition risk brings the time horizon impact closer, or where regulatory measures or technological developments set the implementation schedule.\n\nIn  wholesale  banking,  the  prevailing  analysis  dimension  is  the  sectorial,  detailing  sub-sectors  or  specific  activities, combined with the geographic consideration, especially in regulated sectors.\n\nThe  combination  of  these  two  factors  results  in  the  i ntegration of climate factors into credit risk management processes through the wholesale credit industry frameworks of those sectors most strongly impacted.\n\nIn  2020,  sustainability  factors  have  been  incorporated  as  one  of  the  dimensions  of  the  analysis  in  the  Operating Frameworks of Vehicles, Energy, Utilities, Steel and Cement. All these sectors are included in the taxonomy as transition risk-sensitive. In these frameworks, the impact of decarbonization on the sectors is analyzed based on long-term scenarios aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. To this end, the sectorial impact of factors such as energy demand, investment or technological transformation (change of the generation mix in Energy / Utilities, or electrification in the case of vehicles) is analyzed. The industry frameworks take into account the transition strategies developed by the Bank's main client in each sector. Based on the analysis, individual risk policies have been reviewed with some of the main groups of these industries.\n\nThe following chart shows an anonymized example of sustainability strategies analysis of the main clients in BBVA's auto manufacturer portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLegend: Lighter green represents a better assessment of each sustainability factor\n\nTogether with the integration into the Industry Frameworks, the systematic integration of sustainability factors into the client analysis processes for credit origination purposes has begun in 2020, thus allowing their incorporation in credit decision making.\n\n## Retail banking\n\nClimate change risk affects retail portfolios through two dimensions. Firstly, for its role as a financing facilitator to address the investments required for climate change mitigation and adaptation, generating business opportunities in the financial sector. Second, through the financial risks that climate change and its mitigation pose to their balance sheet.\n\nIn  retail  banking  the  predominant  focus  of  analysis  is  the  type  of  risk  and  the  affected  portfolio,  together  with  the geographical dimension.\n\n- \uf0b7 Transition risk: mainly affects the auto portfolio due to the CO2 emissions of the vehicles, the mortgage portfolio due  to  the  CO2  emissions  of  real  estate/households  that  are  pledged  as  collateral,  and  the  SME  portfolio depending on the concentration in activities more exposed to CO2 emissions.",

        "page_content": "- \uf0b7 The key to treating, measuring and managing physical risk is the location of the properties . The location of the collateral in areas with the greatest environmental impact related to natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods among many, make up the block known as 'location matters'.\n\n## Transition risk treatment in the retail portfolio\n\nWithin  the  financing  activity,  the  main  target  is  to  i dentify  and  support  customers  who  contribute  to  the decarbonization process. In BBVA's retail portfolio, the most exposed portfolios to transition risk and therefore to CO2 emissions are vehicles and mortgages, which account for more than 59% of the total retail portfolio, which in terms of exposure corresponds to around \u20ac118,529m according to data as of 31 December 2020. The main geographical areas impacted are Spain, the United States and Mexico.\n\nAs in the wholesale area, in the case of retail, risk appetite is developed through the annual development of Operating Frameworks, which explain and integrate the risk criteria under which the retail portfolios must be originated and managed in the BBVA Group. In 2020, climate change and environmental risk has been incorporated into the Operating Frameworks for the vehicles and mortgage portfolios.\n\n- \uf0b7 Vehicles portfolio: Incorporating the 'fuel type' indicator as an analysis dimension allows a monthly monitoring of the origination, in the Group's main vehicles portfolios.\n- \uf0b7 Mortgages portfolio: In this portfolio, a detailed analysis with regard to the energy efficiency of housing financed by BBVA is being carried out, with a focus on Spain in 2020, due to its relevance.\n- The main purpose of the analysis is to verify the existing relationship between the energy efficiency of housing (buildings) financed by BBVA, and the clients' behavior in terms of default (PD/probability of default). Thus, the aim is to identify whether, ceteris paribus, housing with greater energy efficiency has a lower probability of default than housing with less energy efficiency.\n\nIn addition, the analysis includes a study of the relationship between the collateral value and the coverage variation in relation to the energy efficiency of housing, and consequently, how this affects the LGD (loss given default) / Severity of the mortgage loan. In addition, BBVA actively participates in the working group of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institution Group (EEFIG). This group consists of more than 40 institutions at a European level and one of its targets is to deepen risk assessment through the quantitative relationship between the energy efficiency ratings of properties and the associated probability of default and the valuation of the underlying assets. All this with the aim of issuing the relevant recommendations at European level that guarantee homogeneity in the analysis between participating countries and the former institutions.\n\nAt the management level, work is underway to refine the admission model with sustainability factors as a fundamental step to  support  green  products.  A  commercial  plan  has  been  defined  for  the  creation  of  green  products  for  the  main geographies and segments of both individual customers and SMEs, with the defined operational and advertising channels.\n\n## Physical risk treatment in the retail portfolio\n\nRegarding physical risk, the risks derived from the location of properties in the zones of hurricanes, floods or eruptions is one of the risks that must be assessed and incorporated in credit processes, in particular during collateral valuation in transactions with collaterals.\n\nThe Group's portfolio with the greatest exposure to this type of risk is the mortgage portfolio, which accounts for 53% of the total retail portfolio, with a special focus on Spain, Mexico and the United States. Throughout 2021, work will be done to identify the location of the buildings financed by BBVA, using geolocation maps and analytical algorithms in order to create a heat map, identifying the areas most exposed to adverse weather events (e.g. in Spain housing on coasts impacted by flooding or in Mexico the areas exposed to hurricanes). The analysis of the need to adjust the collateral value, and therefore the severity of the mortgage loans, in such areas, will allow us to give an adequate and prudent treatment in terms of credit risk management.\n\n## PACTA Methodology used to evaluate loan portfolios and their alignment with the Paris Agreement\n\nAs part of the climate change strategy, BBVA has committed to aligning its loan portfolio with scenarios compatible with the global warming objectives established in the Paris Agreement . This commitment materialized in the signing, with other European banks, of the Katowice commitment. In conjunction with these banks, and with the support of the think  tank  2  Degree  Investing  Initiative  (2DII),  a  methodology  called  PACTA  (Paris  Agreement  Capital  Transition Assessment) has been adapted to the banking sector.\n\nThe methodology focuses on the most polluting sectors and, within them, on the phase of the production chain whose reduction may have the greatest impact on the global reduction of emissions. The sectors under analysis are oil and gas, coal mining, electricity generation, automobiles, maritime transport, cement and iron and steel.",

Through a process of aggregation of these assets by companies, the methodology is able to link these assets with financial products and establish a relationship between the financial instrument and the degree of alignment in a climate change scenario.\n\n## Indirect environmental and social impacts management\n\nBBVA addresses environmental and social risks from the perspective of impact prevention and mitigation. To do this, it uses tools such as the Environmental and Social Framework or the Equator Principles that have an environmental and social focus, and which are described below. Managing the impacts that customers generate on the environment is part of the 2025 Pledge. To manage them, BBVA has implemented a series of initiatives and tools.\n\n## Environmental and Social Framework\n\nIn 2020, the Environmental and Social Framework for the due diligence in the field of mining, agribusiness, energy, infrastructure  and  defense was  approved,  which  integrates  and  entails  the  review  of  the  previous  Sector  Norms (approved in 2018) and the Rules of Conduct in Defense (in force since 2012).\n\nIn line with the previous regulation, this Framework provides a decision-making guideline with regard to transactions and customers that operate in these five sectors (mining, agribusiness, energy, infrastructure and defense); as they are considered to have a bigger social and environmental impact.\n\nIn order to ensure the effective implementation of this Framework, BBVA receives advice from an independent external expert. This Framework is public and available for consultation in the shareholders and investors web of BBVA. With the aid of this independent external advice, BBVA carries out a reinforced due diligence to its customers and transactions, in order to mitigate the risks associated with these sectors and contribute to the compliance with the General Sustainability and Social Corporate Responsibility Policies.\n\nFor the Framework review, new market trends in this area, the expectations of stakeholders and the strengthening of the implementation procedures have been taken into account.\n\nOne of the more important changes within the 2020 review is the restriction to the applying of exceptions in the field of mining and energy for countries with high energetic dependence only to already existing or under construction projects and customers.\n\nAdditionally, the reduction from 35% to 25% of the threshold applied to the exclusion of customers with high coal exposure, which applies both to the extractive activity and the energy generation.\n\nLikewise, the prohibition concerning tar sands has been extended to any activity using this kind of fuel which does not have a diversification strategy and where this activity represents more than 10% of total production. Finally, new prohibited activities have been added in projects such as deep sea mining, Artic oil and gas transportation (which complements the existing one on Artic oil and gas exploration and production), as well as large dams that are not built under the World Commission on Dams (WDC).\n\n## Equator Principles\n\nEnergy, transport and social service infrastructures, which drive economic development and create jobs, can have an impact on the environment and society. BBVA's commitment is to manage the financing of these projects to reduce and avoid negative impacts and enhance their economic, social and environmental value.\n\nAll decisions to finance projects are based on the criterion of principle-based profitability. This implies meeting stakeholder expectations and the social demand for adaptation to climate change and respect for human rights.\n\nIn line with this commitment, since 2004 BBVA has adhered to the Equator Principles (EP), which include a series of standards for managing environmental and social risk in project financing. The EPs were developed on the basis of the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability and the World Bank's General Guidelines on Environment, Health and Safety. These principles have set the benchmark for responsible finance.\n\nThe analysis of the projects consists of subjecting each operation to an environmental and social due diligence process. The  first  step  is  the  allocation  of  a  category  (A,  B  or  C),  which  reflects  the  project's  level  of  risk.  Reviewing  the documentation provided by the customer and independent advisers is a way to assess compliance with the requirements established in the EPs, according to the project category. Financing agreements include the customer's environmental and social obligations. The application of the EPs at BBVA is integrated into the internal processes for structuring, acceptance and monitoring of operations, and is subject to regular checks by the Internal Audit area.",

Where this is the case, free, prior and informed consent is required from these communities, regardless of the geographic location of the project.\n\nIn 2020 the fourth version of the Principles has come into force. This update, after an extensive public consultation period, incorporates new and more demanding requirements in the review of projects in relation to human rights and climate change. BBVA has actively participated in the updating process and its contribution in recent years has been recognized with a new mandate in the Steering Committee of the Association of the Principles of Ecuador.\n\n## OPERATIONAL DATA ANALYZED ACCORDING TO THE EQUATOR PRINCIPLES CRITERIA\n\n|                                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of transactions                      | 30     | 39     |\n| Total amount (millions of euros)            | 12,061 | 15,287 |\n| Amount financed by BBVA (millions of euros) | 1,304  | 2,437  |\n\nNote: of the 30 transactions analyzed, 9 fail under the Equator Principles, and the remaining 21 were analyzed voluntarily by BBVA using the same criteria in 2020 (39, 16 and 23 respectively, in 2019).\n\n## Management of direct environmental impacts\n\nBBVA has a clear commitment to both society and the environment. In 2020, this commitment has been bolstered through the creation of the GSO and its various workstreams. One of these is the Direct Impact Workstream, which is transversal across all geographies and focuses on reducing the direct environmental impacts of BBVA's activity.\n\n## Global Eco-Efficiency Plan\n\nThe \"Global Eco-efficiency Plan\" is included in the line of work to reduce direct impacts. The first plan was launched during the 2008-2012 period, and the plan for the 2016-2020 period was completed in 2020.\n\nThe Global  Eco-Efficiency  Plan sets  impact  reduction  targets  through  metrics  and  monitoring  indicators.  These objectives are framed within BBVA's climate change strategy, \"2025 Pledge,\" which on the one hand includes a 68% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions, and on the other, to obtain 70% of energy consumption from renewable sources in 2025, reaching 100% in 2030. In line with the latter objective, BBVA has been a member since 2018 of the RE100 initiative, through which the world's most influential companies undertake to make their energy 100% renewable by 2050.\n\nTo ensure continuation, the objectives and targets for the next Global Eco-Efficiency Plan 2021-2025 have already been set. The new Global Eco-Efficiency Plan will address the objective already set out in the 2025 Pledge and will also include other  new  objectives  aimed  at  reducing  and  neutralizing  the  environmental  footprint.  As  in  previous  plans,  regular monitoring will be carried out to ensure proper performance across its entire scope.\n\nIn addition to the objectives of \"2025 Pledge,\" at the UN Conference on Climate Change (Conference of Parties, COP25) held in Madrid in 2019, BBVA announced the incorporation of a domestic price for CO2 emissions from 2020 onward, along with the goal of becoming carbon neutral that same year. BBVA is therefore committed to offsetting all the direct environmental impacts it is unable to reduce.",

This system has been implemented in Argentina, Colombia, Spain, Peru, Uruguay, Mexico and Turkey, meaning that a total of 80 buildings and 1,034 branches have this certification. In Turkey, the headquarters building has the WFF Green Office certification, which certifies this environmental management system and promotes the ecological footprint and carbon emissions reduction.\n\nFurthermore, 3 buildings in Spain also have an Energy Management System that has been certified by an independent third party and complies with the ISO 50.001:2018 standard.\n\nFor its part, 21 buildings and 10 offices of the Group have been awarded the prestigious LEED certification for sustainable construction, including the Bank's main headquarters in Spain, Mexico, the United States, Argentina and Turkey. Of these, three have received the highest certification category, LEED Platinum, thereby recognizing BBVA's effort to have the best environmental and energy standards in its buildings.\n\nThere are also 2 buildings and 12 branches in the United States with Energy Star certification, a program by the United States Environmental Protection Agency created in 1992 to promote efficient electricity consumption, thereby reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nThis year, the EDGE certification has been achieved in the canteen of BBVA's headquarters in Lima, Peru. , an international ecological construction certification created by the World Bank's International Financial Corporation (IFC).\n\n## 2. Energy and climate change\n\nAs part of BBVA's pledge to reduce its environmental footprint, the reduction of its energy consumption, and therefore associated impacts, has been set as a priority. To this end, it is essential that emissions are properly monitored, so that the reduction target set for 2025 can be met.\n\nBBVA's total emissions consist of:\n\n- \uf0b7 Scope  1  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  including  direct  emissions  from  stationary  combustion  plants installed in buildings and branches under the operational control of BBVA;\n- \uf0b7 Scope  2  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  including  indirect  emissions  related  to  electricity  production, purchased and consumed by buildings and branches under BBVA's operational control;\n- \uf0b7 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, including indirect emissions not covered under Scope 2. At BBVA, this scope covers emissions from business travel.",

        "page_content": "Both Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions are calculated according to the GHG Protocol standard established by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).\n\n## Levers for footprint reduction\n\n- \uf0b7 Implementing energy  saving  measures (ESMs)  when  operating  premises  in  such  a  way  that consumption is controlled by establishing baselines.\n- \uf0b7 Promoting renewable energy consumption through PPA agreements or purchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs, iRECs, GdO). As such, 100% of the energy consumed in Spain and Portugal is of renewable origin, and in Mexico, the United States, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Turkey it has already reached  a  significant  percentage,  thus  contributing  to  the  Group's  figure  of  65%  renewable consumption.\n- \uf0b7 Furthermore,  several  countries  such  as  Turkey,  Uruguay  and  Spain  have  also  committed  to selfgenerate renewable energy in their buildings by installing solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels.\n- \uf0b7 Offsetting residual carbon emissions that have not been reduced by the above. In order to achieve the goal to become a Carbon Neutral company in 2020, BBVA is finalizing all the necessary formalities to offset the remaining footprint which it was unable to reduce during the financial year, through purchasing carbon credits of various projects within the Voluntary Carbon Market. All these projects will be certified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) of Verra and the Gold Standard.\n\n## 3. Water\n\nWater, which is one of the resources that has a major impact, is another priority indicator for BBVA. In order to reduce this impact, the headquarters of Spain and Mexico are equipped with gray water recycling systems and rainwater recirculation for irrigation.\n\n## 4. Paper and waste\n\nWaste generation is becoming a major global problem. BBVA has spent many years working to reduce this impact as much as possible through sustainable construction standards or through implementing ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management Systems. In order to ensure the proper separation and subsequent recycling of waste, facilities feature clearly differentiated and signposted areas in order to minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.\n\n## 5. Extension of the pledge - awareness campaigns\n\nOne of the ways in which BBVA can instill its concern about its environmental impact is by raising awareness among employees and providing training to them. The Bank is working in the creation of the new website for sustainability training, ('The Camp'), which will enable employees to become specialized to various different levels in this area, one of which is related to direct impacts. Some of these training itineraries are already mandatory throughout the Group in order to ensure that employees at least have a basic knowledge so that they can apply it in their day-to-day work.\n\nLikewise, as in previous years, BBVA joined the \"Earth Hour\" initiative in 2020, during which we turned off the lights in 114 buildings and 183 branches in 113 cities in Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Turkey, Peru, Uruguay and the United States to support the fight against climate change.\n\n## MAIN INDICATORS OF THE GLOBAL ECO-EFFICIENCY PLAN\n\n|                                                                             |                   | 2020 (3)   | 2020 (3)                 | 2019 (4)   | 2019 (4)                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------------|------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                             | Objetivo 2020 (%) |            | KPI (%)  Reference value |            | KPI (5)  Reference value |\n| People working in the certified buildings (%)  (1)                          | 46                | 48         | -                        | 47         |                          |\n| Electricity usage per person (MWh)                                          | -5                | -17        | 5,33 MWh/ocup            | -9         | 5,88 MWh/ocup            |\n| Energy coming from renewable sources (%)                                    | 48                | 65         | -                        | 37         |                          |\n| Co2 emissions per person (T)  (2)                                           | -8                | -65        | 0,85 TCO2/ocup           |            | -17  2,00 TCO2/ocup      |\n| Water consumption per person (m 3 )                                         | -5                | -24        | 19,75 m3/ocup            | -19        | 21,12 m3/ocup            |\n| People working in buildings with alternative  sources of water supply (%)   | 9                 | 16         | -                        | 17         |                          |\n| Paper consumption per person (T)                                            | -5                | -58        | 0,02 T/ocup              | -27        | 0,04 T/ocup              |\n| People working in buildings with separate waste  collection certificate (%) | 30                | 46         | -                        | 45         |                          |\n\nNote: These indicators are calculated on the basis of building occupants.

The percentage of renewable energy consumption has reached 65%, which far exceeds BBVA's target for this year, and the percentage of people working in buildings with environmental certification reached 48%. All of the above means that 2020 will close the current Global Eco-Efficiency Plan having achieved its objectives in all indicators.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT (BBVA GROUP) (8)\n\n|                                                          | 2020      | 2019 (7)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Consumption                                              |           |            |\n| Public water supply (cubic meters)                       | 2,806,101 | 2,966,426  |\n| Paper (tons)                                             | 3,661     | 6,272      |\n| Energy (Megawatt hour)  (1)                              | 826,832   | 921,130    |\n| CO2 emissions                                            |           |            |\n| Scope 1 emissions (tons CO2e)  (2)                       | 12,467    | 17,092     |\n| Scope 2 emissions (tons CO2e) market-based method  (3)   | 100,589   | 221,405    |\n| Scope 2 emissions (tons CO2e) location-based method  (4) | 286,936   | 325,116    |\n| Scope 3 emissions (tons CO2e)  (5)                       | 7,506     | 56,700     |\n| Business trips  (5)                                      | 7,506     | 42,635     |\n| Employees commuting  (6)                                 | -         | 14,065     |\n| Waste                                                    |           |            |\n| Hazardous waste (tons)                                   | 31        | 168        |\n| Non-hazardous waste (tons)                               | 5,516     | 5,464      |\n\n- (6) Emissions from employees commuting to the workplace have not been calculated this year, as more than 3/4 of the year the employees have been working remotely.\n- (7) 2019 data have been updated with respect to those published in previous reports due to post-2019 adjustments.\n\nGiven the business activities in which the BBVA Group engages, the Group has no environmental liabilities, expenses, assets, provisions or contingencies that are significant in relation to its equity, financial position and earnings.

        "page_content": "## Engagement with global initiatives\n\nBeyond its key role in the drive toward sustainable financing, BBVA promotes a new way of making banking more responsible. As part of the 2025 Pledge, BBVA has actively participated in numerous initiatives and always in close collaboration with all stakeholders such as the industry itself, regulators and supervisors, investors and civil society organizations. These initiatives focus on the following five priority areas:\n\n- 1. Universal reference frameworks : BBVA was one of 28 founding banks in the Principles for Responsible Banking promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, UNEP FI. This is the reference framework for corporate responsibility in the banking sector, which has already been signed by more than 190 entities  worldwide,  which  is  approximately  40%  (by  asset  volume)  of  the  banking  system.  BBVA  also participates  in  global  initiatives  such  as  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact,  Principles  for  Responsible Investment, and the Thun Group, which describes how the \"United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\" (\"UNGPs\") should be applied in the banking sector.\n- 2. Alignment with the Paris Agreement : BBVA signed the Katowice commitment in 2018 together with other major  international  banks  in  order  to  develop  a  methodology  to  help  align  lending  activity  with  the  Paris Agreement.  This  commitment  has  inspired  the  Collective  Commitment  to  Climate  Action  launched  by  31 international financial institutions, including BBVA, under the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking at the United Nations climate summit in New York in September 2019. BBVA has also joined the Science Based Target Initiative and participates in the Alliance CEO Climate Leaders of the World Economic Forum (WEF) as well as in other initiatives focused on environmental issues or the fight against climate change, such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and RE100.\n- 3. Market standards : BBVA has been very active in promoting the Green Bond Principles, Social Bonds Principles, Green Loan Principles and other similar standards developed by the industry itself and which have allowed the creation of an orderly and growing market for sustainable financial instruments.\n- 4. Transparency : in September 2017, BBVA committed to the TCFD recommendations of the FSB and has been reporting on its objectives, plans and performance in line with its utmost commitment to transparency. BBVA published its first TCFD report in November 2020.\n- 5. Financial regulation : BBVA has been involved in consultation processes and various activities with regulatory and supervisory bodies to promote sustainable finance regulation. The Group's participation in the UNEP FI and European Banking Federation working group for defining recommendations so that banks may use the new taxonomy being developed in Europe is also notable.\n\nBBVA co-chairs the UNEP FI management committee and represents European banks in this forum. BBVA also holds the presidency of the working group of sustainable finance at the European Banking Federation and is a member of the Equator Principles management committee.\n\nFor  years,  BBVA  has  been  actively  involved  in  various  supranational  initiatives  and  seeks  to  continue  leading  the international  agenda  in  tackling  climate  change.  Among  others,  BBVA  has  signed  its  commitment  to  the  following initiatives:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, BBVA Insurances subscribed to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and is therefore applying an investment strategy that seeks to improve the ESG rating of the assets in its investment portfolios. As such, in addition to financial aspects, such as profitability and risk, our investment decisions also include environmental, social and good governance criteria in order to contribute to the fight against climate change, promote maximum equality and social inclusion, and exhibit solid and transparent corporate governance.",

Task Force on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets , the  private  sector-led  initiative  working  to  scale  up  a voluntary carbon market that is effective, efficient and functional in helping to meet the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. The more than 50 participants in the Working Group represent the financial sector, market service providers, and buyers and providers of carbon offsets.\n- 3. The Great Reset, promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in which the pandemic is visualized as an exceptional but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine and reset the world.\n- 4. Letter to promote renewable energy in European recovery , promoted by the Corporate European Platform for Renewable Energy Sourcing (Re-Source), and signed by 43 of the 12 largest banks in the world, with BBVA being the only Spanish bank to join.\n- 5. Next Generation EU, promoted by the European Commission, which views the recovery plan as turning the immense challenge arising from the context created by COVID-19 into an opportunity, not only by supporting recovery but also by investing in the future. The European Green Deal and digitization will boost jobs and growth, societal resilience and environmental health.\n- 6. Manifest for sustainable economic recovery in Spain, promoted by the Spanish Green Growth Group ( Grupo Espa\u00f1ol para el Crecimiento Verde, GECV,) to support recovery toward a more sustainable and robust economy and demand that alliances be established between political parties, businesses, trade unions, media, NGOs and civil society to support and implement a sustainable stimulus package, based on the best scientific knowledge and best practices.\n- 7. GECV statement to face the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, promoted by the GECV and in which it is stated that \"The economic stimuli launched to combat the coronavirus crisis must be embedded within and align with actions to address the pressing challenges of climate action and sustainability.\"\n- 8. European manifesto: \"Green Recovery Alliance. Reboot and re-boost our economies for a sustainable future,\" led by the President of the European Parliament's committee on the Environment. The alliance has 270 members, including MEPs from 17 EU countries, European ministers, NGOs and business and trade union associations. Furthermore, 50 presidents or CEOs of large European multinationals have signed this declaration, as has the Spanish Banking Association.\n\nIn addition to these new 2020 initiatives, BBVA has been supporting collective initiatives and declarations for more than 20 years:\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2019,  these  principles  were  officially  signed,  and  BBVA  subscribed  to  these principles together with 131 other global financial institutions. This initiative, which is coordinated by UNEP FI (the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative), aims to respond to the growing demand from different stakeholders for a comprehensive framework that covers all aspects of sustainable banking. More than 190 banks are currently adhering to these Principles.\n\nBBVA therefore believes that these Principles will help reaffirm its purpose, enhance its contribution to both the United Nations SDGs and the commitments derived from the Paris Climate Agreements, and align its business strategy with said commitments. In 2020, BBVA has reported its progress and achievements in each of the 6 principles to UNEP FI; this is the first year we have implemented the Principles for Responsible Banking. For more information on the progress and developments reported, see the chapter named \"UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking Reporting Index\" in this report.\n\n## Progress in the second year since the signing of the Katowice Commitment\n\nTogether with other financial institutions, since 2018, BBVA has adhered to the Katowice Commitment, an initiative that aims  to  develop  an  impact  assessment  methodology  to  adapt  the  loan  portfolio  to  the  commitments  of  the  Paris Agreement.\n\nIn an open letter addressed to world leaders and heads of state gathered at the 24th UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, these banks committed to finance and design the financial services needed to support customers as they transition toward a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn September 2020, BBVA, together with other financial institutions, published a joint methodology to align its credit portfolios with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The group, known as the \"Katowice banks,\" has presented this report, which offers a solid and precise methodology to reconfigure their portfolios in order to finance a society with fewer carbon emissions.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the methodology is that it involves creating specific indicators for each sector. Each bank has committed to setting its own targets for these indicators and monitoring them.\n\nBBVA will use the following metrics to measure the alignment in the more sensible sectors within the Katowice group framework.",

        "page_content": "## Progress in the first year since the signing of Collective Commitment to Climate Action\n\nWithin the Principles for Responsible Banking, signed at the United Nation General Assembly in New York on September 22, 2019, this initiative was born with the aim of aligning the member institutions' portfolios \"to reflect and finance the lowcarbon economy necessary to limit global warming to below 2 degrees, striving to limit it to 1.5 degrees.\"\n\nTo this end, BBVA and 38 international banks, taking the Katowice Commitment as a starting point, share objectives to \"facilitate the economic transition necessary to achieve climate neutrality.\" They also commit to work together and support each other \"to develop the capabilities of each bank and the methodologies required to measure climate impact and alignment with local and global climate objectives.\"\n\nIn order to accelerate the transition toward sustainable technologies, business models, and societies, the Collective Commitment to Climate Action requested that the entities that signed this declaration publish and implement, within twelve months, the set of measures that they will use together with their customers to support and accelerate the transition to low-carbon technologies. A maximum period of three years has also been given to set and publish specific objectives, based on scenarios for portfolio alignment.\n\nAlong these lines, BBVA reported the measures implemented to support customers and accelerate the transition toward low-carbon technologies to UNEP FI in 2020:\n\n- \uf0b7 Exclusion policies: For more information, see the \"Environmental and Social Framework' section included in the \"Management of Indirect Environmental Impacts\" section of this chapter.\n- \uf0b7 Strategy for growing the customer base in selected sectors: for more information, see the \"Funds mobilized under the 2025 Pledge\" table in the \"Sustainable financing: mobilization metrics\" section in this chapter.\n- \uf0b7 Objectives and portfolio alignment: this chapter includes information on exposure to \"carbon sensitive\" sectors and the joint methodology of the Katowice banks.\n\n## Consultation processes\n\nBBVA plays an active role in collaborating with the various regulatory bodies, supervisors and international organizations by  participating  in  initiatives,  forums,  consultation  processes,  etc.,  focused  on  transitioning  toward  a  low-carbon economy.\n\n## Sustainability indices\n\nSustainability ratings measure companies' ESG performance and determine their position in sustainability indices. As such, the permanence and position in these stock indices depend on companies' ability to demonstrate steady progress on sustainability issues, and also influence the eligibility of said companies in investment portfolios.\n\nBBVA participates annually in the main sustainability analyses conducted by non-financial rating agencies. Based on the evaluations obtained through these analyses, companies are chosen to be part of the sustainability indices. Some of the most popular indices are the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), FTSE4Good or MSCI ESG.\n\nSustainability analyses measure companies' performance in environmental, social and corporate governance matters, based on the different methodologies developed by these agencies.\n\nIn 2020, BBVA was ranked first among European banks in the DJSI , which measures the performance of the largest companies by market capitalization in economic, environmental and social matters. Globally, the Group ranked second, achieving the highest score (100 points) in the areas of financial inclusion, environmental reporting, social reporting, corporate citizenship and philanthropy, occupational health and safety, tax strategy and policy influence. The Group therefore achieved an overall score of 87 points, 5 points more than in 2019.\n\nBBVA has been included, for the fourth consecutive year in the Bloomber Gender Equality Index , improving its score from 72.32% to 77.29%, which means the recognition of its commitment to create confident work environments, where all employees' professional development and equal opportunities are granted, regardless of their gender.",

Although a fall of beneficiaries related to presence activities was observed due to cancels, the number of beneficiaries related to the health and social rose, to which the Social Response to COVID-19 Plan was addressed.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in addition to the 12 million people benefited directly, 27.6 million people acquired knowledge through BBVA Platforms access.\n\nThrough this contribution to the society, BBVA acts as a driver of opportunities for people, seeks to generate a positive impact on their lives and delivers on its Purpose of Bringing the age of opportunity to everyone, particularly to vulnerable people.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, approved by the Board of Directors in 2020 and available for consultation on the shareholders and investors Group website, BBVA implements its commitment to society through supporting the development of the societies in which the Group is present.\n\nDuring the year, BBVA's contribution to society includes the launch and execution of the BBVA Group Social Response Plan to fight against the COVID-19 effects. Likewise, BBVA continued to boost in 2020 the main lines of action established",

This line of action has a direct impact into the SDG 3 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages'. In 2020, 839,773 people benefited from the medical supplies donated to hospitals. Below is the breakdown of the items purchased and distributed to hospitals around the world:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf0b7 Providing support to vulnerable groups through contributions to social organizations aimed to cover the needs of those most affected by the pandemic: food, basic necessities, psychosocial support and assistance, and training.

        "page_content": "## Financial education\n\nBBVA has developed since 2008 a Financial Education Global Plan to improve the people's financial health through the training on financial skills and competences, by both face to face and digital channels. This plan is based on three lines of action:\n\n- 1. Financial education for society: to promote the acquisition of financial knowledge, skills and attitudes of the society in all countries where BBVA is present. BBVA develops its own programs in collaboration with third related parties, with the aim of both improving the knowledge of financial concepts and promoting a change in behavior in financial decision-making, enabling the improvement of people's financial health. In 2020, a total of 319,395 people, including children and young adults and SMEs, benefited from the financial education initiatives. This year, the Group began to gradually reduce its initiatives for children as schools come to train on this field, establishing the Group a major focus on the financial health of the vulnerable groups. This change meant an 83.25% down of the beneficiaries number.\n- 2. Financial education in customer solutions: addressed to integrate financial capabilities into the customer experience.  In  order  to  facilitate  informed  decision-making  and  improve  their  financial  well-being,  financial education content was integrated into some customer solutions in 2020.\n- 3. Financial education promotion and content dissemination: in 2020, BBVA intensified the practice of content creation of financial education, which are posted on the transactional webs of the Group and which are accessible for both customers and not customers, and contents on the corporate web through podcast and social media. The Center for Education and Financial Capabilities continued to provide support and promotion to the research and celebrating events to share knowledge. More than 13 million people accessed the digital contents of financial education through some BBVA's channels and the Center for Education and Financial Capabilities.\n\nIn 2020, \u20ac2.7m were spent on financial education, representing a year-on-year decline of 64.8%. The BBVA's commitment to financial education is long-term, with \u20ac91.4m invested and 15.8 million people benefited from different programs since 2008.\n\nThe programs and initiatives of financial education have a direct impact into SDG 4 'Quality education' and SDG 10 'Reduced inequalities'\n\n## Entrepreneurship\n\nThrough entrepreneurship initiatives, BBVA wants to support vulnerable entrepreneurs and those who generate a positive social impact with their companies. In 2020, BBVA allocated \u20ac7.7m to entrepreneurship initiatives that benefited 2.61 million people.\n\nAmong the global initiatives relating to entrepreneurship, BBVA Momentum highlights, which is a mentoring program for social entrepreneurships to generate impact. This program includes training, strategic mentoring, network and funding. In 2020, 100 entrepreneurs have taken part in the Mexico edition, the only one celebrated this year. Additionally and in this field, the action of the BBVA Microfinance Foundation is noteworthy, whose initiatives will be detailed later in this chapter.\n\nThe programs and initiatives of entrepreneurship have a direct impact into SDG 8 'Productive employment and decent work'.\n\n## Knowledge, education and culture\n\nBBVA promotes knowledge, education and culture to boost the sustainable development of the societies and the creation of opportunities for people. In 2020, BBVA invested \u20ac79.1m which benefited 5.6 million people. In addition, 2.2 million people accessed the contents of education, science, culture and economy.\n\nBBVA contributes to the dissemination of knowledge through BBVA Research, the support to the BBVA Foundation and BBVA Open MInd. In 2020, BBVA Research made 718 publications available to shareholders, investors and the general public, including economic studies, reports and analysis, and have been viewed by 525,080 people. For its part, the initiatives to support science, mainly promoted by BBVA Foundation (research, knowledge spaces, recognition and networking) benefited 3.59 million people. The BBVA Foundation initiatives in the field of science and knowledge will be detailed later in this chapter.\n\nThe education for society is an important aspect of BBVA's social investment (30%), as it continues to support the access to education, educational quality and the development of 21st century key skills as sources of opportunity, benefiting 648,921 people in 2020. BBVA Foundation initiatives in this field will be detailed later in this chapter.\n\nOn the one hand, BBVA promotes the access to education for vulnerable children and young through scholarship programs in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. In 2020, 67,573 children and young were benefited.\n\nOn the other hand, with the educational project ' Aprendemos juntos ', BBVA aims to lead and promote conversation on education in the 21st century, taking into account the fact that education provides a great opportunity to improve people's lives. The project was launched in January 2018 with a transformative mission that aims to create opportunities in homes and the educational community. In three years, the project is followed by 4.5 million people on social media, with more than 1,258 million views of its inspiring content, and 69,435 teachers and parents being trained through online courses.",

        "page_content": "Finally, BBVA Foundation also develops educational programs. Its initiatives in the culture field will be detailed later in this chapter.\n\nThe promotion of cultural creation is an axis for knowledge generation. The Group focuses its support on classic music, especially in contemporary music, plastic arts, videoart and digital art, literature and theatre. BBVA Foundation initiatives in the cultural field will be detail later in the chapter. In 2020, 1.4 million people benefited from this initiatives. Likewise, the different local banks that form the Group promote culture in their countries with a wide diversity of activities.\n\nThe programs and initiatives in financial education have a direct impact into the SDG 4 'Quality Education', SDG 9 'Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure' and SDG 11 'Sustainable Cities and Communities'.\n\n## Other contributions\n\nBBVA's community support activity extends to other important activities, such as volunteer work (more information in the \"Work environment\" section in the chapter on \"Questions relating to personnel\"), support for foundations and non-profit organizations and the promotion of corporate responsibility by participating in various different working groups (more information in the section on \"Involvement in global initiatives\" in the chapter on \"Sustainable finance\").\n\nIn terms of contributions to foundations and non-profit organizations, the global amount of these contributions in 2020 was \u20ac36.9m. In 2020, the BBVA Group made:\n\n- \uf0b7 833 donations to foundations and non-profit organizations for an amount of \u20ac27m; and\n- \uf0b7 564 allocations to foundations and non-profit organizations for an amount of \u20ac9.9m.\n\nBBVA channelled all the above initiatives through the different banks of the countries where the Group is present, corporate  foundations  and  the  support  to  other  foundations  such  as  BBVA  Foundation  and  BBVA  Microfinance Foundation, among others, contributing to the development of the societies in which they operate. In this regard, the foundations play a key role in channeling a significant part of the Group's social investment initiatives.\n\nThe BBVA Foundation focuses its activity on building knowledge. Expanding the frontiers of inherited knowledge is one of the most effective ways to successfully address the problems that affect society today, such as the environment, sustainable development, health, demographic changes, globalization, social integration and innovation with the goal of creating opportunities for society as a whole.\n\nThe direct promotion of scientific research is one of the levers of the BBVA Foundation, along with the dissemination of knowledge generated through conferences and digital spaces, and the recognition of talent through awards such as the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards. Among the initiatives promoted by the BBVA Foundation in this area throughout 2020, the special call for aid for scientific research teams in biomedicine, ecology and veterinary science, Big Data,  economics  and  social  sciences,  and  humanities  in  order  to  study  COVID-19  from  each  of  these  five  areas. Furthermore, 59 Leonardo Grants were awarded in 2020. Since 2014, the Leonardo Grants have benefited a total of 427 researchers with highly personal projects and a total budget of \u20ac13m. Furthermore, 45 grants were awarded to research teams in 2020 (45 projects and 509 scientists). Since 2014, the Scientific Research Grants have benefited teams, with an accumulated allocation of \u20ac16m.\n\nIn the field of acting for education for the society, BBVA Foundation activities share space with other Group initiatives. In 2020, 453,262 people benefited from its programs in this area, which are structured in several lines. The Foundation facilitates the access to advanced training through Scholarships for South American students to study a Master's Degree in Protected Natural Areas and promotes social and educational innovation and talent among teachers, providing them with access to training, knowledge, visibility and networks, through various different initiatives.\n\nLikewise, the BBVA foundation boosts to the cultural creation of excellence as described above, particularly through concert  series  at  its  Madrid  and  Bilbao  headquarters,  the  Leonardo  Grants  for  Cultural  Creators  and  the  BBVA Foundation's Multiverse Scholarships for the Creation of Video Art. It collaborates with the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Joan Mir\u00f3 Foundation and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (through its digital program), as well as with the Teatro Real, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, ABAO Bilbao Opera, the Madrid Symphony Orchestra and the Reina Sof\u00eda School of Music for training performers.\n\nFor its part, the BBVA Microfinance Foundation (BBVAMF), established in 2007 by BBVA under the framework of its corporate social responsibility to support vulnerable entrepreneurs through a commitment of \u20ac200m and its more than 160 years of experience. In addition to financial products and services, our microfinance institutions provide entrepreneurs with advice and training for the administration and management of their businesses.\n\nDespite the crisis generated by COVID-19, the BBVAMF has continued its work throughout 2020 and has maintained a close relationship with the more than 2.61 million vulnerable entrepreneurs (57% women) whom it serves thanks to the digital transformation process, which began some years ago. The total volume of microloans granted was \u20ac944m, with an average amount of \u20ac1,235 per microloan.\n\nSince its constitution in 2007, BBVAMF entities have disbursed a combined total of \u20ac12,654m to a total of 5 million lowincome entrepreneurs in South America. In January 2020, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recognized the Foundation's work by ranking it as the second most important private philanthropic entity in the world for its contribution to development , second only to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the first most important in South America.",

In the tax area, in addition to providing legitimate added value to investors, BBVA's actions must also address other stakeholders and must align with the values and commitments that it has undertaken with society in order to bring the age of opportunities to everyone.\n\nAs such, the principles that guide its action are:\n\n- \uf0b7 Integrity : in the fiscal sphere, integrity is defined as the observance of the letter and spirit of the law and the maintenance of a cooperative and good faith relationship with the various Tax Administrations.\n- \uf0b7 Prudence : in the fiscal context, BBVA always assesses the implications of its decisions beforehand, including, among other assessments, the impact that its activity may have in the geographical areas in which we operate.\n- \uf0b7 Transparency: in  the  tax  area,  BBVA  provides  information  on  its  activity  and  its  approach  to  taxation  to customers and other stakeholders in a clear and accurate manner.\n\n## BBVA's fiscal strategy\n\nThe corporate principles described above served as a basis for the articulation of BBVA's Fiscal Strategy in 2015, which was approved by the Board of Directors that same year, and made public on its website (www.bbva.com).\n\nIn summary, BBVA's fiscal strategy establishes:\n\n- 1. The commitment to pay any applicable taxes in all countries in which it operates.\n- 2. The alignment of its taxation with the effective performance of economic activities and value generation. The presence in tax havens is only possible as a consequence of the effective performance of economic activities.\n- 3. The application of reasonable interpretations of tax rules and of the provisions of agreements to avoid double taxation.\n- 4. The  establishment  of  a  transfer  pricing  policy  for  all  transactions  between  related  parties  related  entities, governed by the principles of free competition, value creation and assumption of risk and benefits.\n- 5. Addressing the fiscal challenges that the digital economy poses by incorporating an online presence into its valueadded assessments.\n- 6. The payment of taxes as an important part of the contribution to the economies of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n- 7. The  promotion  of  a  reciprocal  cooperative  relationship  with  the  various  tax  administrations,  based  on  the principles of transparency, mutual trust, good faith and loyalty.\n- 8. The promotion of transparent, clear and responsible reporting of its main tax figures, informing stakeholders of the payment of taxes.\n- 9. When preparing any financial product, it takes into account the tax implications for the customers and provides them with the relevant information required to meet their tax obligations.\n- 10. The development of the Strategy and its principles, through the Fiscal department, in order to establish the internal control mechanisms and rules necessary to comply with the prevailing tax code, the Strategy and its principles.\n\nThe main characteristics of the BBVA Group's fiscal Strategy are:\n\n## \uf0b7 BEPS compliance.\n\nThis is inspired by the results of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project reports promoted by the G20 and the OECD, which aim to align value generation with appropriate taxation where said value is generated. They also reflect the commitment to comply with and respect both the letter and the spirit of tax regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, in accordance with Chapter XI of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.",

        "page_content": "## \uf0b7 Geared toward compliance with SDGs.\n\nBBVA's vision shares the views of the European Economic and Social Committee's opinion ECO/494 of December 11, 2019, on taxation, private investment and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. For BBVA, paying taxes is key to achieving these objectives; in particular, it is clearly associated with the first goal (no poverty); the eighth (decent work and economic growth); the tenth (reduced inequalities); and the seventeenth (partnerships for the goals), although BBVA's commitment extends to all of the goals. In this sense, for BBVA, it is not only a question of contributing with the necessary resources in accordance with current legislation so that the tax authorities may exercise their policies aimed at complying with the SDGs, but it has also adopted a proactive attitude of cooperating with these authorities and have incorporated responsibility in the field of taxation as an essential element of its activities.\n\n## \uf0b7 Committed to protecting human rights.\n\nBBVA  is  concerned  with  the promotion,  protection  and  assurance  of  an effective  exercise  of  human  rights including in the area of taxation, and we have fully embraced the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Taxation is linked to human rights insofar as, through the redistributive action of States, it makes it possible to provide economically disadvantaged persons with the means to effectively exercise their rights. BBVA is committed to paying taxes, and ensures that these taxes are paid in the jurisdictions in which they are collected, aligning its contribution with the effective performance of its economic activity. The Group also collaborates with the tax administrations of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nThe Group maintains transparent, clear and truthful communication on tax matters with various NGOs that are equally committed to human rights, while internally, it participates in auditing activities for implementing the Guiding Principles developed by the BBVA Group's Responsible Business area, and monitors the performance of the plans it has launched in this sphere.\n\nIn the BBVA Group, the Board of Directors is responsible for approving its fiscal Strategy. Although the Strategy is intended to be permanent, and updated when necessary to better express the Group's fiscal orientation and commitments.\n\nThe Strategy is universal and affects all of BBVA's business units and employees, regardless of the region in which they are located. It is developed through a body of fiscal policies that are reviewed annually both internally and by an independent third party to ensure that they reflect best market practices and are fully aligned with the Group's strategy.\n\nIn compliance with United Kingdom regulations, BBVA makes its fiscal strategy public for its branch in that jurisdiction. This strategy reproduces the Group-wide strategy with the adaptations required by United Kingdom regulations, and is also subject to third party review and verification.\n\nIn addition to the above, it should be noted that Section 4.6.1 of BBVA's Code of Conduct requires its members to carry out their professional activity in such a way that BBVA adequately complies with its tax obligations, and in such a way that avoids any practices that involve illicit tax evasion or harm to the public treasury. The implementation of the Code is monitored by the Group's Compliance area, which has its own whistleblowing channel.\n\nBBVA is fully committed to transparency in tax matters and voluntarily publishes its overall tax contribution annually in the Tax Policy section of the shareholders and investors website. As a financial entity, BBVA also complies, through the corresponding areas, with reporting obligations to tax authorities arising from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), the United States Qualified Intermediary (QI), and the country-bycountry report.\n\n## Fiscal risk management and control\n\nThe BBVA Group has set up a Fiscal Control Framework that complies with requirements on tax risk management and control introduced for listed companies by Law 31/2014 amending the Capital Companies Act to improve Corporate Governance.\n\nThe BBVA Group's Fiscal Control Framework is based on its Fiscal Strategy and is applicable to all the jurisdictions in which BBVA operates and to all the Group's various different areas and businesses. This allows the BBVA Group to carry out an integrated management of its fiscal positions and risks in a manner consistent and in conjunction with other risks.\n\nThe BBVA Group's Fiscal Control model is configured around three fundamental lines of action.\n\n- 1. Specific plans are carried out annually to identify, mitigate and control fiscal risk within the BBVA Group. The Head of the Group's Tax Department periodically informs the Audit Committee of the most relevant tax information.\n- 2. Controls for fiscal risk management are subject to the annual cycle of review of internal control areas in order to evaluate their suitability and effectiveness.\n- 3. The Group's Internal Audit area conducts periodic tax compliance reviews.",

        "page_content": "A series of specific tax risk indicators have also been developed, which are integrated into the Group's general risk management and control model, to help establish and manage the Group's risk profile in tax matters.\n\nBBVA's fiscal function carries out the process of evaluating and monitoring these indicators, which allows for:\n\n- \uf0b7 Properly identifying fiscal risks.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the impact of the materialization of fiscal risks.\n- \uf0b7 Developing redirection measures that allow dynamic fiscal risk management.\n- \uf0b7 Reporting and generating relevant information on the evolution of tax risks for the Group's Governing Bodies.\n\nOn the other hand, the Group has fully anonymous whistleblowing channels for reporting potential breaches of both its Code of Conduct and its Fiscal Strategy.\n\nFinally, the BBVA Group Control Framework is subject to annual review by a third independent firm.\n\n## Cooperation with tax administrations\n\nAs advocated by the Group's Fiscal Strategy, BBVA maintains a cooperative relationship with the tax administrations of the countries in which we operate based on the principles of transparency, mutual trust, good faith and loyalty.\n\nIn particular, and with regard to Spanish, it adheres to the Large Corporations Forum, BBVA is subject to the Code of Best Tax Practices ( C\u00f3digo de Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Tributarias , CBPT) adopted by the Forum on July 20, 2010. The Group has once again voluntarily submitted the Annual Fiscal Transparency Report for Companies Adhering to the Code of Best Tax Practices and its Corporate Income Tax declaration for the previous year, which included its performance and proposals to strengthen best practices on fiscal transparency, adopted in a plenary session of the Spanish Large Corporations Forum on December 20, 2016, or companies adhering to the Code.\n\nIn the aforementioned Transparency Report, the most significant criteria used to prepare the Corporate Income Tax Declaration are voluntarily explained to the Central Delegation of Major Contributors, and meetings are subsequently held with the tax authorities in order to further elaborate on any details that may be required. All of the above is before corresponding inspectorate actions commence.\n\nBBVA also adopted the Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks, a United Kingdom initiative that provides for the approach expected from financial institutions in terms of governance, tax planning and engagement with the British tax authorities, in order to promote the adoption of best practices in this area, which is published on the HMRC website.\n\nBBVA is also a financial institution that collaborates in the collection processes of the regions that so request.\n\nFinally, in order to obtain legal certainty and ensure that its understanding of tax code is in line with the spirit of the law, BBVA consults the tax authorities on any aspects that are controversial or raise doubts, when deemed necessary.\n\n## Participation in technical-fiscal discussion forums\n\nBBVA participates, among other organizations, in the Spanish Banking Association's Tax Committee, and collaborates with this association in the finance working groups of the European Banking Federation. BBVA also participates in the main fiscal committees of the banking and trade associations of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The sector's positions are coordinated through all these organizations.\n\nIn  this  respect,  there  are  no  significant  differences  in  fiscal  matters  with  respect  to  the  positions  reported  by  said organizations and those maintained by BBVA.\n\n## Dialogue with other stakeholders on fiscal matters\n\nBBVA is aware of how important taxes are for the progress and sustainability of the societies in which it operates, which is why it maintains mutually constructive dialog with various NGOs, universities, think tanks and other tax-related forums, in relation to the Group's fiscal contribution. As a result of this dialog, BBVA has incorporated new transparency standards made public in the Total Tax Contribution Report, and has been recognized as a transparent financial entity by the Fundaci\u00f3n Compromiso y Transparencia (Commitment and Transparency Foundation) and has promoted initiatives that allow its extension to other multinationals such as the European Business Tax Forum.\n\n## Total tax contribution\n\nBBVA is committed to transparency in paying taxes and this is the reason why, for yet another year, The Group voluntarily breaks down the total tax contribution in countries in which it has a significant presence.",

As a result of these differences, there has been a net cash refund\n\nBanking activity in Spain is mainly carried out through BBVA, S.A., which has a twofold dimension: on the one hand, it is the head of banking business in Spain and, on the other, it is the parent company/holding company of the BBVA Group.\n\nThe main segments of activity developed in Spain include commercial and SME banking, as well as insurance and CIB activities.\n\nSpain's perimeter of consolidation can be consulted in Appendix I of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn general terms, the Group's Spanish companies form a tax group, constituting for this purpose a single taxpayer for corporate income tax. The nominal tax rate in Spain is 30%. However, there are certain effects and peculiarities of a tax and accounting nature due to the aforementioned twofold dimension that may cause the effective tax rate to different.\n\nTo this end, during the 2020 financial year, the most significant is the effect arising from the accounting impairment recorded in relation to the goodwill of the business unit in the United States, which does not have an associated credit in the Corporate Income Tax Expense.\n\n## Mexico\n\n|        | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Profit (loss)   | CIT payment   | CIT accrued  (current   | Number of  workers   | Tangible                |\n|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n|        | Third-parties               | Related  party              | Total                       | before CIT      | (cash basis)  | year)                   |                      | assets other  than cash |\n| Mexico | 6,798                       | 15                          | 6,813                       | 2,491           | 1,250         | 721                     | 36,853               | 1,931                   |\n\nThe BBVA Group's operations in Mexico are conducted through the BBVA Mexico Group, which is the country's leading financial institution and one of the driving forces behind the BBVA Group. Its main segments of activity include commercial and SME banking, insurance and CIB activities.\n\nMexico's perimeter of consolidation can be consulted in Appendix I of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe nominal tax rate in Mexico is 30% and its effective tax rate is very similar. In this respect, there are certain effects and peculiarities of a tax and accounting nature that may cause its effective tax rate to differ from 30%, the most significant being the tax adjustment for inflation that contributes to the fall in the tax rate.\n\n## The United States\n\n|                     | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Profit (loss) before   | CIT payment   | CIT accrued    | Number  of   | Tangible assets  other than cash   |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|------------------------------------|\n|                     | Third- parties              | Related  party              | Total                       | CIT                    | (cash basis)  | (current year) | workers      |                                    |\n| United  States  (1) | 3,165                       |                             | 251  3,416                  | 551                    | 118           | 85             | 10,883       | 826                                |\n\nThe BBVA Group's operations in the United States have been conducted, firstly, through BBVA USA, based in the Sunbelt region of the United States, with its main segments of activity being commercial and corporate banking, as well as CIB activities.

The nominal tax rate applicable to BBVA in the United States considering the aggregation of the federal and state taxes is approximately 23.8%.\n\nThe effective tax rate is lower than the nominal rate, to the extent that there are certain significant peculiarities of a tax and accounting nature. In this sense, the main effect that impacts the tax rate of the United States is the exemption of interest on United States government securities, which has had a very significant weight in the profit before corporate income tax, due to the 2020 economic context.\n\nRegardless of the above, BBVA reached an agreement for the sale of the business unit in the United States, which is expected to be executed in 2021. The profit before corporate income tax, and the accrued corporate income tax that is reflected in the previous table, include the business unit object of the transaction.\n\n## Argentina\n\n|           | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Profit (loss) before  CIT   | CIT payment  (cash basis)   CIT accrued  (current year)   | Number  of  workers   | Tangible assets  other than cash   |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|\n|           | Third- parties              | Related  party              | Total                       | Profit (loss) before  CIT   | CIT payment  (cash basis)   CIT accrued  (current year)   | Number  of  workers   | Tangible assets  other than cash   |\n| Argentina | 732                         | -                           | 732                         | 205                         | 137                                                       | 6,052                 | 340                                |\n\nThe BBVA Group's operations in Argentina are conducted through BBVA Argentina, one of the country's leading financial institutions. The main segments of activity include commercial and SME banking, as well as insurance and CIB activities.\n\nArgentina's perimeter of consolidation can be consulted in Annex I of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe nominal tax rate in Argentina is 30%. Generally speaking, Argentina's tax rate should be close to its nominal rate. However,  its  status  as  a  hyperinflationary  economy  and  the  consequent  restatement  of  its  financial  statements significantly distort the country's tax burden.\n\n## Colombia\n\n|          | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Consolidated gross margin   | Profit (loss)   | CIT payment   | CIT accrued  (current  year)   | Number of  workers   | Tangible  assets other  than cash   |\n|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|          | Third-parties               | Related  party              | Total                       | before CIT      | (cash basis)  | CIT accrued  (current  year)   | Number of  workers   | Tangible  assets other  than cash   |\n| Colombia | 911                         | (2)                         | 909                         | 249             | 104           | 77                             | 6,592                | 127                                 |\n\nThe BBVA Group's operations in Colombia are conducted through BBVA Colombia, one of the country's leading financial institutions.

Thus, in 2020, the Group continued to make progress on the transformation of the purchasing function, which is based on the three basic pillars of the procurement model:\n\n- \uf0b7 Service , maximizing the quality and experience of the internal customer, who is accompanied throughout the process.\n- \uf0b7 Risk, limiting the Group's operational risk in supplier contracts, thus ensuring compliance with regulations and processes.\n- \uf0b7 Efficiency, contributing to the Group's efficiency by the proactive managing costs and suppliers.\n\n## ESSENTIAL DATA ABOUT SUPPLIERS (BBVA GROUP)\n\n|                                                       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of suppliers  (1)                              | 3,582  | 4,669  |\n| Volume provided by suppliers (millions of euros)  (1) | 6,906  | 7,696  |\n| Average payment period to suppliers (days)            | n.a.   | 84     |\n| Suppliers satisfaction index  (2)                     | 5,702  | 5,463  |\n| Number of approved suppliers                          | -      | -      |\n\nn.a. = not applicable.\n\nExcluding Turkey.\n\n- (1) Payments to third parties.

Obtained from a satisfaction survey carried out each 2 years for the Group's suppliers with grants of more than \u20ac10.000 and a turnover of more than \u20ac100.000. It is calculated by the difference between the average of promoters, who have answered 9 and 10 up to 10 to the question if they would recommend working with the Procurement area, and the average of detractors, whose answers to the same question have gone from 1 to 6.\n\nAs a part of the procurement process, BBVA strives to properly manage the impacts, both real and potential, that may be generated by its activity through a series of mechanisms and rules : General Procurement Principles, supplier evaluation process and Corporate Rules for the Acquisition of Goods and the Contracting of Services. These impacts may be environmental; caused by labor practices carried out in supplier companies; a result of the absence of freedom of association; related to human rights; and can have either a positive or negative impact on society.\n\nBoth the supplier evaluation process and the Corporate Rules for the Acquisition of Goods have undergone significant updates throughout 2020, evolving toward a more complete evaluation of supplier risk and greater control over the entire procurement process.\n\nThrough the implementation of the Supplier Code of Ethics in the purchasing units of all countries in which the Group is present, minimum standards of behavior in terms of ethical, social and environmental conduct were established which suppliers are expected to follow when providing products and services. Along with the Supplier Code of Ethics, BBVA maintains a responsible procurement policy, the General Procurement Principles.\n\n## General Procurement Principles\n\nThe General Procurement Principles, included in the Procurement Rules for goods and services, include the former Responsible Purchasing Policy, establishes, among other aspects, that it is necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable  legal  requirements  throughout  the  provisioning  process  regarding human,  labor,  association  and environmental rights by all parties involved in this process, as well becoming involved in the Group's efforts aimed at preventing corruption. In the same way, it is ensured that the selection of suppliers remains in compliance with existing internal regulations at all times and, in particular, with the values of the Group's Code of Conduct, based on respect for legality, commitment to integrity, competition, objectivity, transparency, value creation, segregation of duties, and confidentiality.\n\nThe following are included among the clauses contained in the specifications and in the contractual model:\n\n- \uf0b7 Compliance with current legislation in each locality and, in particular, with the obligations imposed on it by its personnel, Social Security or alternative provision systems, hiring of foreign workers, the Public Treasury, public records among others.\n- \uf0b7 Compliance with current legislation on the social integration of individuals with disabilities.\n- \uf0b7 Clauses that ensure that non-discrimination policies are established for reasons of gender, as well as measures to reconcile work and family life.\n- \uf0b7 Equality clause.\n- \uf0b7 Compliance with all labor occupational health and safety legislation.\n- \uf0b7 Anti-corruption declaration.\n- \uf0b7 Adherence to the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nThe General Procurement Principles also establish, within the principle of commitment to Responsible Business, the commitment to raise awareness of social responsibility among personnel and other stakeholders involved in the Group's procurement process.",

        "page_content": "## Supply chain\n\nBBVA operates a technological platform, the Global Procurement System (GPS), which supports all phases of the Group's procurement process , from budgeting to invoice registration, including electronic invoicing. In 2020, the platform is operational in Spain and Mexico (legally), Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Venezuela.\n\nAdditionally, within the GPS, BBVA also has an electronic catalog procurement tool (SRM), which can be accessed via the Intranet and is designed to issue decentralized procurement requests, i.e., directly from the user area. SRM is available in Spain, Mexico and Peru.\n\nBBVA  has  a supplier portal that facilitates  the  Group's  online  relationship  with  its  suppliers.  It  is  a  collaborative environment targeted at companies and self-employed workers who work or are interested in working with the BBVA Group, allowing them to interact electronically with the Bank throughout the supply cycle. The supplier portal consists of two environments: a public one, accessible from the web (www.suppliers.bbva.com), which provides general information on the procurement process and on the relevant aspects of their purchasing model; and  private one, which allows suppliers to operate online, from tendering (electronic auctions) and approval to payment (electronic invoicing).\n\nIn addition to the portal, there is also a supplier directory, an internal tool that can be accessed via the Intranet, allowing users to consult contact data and general information about the Bank's suppliers.\n\n## Supplier management\n\nBBVA conducts a supplier evaluation process that has been improved in 2020, considerably increasing the number of aspects that are reviewed for a supplier: financial, legal, labor, anti-corruption and money laundering situation, reputation, technological risks, concentration and country risks, and customer protection, with the aim of understanding their basic technical capabilities and their legal responsibilities (labor or environmental regulations, etc.). This allows them to promote their civic responsibilities and confirm that they share the same values as the Group in terms of social responsibility. Suppliers must comply with the following points during this process:\n\n- \uf0b7 Compliance with the social and environmental principles of the UN.\n- \uf0b7 Adoption of internal measures to guarantee diversity and equal opportunities in the management of human resources.\n- \uf0b7 Adoption of measures to promote occupational health and safety and the prevention of workplace accidents and incidents.\n- \uf0b7 Support for the freedom of affiliation and collective bargaining of its workers in all the countries in which it operates.\n- \uf0b7 Possession of a code of conduct or policy to avoid forced labor, child labor and other violations of human rights, both within the company itself as well as in its subcontractors.\n- \uf0b7 Possession of a code of conduct or policy designed to avoid corruption and bribery.\n- \uf0b7 Participation  or  collaboration  in  activities  related  to  culture,  scientific  knowledge,  sports,  the environment or disadvantaged sectors, either through direct actions or by means of donations, in collaboration with other organizations or institutions.\n- \uf0b7 Hiring of persons with disabilities.\n- \uf0b7 Existence of a corporate responsibility policy within the company.\n\nSupplier evaluation is reviewed periodically and is subject to continuous monitoring. As of December 31, 2020, the percentage of allocations granted to approve suppliers was 97%.\n\nIn terms of local suppliers, these account for 97% of BBVA's total suppliers at the end of December 2020, and 94% of total turnover, which facilitates contributions to the economic and social development of the countries in which the Group is present. A local supplier, in this context, is one whose tax identification matches the country of the company receiving the goods or services.\n\nOn the other hand, the turnover of special employment centers (CEEs, for its acronym in Spanish) in Spain to the Bank was \u20ac2,4m as of December 31, 2020. The hiring of CEEs favors inclusion and diversity.\n\nIn 2020, the Internal Audit area conducted audits of suppliers on the procurement processes of supply of goods and services from different areas and on the services provided by certain suppliers, mostly outsourcing. These are risk-based audits, and reviews are carried out according to a defined internal methodology.",

In relation to this business area, the sale agreement reached by the Group is detailed  later  in  this  section.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Group's  results  in  this  report  are  shown  from  a management's business perspective , that is, with the United States business area in continuity. Financial information  is  being  presented  to  the  senior  management  of  the  Group  with  this  management's  business perspective, and this report includes a conciliation between the management's business perspective and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.\n- \uf0b7 Lastly, and to a lesser extent, the execution in the fourth quarter of 2020 of the bancassurance agreement reached with Allianz in Spain, once all required authorizations were received, which has represented a net capital gain of \u20ac304m, registered in the line of corporate operations of the Group.\n\nDespite the complexity of the environment, the operating income registered an 11.7% year-on-year increase at constant exchange rates at the end of 2020, driven by the net trading income (NTI) and the operating expenses reduction.\n\nThe Group's adjusted net attributable profit , excluding the goodwill impairment in the United States and the results from corporate operations in 2020, stood at \u20ac3,084m, that is a 36.1% below the 2019 result, also excluding the goodwill impairment in the United States in the last quarter of 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Balance sheet and business activity\n\n- \uf0b7 The figure for loans and advances to customers (gross) fell by 4.5% compared to the end of the previous year, with deleveraging in all portfolios in the last quarter of 2020, with the exception of consumer and credit cards.\n- \uf0b7 Customer funds grew by 3.8% during 2020, mainly as a result of customers placing larger liquidity in demand deposits.\n\n## Liquidity\n\n- \uf0b7 The availability of substantial liquidity buffers in each of the geographical areas in which the BBVA Group operates and their management, have allowed internal and regulatory ratios to be maintained well above the minimums required.\n\n## Solvency\n\n- \uf0b7 From 2021 onwards the BBVA Group sets the target to keep the CET1 fully-loaded ratio between 11.5%-12.0%, increasing  the  distance  to  the  minimum  requirement  (currently  at  8.59%)  to  291-341  basis  points.  As  of December 31, 2020, the CET1 fully-loaded ratio stood at 11.73%, already within the target range. This ratio does not include the positive impact of the sale of BBVA USA and other companies in the United States with activities related to its banking business, which according to the current estimate and taking by reference the capital base in 2020, would place the CET1 fully-loaded ratio at 14.58%. Additionally, it does not include the effect of the closing of the sale of BBVA Paraguay, which would have a positive impact of approximately +6 basis points, which will be registered in the first quarter of 2021.",

The decision continues the line of recommending to the credit institutions exercise extreme prudence in the distribution of profits, either through the payment of dividends or through conducting share buybacks, remaining this remuneration below 15% of the cumulative profit for 2019 and 2020 financial years, and in any case, not higher than 20 basis points of the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1).\n- \uf0b7 Following the ECB recommendation , it is expected to be proposed for the consideration of the competent government bodies the intention to pay out \u20ac0.059 (gross) per share to its shareholders. The maximum amount distributed will be approximately \u20ac393m corresponding to the 15% consolidated profit for 2020 (excluding among others, the goodwill impairment in the United States, the capital gain from corporate operations and the remuneration of  additional Tier 1 capital-AT1-), following the recommendation of the ECB.\n\n## Risk management\n\n- \uf0b7 The calculation of expected credit losses accumulated in 2020 incorporates:\n- o The update of the forward-looking information in the IFRS 9 models in order to reflect the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- o The granting of relief measures in the form of temporary payment deferrals for customers affected by the pandemic, as well as the option to grant lending with a public guarantee facility. In relation to said payments deferrals and in order to mitigate as much as possible the impact of these measures for the Group, due to the high concentration in the time of their maturities, an anticipation plan has been worked out.\n- \uf0b7 The behaviour of the main credit risk indicators of the Group at the end of 2020 were:\n- o The NPL ratio stood at 4.0% at the end of December 2020, 17 basis points above the end of the previous year.\n- o The NPL coverage ratio closed at 81%, with a relevant improvement compared to the end of 2019.\n- o The cumulative cost of risk at the end of December stood at 1.51%, after the rebound experienced in the first quarter of 2020 and the subsequent correction throughout the year.\n\nNPL AND NPL COVERAGE RATIOS AND COST OF RISK (PERCENTAGE)\n\n<!-- image -->",

(hereinafter PNC) for the sale of 100% of the shareholders' equity of its subsidiary BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc., which in turn owns, all of the shareholders' equity of the bank BBVA USA, as well as other companies of the BBVA Group in the United States with activities related to this banking business. The agreement reached does not include the sale of the institutional business of the BBVA Group developed through its broker dealer BBVA Securities Inc. or the participation in Propel Venture Partners US Fund I, L.P. Likewise, BBVA will continue to develop the wholesale business that it currently conducts through its New York branch. The price of the transaction amounts to aproximately USD 11,600m, which will be paid entirely in cash. It is estimated that the operation will generate a positive impact on the CET1 fully-loaded  ratio  of  the  BBVA  Group  of  approximately  294  basis  points  and  a  net  of  taxes  attributable  profit  of approximately \u20ac580m (calculated with a rate of 1.29 euros/U.S dollar) of which at the end of the financial year 2020, are already collected approximately \u20ac300m (corresponding to the results generated by the companies for sale from the signing of the transaction to the end of the year, and that there are recorded in the consolidated Financial Statements on 31 December, 2020) and approximately 9 basis points of positive impact in the CET1 fully-loaded ratio. As usual, the closing of the operation is subject to obtaining regulatory authorizations from the competent authorities and it is estimated that it will take place in mid-2021.\n\n## Sale of BBVA Paraguay\n\nThe BBVA Group announced on 22 January 2021 that, once the regulatory authorizations were obtained, it has completed the sale of its direct and indirect stake of 100% of the Shareholders' equity of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Paraguay S.A. (hereinafter, BBVA Paraguay) to the Banco GNB Paraguay S.A. The total amount received after the closing of the operation amounts to approximately USD250m and has generated a capital loss, net of taxes, of approximately \u20ac9m. Likewise, this transaction will have a positive impact on BBVA Group's Common Equity Tier 1 (fully-loaded) of approximately +6 basis points. This impact will be reflected in the first quarter of 2021's capital base of BBVA Group.",

Spain was also affected by an environment of falling rates and showed flat performance.\n\nNet fees and commissions were affected by the lower activity as a result of the pandemic. The areas that showed yearon-year  reductions  were  Mexico  and  Turkey;  the  latter  was  also  affected  by  changes  in  regulations  on  fees  and commissions charged, which have been in application since March 2020. In Spain, the United States, Rest of Eurasia and South America, the net fees and commissions showed year-on-year increase, despite not charging certain fees and commissions as a measure to support customers during the worst moments of the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe NTI was up 37.6% year-on-year, primarily due to the exchange rate hedging gains, recorded in the Corporate Center and the increase in the results generated throughout the year by all the business areas, except for South America, due to the positive effect from selling the stake in Prisma Medios de Pago S.A. on the results of the previous year, and except for Spain, where the negative results generated in the fourth quarter hindered positive evolution throughout the year.\n\nThe other operating income and expenses line posted \u20ac-135m in 2020 compared to the \u20ac-77m posted 12 months earlier. This unfavorable evolution is due to a lower contribution by the insurance business in Spain and Mexico, as well as BBVA's increased contributions to the public bank deposit protection schemes in said countries. Both effects offset the positive impact of Argentina's lower hyperinflation adjustment.\n\n## Operating income\n\nOperating expenses fell by 2.6% year-on-year as a result of the containment plans implemented by all business areas and also due to the lesser execution of some discretionary expenses since the beginning of the pandemic. The expenses reduction is remarkable in Spain and the Corporate Center.\n\n## OPERATING EXPENSES (MILLIONS OF EUROS)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) At constant exchange rates: -2.6%.\n\nAs a result, the efficiency ratio stood at 46.8% as of December 31, 2020, significantly below the level recorded one year earlier (50.2%), and operating income recorded a year-on-year growth of 11.7%.",

In the comparison with December 2019, the mortgage portfolio registered the greatest reduction in absolute terms, despite the good origination data in several geographical areas.\n- \uf0b7 Non-performing loans were lower than at the end of December of the previous year, despite the increase in the last quarter of the year, mainly due to the entries of non-performing loans in the retail portfolios in Mexico.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits closed December 2020 6.1% above December 2019 balances, strongly supported by the good performance of demand deposits (up 14.0%), where customers have deposited the available liquidity to face the pandemic  and which more than offset the reduction in time deposits.\n- \uf0b7 Off-balance sheet funds recovered in the quarter (up 2.9%) although it continued to show a negative growth rate compared to December 2019 (down 4.5%), mainly due to the unfavorable evolution of the markets during the first quarter of the year.\n- \uf0b7 Regarding intangible assets , the balance sheet figures as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 include the goodwill impairments in the United States registered in the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, with no effect on the tangible net equity, solvency or liquidity of the BBVA Group.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (MILLIONS OF EUROS)\n\n|

        "page_content": "## Solvency\n\n## Capital base\n\nBBVA's fully-loaded CET1 ratio stood at 11.73% at the end of December 2020. From 2021 onwards the BBVA Group sets the target to keep the CET1 fully-loaded ratio between 11.5%-12.0% increasing the distance to the minimum requirement (currently at 8.59%) to 291-341 basis points. At the end of 2020 financial year the CET1 fully-loaded ratio is already within this target management range.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2020, the CET1 fully-loaded ratio stood 21 basis points above the previous quarter. This increase includes a positive impact of +7 basis points due to the execution of the agreement reached with Allianz to jointly boost the non-life insurance business in Spain, excluding the health insurance line. The corresponding amount to \u20ac0.059 (gross) per share as shareholder remuneration allowed by the ECB recommendation has been already deduced from the capital base. This ratio does not include the positive impact of the sale of BBVA USA and other companies in the United States with activities related to said banking business, which, according to the current estimate and using as a  reference the capital level in December 2020, would place the fully-loaded CET1 ratio at 14.58%. Additionally, it does not include the effect from the closing of the BBVA Paraguay sale, which would have a positive impact of approximately +6 basis points and which will be registered in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFurthermore,  the  profit  generated  in  the  period,  excluding  the  gains  generated  by  the  operation  with  Allianz,  has contributed +30 basis points, while the other elements of the capital ratios has contributed to a total net impact of -16 points, being the most significant component the growth in risk-weighted assets, and, conversely, the good market performance recorded in equity instruments measured at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income. It also includes the positive effect on the regulatory deduction of software, following the publication of Delegated Regulation 2020/2176 on December 22 concerning the prudential treatment of software.\n\nFully-loaded additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) stood at 1.89% at the end of December 2020. In this regard, the world's first green CoCo for a financial institution was  issued  in  July  2020  for  \u20ac1,000m,  a  coupon  of  6%  and  with  an  early amortization option from five and a half years, allowing all requirements at this tier to be fulfilled, including those from the tiering of Pillar 2 and therefore the distance to MDA to be increased. Moreover, a CoCo of \u20ac1,500m (coupon of 6.75%) was amortized in February, on the first date of the early amortization option; in January 2021, the early amortization options were implemented for two preferential issuances, issued by BBVA International Preferred and Caixa Sabadell Preferents for 31 million pounds sterling and \u20ac90m respectively; and finally, for a third preferential issuance issued by Caixa Terrassa Societat de Participacions Preferents, the bondholders' meeting has approved its early amortization on January 29, 2021 (versus the amortization option date of August 10, 2021). As of December 31, 2020, these issuances do not form part of the Group's capital adequacy ratios.\n\nThe fully-loaded Tier 2 ratio stood at 2.30% on December 31. Two Tier 2 issuances were issued in 2020: an issuance of \u20ac1,000m in January, with a maturity of 10 years and an amortization option from the fifth year, with a coupon of 1%; and another issuance of 300 million pounds sterling in July, with a maturity of 11 years and with an early amortization option from the sixth year, with a coupon of 3.104%, thereby diversifying the investment base and improving the price compared to an equivalent issuance in euros.\n\nThe phased-in CET1 ratio stood at 12.15% at the end of December 2020, taking into account the transitory effect of the IFRS 9 standard. AT1 stood at 1.89% and Tier 2 at 2.42%, resulting in a total capital adequacy ratio of 16.46%.\n\nRegarding shareholder remuneration , on April 9, 2020, a cash payment was made for a supplementary dividend for the 2019 financial year for the gross amount of \u20ac0.16 per share, according to the approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 13, 2020. This amounted to \u20ac1,067m. Thus, the total dividend for the 2019 financial year amounts to \u20ac0.26 gross per share. This distribution had no impact on the evolution of the capital adequacy ratio since it had already accrued at the end of 2019\n\nBBVA has announced its intention to return in 2021 to its shareholders remuneration policy , communicated through a relevant event on February 1, 2017, consisting of distributing annually between 35% and 40% of the profits resulting of each financial year entirely in cash through two distributions (predictably in October and April and subject to relevant approvals) when the current ECB recommendation applicable on the date of publication of this report is revoked and there are  no  additional  restrictions  or  limitations.

In May 2020, the first issuance of a COVID-19 social bond by a private financial institution in Europe was completed. This is a five-year senior preferred bond, for \u20ac1,000m and a coupon of 0.75%. Finally, in order to optimize the MREL requirement, in September BBVA issued preferred senior debt of USD 2,000m in two tranches, with maturities of three and five years, for USD 1,200m and USD 800m and coupons of 0.875% and 1.125% respectively.\n\nThe Group estimates that, following the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No. 2019/877 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20 (which, among other matters, establishes the MREL in terms of RWAs and new periods for said requirement's transition and implementation), the current structure of shareholders' funds and admissible liabilities enables compliance with the MREL.\n\nIn November 2015 (effective January 1, 2017) BBVA ceased to be included in the list of banks with global systemic importance (Global Systemically Important Banks -G-SIBs-). This list is prepared annually by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) based on a set of quantitative indicators that can be consulted, together with the evaluation methodology, at the link www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/. In November 2020, BBVA, at a consolidated level, was again identified as Another Entity of Systemic Importance (OEIS). As a consequence of the foregoing, the Bank of Spain imposes the obligation to maintain, as a buffer for OEIS during the financial year 2021, Common Equity Tier 1 elements for an amount equal to 0.75% of the total amount of its exposure to risk in the consolidated base.\n\nFinally, the Group's leverage ratio maintained a solid position, at 6.5% fully-loaded (6.7% phased-in). These figures include the effect of the temporary exclusion of certain positions with the central bank provided for in the \"CRR-Quick fix.\"\n\n## Stress testing at BBVA\n\nThe BBVA Group has a Stress Testing Programme (hereinafter, STP) that is part of its risk management framework. This Stress Testing Programme covers the exercises used for BBVA's internal management and those fostered by supervisory authorities (e.g., stress test of the EBA and ECB). However, as the latter usually have a specific framework determined by the supervisor establishing, among other, its frequency, methodology, infrastructure, assumptions to be applied, etc., the STP focuses on the internal stress tests.\n\nSome of the main targets of these internal tests are the following:\n\n- \u25cf Promote a better understanding of the exposures and risks assumed by the Group on its operations, identifying risk factors and scenarios that could jeopardize compliance with the Risk Appetite Framework.",

On the one hand, global tests are carried out impacting all or a large number of geographies where the Group is present and all material risks faced by the Group, regardless of their nature. In addition, tests focused on a specific geographical area or aimed at stressing a specific type of risk are carried out.\n\nThese stress tests must incorporate, among other, the following principles:\n\n- \u25cf The design of global stress testing models, including the criteria adopted, the assessed scope, and the complexity and granularity of the calculations, must be proportional to and consistent with BBVA's risk profile. BBVA's business model and the characteristics of its portfolios must be considered.\n- \u25cf Stress tests assumptions must preserve a sufficient level of prudence and conservatism as not to underestimate the impact of those elements that are difficult to forecast, such as diversification assumptions.\n\nGlobal stress tests are composed by the analysis of scenarios, associated with macroprudential tests (ICAAP, ILAAP and Recovery Plan) and planning processes, sensitivity analyses and reverse stress tests. The latter two are also inputs to complete the analysis of scenarios, as they contribute to the risk scenarios definition process and to the selection of adverse and very adverse scenarios, and, in the sensitivity analysis case, they allow for an agile approximation of the assessment and analysis of scenarios.\n\n| Global stress test                       | Global stress test   | Global stress test                                                                                                                                            | Global stress test                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Stress                                   | Frequency            | Methodology                                                                                                                                                   | Infrastructure and data procurement                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| High-level stress tests -  Sensitivities | Annual               | Sensitivities to fluctuations in the  main macro-financial variables  included in a stress scenario                                                           | -BBVA Research financial forecasts  - Corporate budget database and output of  planning tools  - Sensitivities by type of risk of specialist  departments  - Internal balance sheet, income statement  and regulatory capital base forecasting tool. |\n| Ad-hoc                                   | One-off              | Detailed calculation by specialist  Risk and Finance departments of  the potential impact on fluctuations  of macro-financial variables in a  stress scenario | impacts on the balance sheet and income  statement  - Internal balance sheet, income statement  and regulatory capital base forecasting tool                                                                                                         |\n| Reverse stress test                      | Annual               | Sensitivities to fluctuations in the  main macro-financial variables  included in a stress scenario                                                           | -Idem stress sensitivities                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Group ICAAP & Recovery  Annual           |                      | Detailed methodology of the stress  tests included in the ICAAP                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| EBA stress test                          | One-off              | Regulatory                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n## Stress tests integration into management\n\nThe scenario analysis is integrated into management through the following processes:\n\n- \u25cf Stress test results are incorporated into capital planning processes in order to project capital paths under the proposed periods and scenarios, both from a regulatory (CET1, AT1, T2) and economic (economic solvency ratio) perspective.",

The impact of these scenarios on BBVA's core metrics allow to assess the resilience of the Group to different risk scenarios.\n- \u25cf Based on the severity of the abovementioned results, and the likelihood allocated to each scenario assessed, and considering the risk assessment carried out to identify the main vulnerabilities of BBVA, conclusions are made on the nature and driver of the adverse and very adverse scenarios developed by BBVA Research at the end of each year to be subsequently assessed in the ICAAP and Recovery Plan processes.\n- \u25cf In addition, the severity of certain risk factors is adjusted through these tests, quickly assessing the impact on BBVA's core metrics of different alternative levels for specific variables.\n\nReverse stress tests contribute to determining the severity in the definition of the different scenarios, depending on its use in internal management processes, liquidity and capital self-assessment or Recovery Plan, while allowing the identification of those hypotheses with greater impact on the results of the stress tests and the risk sources to which the entity is more vulnerable.\n\n## Elements of the Global Stress Tests\n\nFive elements are identified in each of the global stress tests: scenarios, models, hypotheses and inputs, tools and impacts/outputs.\n\nThe scenario generation process is described and governed by the \"Rule on the generation of Internal Risk Scenarios\", which is reviewed and approved annually by the Global Risk Management Committee.\n\nStress test models must comply with the general risk strategy established by BBVA's Board, and must be proportional to the level of the equity, borrowed capital and generation of recurrent earnings of the BBVA Group, and must be managed in a prudent and integrated manner throughout the life cycle of the risk models.\n\nAn adequate management framework for risk models requires considering all phases of their life cycle, from the moment a need is identified, it is planned and the development of a model begins, or its modification, to its implementation, use, validation and monitoring.\n\nModel risk management must be based on tools that integrate the models, criteria and management strategies, and that allow decision processes to be automated. It is based on three levels and an internal governance structure that allows adequate mitigation of model risk:\n\n- \u25cf The  first  level  consists  of  owners,  technicians,  users  and  developers,  ensuring  the  existence  of  a  suitable governance framework consistent with the needs of the BBVA Group. The second level consists of Internal Validation and the Risk Internal Control function, while the third level or line of defense consists of Internal Audit.\n- \u25cf With regard to the governance framework of the models, the necessary approval levels are established for each model or modification according to its tiering (categorization of the models according to the relative importance of their use in the management of the BBVA Group), which must also be applied to stress models in order to allow an adequate management on the deployment of the models, as well as the modifications that occur in risk models currently in use.\n\nWith regard to the hypotheses, and regardless of the specific criteria established in each test, they must all meet the following general requirements:\n\n- \u25cf The correlations between risk factors and types of risk must be assessed and stressed, both at an individual level in each entity or business area, as well as at the consolidated level of the BBVA Group, recognizing that in stress situations certain correlations tend to increase, reducing the benefits of the diversification between portfolios and geographies.\n- \u25cf The  non-linear  effects  between  risk  factors  and  stress  parameters  in  very  low  severity  scenarios  must  be considered.",

Specifically, for each one of them, it shows a summary of the income statement and balance sheet, the business activity figures and the most significant ratios.\n\nAt the end of 2020, BBVA Group's business areas reporting structure continued to be the same as the one presented at the end of 2019, although BBVA has reached agreements that, in some cases, could affect that structure. BBVA Group's business areas and the agreements reached in relation to some of them are summarized below:\n\n- \uf0b7 Spain mainly includes the banking and insurance businesses that the Group carries out in this country. In relation to the agreement reached in April 2020 with Allianz to create a bancassurance alliance, by setting up a newly created insurance company, once the authorizations from the competent regulators had been received, on December 14, 2020. BBVA Seguros transferred half plus one share from the aforementioned company to Allianz. The results from this new company are included in this business area.\n- \uf0b7 The United States incorporates the businesses of BBVA USA, including the Group's wholesale business through the New York branch office, the stake in Propel Venture Partners and the broker dealer BBVA Securities Inc business, all of which are excluded from the sale agreement reached with PNC. In relation to said agreement (for more information, see the chapter 'Highlights' of this report), it includes BBVA USA and other companies in the United States with activities related to this banking business. Likewise, in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', the information for this business area is provided for the financial years 2020 and 2019, including the companies subject to the sale agreement, whose closing is subject to obtaining regulatory authorizations from the competent authorities.\n- \uf0b7 Mexico includes banking and insurance businesses in this country, as well as the activity that BBVA Mexico carries out through its branch in Houston.\n- \uf0b7 Turkey reports the activity of the group Garanti BBVA that is mainly carried out in this country and, to a lesser extent, in Romania and the Netherlands.\n- \uf0b7 South America mainly includes banking and insurance activity carried out  in the region.

The information in this business area includes BBVA Paraguay at the end of December 2020 and 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Rest of Eurasia includes the banking business activity carried out in Asia and in Europe, excluding Spain.\n\nThe Corporate Center contains the centralized functions of the Group, including: the costs of the head offices with a corporate function; management of structural exchange rate positions; some equity instrument issuances to ensure an adequate management of the Group's global solvency. It also includes portfolios whose management is not linked to customer  relationships,  such  as  industrial  holdings;  certain  tax  assets  and  liabilities;  funds  due  to  commitments  to employees; goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nThe information by business area is based on units at the lowest level and/or companies that comprise the Group, which are assigned to the different areas according to the main region or company group in which they carry out their activity.\n\nAs usual, in the case of the different business areas in Americas and Turkey, the results applying constant exchange rates are given as well as the year-on-year variations at current exchange rates.",

        "page_content": "## Activity\n\nThe most relevant aspects related to the area's activity throughout 2020 were:\n\n- \uf0b7 Lending activity (performing loans under management) stood higher than at the end of 2019 (up 0.8%). The reduction in mortgage lending and lending to public institutions (down 4.2%) was offset, among others, by higher balances in retail banking (up 11.2%), in SMEs (up 6.5%) and in corporate and investment banking (up 3.3%), which benefited from the facilities guaranteed by the Spanish Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (hereinafter ICO).\n- \uf0b7 With regard to asset quality , the indicators remained stable compared to the previous quarter. As a result, the NPL ratio remained at 4.3% and the coverage ratio at 67%.\n- \uf0b7 Total customer funds grew by 8.1% compared to the close of 2019, partly due to the trend for greater saving, both by companies and by individual customers. This has resulted in an increase in customer deposits under management (up 12.9%), which managed to offset the negative evolution of off-balance sheet funds (down 5.1%) resulting from the unfavorable performance of the markets in 2020.\n\n## Results\n\nSpain generated a cumulative net attributable profit of \u20ac606m in 2020, 56.3% lower than in 2019, mainly due to the increase in impairment on financial assets as a result of the pandemic, meanwhile, operating income increased by 4.7% compared to the previous year.\n\nThe main highlights of the area's income statement are:\n\n- \uf0b7 Net interest income was slightly lower than at the close of 2019 (down 0.4%), affected by the falling rate environment and the change in the financing mix of the companies from long- to short-term.\n- \uf0b7 Net fees and commissions performed well (up 2.9% year-on-year), widely as a result of asset management fees and fees generated by corporate banking operations, which offset exemptions on some products at the worst moments of the pandemic.\n- \uf0b7 NTI decreased (down 27.2% year-on-year), mainly due to performance of the Global Markets area in the last quarter of the year, which offsets the higher gains from ALCO portfolio sales in 2020.\n- \uf0b7 The other operating income and expenses line compares negatively to the previous year (down 74.2%), due to increased contributions to both the Single Resolution Fund and the Deposit Guarantee Fund and the lower contribution of the insurance business. It should also be noted that, once authorization was received from the competent regulators, on December 14, BBVA Seguros transferred to Allianz half plus one share of the company created to jointly develop non-life insurance business, excluding health insurance line.\n- \uf0b7 There  was  a  reduction  in operating  expenses (down  6.6%  year-on-year),  mainly  as  a  result  of  the  costcontainment plans and supported by the reduction in discretionary expenses as a result of the pandemic. Therefore, the efficiency ratio stood at 54.7% compared to 57.5% in 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Impairment on financial assets increased by \u20ac1,029m compared to the previous year, mainly due to the negative impact recorded mainly in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of deterioration in the macroeconomic scenario due to COVID-19, which includes credit provisions for those sectors most affected, in a comparison that is further impacted by portfolio sales made in 2019.

These rates, together with changes at current exchange rates, can be found in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators. In relation to the sale agreement reached by the BBVA Group with PNC (For more information see 'Highlights' section of this report), which includes certain companies of the Group in the United States, the figures and comments of this business area are presented incorporating the companies mentioned at the end of December 2020.\n\n## Activity\n\nThe most relevant aspects related to the area's activity during 2020 were:\n\n- \uf0b7 The lending activity (performing loans under management) showed lower dynamism between October and December (down 3.2%), due to the combined effect of several factors, including the volume of liquidity injected into the system and the use by companies of credit facilities provided during the first and second quarters of the year. In comparison to December 2019, the loan portfolio remains flat, mainly due to the performance of the Corporate and Business Banking segment, which was driven by the Paycheck Protection Program. The rest of the retail portfolio showed reductions in rates of change with respect to the end of 2019, due to the unfavorable impact of the pandemic.\n- \uf0b7 In terms of risk indicators , the NPL ratio showed an upward trend during the year, focused on the most sensitive sectors in the COVID-19 environment and closed at 2.1%. For its part, the NPL coverage ratio stood at 84%, compared to 101% at the end of December 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits under management increased by 13.1% in the year, due to the placement of the increased liquidity made available to customers in demand deposits. This line showed a flat performance in the quarter.\n\n## Results\n\nThe United States generated a net attributable profit of \u20ac429m during 2020, 25.5% less than in the same period of the previous year. The most relevant aspects related to the income statement are summarized below:\n\n- \uf0b7 Net interest income fell by 2.6% year-on-year, affected by the Fed's interest rate cuts, for a total of 225 basis points since the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by the lower financing costs due to the excellent cost of deposits management. This line increased by 2.3% in the quarter, mainly by both the lower expenses and the funding mix improvement.\n- \uf0b7 Net fees and commissions closed with an increase of 5.5% compared to the same period last year, mainly due to commissions generated by the New York branch.\n- \uf0b7 NTI contribution increased (up 31.8% year-on-year) with a favorable evolution in the quarter (up 54.8%), due to the higher results from the Global Markets unit and the stake in Propel.\n- \uf0b7 Operating expenses fell compared to the previous year (down 2.8%), as a result of both the decrease in some discretionary expenses due to the pandemic and the containment plans implemented.\n- \uf0b7 Increase in the impairment on financial assets (up 44.3% year-on-year), explained mainly by the adjustment in the macroeconomic scenario due to the negative effects of COVID-19, mainly registered in the first quarter of 2020, and to higher loan-loss provisions to cover specific customers in the Oil & Gas sector. It should be noted that in the last quarter of 202, this line closed with a release of \u20ac58m, which explains the improvement of the cumulative cost of risk , which stood at 1.18% at the end of December 2020 compared to 1.69 at the end of September.",

These rates, together with changes at current exchange rates, can be found in the attached tables of financial statements and relevant business indicators.\n\n## Activity\n\nThe most relevant aspects related to the area's activity during the year 2020 were:\n\n- \uf0b7 Lending activity (performing loans under management) decreased slightly (down 1.0% year-on-year), due to the economic weakness resulting from the closure of non-essential activities related to the pandemic. The wholesale portfolio fell slightly in 2020 (down 0.7% year-on-year) due to the amortizations related to the credit facilities registered in the first quarter of the year. On the other hand, the retail portfolio registered a decrease compared to December 2019 (down 0.5%), mainly due to the fact that the consumer and credit card portfolios recorded lower balances, affected by the lower economic activity resulting from the pandemic. This was partially offset by a year-on-year increase in the mortgage portfolio (up 7.4%).\n- \uf0b7 As for the asset quality indicators, the NPL ratio stood above the figure at the end of 2019 (up 3.3%), with an increase in the balance of non-performing loans in the consumer, credit cards and mortgage portfolios, mainly related to portfolios that participated in the support programs. For its part, the coverage ratio stood below December 2019 level, at 122%.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits under management increased by 11.8%, supported by the growth of demand deposits that offset the decrease of time deposits, due to the preference of customers to have their balance liquid in an environment of lower interest rates and uncertainty due to the pandemic. Off-balance sheet funds also performed well in 2020 (up 5.9%).\n\n## Results\n\nBBVA Mexico achieved a net attributable profit of \u20ac1,759m in 2020, which is a 25.8% reduction compared to the previous year. This was due to the increase in the impairment on financial assets, generated by additional provisions made during the first half of the 2020, derived from COVID-19. The most relevant aspects related to the income statement are summarized below:\n\n- \uf0b7 Net interest income closed almost in line with the end of 2019 (down 0.7%). The appropriate management and optimization of the net interest income has managed to offset the lower dynamism of the retail portfolio and a reduction of 300 basis points in the benchmark rates throughout 2020. Additionally, this reflects the application of customer support programs during the first half and a change in the portfolio mix, with a higher percentage of wholesale customers for most of 2020 and stood at the end of December at pre-pandemic levels.\n- \uf0b7 Net fees and commissions fell (down 6.6%), mainly as a result of the closure of non-essential activities in Mexico, which caused a lower transactionality with credit cards. Likewise, the lower activity in investment banking and the increase  in  transactions  made  through  digital  channels,  which  do  not  generate  fees  and  commissions  for individual customers, also influenced this decrease.\n- \uf0b7 NTI continued to perform well, with a 55.3% year-on-year growth, mainly derived from the result of the Global Markets unit, as well as greater earnings from foreign exchange operations and capital gains from the ALCO portfolio sales.\n- \uf0b7 The other operating income and expenses line registered a year-on-year decrease of 38.8%, as a result of a greater contribution to the Deposit Guarantee Fund due to the higher volume deposited by customers and a lower performance of the insurance business, as a result of an increase in claims.\n- \uf0b7 Operating expenses closed at similar levels to the previous year (up 0.7%), with a growth that is below the average inflation levels for the year (up 3.4%) reflecting the effort to maintain strict control, despite additional expenses in medical supplies to ensure the health and safety of the employees and customers.\n- \uf0b7 The impairment on financial assets line increased by 45.6%, fundamentally due to the additional provisions caused  by  COVID-19,  mainly  registered  in  the  first  half  of  2020,  which  include  the  deterioration  in  the macroeconomic scenario  compared to the one originally forecasted in early 2020. With regard to the cumulative cost of risk as of December 2020, it stood at 4.02% following the upturn in March.\n- \uf0b7 The provisions and other results line showed an unfavorable comparison at \u20ac-33m compared with a positive result of \u20ac5m in the previous year, and mainly includes higher provisions for contingent liabilities arising from COVID-19.",

These rates, together with changes at current exchange rates, can be observed in the attached tables of the financial statements and relevant business indicators.\n\n## Activity\n\nThe most relevant aspects related to the area's activity during 2020 were:\n\n- \uf0b7 Lending activity (performing loans under management) increased by 25.9% year-to-date mainly driven by a growth in Turkish lira loans (up 33.6%) which was supported by commercial and consumer loans. Foreigncurrency loans (in U.S. dollars) fell during 2020 (down 5.4%).\n- \uf0b7 Lending growth was accelerated in the first half the year favored by the low interest rate environment, yet as the interest rates started to increase its loan growth moderated in the second half of the year. By segments;\n- o Turkish lira commercial loans performed remarkably well year-on-year (up 51.6%) mainly thanks to the Credit Guarantee Fund utilizations and short term commercial lending.\n- o Additionally, retail loans increased (up 22.3%) driven by both consumer loans including mortgages (up 22.6%) and credit cards (up 21.5%), thanks to the recovering economic activity with the steps taken towards new normal in the COVID-19 environment.\n- \uf0b7 In terms of asset quality , the NPL ratio decreased from December 2019 and stood at 6.6%. The NPL coverage ratio increased to 80% as of December 31, 2020 compared to the previous year.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits under management (66% of total liabilities in the area as of December 31, 2020) remained the main source of funding for the balance sheet and increased by 29.8% year-to-date. It is worth mentioning the positive performance of demand deposits which increased by 73.9% year-to-date and now represent 51% of total customer deposits, as well as the off-balance sheet funds which grew by 19.5% during the same period. Foreign currency demand deposit grew by 84.6% year-to-date, with remarkable increases in second and third quarters, mainly due to the dollarization impact and increasing demand towards gold deposits.\n\n## Results\n\nTurkey generated a net attributable profit of \u20ac563m in 2020, 41.0% higher than the same period of the previous year, despite a decrease in the quarter (down -62.6%). The most significant aspects of the year-on-year evolution in the income statement are the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 Net interest income grew (up 25.2%) mainly thanks to good management of customer spreads, higher activity volume and remarkable contribution from inflation-linked bonds.\n- \uf0b7 Net fees and commissions contracted by -9.9% on a year-on-year basis, mainly due to the changes in fees regulation that came into force in March 2020 and lower activity levels due to the impact of COVID-19. With the beginning of the third quarter, this line started to record growth thanks to the recovery of the economic activity with the gradual steps taken towards normalization.\n- \uf0b7 Good performance of the NTI , which contributed \u20ac227m in 2020 compared to \u20ac10m in 2019. This is mainly the result of the good performance of foreign currency positions and trading operations.\n- \uf0b7 Other operating income and expenses increased by 35.8% year-on-year, mainly due to the positive contribution of non-financial activities (renting activity) and higher insurance activity net results.\n- \uf0b7 Operating expenses increased by 7.3%, significantly below the average inflation rate (12.28%), which is also supported by the reduction in some discretionary expenses due to COVID-19. As a result of the growth of the gross income well above the growth of expenses, the efficiency ratio improved 5 percentage points during the year to 28.8%.\n- \uf0b7 Impairment losses on financial assets increased by 25.0% primarily due to higher provisions for specific clients in the commercial portfolio. As a result, the cumulative cost of risk at the end of December stood at 2.13%.\n- \uf0b7 The line provisions and other results closed in 2020 with a loss of \u20ac127m, which is a similar level to the one registered in the previous year, mainly due to provisions for special funds and for contingent liabilities and commitments.",

These rates, together with the changes at current exchange rates, can be found in the attached tables of the financial statements and relevant business indicators.\n\n## Activity and results\n\nThe most relevant aspects related to the area's activity in 2020 were:\n\n- \uf0b7 Lending activity (performing loans under management) was 12.6% higher as of December 31, 2020 compared to the close of the previous year. The performance of the wholesale portfolio stands out (up 20.3% year-on-year), due to the greater drawdown of credit facilities by companies in response to the situation generated by the COVID19 pandemic. The retail portfolio closed up compared to the end of 2019 (up 5.1%) following the upturn in the quarter (up 1.9%), mainly due to the evolution of credit cards and consumer loans (up 4.3% collectively). In terms of asset quality , the non-performing loan ratio stood at 4.4% while the NPL coverage ratio stood at 110%.\n- \uf0b7 On the funding side, the performance has been boosted by the measures taken by the different central banks to ensure liquidity in the respective financial systems in the region. As a result, deposits from customers under management increased by 23.3% throughout the year, mainly due to the evolution of demand deposits. Likewise, off-balance sheet funds grew by 20.3% throughout the year.\n\nSouth America generated a cumulative net attributable profit of \u20ac446m in 2020, representing a year-on-year decline of 22.6% (down 38.2% at current exchange rates), mainly due to the increase in the impairment on financial assets in the first half of 2020 caused by the COVID-19 crisis. The cumulative  impact  of  inflation  in  Argentina  on  the  area's  net attributable profit in 2020 stood at a loss of around \u20ac104m, compared to a cumulative loss of \u20ac98m at the end of December 2019.\n\nThe most notable aspects of the cumulative evolution of the income statement as of December 2020 are summarized below:\n\n- \uf0b7 Net interest income continued to grow at constant exchange rates (up 0.9%). At current exchange rates, the devaluation of the main currencies in the region weakened this positive performance.\n- \uf0b7 Decreased contribution from NTI (down 12.8% at constant exchange rates, down 29.3% at current exchange rates). This line includes the annual valuation in the last quarter of 2020 of the Bank's stake in Prisma Medios de Pago S.A. (hereinafter Prisma), the outcome of which was more positive than the 2019 annual valuation, in a comparison that also includes the capital  gains in the first quarter of 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Operating expenses (up 2.8%) increased significantly below the inflation rate in the region.",

Throughout the quarter, retail portfolios showed higher growth than wholesale portfolios as a result of lower activity caused by the pandemic. Greater credit card and consumer finance dynamism was also observed. There was a decrease in the NPL ratio, which stood at 1.8% as of December 31, 2020, from 3.4% at the end of December 2019, due to the reduction in non-performing loans. The NPL coverage ratio increased to 241%.\n- \uf0b7 On the total customers funds side, available liquidity meant that deposits from customers under management increased by 62.5% in 2020, with growth in both demand deposits and time deposits, the latter was favored by minimum returns on deposits in pesos established by the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina. Off-balance sheet funds also increased significantly.\n- \uf0b7 Net  attributable profit stood  at  \u20ac89m,  with  recurrent  revenues  performing  well  (up  8.0%)  and  a  greater contribution as a result of the annual valuation on the remaining stake in Prisma. The year-on-year comparison is affected by the positive effect of the sale of the stake in Prisma and the increased need for impairment on financial assets in 2019, due to the rating downgrade and the situation in the country at the time.\n\n## Colombia\n\n- \uf0b7 Lending activity grew by 4.0% in 2020 due to the performance of retail portfolios (up 5.1% year-on-year), particularly consumer and mortgages, the latter supported by government incentives for non-social housing. In terms of asset quality, the NPL ratio and NPL coverage ratio improved to 5.2% and 113% respectively at the close of December 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Deposits from customers under management increased by 9.3% in 2020, driven by growth in demand deposits. Off-balance sheet funds continued their recovery after the withdrawals seen at the end of the first quarter of the year and closed 29.0% higher than the one reached at the end of December 2019. In the quarter, the search for more profitable investment alternatives by customers, in line with the bank's strategy of reducing financial costs, meant a reduction in deposits from customers (down 0.9%).\n- \uf0b7 Net attributable profit stood at \u20ac165m, with a year-on-year decrease of 28.9%. The strength of operating income is notable, which increased by 6.2% in 2020 thanks to higher income generation from net interest income and NTI, although there was a negative impact from the higher loan-loss provisioning due to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## Peru\n\n- \uf0b7 Lending activity was 20.1% higher than at the end of the 2019 financial year, mainly driven by the wholesale portfolio, as a result of the distribution of funds from the Plan Reactiva , which more than offset the decline still seen in credit cards as a result of the lower activity due to the pandemic. In terms of asset quality, as of December 31, 2020, an increase was recorded in the NPL ratio, which stood at 4.5%, due to the deterioration of certain refinanced loans, as well as other assets in the commercial, SMEs and retail portfolio segments. For its part, the NPL coverage ratio stood at 101%, higher than at the end of December 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits under management increased by 29.4% during 2020, mainly due to the 53.4% growth in demand deposits driven by legislative measures that allowed pension plan participants to withdraw part of their funds as a relief measure to cope with the pandemic. Off-balance sheet funds increased by 40.9%.\n- \uf0b7 Net interest income fell compared to the previous year, due to the pressure on interest rates caused by the drop in official rates and government-backed loans at preferential rates, which are in addition to other customer relief measures such as interest-free deferral of repayments on credit cards. Net fees and commissions grew slightly (up 0.5%), influenced by reduced activity as a result of the pandemic, the temporary elimination of certain fees and commissions as a measure to support customers, and the increased use of digital channels. The upturn in operating expenses in the last quarter caused a growth in this line (up 1.1%) in the year, but below the inflation growth  (up  2%).  Greater  impairment  on  financial  assets  was  observed  in  the  quarter  as  a  result  of  rating adjustments, which were combined with provisions made mainly in the first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and resulted in this line increasing by 70.2%. As a result, net attributable profit stood at \u20ac110m, 41.8% lower than in 2019.",

The above is explained by both the amortizations made during the second half of the year, as customers did not have to use all the liquidity initially available to cope with the situation generated by COVID-19, and by the reopening of the wholesale funding markets in the third quarter of 2020, as a funding alternative.\n- \uf0b7 Credit risk indicators remained stable compared to the end of 2019: the NPL ratio and NPL coverage ratio closed at 1.1% and 100%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Customer deposits under management fell by 2.8%, due to the decrease in time deposits.\n- \uf0b7 In terms of results , double-digit increase of 16.1% year-on-year in the most recurring revenues due to the positive performance of both net interest income (up 22.4% year-on-year) and net fees and commissions (up 8.2% year-on-year), supported by CIB activity.\n- \uf0b7 The NTI line increased (up 4.4% year-on-year) due to the good performance of customer activity and favorable management of market volatility.\n- \uf0b7 Reduction of operating expenses (down 2.7% year-on-year).\n- \uf0b7 The line of impairment on financial assets registered a release of \u20ac10m in the last quarter of the year and closed the year at \u20ac-38m, well above the \u20ac-4m recorded 12 months earlier, mainly as a consequence of the deterioration of specific customers in the wholesale portfolio. As a result, the cumulative cost of risk of the area at the end of the year stood at 0.18%.\n- \uf0b7 As a result, the area's cumulative net attributable profit at the end of December 2020 was \u20ac137m (up 7.6% year-on-year).",

This attributable loss also includes the result of corporate operations for the net capital gain, of \u20ac304m, recorded in the last quarter of 2020 due to the materialization of the agreement with Allianz. For its part, 2019 reflected the goodwill impairment in the United States that amounted to \u20ac1,318m euros at the net attributable loss level, mainly due to the evolution of interest rates in the country and the slowdown in the economy in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Corporate Center's net attributable loss , excluding the goodwill impairment in the United States and the result of corporate operations in 2020, stood at \u20ac-856m, 28.6% better than in 2019, equally excluding the goodwill impairment in the United States.\n\nThe most relevant aspects of the income statement evolution are:\n\n- \uf0b7 The net interest income increased by 36.0% due to the lower financing costs.\n- \uf0b7 The NTI recorded \u20ac104m, mainly from gains in foreign-exchange rate hedging, which compares very positively to the \u20ac-54m registered in 2019.\n- \uf0b7 Other operating income and expenses include mainly the dividends from Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., as well as the income from the consolidated companies accounted for by the equity method.\n- \uf0b7 Containment of the operating expenses , which decreased by 14.3% year-on-year, both for personnel expenses (mainly variable remuneration) and for general expenses.",

This model allows the Group to carry out its activity within the risk management and control strategy and policy defined by the corporate bodies of BBVA and to adapt itself to a changing economic and regulatory environment, facing this management at a global level and aligned to the circumstances at all times.\n\nThe Model, for which the Group's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible and that must be updated or reviewed at least annually, is fully applied in the Group and it comprises the following basic elements:\n\n- \uf0b7 Governance and Organization\n- \uf0b7 Risk Appetite Framework\n- \uf0b7 Assessment, Monitoring and Reporting\n- \uf0b7 Infrastructure.\n\nThe Group promotes the development of a risk culture that ensures a consistent application of the Model in the Group, and that guarantees that the risks function is understood and internalized at all levels of the organization.\n\n## Governance and Organization\n\nThe risk governance model in the BBVA Group is characterized by a special involvement of its corporate bodies, both in setting the risk strategy and in monitoring and supervising its implementation on an ongoing basis.\n\nThus, and as explained below, the corporate bodies are responsible for approving the risk strategy and the general policies for the different types of risks. Global Risk Management (GRM) & Regulation and Internal Control (including, among other areas, Non-Financial Risks) are the functions responsible for its implementation and development, with the appropriate reporting to corporate bodies.\n\nResponsibility for day-to-day management of risks falls on business and corporate areas, the activities of which adhere to the general policies, regulation, infrastructures and controls that, based on the framework set by corporate bodies, are defined by Global Risk Management and Regulation & Internal Control in their corresponding areas of responsibility.\n\nTo carry out this work adequately, the financial risks function in the BBVA Group (GRM) has been set up as a single, global function independent from commercial areas.\n\nThe head of the risks function at an executive level, the Group's Chief Risk Officer (or CRO), is appointed by the Board of Directors as a member of its senior management, and reports directly on the development of the corresponding functions to the corporate bodies. The Chief Risk Officer, for the best fulfillment of the functions, is supported by a structure consisting of cross-cutting risk units in the corporate area and specific risk units in the Group's geographical and/or business areas.\n\nIn addition, and with regard to internal control and non-financial risks, the Group has a Regulation & Internal Control area independent from the rest of units and whose head (Head of Regulation & Internal Control) is also appointed by the Board of Directors of BBVA and reports directly to corporate bodies on the performance of its functions. This area is responsible for proposing and implementing non-financial risks policies and the Internal Control Model of the Group and it is composed by, among other, the Non-Financial Risks, Regulatory Compliance and Risk Internal Control units.\n\nThe Risk Internal Control unit, within the Regulation & Internal Control area and, therefore, independent from the financial risks function (GRM), acts as a control unit for the activities carried out by GRM. In this regard, and without prejudice to the functions performed in this regard by the Internal Audit area, Risk Internal Control checks that the regulatory framework, processes and established measures are sufficient and appropriate for each type of financial risk. It also monitors its implementation  and  operation,  and  confirms  that  those  decisions  taken  by  GRM  are  taken  independently  from  the business lines and, in particular, that there's an adequate segregation of functions between units.\n\nGovernance and organizational structure are basic pillars for ensuring an effective risk management and control. This section summarizes the roles and responsibilities of the corporate bodies in the risks area, of the Group's Chief Risk Officer and, in general, of the risks function, its interrelation and the group of committees, in addition to the Risk Internal Control unit.",

For this purpose, a coordinated work scheme between these corporate bodies has been established.\n\nIn  terms  of  risks,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  reserved  those  powers  referred  to  determining  the  risk  control  and management policy and the supervision and control of its implementation.\n\nIn addition, and for an adequate performance of its duties, the Board of Directors is assisted by the Risk and Compliance Committee ('CRC'), on the issues detailed below, and by the Executive Committee ('CDP'), which is focused on the strategy, finance and business functions of the Group, for the purposes of which it monitors the risks of the Group.\n\nThe involvement of the corporate bodies of BBVA in the control and management of the risks of the Group is detailed below:\n\n- \uf0b7 Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the risk strategy of the Group and, in this role, it determines the risks management and control policy, through the following documents:\n\n- o The Risk Appetite Framework of the Group, which includes in the one hand the risk appetite statement of the Group, that is, the general principles governing the risk strategy of the Group and its target profile; and, on the other hand, and based on the above mentioned risk appetite statement, a set of quantitative metrics (core metrics, and their corresponding statements, and by type of risk metrics), reflecting the risk profile of the Group;\n- o The framework of management policies of the different types of risk to which the Bank is, or could be, exposed. They contain the basic lines for a consistent management and control of risks throughout the Group, and consistent with the Risk Appetite Framework and the Model; and\n- o The model.\n\nAll of the above in coordination with the rest of prospective-strategic decisions of the Bank, which includes the Strategic Plan, the Annual Budget, the Capital Plan and the Liquidity & Funding Plan, in addition to the rest of management objectives, whose approval is a responsibility of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to defining the risk strategy, the Board of Directors, in the performance of its risks monitoring, management and control tasks, also monitors the evolution of the risks of the Group and of each main business and/or  geographical  area,  ensuring  compliance  with  the  Risk  Appetite  Framework  of  the  Group;  and  also supervising the internal information and control systems.\n\nFor the development of all these functions, the Board of Directors is supported by the CRC and the CDP, which are responsible for the functions detailed below.\n\n## \uf0b7 Risk and Compliance Committee\n\nThe CRC is, according to its own charter, composed of non-executive directors and its main purpose is to assist the Board of Directors on the establishment and monitoring of the risk control and management policy of the Group.\n\nFor this purpose, it assists the Board of Directors in a variety of risk control and monitoring areas, in addition to its analysis functions, based on the strategic pillars established by the Board of Directors and the CDP, the proposals on the risk management, control and strategy of the Group, which are particularly specified in the Risk Appetite Framework and in this Model. After the analysis, the Risk Appetite Framework and Model proposal is submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration and, where appropriate, approval purposes.\n\nIn addition, the CRC proposes, in a manner consistent with the Risk Appetite Framework of the Group approved by the Board of Directors, the management and control policies of the different risks of the Group, and supervises the internal control and information systems.\n\nWith regard to the monitoring of the evolution of the risks of the Group and their degree of compliance with the Risk Appetite Framework and defined general policies, and without prejudice to the monitoring task carried out by the Board of Directors and the CDP, the CRC carries out monitoring and control tasks with greater frequency and receives information with a sufficient granularity to achieve an adequate performance of its duties.\n\nThe CRC also analyzes all measures planned to mitigate the impact of all identified risks, should they materialize, which must be implemented by the CDP or the Board of Directors, as the case may be.\n\nThe CRC also monitors the procedures, tools and measurement indicators of those risks established at a Group level in order to have a comprehensive view of the risks of BBVA and its Group, and monitors compliance with the regulation and supervisory requirements in terms of risks.",

This committee is the main executive committee for those risks within its competence, and its main purpose is the development of the strategies, policies, regulation and infrastructure required for identifying, assessing, measuring and managing those material risks within its scope of responsibility faced by the Group. This committee is composed by the Chief Risk Officer, who chairs the meetings, and the heads of the GRM corporate disciplines of the Risk Management Group, the four most relevant geographical risk areas, CIB, South America and Risk Internal Control. The purpose of the GRMC is to propose and challenge, among other issues, the internal regulatory framework of GRM and the infrastructures required to identify, assess, measure and manage the risks faced by the Group in carrying out its businesses and to approve risk limits.\n\nThe GRMC carries out its functions assisted by various support committees which include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Global  Credit  Risk  Management  Committee:  It  is  responsible  for  analyzing  and  decision-making  related  to wholesale credit risk admission.\n- \uf0b7 Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee: its purpose is the analysis and decision-making regarding the admission of wholesale credit risk of certain customer segments of the BBVA Group.\n- \uf0b7 Work Out Committee: its purpose is to be informed about decisions taken under the delegation framework regarding risk proposals concerning clients on Watch List and clients classified as NPL or written-off of certain customer segments of the BBVA Group, as well the sanction of proposals regarding entries, exits and changes of Watch List, entries and exits in non-performing unlikely to pay and turns to written off, as well as the approval of other proposals that must be seen in this Committee according to the established thresholds and criteria.\n- \uf0b7 Asset Allocation Committee: The executive authority responsible for managing the limits by asset class for credit risk, equities and real estate not for own use and by business area and at group level established in the Asset Allocation limits planning exercise, which aims to achieve an optimal combination and composition of portfolios under the restrictions imposed by the Risk Appetite Framework ('RAF'), which allows maximizing the riskadjusted return on regulatory and economic capital when appropriate. Additionally, it takes into account the concentration and credit quality objectives of the portfolio, as well as the prospects and strategic needs of the Bank.\n- \uf0b7 Risk Models Management Committee: It ensures an appropriate decision-making process regarding the planning, development, implementation, use, validation and monitoring of the models required to achieve an appropriate management of the Model Risk in the BBVA Group.\n- \uf0b7 Global Markets Risk Unit Global Committee: It is responsible for formalizing, supervising and communicating the monitoring of trading desk risk in all the Global Markets business units, as well as coordinating and approving GMRU key decisions activity, and developing and proposing to GRMC the corporate regulation of the unit.\n- \uf0b7 Retail Credit Risk Committee: It ensures for the analysis, discussion and decision support on all issues regarding the retail credit risk management that impact or potentially do in the practices, processes and corporate metrics established in the Policies, Rules and Operating Frameworks.\n- \uf0b7 Asset Management Global Risk Steering Committee: its purpose is to develop and coordinate the strategies, policies, procedures, and infrastructure necessary to identify, assess, measure and manage the material risks facing the bank in the operation of businesses linked to BBVA Asset Management.\n- \uf0b7 Global Insurance Risk Committee: its purpose is to serve as the basis for the development of the risk management model and the monitoring of the insurance companies of the BBVA Group by developing and coordinating the strategies, policies, procedures and infrastructure necessary to identify, evaluate, measure, monitor and manage the material risks faced by insurance companies.\n- \uf0b7 COPOR: its purpose is to analyze and make decision in relation to the operations of the various geographies in which Global Markets is present.\n\nAdditionally, the Corporate Committee for Admission of Operational Risk and Product Governance (CCAROyGP) aims to ensure the adequate evaluation of initiatives with significant operational risk (new business, product, outsourcing, process transformation,  new  systems,  etc.)  from  the  perspective  of  operational  risk  and  approval  of  the  proposed  control environment\n\n## Risk units of the corporate area and the business/geographical areas\n\nThe risks function is comprised of risk units from the corporate area, which carry out cross-cutting functions, and of risk units of the geographical/business areas.\n\n- \uf0b7 The risk units of the corporate area develop and submit to the Group's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) the different elements required to define the proposal for the Group's Risk Appetite Framework, the general policies, regulation and global infrastructures within the operating framework approved by corporate bodies; they ensure their application and report directly or through the Group's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to the corporate bodies of BBVA.

In addition, they ensure the application of general policies and rules with the necessary adaptations, when applicable, to local requirements, providing the appropriate infrastructures for risk management and control purposes, within the global risk infrastructure framework defined by the corporate areas, and reporting to the corresponding corporate bodies and senior management, as applicable. With regard to Non-financial risks, which are integrated in the Regulation & Internal Control area, the local risk units will coordinate, with the unit responsible for those risks, the development of the elements that should be integrated into the local Risk Appetite Framework.\n\nThus, the local risk units work with the risk units of the corporate area with the aim of adapting themselves to the risk strategy at Group level and pooling all the information required to monitor the evolution of their risks.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the risks function has a decision-making process supported by a structure of committees, and also a top-level committee, the GRMC, whose composition and functions are described in section 'Corporate Bodies of BBVA'.\n\nEach geographical and/or business area has its own risk management committee(s), with objectives and contents similar to those of the corporate area. These committees perform their duties consistently and in line with general risk policies and corporate rules, and its decisions are reflected in the corresponding minutes.\n\nUnder this organizational scheme, the risks function ensures the integration and application throughout the Group of the risk strategy, the regulatory framework, the infrastructures and standardized risk controls. It also benefits from the knowledge and proximity to customers in each geographical and/or business area, and conveys the corporate risk culture to the Group's different levels. Moreover, this organization enables the risks function to conduct and report to the corporate bodies an integrated monitoring and control of the risks of the entire Group.\n\n## Chief Risk Officers of geographical and/or business areas\n\nThe risks function is cross-cutting, i.e. it is present in all of the Group's geographical and/or business areas through specific risk units. Each of these units is headed by a Chief Risk Officer for the geographical and/or business area who, within the relevant scope of responsibility, carries out risk management and control functions and is responsible for applying the Model, the general policies and corporate rules approved at Group level in a consistent manner, adapting them if necessary to local requirements and with the subsequent reporting to local corporate bodies.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officers of the geographical and/or business areas have functional reporting to the Group's Chief Risk Officer and hierarchical reporting to the head of their geographical and/or business area. This dual reporting system aims to ensure the independence of the local risks function from the operating functions and enable its alignment with the Group's general policies and goals related to risks.\n\n## Risk Internal Control\n\nThe Group has a specific Risk Internal Control unit, within the Regulation & Internal Control area, that, among other tasks, independently  challenges  and  control  the  regulation  and  governance  structure  in  terms  of  financial  risks  and  its implementation and deployment in GRM, in addition to the challenge of the development and implementation of financial risks control and management processes. In addition, it is also responsible for validating the risk models.\n\nFor this purpose, it has 3 subunits: RIC-Processes, Risks Technical Secretariat and Risk Internal Validation.\n\n- \uf0b7 RIC-Processes. It is responsible for challenging an appropriate development of the functions of GRM units, and for reviewing that the functioning of financial risks management and control processes is appropriate and in line with the corresponding regulation, identifying potential opportunities for improvement and contributing to the design of the action plans to be implemented by the responsible units. In addition, it is the Risk Control Specialist (RCS)  in  the  Group's  Internal  Control  Model  and,  therefore,  establishes  the  frameworks  for  mitigating  and controlling the risks for which it is responsible.\n- \uf0b7 Risks Technical Secretariat. It is responsible for the definition, design and management of the principles, policies, criteria and processes through which the regulatory risk framework is developed, processed, reported and disclosed  to  the  countries;  and  for  the  coordination,  monitoring  and  assessment  of  its  consistency  and completeness. In addition, it coordinates the definition and structure of the most relevant GRM Committees, and monitors their proper functioning, in order to ensure that all risk decisions are taken through an adequate governance and structure, ensuring their traceability. It also provides to the CRC the technical support required in terms of financial risks for a better performance of its functions.\n- \uf0b7 Risk Internal Validation. It is responsible for validating the risks models. In this regard, it effectively challenges the relevant models used to manage and control the risks faced by the Group, as an independent third party from those developing or using the models in order to ensure its accuracy, robustness and stability. This review process is not restricted to the approval process, or to the introduction of changes in the models, but it is a plan to make a regular assessment of those models, with the subsequent issue of recommendations and actions to mitigate identified weaknesses.",

In order to comply with the control activity within its scope. Risk Internal Control is member of GRM's top-level committees (sometimes even assuming the Secretariat role), independently challenging the decisions that may be taken and, specifically, the decisions related to the definition and application of internal risk regulation.\n\nFurthermore, the control activity is developed within a homogeneous methodological framework at a Group level, covering the entire life cycle of financial risks management and carried out under a critical and analytical approach.\n\nThe Risk Internal Control team reports the results of its control function to the corresponding heads and teams, promoting the implementation of corrective measures and submitting these assessments and the resolution commitments in a transparent manner to the established levels.\n\nLastly, and notwithstanding the control responsibility that GRM teams have in the first instance, Risk Internal Control teams promote a control culture in GRM, conveying the importance of having robust processes.\n\n## Risk Appetite Framework\n\n## Elements and development\n\nThe Group's Risk Appetite Framework approved by the corporate bodies determines the risks and the risk level that the Group is willing to assume to achieve its business objectives considering the organic evolution of business. They are expressed  in  terms  of  solvency,  liquidity  and  funding  and  profitability  and  income  recurrence,  which  are  reviewed periodically and in case of material changes in the business strategy or relevant corporate transactions.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework is expressed through the following elements:\n\n- \uf0b7\n- Risk Appetite Statement: sets out the general principles of the Group's risk strategy and the target risk profile: The BBVA Group develops a multichannel and responsible universal banking business model, based on values, committed  to  sustainable  development  and  centered  on  our  customers'  needs,  focusing  on  operational excellence and the preservation of adequate security and business continuity.\n- BBVA intends to achieve these goals while maintaining a moderate risk profile, so the risk model established aims at ensuring a robust financial position, facilitating its commitment with sustainability and obtaining a sound riskadjusted profitability throughout the cycle, as the best way to face adverse environments without jeopardizing its strategies .\n- Risk Management at BBVA is based on prudent management, an integral view of all risks, a portfolio diversification by geography, asset class and client segment and keeping a long-term relationship with the client, accompanying him in the transition to a sustainable future, to guarantee profitable growth and generation of recurring value.\n- \uf0b7 Statements and core metrics: based on the appetite statement, statements are established that specify the general principles of risk management in terms of solvency, liquidity and funding and profitability and income recurrence. Moreover, the core metrics reflect, in quantitative terms, the principles and the target risk profile set out in the Risk Appetite statement. Each core metric has three thresholds ranging from usual management of the businesses to higher levels of impairment:\n- o Management reference: reference that determines a comfortable management level for the Group.\n- o Maximum appetite: maximum level of risk that the Group is willing to accept in its ordinary activity.\n- o Maximum  capacity:  maximum  risk  level  that  the  Group  could  assume  which,  for  some  metrics,  is associated with regulatory requirements.\n- \uf0b7 Statements and metrics by type of risk: based on the core metrics and their thresholds for each type of risk, statements are established that set out the general management principles for that risk and a number of metrics are determined, whose observance enables compliance with the core metrics and the Group's Risk Appetite statement. These metrics have a maximum risk appetite threshold.\n\nIn addition to this Framework, there is a level of management limits that is defined and managed by the areas responsible for the management of each type of risk in the development of the structure of metrics by type of risk, in order to ensure that the early management of risks complies with that structure and, in general, with the established Risk Appetite Framework.",

        "page_content": "Each significant geographical area (e.g those representing more than 1% of the assets or operating income of the BBVA Group) has its own Risk Appetite framework, consisting of its local Risk Appetite statement, core metrics and statements, metrics and statements by type of risk, which must be consistent with those set at the Group level, but adapted to their own reality. These are approved by the corresponding corporate bodies of each entity. This Appetite Framework is deployed through a structure of limits consistent with the above.\n\nThe  corporate  risks  area  works  with  the  various  geographical  and/or  business  areas  to  define  their  Risk  Appetite Framework, so that it is coordinated with, and integrated into, the Group's Risk Appetite Framework, making sure that its profile is in line with the one defined. Moreover, and for the purposes of monitoring at local level, the Chief Risks Officer of the  geographical  and/or  business  area  regularly  reports  on  the  evolution  of  the  metrics  of  the  Local  Risk  Appetite Framework to the corporate bodies, as well as to the relevant top-level local committees, following a scheme similar to that of the Group, in accordance with its own corporate governance systems.\n\nWithin the issuing process of the Risk Appetite Framework, Risk Internal Control carries out, within the scope of the GRM area (the GRMC), the effective challenge of the Framework proposal prior to its escalation to corporate bodies, which is also documented, and it is extended to the approval of the management limits under which it is developed, also supervising its adequate approval and extension to the different entities of the Group.\n\n## Monitoring of the Risk Appetite Framework and management of breaches\n\nSo that corporate bodies can develop the risk functions of the Group, the heads of risks at an executive level will regularly report (or more frequently in the case of the CRC, within its scope of responsibility) on the evolution of the metrics of the Risk Appetite Framework of the Group, with the sufficient granularity and detail, in order to check the degree of compliance of the risks strategy set out in the Risk Appetite Framework of the Group approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nIf, through the monitoring of the metrics and supervision of the Risk Appetite Framework by the executive areas, a relevant deviation or breach of the maximum appetite levels of the metrics is identified, that situation must be reported and, where applicable, the corresponding corrective measures must be submitted to the CRC.\n\nAfter the relevant review by the CRC, the deviation must be reported to the CDP -as part of its role in the monitoring of the evolution of the risk profile of the Group- and to the Board of Directors, which will be responsible, when applicable, for implementing  the  corresponding  executive  measures,  including  the  modification  of  any  metric  of  the  Risk  Appetite Framework. For this purpose, the CRC will submit to the corresponding corporate bodies all the information received and the proposals prepared by the executive areas, together with its own analysis.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, once the information has been analyzed and the proposal of corrective measures has been reviewed by the CRC, the CDP may adopt, on grounds of urgency and under the terms established by law, measures corresponding the Board of Directors, but always reporting those measures to the Board of Directors in the first meeting held after the implementation for ratification purposes.\n\nIn any case, an appropriate monitoring process will be established -with a greater information frequency and granularity, if  required-  regarding  the  evolution  of  the  breached  or  deviated  metric,  and  the  implementation  of  the  corrective measures, until it has been completely redressed, with the corresponding reporting to corporate bodies, in accordance with its risks monitoring, supervision and control functions.\n\n## Integration of the Risk Appetite Framework into the management\n\nThe transfer of the Risk Appetite Framework to ordinary management is underpinned by three basic elements:\n\n- 1. The existence of a consistent regulatory framework: the corporate risks area defines and proposes the general policies within its scope of action, and develops the additional internal regulation required for the development of those policies and the operating frameworks on the basis of which risk decisions must be adopted within the Group. The approval of the general policies for all types of risks is a responsibility of the corporate bodies of BBVA, while the rest of regulation is defined at an executive level according to the framework of competences applicable at any given time. The Risks units of the geographical and/or business areas comply with this regulation and performing, where necessary, the relevant adaptation to local requirements, in order to have a decision-making process that is appropriate at local level and aligned with the Group's policies.\n- 2. Risk planning, which ensures the integration into the management of the Risk Appetite Framework through a cascade process established to set limits adjusted to the target risk profile. The Risks units of the corporate area and of the geographical and/or business areas are responsible for ensuring the alignment of this process with the Group's  Risk  Appetite  Framework  in  terms  of  solvency,  liquidity  and  funding  and  profitability  and  income recurrence.\n- 3.

This function ensures that the model has a dynamic and proactive vision to enable compliance with the Risk Appetite Framework approved by the Board of Directors, even in adverse scenarios.\n\nThis process is integrated in the activity of the Risk units, both of the corporate area and in the geographical and/or business units, together with the units specialized in non-financial risks and reputational risk within the Regulation & Internal Control and Communications & Responsible Business areas respectively, in order to generate a comprehensive and single view of the risk profile of the Group.\n\nThis process is developed through the following phases:\n\n- \uf0b7 Monitoring of the identified risk factors that can compromise the performance of the Group or of the geographical and/or business areas in relation to the defined risk thresholds.\n- \uf0b7 Assessment of the impact of the materialization of the risk factors on the metrics that define the Risk Appetite Framework based on different scenarios, including stress testing scenarios.\n- \uf0b7 Response to unwanted situations and proposals for redressing measures to the corresponding levels, in order to enable a dynamic management of the situation, even before it takes place.\n- \uf0b7 Monitoring  the  Group's  risk  profile  and  the  identified  risk  factors,  through  internal,  competitor  and  market indicators, among others, to anticipate their future development.\n- \uf0b7 Reporting:  complete  and  reliable  information  on  the  evolution  of  risks  to  corporate  bodies  and  senior management, with the frequency and completeness appropriate to the nature, significance and complexity of the reported risks. The principle of transparency governs all the risk information reporting process.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nFor the implementation of the Model, the Group has the resources required for an effective management and supervision of risks and for achieving its goals. In this regard, the Group's risks function:\n\n- \uf0b7 Has the appropriate human resources in terms of number, ability, knowledge and experience. The profile of resources will evolve over time based on the specific needs of the GRM and Regulation & Internal Control areas, always with a high analytical and quantitative capacity as the main feature in the profile of those resources. Likewise, the corresponding units of the geographical and/or business areas ensure they have sufficient means from the resources, structures and tools perspective in order to achieve a risk management process aligned with the corporate model.\n- \uf0b7 Develops the appropriate methodologies and models for the measurement and management of the different risk profiles, and the assessment of the capital required to take those risks.\n- \uf0b7 Has the technological systems required to: support the Risk Appetite Framework in its broadest definition; calculate and measure the variables and specific data of the risk function; support risk management according to this Model; and provide an environment for storing and using the data required for risk management purposes and reporting to supervisory bodies.\n- \uf0b7 Promotes an adequate data governance to ensure solid quality standards in the processes aligned with the relevant internal regulation.\n\nWithin the risk functions, both the profiles and the infrastructure and data shall have a global and consistent approach.\n\nThe human resources among the countries must be equivalent, ensuring a consistent operation of the risk function within the Group. However, they will be distinguished from those of the corporate area, as the latter will be more focused on the conceptualization of appetite frameworks, operating frameworks, the definition of the regulatory framework and the development of models, among other tasks.\n\nAs in the case of the human resources, technological platforms must be global, thus enabling the implementation of the Risk Appetite Framework and the standardized management of the risk life cycle among all countries.\n\nThe corporate area is responsible for deciding on the platforms and for defining the knowledge and roles of the human resources. It is also responsible for defining risk data governance.\n\nThe foregoing is reported to the corporate bodies of BBVA so they can ensure that the Group has the appropriate means, systems, structures and resources.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\nThe local authorities of the countries in which the Group operates have initiated economic support measures including the granting of relief measures in terms of temporary payments deferrals for customers affected by the pandemic, as well as the granting of loans , especially to companies and SMEs, with public guarantees. The amount of current payment deferrals granted by the Group was \u20ac6,803m at December 31, 2020.\n\nThese measures are supported by the rules issued by the authorities of the geographical areas where the Group operates as well by certain industry agreements and should help to ease the temporary liquidity needs of the customers. The classification of the customers' credit quality and the calculation of the expected credit loss, once the credit quality of those customers have been reviewed under the new circumstances, will depend on the effectiveness of these relief measures. In any case, the incorporation of public guarantees is considered to be a mitigating factor in the estimation of the expected credit losses.\n\nFor the purposes of classifying exposures based on their credit risk, the Group has maintained a rigorous application of IFRS9 at the time of the granting of the moratoriums and has reinforced the procedures to monitor credit risk both during their validity and upon their expiration. In this sense, additional indicators have been introduced to identify the significant increase in risk that may have occurred in some operations or a set of them and, where appropriate, proceed to its classification in the corresponding risk stage.\n\nLikewise the indications provided by the European Banking Authority (EBA) have been taken into account to not consider refinancing the moratoriums that meet a series of requirements, without prejudice to keeping the exposure classified in the corresponding risk stage or its consideration as refinancing if it was previously so qualified.\n\nIn relation to the payment deferrals for customers affected by the pandemic, and with the goal of mitigating as much as possible the impact of these measures in the Group, due to the high concentration of its maturities over time, BBVA has worked on an anticipation plan based on some basic lines of action, supported by the following pillars:\n\n- \uf0b7 Diagnose: portfolio segmentation.\n- \uf0b7 Strategy: value offering and action protocols by segment.\n- \uf0b7 Operationality: equipment and channel sizing.\n\nThese lines of action have made it possible to advance the management actions to be carried out with customers according to their level of involvement and local legislation.\n\n## Calculation of expected losses due to credit risk\n\nTo respond to the circumstances generated by the global COVID-19 pandemic in the macroeconomic environment, characterized by a high level of uncertainty regarding its intensity, duration and speed of recovery, forward-looking information has been updated in the IFRS 9 models to incorporate the best information available at the date of publication of this report. The estimation of the expected losses has been calculated for the different geographical areas in which the Group operates, with the best information available for each of them, considering both the macroeconomic perspectives and the effects on specific portfolios, sectors or specific accredited. The scenarios used consider the various economic measures that have been announced by governments as well as monetary, supervisory and macroprudential authorities around the world. However, the final magnitude of the impact of this pandemic on the Group's business, financial situation and results, which could be material, will depend on future and uncertain events, including the intensity and persistence over time of the consequences derived from the pandemic in the different geographical areas in which the Group operates.\n\nThe expected  losses calculated  according  to  the  methodology  provided  by  the  Group,  including  macroeconomic projections,  have  been  supplemented  with  additional  amounts  that  have  been  considered  necessary  to  collect  the particular characteristics of specific accredited sectors or portfolios and that may not be identified in the general process. Of the complementary amounts recognized throughout the year, at the end of 2020 there remains a \u20ac244m pending allocation to specific accredited portfolios, mainly in Spain and to a lesser extent in the United States.\n\nThese lines show the evolution of the exposure of corporate banking clients to the sectors that have been considered most vulnerable in the COVID-19 pandemic environment:",

In the last quarter of the year, this metric remained almost flat, in both current and constant exchange rates, as the growth in Spain, Turkey and South America was offset by a contraction in the United States and Rest of Eurasia. Mexico's growth in the last quarter was driven by the evolution of the exchange rate.\n- \uf0b7 The balance of non-performing loans was lower than at the end of December of the previous year, although it increased in the last quarter of the year (up 2.7% at current exchange rates, up 2.9% at constant exchange rates), mainly because of the entries into default of the retail portfolios in Mexico.\n- \uf0b7 The NPL ratio stood at 4.0% at the end of December, above the end of the previous year and the end of the third quarter.\n- \uf0b7 Loan-loss provisions fell by 1.9% in the quarter. Compared to December 2019, they were 6.1% higher due to the provisions made in the first half of the year as a result of the negative effects of COVID-19.\n- \uf0b7 The NPL coverage ratio closed at 81% from 85% in the previous quarter, due to the increase in the balance of non-performing loans and with a significant improvement of 488 basis points compared to the end of 2019.\n\nThe cumulative cost of risk at December 31, 2020 stood at 1.51%, compared to a cumulative 1.69% at the end of September  and  following  the  strong  growth  registered  in  March  related  to  the  significant  increase  in  the  loan  loss allowances in the first quarter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(1) Preliminary data.\n\n## Market risk\n\nFor futher information, see Note 7.4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Structural risks\n\n## Structural interest rate risk\n\nThe aim of managing interest-rate risk is to limit the sensitivity of the balance sheets to interest rate fluctuations. BBVA carries out this work through an internal procedure following the guidelines established by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which measures the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value to determine the potential impact of a range of scenarios on the Group's different balance sheets.\n\nThe model is based on assumptions intended to realistically mimic the behavior of the balance sheet. Assumptions regarding the behavior of accounts with no explicit maturity and prepayment estimates are of particular relevance. These assumptions are reviewed and adapted at least once a year to take into account any changes in behavior.\n\nAt the aggregate level, BBVA continues to maintain a moderate risk profile, in accordance with the established target, showing a net interest income position which would be favored by an increase in interest rates. The effective management of structural balance sheet risk has allowed it to mitigate the negative impact of the downward trend in interest rates and the volatility experienced as a result of the effects of COVID-19, and is reflected in the soundness and recurrence of net interest income.\n\nBy area, the main features are:\n\n- \uf0b7 Spain and the United States have balance sheets characterized by a high proportion of variable-rate loans in the loan portfolio (basically mortgages in Spain and corporate lending in both countries) and liability composed mainly of customer deposits. The ALCO portfolios act as hedging for the bank's balance sheet, mitigating its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. The profile of both balance sheets has remained stable during 2020. In Spain the sensitivity of the net interest income has increased in the year due the higher volume of sensitive balances (liquid short-term assets) as a result of the liquidity generated by the balance and the additional TILTRO III financing, as well as the maturity of a part of the mortgage portfolio coverage.\n\nIn addition, following a slightly downward trend at the start of the year for European benchmark interest rates (Euribor), there was a rebound of around 20-30 basis points (depending on the maturity) in mid-March. This was",

        "page_content": "a result of an adjustment in expectations after the ECB held the marginal deposit facility rate at -0.50% when the market had discounted a fall, and an increase in the required credit spread in the light of the COVID-19 crisis. However, since May, Euribor has fallen between -35 and -45 basis points, reaching record lows, mainly due to the easing of credit spreads and the ECB's monetary stimulus measures. In the United States, base rates (Libor) have maintained a downward trend during the year (falling around 165 basis points in the main terms), in line with the Fed's rate cuts in the first quarter of the year.\n\n- \uf0b7 Mexico continues to show stability between the balance sheet items benchmarked at fixed and variable interest rates. In terms of assets that are most sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, the corporate portfolio stands out, while consumer loans and mortgages are mostly at a fixed rate. The ALCO portfolio is used to neutralize the longer duration of customer deposits. The sensitivity of net interest income continues to be limited and stable in 2020, considering the new interest rate scenario that emerged in March, with a downward trend in benchmark rates throughout 2020 compared to expectations at the beginning of the year. In this regard, the monetary policy rate at the end of December stood at 4.25%, which has meant a reduction of -300 basis points during 2020.\n- \uf0b7 In Turkey, the interest-rate risk (broken down into Turkish lira and US dollars) is limited. In terms of assets, the sensitivity of lending, which is mostly fixed-rate, but with relatively short maturities, and the ALCO portfolio, including inflation-linked bonds, are balanced by the sensitivity of deposits on the liability side, which are repriced in the short term. The sensitivity of net interest income on the currency balance sheets increased due to the establishment of the asset ratio in the second quarter of 2020. In relation to the benchmark rates, the strong increase since August reverted the decreases of the previous quarters, ending the year with an increase of 500 basis points above the level of December 2019.\n- \uf0b7 In South America, the risk profile for interest rates remains low as most countries in the area have a fixed/variable composition and maturities that are very similar for assets and liabilities, with a low and small variations net interest income sensitivity throughout 2020. In addition, in balance sheets with several currencies, interest-rate risk is managed for each of the currencies, showing a very low level of risk. The measures promoted by central banks have helped the downward trend of the benchmark interest rates (-250 basis points in Colombia and -200 basis points in Peru during the year) at minimum levels below that expected at the beginning of the year.\n\n## Structural foreign exchange rate risk\n\nForeign exchange risk management of BBVA's long-term investments, principally stemming from its overseas franchises, aims to preserve the Group's capital adequacy ratio and ensure the stability of its income statement.\n\nBBVA has maintained its policy of actively hedging its main investments in emerging markets, covering on average between 30% and 50% of annual earnings and around 70% of the CET1 capital ratio excess. Based on this policy, the sensitivity of the CET1 ratio to a depreciation of 10% against the euro of the main emerging-market currencies stood at -5 basis points for the Mexican peso and -2 basis points for the Turkish lira. In the case of the US dollar, the sensitivity to a depreciation of 10% against the euro is approximately +9 basis points. The transactional foreign currency risk associated with the sale of the subsidiary in the United States is managed in a way to minimize negative impacts at the level of net profit and capital ratio (after sales). At the end of December, the coverage level for expected earnings for 2021 was at levels close to 50% in the case of Turkey, 40% for Mexico, 50% for Peru and 40% for Colombia.\n\n## Structural equity risk\n\nFor futher information, see Note 7.3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nManagement of liquidity and funding at BBVA aims to finance the recurring growth of the banking business at suitable maturities and costs, using a wide range of instruments that provide access to a large number of alternative sources of financing. In this context, it is important to notice that, given the nature of BBVA's business, the funding of lending activity is fundamentally carried out through the use of stable customer funds.\n\nDue to its subsidiary-based management model, BBVA is one of the few major European banks that follows the Multiple Point  of  Entry  (MPE)  resolution strategy :  the  parent  company  sets  the  liquidity  policies,  but  the  subsidiaries  are selfsufficient and responsible for managing their own liquidity (taking deposits or accessing the market with their own rating), without fund transfers or financing occurring between either the parent company and the subsidiaries or between the different subsidiaries. This strategy limits the spread of a liquidity crisis among the Group's different areas, and ensures that the cost of liquidity and financing is correctly reflected in the price formation process.\n\nDuring of 2020, liquidity conditions have remained comfortable across all countries in which the BBVA Group operates. Since the beginning of March, the global crisis caused by COVID-19 had a significant impact on financial markets. The initial effects of this crisis on the Group's balance sheets have fundamentally been felt through increased drawdown of credit facilities by wholesale customers in the face of worsening funding conditions in the markets, with no significant effect in the retail world. These drawdowns were largely returned throughout the following quarters. Given this initial uncertainty, the different central banks provided a joint response through specific measures and programs to facilitate the funding of",

For the calculation of this ratio, it is assumed that there is no transfer of liquidity among subsidiaries; i.e. no kind of excess liquidity levels in foreign subsidiaries are considered in the calculation of the consolidated ratio. When considering these excess liquidity levels, the BBVA Group's LCR would stand at 185%.\n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), defined as the ratio between the amount of stable funding available and the amount of stable funding required, is one of the Basel Committee's essential reforms, whose transposition under CRR II will become effective in June 2021, and requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. This ratio should be at least 100% at all times. At the BBVA Group, the NSFR, calculated according to the Basel requirements, stood at 127% as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThese ratios in the main geographical areas in which the Group operates are shown below:\n\n## LCR AND NSFR RATIOS (PERCETANGE. 31-12-20)\n\n|      |   Eurozone  (1) | The United States   |   Mexico |   Turkey | South America      |\n|------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|----------|--------------------|\n| LCR  |             173 | 144  (2)            |      196 |      183 | All countries >100 |\n| NSFR |             121 | 126                 |      138 |      154 | All countries >100 |\n\n- (1) Perimeter: Spain + Rest of Eurasia.\n- (2) Calculated according to local regulation (Fed Modified LCR).\n\nThe most relevant aspects related to the main geographical areas are the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 In the Eurozone, BBVA's liquidity situation remains comfortable with a high quality ample liquidity buffer that has been strengthened during the year as a result of the management measures implemented and the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB) which have led to an increase of liquidity in the system. In the wake of the COVID19 crisis, there was initially a higher demand for lending through increased drawdowns of credit facilities by the Corporate & Investment Banking wholesale business, which was also accompanied by growth in customer deposits.  Subsequently,  in  the  following  of  the  year  there  were  partial  repayments  of  the  aforementioned drawdowns,  while  deposits  have  continued  to  grow.  In  addition,  it  is  important  to  mention  the  measures implemented by the ECB in order to face the crisis, which have included different actions, such as: the expansion of asset purchase programs, in particular through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) for \u20ac750,000m in a first tranche announced in March extended with a second tranche for a further \u20ac600,000m until June 2021, or until the ECB considers the crisis to be over and with a third tranche for \u20ac500,000m until at least the end of March 2022 ; the coordinated action by Central Banks for the provision of US dollars; a package of temporary  collateral  easing  measures  affecting  eligibility  for  use  in  funding  operations  and  the  easing  and improvement of the conditions for the TLTRO III program and the creation of the new program of long-term , refinancing operations without specific emergency objective  (Pandemic  emergency longer-term refinancing operations, PELTRO). In March and June, BBVA took part in the TLTRO III liquidity windows (with an amount drawn at the end of December of \u20ac35,032m) due to its favorable cost and maturity conditions, and repaid the corresponding part of the TLTRO II program.\n- \uf0b7 BBVA USA also maintains a strong liquidity buffer consisting of high-quality assets, which has been strengthened during 2020. As in the Eurozone, there was an increase in loans toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to a rise in the drawing down of credit facilities by wholesale customers and the US government's stimulus program for SMEs and self-employed workers (Paycheck Protection Program). In the following quarters, there were repayments that have now brought the credit facility usage percentage back to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, deposits have grown very significantly during the year, reflecting the high level of liquidity in the system as a result of the stimulus programs established by the government and the Fed.\n- \uf0b7 At BBVA Mexico, the liquidity position has remained strong during 2020. Following the COVID-19 crisis, the lending gap increased in the first quarter of the year due to increased drawdowns of credit facilities. However in the second quarter, the success of the commercial actions and the normalization of lending growth led to a reduction in the lending gap compared to December 2019 levels. During the third and fourth quarter of the year, the reduction in the lending gap has been exacerbated, driven by a reduction in loans and a growth in deposits, despite  the  progressive  ending  of  the  commercial  policies  implemented  to  attract  deposits,  creating  a comfortable position in liquidity ratios. Regarding the measures taken by Banxico over the year, in addition to reducing the monetary policy rate, it announced a reduction in the Monetary Regulation Deposit and the start of auctions of US dollars with credit institutions (swap line with the Fed) in which BBVA Mexico participated in April, in the amount of USD 1,250m, partially renewing that position from June to September for USD 700m. Likewise, it has participated in the Banxico 7 and 8 facilities (measures to direct funds to micro, small and medium-sized companies, as well as individuals affected by the pandemic).",

        "page_content": "- \uf0b7 At Garanti BBVA, the liquidity situation remained comfortable during the 2020, with a contraction of loans and a growth of deposits in foreign currency, as well as higher growth of loans than deposits in local currency. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, an increase in collateral requirements was seen due to the credit risk in Turkey (Credit Default Swaps) to cover derivative valuations and wholesale funding. Moreover, Turkey's regulator established the so-called asset ratio to encourage banks, to increase lending and avoid the accumulation of deposits, which caused an increase in the lending gap. This was covered by the bank's excess liquidity. Later, the asset ratio requirement was reduced in the third quarter (from 100% to 90%) and it was eliminated in December. In the face of contractionary policies, The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) increased the reserve requirement rates, and during the second semester of the year the cost of lending and the base rate has progressively increased. In addition, the Credit Default Swap returns to previous levels to COVID-19 pandemic. With all this, during the year, Garanti BBVA has shown a good liquidity buffer.\n- \uf0b7 In South America, an adequate liquidity situation prevails throughout the region, helped by the support of various central banks and governments which, in order to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, have acted by implementing measures to stimulate economic activity and provide greater liquidity in financial systems. In Argentina, US dollar deposit outflows in the banking system slowed down to show growth in the fourth quarter, although BBVA Argentina continues to maintain a strong liquidity position with comfortable liquidity ratios. In Colombia, after the adjustment of the excess liquidity carried out in the third quarter by reducing wholesale deposits, a comfortable liquidity position has been maintained, as well as BBVA Per\u00fa, where the liquidity position has been reinforced by the increase in the volume of deposits during the second quarter, as well as by the funds from the Central Bank's support programs.\n\nThe wholesale funding markets in which the Group operates, after two months of great stability at the start of 2020, were followed by a strong correction as a result of the crisis of COVID-19 and the limited access to the primary market. This situation has been stabilizing, marked by the evolution of the pandemic, the vaccines development, various geopolitical events and the actions of Central Banks. Secondary market levels ended the year reaching January 2020 levels, while primary market volumes have been reactivating, reducing the issue premiums.\n\nThe main transactions carried out by the companies that form part of the BBVA Group in 2020 are:\n\n- \uf0b7 During the first quarter of 2020, BBVA, S.A. carried out two issuances of senior non-preferred debt by a total approximate amount of \u20ac1,400m and a Tier 2 issuance totaling \u20ac1,000m. In the second quarter of 2020, it issued preferred senior debt totaling \u20ac1,000m as a COVID-19 social bond, the first of its kind from a private financial institution in Europe. In the third quarter, it carried out three public issues: the first is the first green convertible bond (CoCo) ever issued by a financial institution worldwide in the amount of \u20ac1,000m; a subordinated Tier 2 debt issuance in Pounds sterling, for the amount of 300m; and the third is a preferred debt issue filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in two tranches over three and five years, in a total amount of USD 2,000m. On the other hand, in February 2020 a CoCo of \u20ac1,500m was amortized and in January 2020 three preferential  issues  were  amortized  in  advance  (For  more  information  about  these  transactions,  see  the \"Solvency\" chapter of this report).\n- \uf0b7 In Mexico, a local senior issuance was successfully carried out in February for MXN 15,000m (\u20ac614m) in three tranches. Two tranches in Mexican pesos over 3 and 5 years (one for MXN 7,123m at the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE) 28 + 5 basis points and another for MXN 6,000m at TIIE 28 + 15 basis points, respectively), and another tranche in US dollars over 3 years (USD 100m at 3-month Libor + 49 basis points). The purpose of this issuance was to bring forward the refinancing of maturities in the year, taking advantage of the good market conditions, as well as to strengthen the liquidity situation by offsetting the seasonal outflows of deposits in the early months of the year. In September, it carried out an international issuance of unsecured 5-year senior debt in an amount of USD 500m at a rate of 1.875%, which represents the lowest ever for a financial institution in Mexico and the lowest of any of Latin America's private financial institutions. This issue is the second under BBVA Mexico's Global Issuer Program, which has a value of up to USD 10,000m.\n- \uf0b7 In Turkey, the issues have not been fully renewed by the foreign currency gap reduction in 2020 Garanti BBVA carried out a Tier 2 issuance for TRY 750m in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Garanti BBVA partially renewed a syndicated loan of USD 699m by issuing the first green syndicated loan for a bank indexed to sustainability criteria, and in whose renovation the EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and the IFC (International Finance Corporation) participated.

This is carried out through the establishment of mitigation plans, monitoring and the development of control frameworks aimed at minimizing resulting economic and reputational losses and their impact on the recurrent generation of results, and contributing the increase the quality, safety and availability of the provided service. Operational risk management is integrated into the global risk management structure of the BBVA Group.\n\nThis section addresses general aspects of operational risk management as the main component of non-financial risks. However, sections devoted to conduct and compliance risk and to cybersecurity risk management are also included in the non-financial information report.\n\n## Operational risk management principles\n\nThe BBVA Group is committed to preferably applying advanced operational risk management models, regardless of the capital calculation regulatory model applicable at the time. Operational risk management at the BBVA Group shall:\n\n- \uf0b7 Be aligned with the Risk Appetite Framework ratified by the BBVA Board of Directors.\n- \uf0b7 Address BBVA's management needs in terms of compliance with legislation, regulations and industry standards, as well as the decisions or positioning of BBVA's corporate bodies.\n- \uf0b7 Anticipate the potential operational risk to which the Group may be exposed as a result of the creation or modification of products, activities, processes or systems, as well as decisions regarding the outsourcing or hiring of services, and establish mechanisms to assess and mitigate risk to a reasonable extent prior to implementation, as well as review the same on a regular basis.\n- \uf0b7 Establish methodologies and procedures to enable regular reassessment of the significant operational risk to which the Group is exposed, in order to adopt appropriate mitigation measures in each case, once the identified risk and the cost of mitigation (cost/benefit analysis) have been considered, while safeguarding the Group's solvency at all times.\n- \uf0b7 Promote the implementation of mechanisms that support careful monitoring of all sources of operational risk and the effectiveness of mitigation and control environments, fostering proactive risk management.\n- \uf0b7 Examine the causes of any operational events suffered by the Group and establish means to prevent the same, provided that the cost/benefit analysis so recommends. To this end, procedures must be in place to evaluate operational events and mechanisms and to record the operational losses that may be caused by the same.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate key public events that have generated operational risk losses at other institutions in the financial sector and support, where appropriate, the implementation of measures as required to prevent them from occurring at the Group.\n- \uf0b7 Identify, analyze and attempt to quantify events with a low probability of occurrence and a high impact, which by their exceptional nature may not be included in the loss database; or if they are, feature with impacts that are not very representative for the purpose of valuing possible mitigation measures.\n- \uf0b7 Have an effective system of governance in place, where the functions and responsibilities of the corporate areas and bodies involved in operational risk management are clearly defined.\n- \uf0b7 Operational risk management must be performed in coordination with management of other risk, taking into consideration credit or market events that may have an operational origin.\n\n## Operational risk control and management model\n\nThe operational risk management cycle at BBVA is similar to the one implemented for the rest of risks. Its elements are:\n\n## Operational risk management parameters\n\nOperational risk forms part of the risk appetite framework of the Group and includes three types of metrics and limits:\n\n- \uf0b7 Economic capital calculated with the operational losses database of the Group, considering the corresponding diversification effects and the additional estimation of potential and emerging risks through stress scenarios designed for the main types of risks. The economic capital is regularly calculated for the main banks of the Group and simulation capabilities are available to anticipate the impact of changes on the risk profile or new potential events.\n- \uf0b7 ORI metrics (Operational Risk Indicator: operational risk losses vs. gross income) broken down by geography, business area and type of risk.",

These metrics make it possible to intensify the anticipatory management of risk and objectify the appetite to different sources.\n\n## Operational risk admission\n\nThe main purposes of the operational risk admission phase are the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 To  anticipate  potential  operational  risk  to  which  the  Group may be exposed due to the release of new, or modification  of  existing,  products,  activities,  processes  or  systems,  as  well  as  purchasing  decisions  (e.g. outsourcing).\n- \uf0b7 To ensure that implementation and the roll out of initiatives is only performed once appropriate mitigation measures have been taken in each case, including risk assurance where deemed appropriate.\n\nThe Corporate Non-Financial Risk Management Policy sets out the specific operational risk admission framework through different committees, at a corporate and Business Area level, that follow a delegation structure based on the risk level of proposed initiatives.\n\n## Operational risk monitoring\n\nThe purpose of this phase is to check that the target operational risk profile of the Group is within the authorized limits. Operational risk monitoring considers 2 scopes:\n\n- \uf0b7 Monitoring the operational risk admission process, oriented towards checking that accepted risks levels are within the limits and that defined controls are effective.\n- \uf0b7 Monitoring the operational risk \"stock\" associated with processes. This is done by carrying out a periodic reevaluation in order to generate and maintain an updated map of the relevant operational risks in each Area, and evaluate  the  adequacy  of  the  monitoring  and  mitigation  environment  for  said  risks.  This  promotes  the implementation of action plans to redirect the weaknesses detected.\n\nThis process is supported by a corporate Governance, Risk & Compliance tool that monitors OR at a local level and its aggregation at a corporate level.\n\nIn addition, and in line with the best practices and recommendations provided by the BIS, BBVA has procedures to collect the operational losses occurred in the different entities of the Group and in other financial groups, with the appropriate level of detail to carry out an effective analysis that provides useful information for management purposes and to contrast the consistency of the Group's operational risk map. To that end, a corporate tool of the Group is used.\n\nThe  Group  ensures  continuous  monitoring  by  each  Area  of  the  due  functioning  and  effectiveness  of  the  control environment, taking into consideration management indicators established for the Area, any events and losses that have occurred, as well as the results of actions taken by the second line of defense, the internal audit unit, supervisors or external auditors.\n\n## Operational risk mitigation\n\nThe Group promotes the proactive mitigation of the financial risks to which it is exposed and which are identified in the monitoring activities.\n\nIn order to rollout common monitoring and anticipated mitigation practices throughout the Group, several cross-sectional plans are being promoted related to focuses from events, lived by the Group or by the industry, self-assessments and recommendations from auditors and supervisors in different geographies, thereby analyzing the best practices and fostering comprehensive action plans to strengthen and standardize the control environment.\n\n## Insurance of operational risk\n\nInsurance is one of the possible options for managing the operational risk to which the Group is exposed, and mainly has two potential purposes:\n\n- \uf0b7 Coverage of extreme situations linked to recurrent events that are difficult to mitigate or can only be partially mitigated by other means.\n- \uf0b7 Coverage of nonrecurrent events that could have significant financial impact, if they occurred.\n\nThe Group has a general framework that regulates this area, and allows systematizing risk assurance decisions, aligning insurance coverage with the risks to which the Group is exposed and reinforcing governance in the decision-making process of arranging insurance policies.\n\n## Operational risk control model",

The aim is to support rapid decision-making with foresight, for the mitigation or assumption of the main risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach geography has a Corporate Assurance Committee chaired by the Country Manager and whose main functions are:\n\n- \uf0b7 Monitoring the changes in the non-financial risks and their alignment with the defined strategies and policies and the risk appetite.\n- \uf0b7 Analyzing and assessing controls and measures established to mitigate the impact of the risks identified, should they materialize.\n- \uf0b7 Making decisions about the proposals for risk taking that are conveyed by the working groups or that arise in the Committee itself\n- \uf0b7 Promoting transparency by promoting the proactive participation of the three lines of defense in discharging their responsibilities and the rest of the organization in this area\n\nAt the holding company level there is a Global Corporate Assurance Committee, chaired by the Group's Chief Executive Officer. Its main functions are similar to those already described but applicable to the most important issues that are escalated from the geographies and the holding company areas.\n\nThe business and support areas have an Internal Control and Operational Risk Committee, the purpose of which is to ensure the due implementation of the operational risk management model within its scope of action and drive active management of such risk, taking mitigation decisions when control weaknesses are identified and monitoring the same.\n\nAdditionally, the Non-Financial Risk unit periodically reports the status of the management of non-financial risks in the Group to the Board's Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\n## Reputational risk\n\n## Reputational risk assessment\n\nSince 2016, BBVA disposes of a reputational risk assessment methodology. Through this methodology, the Bank defines and reviews regularly a map in which it prioritizes the reputational risks which have to be faced and the set of action plans to mitigate them. The prioritization is done based on two variables: the impact on the perception of the stakeholders and the strength of BBVA facing the risk.\n\nThis exercise is performed annually in all geographical areas where the Group is operating and the business areas CIB and AM EMEA. As a result of the assessment carried out in 2019, 24 mitigation action plans have been conducted during 2020.\n\nThe guide for the Annual Reputational Risk Assessment of the stock was updated by the end of 2019 and was implemented in all Banks of BBVA Group during 2020. Likewise, it is planned to elaborate in 2020 a guide for the Annual Reputational Risk Assessment in the process of the Admission of Non-financial Risks.",

Those  Committees  are responsible for the initial identification of potential reputational risks, and, where appropriate, an assessment of the foreseeable impact on BBVA's reputation.\n\n## Reporting of the Reputational Risk\n\nThe results of the annual assessment of the Reputational Risk are reported in every geographical area at the appropriate governance level and, at Group level, reported to the Global Corporate Assurance Committee and, since 2020, to the Executive Committee.\n\n## Risk factors\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BBVA has processes in place for identifying risks and analyzing scenarios that enable the Group to manage risks in a dynamic and proactive way.\n\nThe risk identification processes are forward looking to ensure the identification of emerging risks and take into account the concerns of both the business areas, which are close to the reality of the different geographical areas, and the corporate areas and senior management.\n\nRisks  are  captured  and  measured  consistently  using  the  methodologies  deemed  appropriate  in  each  case.  Their measurement includes the design and application of scenario analyses and stress testing and considers the controls to which the risks are subjected.\n\nAs part of this process, a forward projection of the risk appetite framework variables in stress scenarios is conducted in order to identify possible deviations from the established thresholds. If any such deviations are detected, appropriate measures are taken to keep the variables within the target risk profile.\n\nTo this extent, there are a number of emerging risks that could affect the Group's business trends. These risks are described in the following main sections:\n\n## Risk related to new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the world economy and economic activity and conditions in the countries in which the Group operates, leading many of them to economic recession in 2020 and relatively moderate activity growth in 2021, so that probably only from 2022 will the GDP levels observed before the crisis recover. Among other challenges, these countries are experiencing widespread increases in unemployment levels and falls in production, while public debt has increased significantly due to support and spending measures implemented by government authorities. In addition, there is an increase in defaults on debts by both companies and individuals, volatility in financial markets, including exchange rates, and falls in the value of assets and investments, all of which have had a negative impact on the Group's in the year 2020 and is expected to continue to affect in the future.\n\nFurthermore, the Group may be affected by the measures adopted by regulatory authorities in the banking sector, including but not limited to, the recent reductions in reference interest rates, the relaxation of prudential requirements, the suspension of dividend payments, the adoption of payment deferrals measures for bank clients (such as those included in Royal Decree Law 11/2020 in Spain, as well as in the CECA-AEB agreement to which BBVA has adhered and which, among other things, allows loan debtors to extend maturities and defer interest payments) and facilities to grant credit through a line of guarantees or public guarantees, especially to companies and the self-employed individuals, as well as any changes in the financial asset purchase programs.\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has experienced a decline in its activity. For example, the granting of new loans to individuals has significantly decreased since the beginning of mobility restriction measures approved in certain countries in which the Group operates. In addition, the Group faces several risks, such as a greater risk of impairment of the value of its assets (including financial instruments valued at fair value, which may undergo significant fluctuations) and of the securities held for liquidity reasons, a possible significant increase in non-performing loans and a negative impact on the cost of the Group's financing and its access to financing (especially in an environment where credit ratings are affected).\n\nFurthermore, in several of the countries in which the Group operates, including Spain, the Group has temporarily closed a significant number of its offices and reduced opening hours to the public, and the teams that provide central services have been working remotely. Although these measures have been gradually reversed due to the continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear how long it will take until normal operations can fully resume. On the other hand, the pandemic could adversely affect the business and operations of third parties that provide critical services to the Group and, in particular, the higher demand and / or lower availability of certain resources could in some cases make it more difficult to maintain the service levels. In addition, the generalization of remote work has increased the risks related to cybersecurity, as the use of non-corporate networks has increased.",

        "page_content": "As a result of the above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on the Group's results and capital base. During the first half of the year the main accumulated impacts were:\n\n- \u25cf an  increase  in  the  cost  of  risk  associated  with  the  lending  activity,  mainly  due  to  the  deterioration  of  the macroeconomic environment, which has had a negative impact of \u20ac2,009 million in the Group (including the initial adverse effect of the payment deferral) and provisions for credit risk and contingent commitments for \u20ac95 million, (see Notes 7.2, 46 and 47 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Stemens); and\n- \u25cf a deterioration in the goodwill of the Group's subsidiary in the United States, mainly due to the deterioration of the macroeconomic scenario in the United States, which has had a net negative impact of \u20ac2,084 million on the Group's attributed profit in this period (although this impact does not affect the tangible book value, nor the solvency or the liquidity of the Group) (see Notes 18.1 and 49 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nFrom June 30, 2020 on, and as a consequence of the general deterioration of the global macroeconomic scenario, its specific effects cannot be isolated, affecting all of the Group's consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks\n\nThe Global economy is being severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply, demand and financial factors caused an unprecedented fall in GDP in the first half of 2020. Supported by strong fiscal and monetary policy measures, as well as greater control over the spread of the virus, global growth rebounded more than expected in the third quarter, before slowing down in the fourth, when the number of infections rose again in many regions, mainly in the United States and Europe. As for 2021, the unfavorable evolution of the pandemic is expected to adversely affect activity in the short term, while new fiscal and monetary stimuli, as well as the administering of coronavirus vaccines, are expected to support recovery from mid-year onwards.\n\nFollowing the massive fiscal and monetary stimuli to support economic activity and reduce financial tensions, government debt has increased across the board and interest rates have been cut, and are now at historical low levels. Additional countercyclical measures may be required. Similarly, a significant reduction in current stimuli is not expected, at least until the recovery takes hold.\n\nTensions in the financial markets have moderated rapidly since the end of March 2020, following the decisive actions taken by the main central banks and the fiscal packages announced in many countries. In recent months, the markets have shown relative stability and, at certain times, risk-taking movements. Likewise, progress related to the development of COVID-19 vaccines and prospects for economic recovery should pave the way for financial volatility to persist at relatively low levels in general going forward.\n\nBBVA Research estimates that global GDP contracted by around 2.6% in 2020 and will expand by around 5.3% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022. Activity will recover gradually and heterogeneously among countries. Various epidemiological, financial and geopolitical factors are also contributing to the persistent exceptionally high uncertainty.\n\nWith regard to the banking system, in an environment in which much of the economic activity has been at a stand still for several months, the services provided have played an essential role, basically for two reasons: firstly, the banks have ensured the proper functioning of collections and payments for households and companies, thereby contributing to the maintenance of economic activity; secondly, the granting of new lending or the renewal of existing lending has reduced the impact of the economic slowdown on household and business income. The support provided by the banks over the months of lockdown and public guarantees have been essential in softening the impact of the crisis on companies' liquidity and solvency, meaning that banking has become its main source of funding for most companies.\n\nIn terms of profitability, European and Spanish banking have deteriorated, primarily because many entities recorded high provisions for impairment on financial assets in the first two quarters of 2020 as a result of the worsening macroeconomic environment following the pandemic outbreak. Pre-pandemic profitability levels remained far from the levels prior to the previous financial crisis. This is in addition to the accumulation of capital since the previous crisis and the very low interest rate environment that we have been experiencing for several years. Nevertheless, the banks are facing this situation from a healthy position and with solvency that has been constantly increasing since the 2008 crisis, with reinforced capital and liquidity buffers and, therefore, with a greater lending capacity.\n\nThe BBVA Group has a General Risk Management and Control Model appropriate to its business model, its organization, the countries in which it operates and its corporate governance system, which allows it to carry out its activity within the framework of the risk management and control strategy and policy defined by the corporate bodies. This model deals with management in global form adapting itself to the circumstances of each moment. This Model is applied integrally in the Group.\n\nIn  this  sense,  from  the  beginning  of  the  crisis,  the  BBVA  Group  implemented  specific  measures  for  the  proper management of these associated risks, establishing different global initiatives that define the risk management strategy during the crisis, with common action protocols that should be implemented and adapted, when needed, to local needs.",

        "page_content": "The BBVA Group global risk unit - Global Risk Management (hereinafter, 'GRM') - has increased the frequency and intensity of the evaluation of potential impacts on the different groups and clients, in order to prevent their future evolution, and carried out appropriate adjustments and reclassifications, reinforcing its processes, governance and teams in Holding and countries to act in a coordinated manner, focusing priority on crisis management.\n\nOver the past year, it has been found that the pandemic has a  global impact ,  affecting to a greater extent the sectors in which there is a high level of human interaction (transport, especially air transport, leisure, especially hotel establishments, as well as industries and activities dependent on them), regardless of the regional area in question. For this reason, the Bank's  risk  management  has  clearly  been  intensified  by  sectorial  vectors  over  other  conditioning  factors  such  as geographic.\n\n## Regulatory and reputational risks\n\nFinancial institutions are exposed to a complex and ever-changing regulatory environment defined by governments and regulators. This can affect their ability to grow and the capacity of certain businesses to develop, and result in stricter liquidity and capital requirements with lower profitability ratios. The Group constantly monitors changes in the regulatory framework that allow for anticipation and adaptation to them in a timely manner, adopt industry practices and more efficient and rigorous criteria in its implementation.\n\nThe financial sector is under ever closer scrutiny by regulators, governments and society itself. In the course of activities, situations which might cause relevant reputational damage to the entity could raise and might affect the regular course of business. The attitudes and behaviors of the Group and its members are governed by the principles of integrity, honesty, long-term vision and industry practices through, inter alia, the internal control model, the Code of Conduct, the Corporate Principles in tax matters and Responsible Business Strategy of the Group.\n\n## Business, operational and legal risks\n\nNew technologies and forms of customer relationships: Developments in the digital world and in information technologies pose significant challenges for financial institutions, entailing threats (new competitors, disintermediation, etc.) but also opportunities (new framework of relations with customers, greater ability to adapt to their needs, new products and distribution channels, etc.). Digital transformation is a priority for the Group as it aims to lead digital banking of the future as one of its objectives.\n\nTechnological risks and security breaches: The Group is exposed to new threats such as cyber-attacks, theft of internal and customer databases, fraud in payment systems, etc. that require major investments in security from both the technological and human point of view. The Group gives great importance to the active operational and technological risk management and control.\n\nThe financial sector faces an environment of increasing regulatory and litigious pressure, and thus, the various Group entities are usually party to individual or collective judicial proceedings (including class actions) resulting from their activity and  operations,  as  well  as  arbitration  proceedings.  The  Group  is  also  party  to  other  government  procedures  and investigations, such as those carried out by the antitrust authorities in certain countries which, among other things, have in the past and could in the future result into sanctions, as well as lead to claims by customers and others. In addition, the regulatory framework, in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, is evolving towards a supervisory approach more focused on the opening of sanctioning proceedings while some regulators are focusing their attention on consumer protection and behavioral risk.\n\nIn Spain and in other jurisdictions where the Group operates, legal and regulatory actions and proceedings against financial institutions, prompted in part by certain judgments in favor of consumers handed down by national and supranational courts, have increased significantly in recent years and this trend could continue in the future. The legal and regulatory actions and proceedings faced by other financial institutions in relation to these and other matters, especially if such actions or proceedings result in favorable resolutions for the consumer, could also adversely affect the Group.\n\nAll of the above may result in a significant increase in operating and compliance costs or even a reduction of revenues, and it is possible that an adverse outcome in any proceedings (depending on the amount thereof, the penalties imposed or the procedural or management costs for the Group) could damage the Group's reputation, generate a knock-on effect or otherwise adversely affect the Group.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of legal and regulatory actions and proceedings, both   those to which the Group is currently exposed and those that may arise in the future, including actions and proceedings relating to former Group subsidiaries  or  in  respect  of  which  the  Group      may  have  indemnification  obligations,  but  such  outcome  could  be significantly adverse to the Group. In addition, a decision in any matter, whether against the Group or against another credit entity facing similar claims as those faced by the Group, could give rise to other claims against the Group. In addition, these actions and proceedings attract resources from the Group and may occupy a great deal of attention on part of the Group's management and employees.",

In accordance with the indications given in the guidelines, BBVA Group's APMs:\n\n- \uf0b7 Include clear and readable definitions of the APMs (paragraphs 21-25).\n- \uf0b7 Disclose the reconciliations to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total presented in the financial statements of the corresponding period, separately identifying and explaining the material reconciling items (paragraphs 26-32).\n- \uf0b7 Are standard measures generally used in the financial industry, so their use provides comparability in the analysis of performance between issuers (paragraphs 33-34).\n- \uf0b7 Do not have greater preponderance than measures directly stemming from financial statements (paragraphs 3536).\n- \uf0b7 Are accompanied by comparatives for previous periods (paragraphs 37-40).\n- \uf0b7 Are consistent over time (paragraphs 41-44).\n\n## Reconciliation of the Financial Statements of the BBVA Group\n\nBelow is the reconciliation between the consolidated Financial Income Statements and the consolidated management income statements, shown throughout this report, for 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe main difference between them is the treatment of the results generated by the portion of the business in the United States that is subject to the sale agreement reached on November 16, 2020. As a result, in the management income statements, the results of the Group are presented by consolidating the  said business for sale in continuity, compared to the treatment of the income statement of the consolidated Financial Statements in which, according to the applicable accounting  regulation,  and  since  the  transaction  represents  a  sale  agreement  that  includes  a  large  section  of  the businesses that constitute a significant geographical area for the Group (IFRS 5.32 and Appendix A), it has been considered as a 'discontinued operation'. Based on this consideration, the results obtained by the business subject to the sale are presented under a single line of the income statements - \"Profit (loss) after tax from discontinued operations\" - (IFRS 5.33) and the income statements of the consolidated Financial Statements for the comparative periods presented have been reexpressed (IFRS 5.34).This line of the consolidated Financial Statements includes the successive goodwill impairments in the United States made in the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 that, in the management income statements are collected in a management margin called 'United States goodwill impairment and corporate operations'.\n\nAdditionally, there is a difference between both approaches that derives from the materialization of the agreement with Allianz that, in the Financial Income Statements is included with its gross impact on the line \"Gains (losses) from noncurrent assets and disposable groups of items classified as held for sale not qualifying as discontinued operations\" and its corresponding tax effect on the line \"Tax expense or income related to profit or loss from continuing operations' while, for management purposes, it has been classified as 'Corporate Operation' for its net amount, being included in the same management margin mentioned above.",

This limit does not apply to issues of contingently convertible securities.\n\nTo date, BBVA has not adopted any resolution using this delegated power.\n\n- \uf0b7 The BBVA General Meeting of 17 March 2017, under the fifth item on the agenda, delegated to the Board the power to issue securities that are convertible into newly issued BBVA shares, on one or more occasions within a maximum term of five years, up to a total combined maximum amount of EUR 8,000,000,000 or its equivalent in another currency; the Board may likewise resolve upon, set and determine the terms and conditions of the issues carried out, determine the basis and mode of conversion, and resolve upon, set and determine the conversion ratio, which may be fixed or variable. Moreover, the General Meeting resolved to delegate to the Board the power to totally or partially exclude preemptive subscription rights over any issue of convertible securities that may be made under the agreement, when the corporate interest so requires, in compliance with any applicable legal requirements. However, this power was limited in so far as the normal amount of the capital increases resolved upon or actually carried out to accommodate the conversion of ordinarily convertible issues executed using this delegated power with an exclusion of the pre-emptive subscription right, and those resolved upon or executed also with an exclusion of the pre-emptive subscription right in the exercise of the delegated power to increase share capital granted by the same Meeting, under item four of the Agenda, may not exceed the maximum nominal amount, taken as a whole, of 20% of BBVA's share capital at the time of delegation. This limit does not apply to issues of contingently convertible securities.\n\nThrough the aforementioned delegation, BBVA has made six issuances of contingently convertible perpetual securities (Additional Tier 1 capital instruments), without pre-emptive subscription rights, namely two issuances in the 2017 financial year in the amounts of EUR 500 million and USD 1 billion; one in the 2018 financial year in the amount of EUR 1 billion; two in the 2019 financial year in the amounts of EUR 1 billion and USD 1 billion; and one in 2020 in the amount of EUR 1 billion.\n\n- \uf0b7 Under the third item of the agenda of the BBVA General Meeting held on 16 March 2018, it was resolved to grant BBVA the authority, whether directly or through any of its subsidiaries, and for a period of no more than five years, at any time and on as many occasions as it deems necessary, to derivatively acquire BBVA shares by any means permitted by law, including charging the acquisition to the profits for the financial year and/or to freely available reserves, as well as to later divest the acquired shares by any means permitted by law. The derivative acquisition of shares is to be carried out, in all cases, in accordance with the applicable legal conditions or by the competent authorities and, in particular, with the following conditions: (i) the nominal value of the treasury stock acquired, whether directly or indirectly, by means of this authorisation, when added to that already held by BBVA and its subsidiaries, may not exceed 10% of the subscribed share capital of BBVA or, where appropriate, the maximum amount permitted under the applicable legislation; and (ii) the acquisition price per share may not be lower than the nominal value of the share, and must be under 10% higher than the share price or any other price associated with the shares at the time that they are acquired. The aforementioned General Meeting also expressly authorised that the shares acquired by BBVA or any of its subsidiaries may, through this authorisation, be partially or totally set aside for workers or directors of BBVA or its subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of them exercising any option rights that they may hold.",

Additionally, Article 25 of Royal Decree 84/2015, implementing the LOSS, establishes that the Bank of Spain shall evaluate proposals for acquisitions of significant shares and submit a proposal to the European Central Bank regarding whether to oppose this acquisition or not.

In accordance with the definition given in the Spanish Account Auditing Act, small and mediumsized companies will have to report, at a minimum, the policy that they have agreed in regard to gender diversity.\n\n## Yes\n\nIf yes, please outline these diversity policies, their objectives, their measures, the way in which they have been applied and the results thereof in this financial year. Any specific measures adopted by the board of directors and the appointments committee to attain a balanced and diverse representation of directors must also be indicated.\n\nIf the company does have a diversity policy, explain the reason for this.\n\n## Outline of the policies, their objectives, their measures, the way in which they have been applied and the results thereof\n\nThe Bank has a Policy on the selection, suitability and diversity of the BBVA Board of Directors (the Selection Policy), the current text of which was revised and approved at the end of 2020 by the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee, in both cases,  in  accordance  with  their  respective  regulatory  powers,  taking  into  account  the recommendations included in the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies of the CNMV and local and international best practices and recommendations.\n\nThis Selection Policy sets out the principles and criteria governing the process for the selection, appointment and renewal of the members of the BBVA Board of Directors, as well as the legal requirements that directors must meet, including suitability requirements. The Policy also provides for elements and objectives concerning the composition of the corporate bodies, including diversity, which will be attended to ensure that the corporate bodies properly exercise their functions and to guarantee their effective functioning. All the foregoing in the Bank's best corporate interest.\n\nIn this sense, with regard to diversity, the Selection Policy states that the BBVA Board of Directors will promote diversity in the composition of the Bank's corporate bodies by encouraging the inclusion of people with different profiles, qualities, knowledge, training and experience.\n\nTo ensure that the corporate bodies have an adequate and balanced composition, the refreshment and selection processes will encourage diversity of their members, based on the needs of the Bank at all times.\n\nIn particular, they will strive to ensure that the Board of Directors has a balanced representation of men and women. To this end, the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee has set a target for representation of the lesser-represented gender, namely to endeavour that female directors should represent at least 40% of the Board of Directors by the end of the 2022 financial year and beyond, not dropping below 30% prior to this.\n\nAdditionally, the composition of the Board of Directors shall seek to feature an adequate balance between the different types of director, for non-executive directors to represent an ample majority over",

It also ensures that the process of ongoing refreshment of the corporate bodies, which entails the inclusion of new profiles with lesser knowledge of the Group, is carried out without affecting the proper functioning of the Board.\n\nThus, the Board, as a whole, has suitable balance in its composition and suitable knowledge of the Bank and Group's environment, activities, strategies and risks, which contributes to bettering its functioning.\n\nIn addition, as a result of the Board refreshment process that has taken place in recent years, in 2020:\n\n- (i) the appropriate balance between the different types of director has been strengthened and the majority of non-executive directors on the Board has increased (to 86.67%);\n- (ii) the majority of independent directors has been increased (to 66.67%); and\n- (iii) the target for female representation established in the Selection Policy applicable to 2020, i.e. for 30% of directors to be female by 2020, has been achieved (specifically, women represent 33.33% of the Board).\n\nTherefore, at the end of the 2020 financial year, the Board of Directors meets the aforementioned diversity targets relating to the composition of the Board of Directors, as provided for in the Selection Policy, which are also in line with applicable regulations.\n\n- C.1.6  Explain any measures that have been agreed by the Appointments Committee to ensure that the selection procedures are free from implicit biases that could hinder the selection of female directors, and to ensure that the company includes and makes a conscious effort to find potential female candidates who match the professional profile, in order to achieve a balanced representation  of  men  and  women.  Also  indicate  whether  these  measures  include encouraging the company to have a significant number of female senior managers:\n\n## Explanation of the measures\n\nAs stated in Section C.1.5, the Board of Directors has a Selection Policy that establishes that, with respect to the selection processes for new Bank directors, as part of the process of progressive and systematic  refreshment  of  the  corporate  bodies,  the  Appointments  and  Corporate  Governance Committee will ensure that they promote diversity and that, in general, they are not impaired by implicit biases that may lead to any form of discrimination.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee will ensure that these selection processes facilitate the selection of a sufficient number of female directors so as to guarantee a balanced representation of women and men, endeavouring to ensure that women with the relevant professional profile are included amongst potential candidates.\n\nTo  this  end,  the  Appointments  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  has  set  a  target  for representation of the lesser-represented gender, namely to endeavour that female directors represent",

In particular, the presence of women on the Board has been increasing. At the end of the year, one third of all Board members and 40% of independent directors were female.\n\nAs of the date of this report, BBVA has five women on its Board and they are members of five of the Committees.  Furthermore,  the  majority  of  the  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  the Remunerations Committee are women, including the Chair of the Remunerations Committee.\n\nThis means it is meeting the target established in the Selection Policy, which is aligned with the provisions of the CNMV Good Governance Code, for at least 30% of directors to be female in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 540 of the Spanish Corporate Enterprises Act, which stipulates that a brief description of the diversity policy, with regard to members of management, must be provided, BBVA has a selection and appointment policy for members of Senior Management that has been approved by the Board.\n\nSaid policy is designed to ensure that individuals in Senior Management positions at BBVA have the capacity to properly exercise the responsibilities conferred upon them. Thus, members of BBVA Senior Management must have top-level academic and technical qualifications, professional skillsunderpinned by their professional careers to date-applicable to the responsibilities associated with the role to be fulfilled, a recognised honourable business and professional reputation, and commitment to BBVA's values.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of this policy, for the assessment of internal talent, performance is assessed in terms of the achievement of objectives, potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future, and individuals' professional capabilities and skills. These assessments may be supported by means of review sessions during which members of Senior Management analyse the profiles of certain employees and share their opinions on the achievements and strengths of each individual.\n\nMoreover, for the selection of external candidates for senior management positions, references and top-level executive search firms are used. The Talent & Culture area ensures that external candidates possess top-level academic and technical qualifications, that their professional careers to date adequately encompass the responsibilities associated with the roles to be fulfilled, that they have recognised  business  and  professional  reputations,  and  that,  during  their  careers  at  other organisations, they have demonstrated a high level of alignment with BBVA's values. The candidates identified  through  the  company's  external  selection  process  are  considered  alongside  internal candidates, in order to select the individual that best fits the role to be fulfilled.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the Regulations of the Board, the functions of this body include appointing members of Senior Management based on a report from the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee. Prior to the proposal and appointment, the Bank follows a selection process for members of Senior Management which is governed by the principles and criteria outlined in the selection  and  appointment  policy  for  members  of  Senior  Management.  This  process  involves analysing the functions and candidate profiles, confirming the suitability of the selected candidate, submitting  the  proposal  for  the  consideration  of  the  Appointments  and  Corporate  Governance Committee, which drafts a preliminary report for the Board, and, finally, submitting the proposal to the Board for approval, which must be supported by a favourable preliminary report from the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nAppointment of senior managers will be made on the proposal of the Group Executive Chairman for those who report thereto, and of the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer ( Consejero Delegado ), for those who report instead thereto, prior information to the Group Executive Chairman. The Board of Directors will be responsible for the appointment and dismissal of the head of the Internal Audit area, based on a proposal from the Audit Committee, and the Head of Regulation & Internal Control, on a proposal from the Risk and Compliance Committee, as well as the determination of their objectives and assessment of their performance, on a proposal from the corresponding committee.\n\nFollowing the implementation of this policy, the number of women in Senior Management has increased, and 27% of senior managers were women at the end of the financial year.\n\nWhen, despite the measures taken, there are few or no female directors or senior managers, explain the reasons:",

In 2020, it took into account, in particular, how they have operated during the COVID-19 crisis, during which the directors have shown a great deal of dedication to the Bank as well as demonstrating flexibility and an ability to adapt to the current circumstances, and during which their knowledge of the landscape and the Group itself has not only enabled the corporate bodies to adequately carry out their functions, it has also contributed to the Group being able to tackle the crisis from a position of strength.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee takes into account the areas and subjects that are of particular relevance to the performance of the corporate bodies' functions, in particular the Group's current and future activities, business and strategy.\n\nAmong the information used by the Committee to carry out its work, of particular note is the skills and diversity matrix of the Board of Directors, which is developed to help to identify the Board's skills, characteristics and experience, as well as those areas that needed to be improved in the future. The matrix also includes areas, sectors and matters related to banking and finance, as well as others that are of particular relevance to the Group's strategy and activities.\n\nThe matrix includes areas such as banking and financial services; accounting and auditing; risk management; innovation and information technology; macroeconomic strategy and environment; human resources and compensation; institutions, legal and regulations; and corporate governance and sustainability.\n\nThe matrix includes directors' professional experience and career paths in different areas such as, for example, business, boards of directors, public administration and academia, both nationally and internationally. It also indicates the Board's ratio of men to women.\n\nRegarding the above, the Committee has been able to verify that the Board brings together directors with broad experience and knowledge of the financial and banking sector with other directors who have experience in each of the other areas analysed, and that its directors have a diverse range of career paths, both nationally and internationally.\n\nThe Board's diversity of skills, knowledge and experience has been reinforced by the thorough refreshment process with regard to the corporate bodies, which has seen the introduction of seven new directors in the past three years, which in turn has bolstered said skills, knowledge and experience on the Board in areas of particular relevance to the Bank's strategy, business and activities.",

Proposals for the appointment or re-appointment of nonindependent directors must also be accompanied by a report from the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nTo this end, said Committee will assess the balance of knowledge, skills and experience on the Board of Directors, as well as the conditions that the candidates must meet to cover vacancies (applicable legal and suitability requirements, inter alia), evaluating the time commitment considered necessary so that they can carry out their duties, according to the needs of the corporate bodies.\n\nThus, the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee will develop renewal and selection processes for directors as part of the process of progressive and systematic refreshment of the corporate bodies, with a view to ensuring that the structure and composition of the Board remains balanced and in line with the needs of the Bank at all times, having directors with different profiles, knowledge, training, experience and qualities.\n\nWithin these processes, the Committee will ensure that diversity is promoted and that, in general, there are no implicit biases that may lead to any form of discrimination.\n\nIt shall also ensure that these processes facilitate the selection of a sufficient number of female directors to guarantee a balanced representation of men and women, with the aim that female directors represent at least 40% of the Board by the end of the 2022 financial year and beyond, with the figure not dropping below 30% prior to this, while endeavouring to ensure that women who match the professional profile sought are included amongst potential candidates.\n\nAdditionally, the aim is for the composition of the Board of Directors to feature an appropriate balance between the different types of director, for non-executive directors to represent an ample majority over executive directors and for the number of independent directors to account for at least 50% of the total seats.\n\nThe corporate bodies will also be assessed to ensure that they have a mix of individuals who have experience and knowledge of the Bank, the Group, its businesses and the financial sector in general, as well as others who have training, skills, knowledge and experience in other areas and sectors relevant to the Bank.\n\nIn any case, BBVA's corporate bodies may take any other relevant diversity factor into consideration to adapt the composition of the corporate bodies to the needs of the Bank, taking into account criteria such as gender diversity, academic profile, professional experience, knowledge, disability, origin or age, thus being able to achieve an adequate balance.\n\nIn the performance of its functions, the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee may employ external services to select potential candidates, when it deems this necessary or appropriate.\n\n## Duration of mandate and termination:\n\nThe directors will hold their position for the term set out in the company Bylaws (three years, after which they may be reappointed one or more times for an additional three-year term) or, if they have been co-opted, until the first General Shareholders' Meeting has been held. They will leave their positions when the term for which they were appointed expires, unless they are re-appointed.\n\nDirectors must also inform the Board of Directors of any circumstances affecting them that could harm the company's standing and reputation, and any circumstances that may have an impact on their suitability for their role. Directors must offer their resignation to the Board and accept the Board's decision regarding their continuity in office. Should the Board decide against their continuity, they are required to tender their resignation, in the circumstances listed in section C.1.19 below.\n\nIn any event, directors will resign from their posts upon reaching 75 years of age and must submit their  resignation  at  the  first  meeting  of  the  Bank's  Board  of  Directors  held  after  the  General Shareholders' Meeting approving the accounts for the financial year in which they reach said age.",

This procedure was followed in the 2020 financial year, and certain measures (indicated below) were undertaken and consolidated, as part of the ongoing process of developing and adapting BBVA's Corporate Governance System to the needs of the corporate bodies, to the environment in which it carries out its activities and to regulatory requirements and best practices.\n\nAccordingly, the BBVA Board of Directors has carried out their self-assessment process for the 2020 financial year, having carried out an analysis of its Corporate Governance System, which took into consideration, as a starting point, the self-assessment process for the 2019 financial year.\n\nWithin the evaluation process for the 2020 financial year, the following is highlighted:\n\n- \uf0b7 the renewal of the composition of the Board of Directors, with the appointment of three new directors and the re-appointment of two directors, and of the composition of the Board Committees, in the terms set out in this Report;\n- \uf0b7 the consolidation of measures to improve governance structures implemented in the 2019 financial year, together with the development and implementation, in 2020, of measures to strengthen and improve efficiency in certain aspects of the organisation and functioning of the corporate bodies, in particular concerning meeting dynamics and the information model;\n- \uf0b7 Reinforcement in terms of the distribution of functions among the corporate bodies and the handling of issues of particular relevance to the Group;\n- \uf0b7 The approval of internal regulation to standardise and unify the methodology for the creation, approval, application and supervision of the Group's internal rules, and the approval and updating of general policies, through which the corporate bodies establish the general principles, objectives and the main management and control guidelines that the BBVA Group must observe within its various areas of activity; and\n- \uf0b7 Finally, it was noted that the COVID-19 crisis, which has impacted the organisation at all levels, meant that the corporate bodies: reinforced their monitoring of the impact of the crisis and management of the Group's activities, business and results; strengthened the interaction between the Board, its Committees and the executive team for the analysis of all relevant information on the evolution of the crisis and its management by the Bank; directly and continuously monitored and observed the management carried out by the executive team; and considered the need to adapt the dynamics of their meetings, in terms of how they are held, the number of meetings and the prioritisation of issues.\n\nIn all of this, the Bank's corporate bodies sought to keep BBVA's Corporate Governance System adapted to the reality, circumstances and needs of the Bank and, consequently, to emphasise the importance attributed to ensuring its solidity and resilience under all circumstances.",

This analysis was performed on the basis of the needs of the corporate bodies at any given time and taking into account the Selection Policy.\n- \uf0b7 The assessment of the performance of the functions of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, which was led by the Lead Director in accordance with Article 21 of the Regulations of the Board, was carried out by the Board on the basis of the report by the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee (in accordance with Article 5 of the Regulations of the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee) which details the key elements of the Chairman's performance for the 2020 financial year.\n- \uf0b7 The assessment of the performance of the duties of the Chief Executive Officer was carried out by the Board on the basis of the report by the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee, including the assessment carried out in this respect by the Executive Committee (in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulations of the Board) which details the key elements of the Chief Executive Officer's performance for the 2020 financial year.\n\nIn addition, the Board assessed the quality and efficiency of the functioning of each Committee on the basis of the reports submitted by their respective Chairs, as described in Section H of this Report.\n\n- C.1.18 For those financial years in which an external consultant provided assistance for the evaluation, provide details of any ongoing business relationships that the consultant or any entity in their group maintains with this company or any company in this group.\n\nThe assessment carried out by the Board of Directors in the 2020 financial year regarding its quality and operation, its Committees and the performance of the functions of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer was carried out without the support of an independent expert.",

The  only  exceptions  to  this  approval  will  be  transactions  that simultaneously meet the three following specifications: (i) they are carried out under contracts with standard terms and are applied en masse to a large number of customers; (ii) they are executed at market rates or prices set in general by the party acting as supplier of the goods or services; and (iii) they are worth less than 1% of the Company's annual revenues.\n\nD.2 Detail transactions deemed to be significant given their amount or content carried out between the company or its group companies and the company's significant shareholders:",

RISK CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n\n- E.1  Explain the scope of the company's Risk Control and Management System, including risks of a taxrelated nature.\n\nThe BBVA Group has a general risk management and control model (hereinafter, the Model) adapted to its business model, its organisation, the countries in which it operates and its Corporate Governance System. This allows the BBVA Group to operate within the framework of the risk control and management strategy and policy defined by the Bank's corporate bodies and to adapt to the changing economic and regulatory environment, addressing risk management on a global level in a manner adapted to the circumstances at any moment.\n\nThis Model, which is the responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and which must be updated or reviewed at least annually, is applied comprehensively in the Group and is made up of the basic elements set out below:\n\n- I. Governance and organisation\n- II. Risk Appetite Framework\n- III. Evaluation, monitoring and reporting\n- IV.  Infrastructure\n\nThe Group promotes the development of a risk culture that ensures consistent application of the Model within the Group, and that guarantees that the risk function is understood and internalised at all levels of the organisation.\n\nThe Model applies to the management and control of all financial and non-financial risks of the Group, including tax risks, without prejudice to the fact that, with regard to tax, in addition to the management of this type of risk as a non-financial risk, BBVA has a tax risk management policy based on an adequate control environment, a risk identification system and a process for the monitoring and continuous improvement of the effectiveness of the established controls. This management model is revised and assessed by an independent expert.\n\nFor more information on the basic elements of the Model, see \"General risk management and control model\" in the \"Risk management\" chapter of the individual and consolidated Management Reports for financial year 2020.",

        "page_content": "## E.2  Identify the corporate bodies responsible for drawing up and enforcing the Risk Control and Management System, including tax-related risks.\n\nWith regard to risks, the Board of Directors' responsibilities are those relating to establishing the policy for controlling and managing risk and the oversight and control of its implementation.\n\nIn addition, and for a proper discharge of its functions, the Board of Directors is assisted by the Risk and Compliance Committee in the matters specified below. It is also assisted by the Executive Committee, which focuses on strategy, finance and business-related matters in an integrated manner, in order to monitor the Group's risks.\n\nIn particular, the Board of Directors establishes the Group's risk strategy and, in the discharge of this function, determines the risk control and management policy, which is set out in: the BBVA Group's Risk Appetite Framework, which includes the Group's risk appetite statement, containing the general principles of the Group's risk strategy and its target profile, as well as a set of quantitative metrics (core metrics-with their respective statements-and metrics by type of risk) originating from said statement that reflect the Group's risk profile; the management policy framework for the different types of risk to which the Bank is or may be exposed, which contains the basic principles for managing and controlling risks consistently throughout the Group and in accordance with the Model and the Risk Appetite Framework; and the Model.\n\nFurthermore, in parallel with the function of defining the risk strategy and within the scope of its risk monitoring, supervision and control functions, the Board of Directors monitors the evolution of the BBVA Group's risks as well as the risks of each of its main geographical and/or business areas, ensuring their compliance with the BBVA Group's Risk Appetite Framework, and also overseeing internal information and control systems.\n\nAt the executive level, the Group's Chief Risk Officer (the Head of Global Risk Management) is responsible for managing all of the Group's financial risks with the independence, authority, rank, experience, knowledge and resources required. They are responsible for ensuring, within their scope of functions, that the BBVA Group's risks are managed according to the established model.\n\nFor decision-making, the Group's Chief Risk Officer has a governance structure for the role that culminates in a support forum, the Global Risk Management Committee (GRMC), which is established as the main executive-level committee on the risks within its remit. Its purpose is to develop the strategies, policies, regulations and infrastructures needed to identify, assess, measure and manage the material risks within its remit that the Group faces in its business activity.\n\nIn addition, the chief risk officers of the geographical and business areas report functionally to the Group's Chief Risk Officer and report operationally to the head of their geographical and/or business area. This dual reporting system aims to ensure the independence of the local risk management function from the operating functions, and enable its alignment with the Group's risk-related general policies and goals.\n\nWith regard to non-financial risks and internal control, the Group has a Regulation & Internal Control area that is independent from the other units. This area is under the responsibility of the Global Head of Regulation & Internal Control, who is also appointed by the BBVA Board of Directors and reports directly to the corporate bodies, providing updates on the performance of its functions. This area is responsible for proposing and implementing policies related to non-financial risks and the Group's internal control model. It also includes, amongst others, the Non-Financial Risk, Compliance and Internal Risk Control units.\n\nFor more information on the bodies responsible for risk management and control at BBVA, see \"Governance and organisation\" in the \"General risk management and control model\" section in the \"Risk management\" chapter of the individual and consolidated Management Reports for financial year 2020.\n\nAs far as tax risk is concerned, the Tax function of the BBVA Group is responsible for establishing the control mechanisms and internal rules necessary to ensure compliance with current tax regulations, as well as proposing tax strategy to the Board of Directors for their consideration and approval, where appropriate. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the tax risks in the process of preparing and presenting financial information, which is evidenced by the reports made by the Head of the BBVA Group's Tax function to the Committee.\n\nE.3  Indicate the primary risks, including tax-related risks and, where significant, risk derived from corruption (the latter can be understood to be within the scope of Royal Decree Law 18/2017) that could prevent business targets from being met.",

        "page_content": "BBVA has processes to identify risks and analyse scenarios, enabling dynamic and advance risk management. These processes are forward-looking to ensure the identification of emerging risks, and take into account the concerns of both the business and corporate areas, as well as those of Senior Management.\n\nRisks are identified and measured in a consistent manner and in line with approved methodologies. Their measurement includes scenario analyses and stress testing, and considers the controls to which the risks are subject.\n\nIn  this  regard,  there  are  a  number  of  emerging  risks  that  could  impact  the  Group's  business performance. These risks are organised into the following large blocks:\n\n- \uf0b7 Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks\n- \uf0b7 Regulatory and reputational risks\n- \uf0b7 Business, legal and operational risks\n\nFor more information on these risks, see \"Risk factors\" in the \"Risk management\" chapter of the individual and consolidated Management Reports for financial year 2020, and \"Other non-financial risks\" chapter of the Non-Financial Information Statement, included in said Management Reports.\n\nLikewise, amongst the possible crimes included in the criminal prevention model are those related to corruption and bribery, since there are a number of risks that could manifest in a company with characteristics such as those of BBVA. For more information, see \"Other standards of conduct\" and 'Criminal prevention model' in the \"Compliance system\" section, which is included in the \"Ethical behaviour\" chapter of the Non-Financial Information Statement in the individual and consolidated Management Reports for the 2020 financial year.\n\nOn the other hand, and not having the consideration of significant risk referred to in this section, the Spanish judicial authorities are investigating the activities of the company Centro Exclusivo de Negocios y Transacciones, S.L. (Cenyt). The investigation includes services provided to the Bank.\n\nIn relation to this, on 29 July 2019, the Bank was served the notice from Central Magistrates Court No. 6 of the Spanish High Court, citing the Bank as an investigated legal entity in the preliminary proceedings 96/2017 - investigation piece number 9 - for alleged events that could be constitutive of bribery, revelation of secrets and corruption in business. On 3 February 2020, the Bank was notified that  the  Central  Magistrates  Court  No.  6  of  the  Spanish  High  Court  lifted  the  secrecy  of  the proceedings. Certain Group managers and employees, both current and former, as well as some former directors, are also under investigation in relation to this case. The Bank has been and continues to proactively cooperate with judicial authorities and has shared with them the relevant documentation arising from the forensic investigation hired by the Bank in 2019 to help to clarify the events. As of the date of this document, no indictment has been filed against BBVA for any crime.\n\nThe above-mentioned criminal proceedings are in the pre-trial phase. It is therefore impossible at this time to predict their scope or duration, their possible outcome or the possible implications for the Group, including potential fines and losses and damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nContinued in Section H of this Report.\n\n## E.4 Identify whether the company has risk tolerance levels, including for tax-related risks.\n\nThe Group's Risk Appetite Framework, approved by the Board of Directors, determines the risks and the associated risk levels that the Group is prepared to assume to achieve its objectives, considering the organic development pattern of the business. These are expressed in terms of solvency, liquidity and funding, and profitability and recurrence of revenue, which are reviewed not only periodically but also if there are any substantial changes in the business strategy or relevant corporate transactions.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework is expressed through the following elements:\n\n- \uf0b7 Risk Appetite Statement: This contains the general principles of the Group's risk strategy and the target risk profile.\n- \uf0b7 Statements and core metrics: Derived from the appetite statement, these statements set out the general risk management principles in terms of solvency, liquidity and funding, profitability and recurrence of revenue.",

A series of metrics are also determined, and adherence to these ensures compliance with the core metrics and the Group's Risk Appetite Statement.\n\nIn addition to this Framework, there is a level of management limits that is defined and managed by the  areas  responsible  for  managing  each  type  of  risk.  This  is  to  ensure  that  anticipatory  risk management respects this structure and, in general, the established Risk Appetite Framework.\n\nEach significant geographical area has its own Risk Appetite Framework consisting of its local Risk Appetite statement, core metrics and statements, statements and metrics by type of risk, which should be consistent with those set at the Group level, but adapted to their reality and approved by the corresponding corporate bodies of each entity. This Risk Appetite Framework has a limit structure in line and consistent with the above.\n\nThe corporate Risk area works together with the various geographical and/or business areas to define their Risk Appetite Framework, so that it is coordinated with and integrated into the Group's Risk Appetite Framework, making sure that its profile is in line with the one defined. Also, for local monitoring purposes, the Chief Risk Officer for the geographical and/or business area will periodically report on the evolution of the local Risk Appetite Framework metrics to its corporate bodies, as well as, where appropriate, to the appropriate local top-level committees, following a scheme similar to that of the Group, in accordance with its own corporate governance systems.\n\nFor more information on the Risk Appetite Framework described above and on its monitoring and management integration, see \"Risk Appetite framework\" in the \"General Risk management and control model\" section within the \"Risk management\" chapter of the individual and consolidated Management Reports for financial year 2020.\n\n## E.5   State what risks, including tax-related risks, have occurred during the financial year.\n\nRisk is inherent to financial activity, and the occurrence of minor and major risks is therefore an inseparable part of the Group's activities. BBVA therefore offers detailed information on the evolution of risks which, by their nature, continuously affect the Group in carrying out its activity. This information is provided in its annual financial statements (notes 7 and 19 on risk management and tax risks, respectively, in the BBVA Group's Consolidated Annual Financial Statements; and notes 5 and 17, on the same subject matters, in BBVA's Individual Annual Financial Statements, both for financial year 2020) and in the individual and consolidated Management Reports, both for financial year 2020 (the \"Risk management\" chapter and \"Other non-financial risks\" chapter of the NonFinancial Information Statement).\n\n- E.6 Explain the response and oversight plans for the primary risks faced by the company, including taxrelated risks, and the procedures followed by the company to ensure that the board of directors responds to any new challenges.\n\nThe BBVA Group's internal control system for operational risks is based on the best practices developed both in the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework and in the Framework for Internal Control Systems in Banking Organisations drawn up by the Basel Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\n\nThe control model has a system comprising three lines of defence:\n\n- \uf0b7 The Group's business and support units constitute the first line of defence. They are responsible for primary management of current and emerging risks, and implementing control procedures for risk mitigation. They are also responsible for reporting to their business/support unit.\n- \uf0b7 The second line of defence is comprised of specialised control units in different areas of risk: Compliance, Legal, Finance, People, Physical security, Technological security, Information and Data Security, Suppliers, Internal Risk Control and Processes. This line defines the control frameworks in its specialist field, across the entire Entity, and provides training to areas exposed to risk. It also checks the identification of current and emerging risks carried",

This second line of defence is in place in  all  geographical  areas  in  which  the  Group  is  present  and  acts  in  accordance  with standardised practices that come from the corporate units in each of the fields.\n\nThe Group's Head of Non-Financial Risks is responsible for the function and, together with the Chief Compliance Officer and the Head of Internal Risk Control, reports on its activity to the Global Head of Regulation & Internal Control and to the Risk and Compliance Committee, assisting the latter in any matters where requested.\n\n- \uf0b7 The third line of defence is made up of the Internal Audit unit, for which the Group assumes the guidelines of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and of the Institute of Internal Auditors. Its function is to independently and objectively assess the first and second lines of defence, evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of internal control policies and systems, risk management and the governance processes and policies established by the Group.\n\nAs part of the second line of defence, the Group has a specific Internal Risk Control unit, within the area of Regulation & Internal Control, which, among other tasks, independently checks and monitors regulations and governance structure, in terms of financial risks, and the application and operation thereof in the area of Global Risk Management, as well as checking the development and implementation of financial risk management and control processes. It is also responsible for the validation of risk models.\n\nThe Group's Head of Internal Risk Control is responsible for the function and reports on its activities and work plans to the Head of Regulation & Internal Control and to the Risk and Compliance Committee, assisting the Committee in any matters where requested, and in particular  checking  that  the  GRM  reports  presented  to  the  Committee  comply  with  the established criteria at all times.\n\nIn addition, the Internal Risk Control function is global and transversal, covering all types of financial  risks  and  having  specific  units  in  all  geographical  and/or  business  areas,  with functional dependency on the Group's Head of Internal Risk Control.\n\nAs far as tax risk is concerned, the Tax Department, located within the Finance area, is responsible for establishing the policies and controls necessary to ensure compliance at all times with the current tax regulations and the tax strategy approved by the Board of Directors. The Internal Financial Control Unit, as a second line of defence against financial, accounting and tax risks, is responsible for assessing the quality of the design and effectiveness of the control model operating in tax processes, as detailed in Section F of this document.\n\nIn order to meet the new challenges that arise, the BBVA Group has a governance system that allows the Board of Directors to be informed of the real and potential risks that affect or may affect the Group at any time. Thus, in addition to the work carried out by the Bank's different areas of control (Risk, Regulation & Internal Control and Internal Audit), as well as other areas of the Bank, such as the legal and finance areas, and the corresponding Board committees (such as the Risk and Compliance Committee or the Audit Committee), there is also the monitoring and supervision carried out by the Technology and Cybersecurity Committee. Its work allows the Board of Directors to be informed of the main technological risks to which the Group is exposed-including those relating to information security risks, information technology compliance risks and cybersecurity risks-as well as of current technological trends and strategies, business continuity plans in matters of technology and relevant cybersecurity events affecting the Group or which might affect it in the future, among other functions.\n\n## F.

Which bodies and/or functions are responsible for: (i) the existence and maintenance of an adequate and effective ICFR; (ii) its implementation and (iii) its supervision.\n\nPursuant to Article 17 of its Regulations, the Board of Directors approves the financial information that BBVA is required to publish periodically as a listed company. The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee whose main task, among others, is to assist the Board in monitoring the preparation of financial statements and public information, as well as monitoring internal financial control.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  Rules  of  Procedure  of  BBVA's  Audit  Committee  establish  that  one  of  the Committee's functions is to monitor the effectiveness of the Company's internal control and the risk management systems in the process of drawing up and presenting financial information, including tax risks, as well as discussing with the statutory auditor the significant weaknesses of the internal control system detected during the audit.\n\nThe BBVA Group complies with the requirements imposed by the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) for each financial year's consolidated annual financial statements due to its status as a publicly traded company listed with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The main Group executives are involved in the design, compliance and maintenance of an effective internal control model that guarantees  the  quality  and  veracity  of  the  financial  information.  The  Finance  area  has  been responsible during 2020 for producing the consolidated annual financial statements and maintaining the control model for financial information generation. Specifically, this function is performed by the Financial Internal Control area, which is integrated within the Group's general internal control model, which is briefly outlined below:\n\nThe BBVA Group works continuously to bolster its internal control model, which comprises two key elements. The first is the control structure organised into three lines of defence, which is described in Section E.6 above; and the second is a governance scheme called Corporate Assurance, which establishes a framework for monitoring the internal control model and bringing the main aspects of the Group's internal control to the attention of Senior Management.\n\nCorporate Assurance establishes a committee structure, both at the local and corporate levels, that provides Senior Management with a comprehensive and homogeneous view of the main non-financial risks and relevant situations as regards the control environment. The aim is to facilitate fast and proactive decision-making in relation to the mitigation or assumption of major risks. These committees are formed by the main executives responsible for the business and support areas, as well as those responsible for the second line of defence (RCS).\n\nThe effectiveness of this internal control system is assessed periodically for those risks that may affect the correct compilation of the Group's financial statements. The assessment is coordinated by the Internal Financial Control area and involves risk control specialists (RCS), as the second line of defence, and risk control assurers (RCA) for the main processes, in both business areas and support areas. The Group's Internal Audit area also performs its own assessment of the internal control system with regard to the generation of financial information. In addition, the external auditor of the BBVA Group issues an opinion every year on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established by COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and in accordance with PCAOB (the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) standards. This opinion appears in Form 20-F, which is filed every year with the SEC.\n\nThe result of the annual internal assessment of the System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, conducted by Internal Audit and Internal Financial Control, is reported to the Audit Committee by the heads of Internal Financial Control.\n\n## F.1.2 Whether, especially in the process of drawing up financial information, the following elements exist:\n\n- \uf0b7 Departments and/or mechanisms responsible for: (i) the design and review of the organisational structure; (ii) the clear definition of lines of responsibility and authority, with an adequate distribution of tasks and functions; and (iii) ensuring that sufficient procedures exist for their correct dissemination within the entity.",

The units responsible for drawing up these financial statements have a suitable distribution of tasks and the necessary segregation of functions to draw up these statements in an appropriate operational and control framework.\n\nAdditionally, there is an accountability model aimed at extending the culture of, and commitment to, internal control. Those in charge of the design and operation of the processes that have an impact on financial reporting certify that all the controls associated with its operation under their responsibility are sufficient and have worked correctly.\n\n- \uf0b7 Code of conduct, approval body, degree of dissemination and instruction, principles and values included (indicating whether there are specific mentions of recording transactions and drawing up financial information), body in charge of analysing non-compliance and proposing corrective measures and sanctions.\n\nBBVA has a Code of Conduct that is approved by the Board of Directors and reflects BBVA's concrete commitments with regard to one of the principles of its Corporate Culture: Integrity  in  the  consideration  and  undertaking  of  its  business.  This  Code  likewise establishes the corresponding whistleblowing channel regarding possible infringements of the Code. It is the subject of training and refresher programmes that include key personnel in the financial function.\n\nFollowing the update to the Code in 2015, communication campaigns to share its new content have been in place since 2016, making use of new formats and digital channels. In addition, a training plan has been developed at a global level, reaching the entire workforce of the Group.\n\nThe Code of Conduct can be accessed on the Bank's website (www.bbva.com) and on the employees' website (Intranet). Additionally, Group members undertake personally and individually to observe its principles and rules in an express declaration of awareness and adhesion.\n\nOne of the functions of the Risk and Compliance Committee is to examine draft codes of ethics and conduct and their respective modifications prepared by the corresponding area of the Group, and give its opinion in advance of the proposals to be drafted to the corporate bodies.\n\nAdditionally,  BBVA  has  adopted  a  structure  of  Corporate  Integrity  Management Committees (with individual powers at jurisdiction or Group entity levels, as applicable). Their joint scope of action covers all the Group businesses and activities and their main function is to ensure effective application of the Code of Conduct. There is also a Corporate Integrity  Management  Committee,  whose  scope  of  responsibility  extends  throughout BBVA. The main mission of this committee entails ensuring uniform application of the Code in BBVA.\n\nThe Compliance Unit in turn independently and objectively promotes and supervises to ensure that BBVA acts with integrity, particularly in areas such as money-laundering prevention, conduct with customers, security market conduct, corruption prevention, and other areas that could entail a reputational risk for BBVA. The unit's duties include fostering the knowledge and application of the Code of Conduct, promoting the drafting and distribution of its implementing standards, assisting in the resolution of any concern that may arise regarding the interpretation of the Code, and managing the Whistleblowing Channel.",

This attitude is reflected in everyone's commitment to whistle-blowing, by timely communication,  of  situations  that,  even  when  unrelated  to  their  activity  or  area  of responsibility, could be infringe regulations or contradict the values and guidelines of the Code.\n\nThe Code of Conduct itself and contemplates a Whistleblowing Channel, whereby BBVA employees, as well as other parties not part of BBVA, may communicate, in a confidential manner and, if they wish, anonymously, any behaviours that may not comply with the Code or that may infringe applicable regulation. Complaints are handled promptly and diligently, guaranteeing the confidentiality of the investigations and the prohibition of retaliation or adverse consequences in light of communications made in good faith.\n\nTelephone lines and email inboxes have been set up in each jurisdiction for these communications.

This risk identification is performed taking into account the theoretical risk model and the mitigation and control framework previously defined by the specialists for each type of risk (within the second line of defence) which, in the case of Finance, is the Internal Financial Control unit (tax and financial reporting risk specialist), who, in addition, challenges the functioning and effectiveness of the controls implemented.\n\nWhether the assessment of their controls is annual, quarterly or monthly is determined based on the significance of the risks, this ensuring coverage of the risks considered critical for the financial statements.\n\nThe assessment of the aforementioned risks and the design and effectiveness of their controls begins with the understanding of and insight into the analysed operating process, considering criteria of quantitative materiality, likelihood of occurrence and economic impact, in addition to qualitative criteria associated with the type, complexity and nature of the risks or of the business or process structure itself.\n\nThe system for identifying and assessing the risks of internal control over financial reporting is dynamic. It evolves continuously, always reflecting the reality of the Group's business, changes in operating processes, the regulations applicable at all times, the risks affecting them and the controls that mitigate them.\n\nAll this is documented in a corporate management tool developed and managed by the Non-Financial Risk area (STORM).

The purpose of these committees is to analyse, study and issue standards that may affect the compilation of the Group's financial and regulatory information, to determine the accounting and solvency criteria required to ensure that transactions are booked correctly, and to calculate capital requirements within the framework of the applicable standards.\n\nThe Group also has an Accounting Policies Manual, which is updated and made available to all Group units by means of the Intranet. This Manual is the tool that guarantees that all the decisions related to accounting policies or specific accounting criteria to be applied in the Group are supported and are standardised. This Manual is approved by the Technical Accounting Committee and is continuously documented and updated for use and analysis by all the Group's entities.\n\n- F.4.2. Mechanisms to capture and prepare financial reporting in standardised formats, for application and use by all of the units of the entity or the group, that support the main financial statements and the notes, and the detailed information on ICFR.\n\nThe BBVA Group's Finance area and the countries' financial management units are responsible for the processes for preparing financial statements in accordance with the current accounting and consolidation manuals. There is also a consolidation computer application that collects the accounting  information  of  the  various  companies  within  the  Group  and  performs  the consolidation processes, including the standardisation of accounting criteria, aggregation of balances and consolidation adjustments.\n\nControl measures have also been implemented in each of the aforementioned processes, both locally and at consolidated level, to ensure that all the data supplying the financial information is  collected  in  a  comprehensive,  exact  and  timely  manner.  There  is  also  a  single  and standardised financial reporting system that is applicable to and used by all the Group units and supports the main financial statements and the explanatory notes. There are also control measures and procedures to ensure that the information disclosed to the markets contains a breakdown that is tailored to regulatory requirements and sufficient so as to enable investors and other users of the financial information to understand and interpret it.\n\n## F.5 Supervision of the system's operation\n\n## Give information on the key features of at least:\n\n- F.5.1. The ICFR supervision activities carried out by the audit committee and whether the entity has an internal audit function with powers that include providing support to the audit committee in its task of supervising the internal control system, including the ICFR. Likewise, information will be given on the scope of the ICFR assessment carried out during the financial year and of the procedure by which the person in charge of performing the assessment communicates its results, whether the entity has an action plan listing the possible corrective measures, and whether its impact on financial reporting has been considered.\n\nThe internal control units of the business areas and of the support areas conduct a preliminary assessment of the internal control model, assess the risks identified in the processes, the effectiveness of controls, and the degree of mitigation of the risks, as well as identifying possible weaknesses and designing, implementing and monitoring the mitigation measures and action plans.\n\nThe first assessment of the effectiveness of the risk controls for the financial information preparation process is carried out by the RCA (Risk Control Assurer), who is responsible for control in the first line of defence, and layer by the RCS (Risk Control Specialist - second line of defence) who must challenge the design and operation of the controls in order to issue a conclusion on the operation of the control model on the risks covered by his field of expertise.",

The Internal Audit function is entirely independent of the units that draw up the financial information.\n\nAll the weaknesses in controls, mitigation measures and specific action plans are documented in  the  corporate  tool  STORM  and  submitted  to  the  internal  control  and  operational  risk committees of the areas, as well as to the local or global Corporate Assurance Committees, based on the significance of the detected issues.\n\nBoth the weaknesses identified by the internal control units and those detected by the internal or external auditor have an action plan in place to correct or mitigate risk.\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the areas responsible for Internal Control conducted a full assessment of the system for internal control over financial reporting, and, to date, no material or significant weakness having any impact on the preparation of financial information have been revealed therein.\n\nAdditionally, in compliance with the SOX, the Group's Internal Control and Internal Auditing areas annually assesses the effectiveness of the model of internal control over financial reporting on a group of risks (within the perimeter of SOX companies) that could affect the drawing up of financial statements at local and consolidated levels. This perimeter incorporates risks and controls in Finance and other specialisms that are not directly financial (technology, risks, operational processes, human resources, procurement, legal etc.). The results of this assessment are reported annually to the Audit Committee.\n\nF.5.2.

Also provide information on whether there is an action plan to try to correct or mitigate the weaknesses observed.\n\nAs described in section (F.5.1) above, the Group has a procedure in place whereby the internal auditor and the heads of Internal Financial Control report to the Audit Committee any significant internal control weaknesses detected in the course of their work. Any significant or material weaknesses, if present, will likewise be reported. Similarly, there is a procedure whereby the external auditor reports to the Audit Committee the result of their work assessing the system for internal control over financial information.\n\nSince BBVA is listed with the SEC, the BBVA Group's external auditor annually issues its opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting contained in the Group's consolidated annual financial statements on 31 December each year, under PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) standards, with a view to filing the financial information with the SEC on Form 20-F. The latest report issued on the financial information for the 2019 financial year is available at www.sec.gov and www.bbva.com.\n\nAll control weaknesses detected by the Internal Control, Internal Audit and External Audit areas have an action plan for resolution and are reported to the Internal Control Committees of each area, to the Corporate Assurance Committees (local or global, depending on the severity of the weaknesses) and also to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe internal control oversight carried out by the Audit Committee, described in the Regulations of the Audit Committee published on the Group website, www.bbva.com, includes the following activities:\n\n- \uf0b7 Analyse, prior to their submission to the Board of Directors and in enough detail to guarantee their accuracy, reliability, sufficiency and clarity, the financial statements of the Bank and of its consolidated Group contained in the annual, six-monthly and quarterly reports, as well as in all other required financial information and related nonfinancial information.

With respect to internal control and reporting systems:\n- a) Monitor and evaluate the preparation process and the integrity of the financial and non-financial information, as well as the control and management systems for financial and non-financial risks related to the company and, where appropriate, to the group - including operating, technological, legal, social, environmental, political and reputational risks or those related to corruption reviewing compliance with regulatory requirements, the accurate demarcation of the consolidation perimeter, and the correct application of accounting principles.\n- b) Monitor the independence of the unit handling the internal audit function; propose the selection, appointment and removal of the head of the internal audit service; propose the service's budget; approve or make a proposal for approval to the board of the priorities and annual work programme of the internal audit unit, ensuring that it focuses primarily on the main risks the company is exposed to (including reputational risk); receive regular report-backs on its activities; and verify that senior management are acting on the findings and recommendations of its reports.\n- c) Establish and supervise a mechanism that allows employees and other persons related to the company, such as directors, shareholders, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors, to report irregularities of potential significance, including financial and accounting irregularities, or those of any other nature, related to the company, that they notice within the company or its group. This mechanism must guarantee confidentiality and enable communications to be made anonymously, respecting the rights of both the complainant and the accused party.\n- d) In general, ensure that the internal control policies and systems established are applied effectively in practice.\n- 2.  With regard to the external auditor:\n- a) Investigate the issues giving rise to the resignation of the external auditor, should this come about.\n- b) Ensure that the remuneration of the external auditor does not compromise its quality or independence.\n- c) Ensure that the company notifies any change of external auditor to the CNMV as a material event, accompanied by a statement of any disagreements arising with the outgoing auditor and the reasons for the same.\n- d) Ensure that the external auditor has a yearly meeting with the board in full to inform it of the work undertaken and developments in the company's risk and accounting positions.\n- e) Ensure that the company and the external auditor adhere to current regulations on the provision of non-audit services, limits on the concentration of the auditor's business and other requirements concerning auditor independence.\n\n## PARTIALLY COMPLIANT\n\nCertain functions contained in this recommendation, in particular in paragraph 1(a), on the monitoring of risk control and management systems; paragraph 1(c), on the monitoring of a mechanism for the reporting of irregularities of particular importance; and paragraph 1(d), on the monitoring of the implementation of internal control policies and systems, are assigned, in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, to the Risk and Compliance Committee, composed exclusively of non-executive directors, most of them being independent directors, as well as its Chairman.\n\nWithin the framework of BBVA's Corporate Governance System, this Committee assists the Board in determining and monitoring the policy for control and management of all risks (financial and non-financial) of the Group, with the exception of the functions that correspond to internal financial control, that are the responsibility of the Audit Committee; those of technological risk, which correspond to the Technology and Cybersecurity Committee; and those of business and reputational risk, which correspond to the Executive Committee.

The rules of performance and membership of supervision and control committees should be set out in the board of directors' regulations and aligned with those governing legally mandatory board committees as specified in the preceding sets of recommendations. They should include:\n- a) Committees should be formed exclusively by non-executive directors, with a majority of independents.\n- b) They should be chaired by independent directors.\n- c) The board should the members of such committees with regard to the knowledge, skills and experience of its directors and each committee's terms of reference; discuss their proposals and reports; and provide report-backs on their activities and work at the first board plenary following each committee meeting.\n- d) They may engage external advice, when they feel it necessary for the discharge of their functions.\n- e) Meeting proceedings should be minuted and a copy made available to all board members.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 53.  The task of supervising compliance with the policies and rules of the company in the environmental, social and corporate governance areas, and internal rules of conduct, should be assigned to one board committee or split between several, which could be the audit committee, the nomination committee, a committee specialised in sustainability or corporate social responsibility, or a dedicated committee established by the board under its powers of selforganisation. Such a committee should be made up solely of non-executive directors, the majority being independent and specifically assigned the following minimum functions.\n\n## PARTIALLY COMPLIANT\n\nThe responsibility of supervising compliance with the Bank's policies and rules in the area of environmental, social and corporate governance, as well as internal codes of conduct, and other matters referred to in Recommendation 54, is shared between several Board Committees: namely, the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee, the Audit Committee and the Risk and Compliance Committee, composed exclusively of non-executive directors; and also the Executive Committee.\n\nIn particular, regarding environmental and social matters, the Executive Committee and the Risk and Compliance Committee play a more active role in assisting the Board on such matters, each within the limits of their powers.\n\nThe Executive Committee, which is comprised of a majority non-executive directors, is established to support the Board in the area of strategy and finance and oversees, on a recurrent basis, the integration of sustainability into the Group's business processes and activity, in line with the strategic priorities set out by the Bank. This Committee also oversees  the  implementation  of  the  Bank's  Sustainability  Policy,  approved  by  the  Board,  as  well  as  the implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, also approved by the Board.\n\nIn turn, the Risk and Compliance Committee, composed of a large majority of independent directors and without the presence of executive directors, monitors and supervises the integration of sustainability into the Group's risk analysis and management, from the perspectives of both risk planning and risk management. This Committee's functions also include to examine draft codes of ethics and conduct and their respective modifications, and matters related to money laundering, conduct on the securities markets, data protection and the scope of Group activities with respect to competition.\n\nFinally, the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee, composed of a majority of independent directors, is responsible for regularly reviewing and assessing BBVA's corporate governance system; and the Audit Committee, composed exclusively of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the process of preparing and reporting financial and related non-financial information.\n\n- 54.  The minimum functions referred to in the above recommendation are as follows:\n- a) Monitor compliance with the company's internal codes of conduct and corporate governance rules, and ensure that the corporate culture is aligned with its purpose and values.\n- b) Monitor the implementation of the general policy regarding the disclosure of economic-financial, non-financial and corporate information, as well as communication with shareholders and investors, proxy advisors and other stakeholders. Similarly, the way in which the entity communicates and relates with small and medium-sized shareholders should be monitored.",

Environmental and social sustainability policies should identify and include at least:\n- a) The principles, commitments, objectives and strategy regarding shareholders, employees, clients, suppliers, social welfare issues, the environment, diversity, fiscal responsibility, respect for human rights and the prevention of corruption and other illegal conducts.\n- b) The methods or systems for monitoring compliance with policies, associated risks and their management.\n- c) The mechanisms for supervising non-financial risk, including that related to ethical aspects and business conduct.\n- d) Channels for stakeholder communication, participation and dialogue.\n- e) Responsible communication practices that prevent the manipulation of information and protect the company's honour and integrity.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 56.  Director remuneration should be sufficient to attract individuals with the desired profile and compensate the commitment, abilities and responsibility that the post demands, but not so high as to compromise the independent judgement of non-executive directors.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 57.  Variable remuneration linked to the company and the director's performance, the award of shares, options or any other right to acquire shares or to be remunerated on the basis of share price movements, and membership of long-term savings schemes such as pension plans, retirement schemes and other savings schemes, should be confined to executive directors.\n- The company may consider the share-based remuneration of non-executive directors provided they retain such shares until the end of their mandate. This condition, however, will not apply to shares that the director must dispose of to defray costs related to their acquisition.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 58.  In the case of variable awards, remuneration policies should include limits and technical safeguards to ensure they reflect the professional performance of the beneficiaries and not simply the general progress of the markets or the company's sector, or circumstances of that kind.\n- And, in particular, variable remuneration items should meet the following conditions:\n- a) Be subject to predetermined and measurable performance criteria that factor the risk assumed to obtain a given outcome.\n- b) Promote the long-term sustainability of the company and include nonfinancial criteria that are relevant for the company's long-term value creation, such as compliance with its internal rules and procedures and its risk control and management policies.\n- c) Be focused on achieving a balance between the delivery of short, medium and long-term objectives, such that performance-related pay rewards ongoing achievement, maintained over sufficient time to appreciate its contribution to long-term value creation. This will ensure that performance measurement is not based solely on one-off, occasional or extraordinary events.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 59.  The payment of the variable components of remuneration is subject to sufficient verification that previously established performance, or other, conditions have been effectively met. Entities should include in their annual directors' remuneration report the criteria relating to the time required and methods for such verification, depending on the nature and characteristics of each variable component.\n\nAdditionally, entities should consider establishing a reduction clause ('malus') based on deferral for a sufficient period of the payment of part of the variable components that implies total or partial loss of this remuneration in the event that prior to the time of payment an event occurs that makes this advisable.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT",

Following the award of shares, options or financial instruments corresponding to the remuneration schemes, executive directors should not be able to transfer their ownership or exercise them until a period of at least three years has elapsed.\n- Except for the case in which the director maintains, at the time of the transfer or exercise, a net economic exposure to the variation in the price of the shares for a market value equivalent to an amount of at least twice his or her fixed annual remuneration through the ownership of shares, options or other financial instruments.\n\nThe foregoing shall not apply to the shares that the director needs to dispose of to meet the costs related to their acquisition or, upon favourable assessment of the nomination and remuneration committee to address an extraordinary situation.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 63.  Contractual arrangements should include provisions that permit the company to reclaim variable components of remuneration when payment was out of step with the director's actual performance or based on data subsequently found to be misstated.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n- 64.  Termination payments should not exceed a fixed amount equivalent to two years of the director's total annual remuneration and should not be paid until the company confirms that he or she has met the predetermined performance criteria.\n- For the purposes of this recommendation, payments for contractual termination include any payments whose accrual or payment obligation arises as a consequence of or on the occasion of the termination of the contractual relationship that linked the director with the company, including previously unconsolidated amounts  for  long-term  savings  schemes  and  the  amounts  paid  under  post-contractual  non-compete agreements.\n\n## \u2714 COMPLIANT\n\n## H.

This consists of the annual allocation to each non-executive director of a number of BBVA 'theoretical shares' equivalent to 20% of the total cash compensation received by each non-executive director in the previous year.

The details of the shares that correspond to each executive director as part of this remuneration are also set out in Notes 54 and 49 on 'Remuneration and other benefits to the Board of Directors and to members of the Bank's Senior Management' of the notes to the annual financial statements for the BBVA Consolidated and Individual Annual Accounts the 2020 financial year, respectively, and in BBVA's Annual Report on the Remuneration of Directors.\n\nFurther to Section A.9, relating to income from treasury-share trading, Rule 21 of Circular 4/2017 and IAS 32, Paragraph 33, expressly prohibit the recognition, in the income statement, of gains or losses made through transactions carried out with own capital instruments, including their issuance and redemption. Said profits and losses are directly booked against the company's net equity. In the table of significant variations, the date of entry of CNMV Model IV into the registries of that body. This model is related to communications with treasury shares and contains the reason for such communication.\n\nFor the purpose of clarifying the information contained in Section C.1.2, it is indicated that Jaime F\u00e9lix Caruana Lacorte accepted his appointment on 4 June 2018; Ana Cristina Peralta Moreno accepted her appointment on 8 May 2018; Ana Leonor Revenga Shanklin and Carlos Vicente Salazar Lomel\u00edn accepted their appointments on 1 April 2020, with the date of appointment by the corresponding General Meeting set out in Section C.1.2.\n\nFurther  to  section  C.1.7,  the  Committee  observed  that  independent  directors  contribute  to  the  suitable composition of both the Board of Directors and its committees and, in particular, those that assist the Board in its supervision and control functions. These Committees must have a significant number of independent directors, from among which the chairs of these committees must also be appointed.\n\nFinally, the current composition of the Board complies with the provisions of the applicable legislation, the Regulations of the corporate bodies and the objectives of the Selection Policy in this regard. In addition to the foregoing paragraphs, it is worth noting that:\n\n- i. there is adequate balance between the different types of director;\n- ii. non-executive directors comprise 86.67% of the total directors (thus meeting the objective of there being a majority of non-executive directors);\n- iii. independent directors make up two thirds of the Board (thus meeting the objective of having at least 50% independent directors); and\n- iv. women currently represent one third of directors (thus meeting the specific target for 2020 of having at least 30% female directors).\n\nIn light of the above, it is the view of the Committee that the Board of Directors as a whole has an adequate and diverse composition, with extensive knowledge of the environment, strategy, activities, business and risks of the Bank and its Group, and which is balanced and suited to current needs, thus helping the corporate bodies to perform their functions in the Bank's best corporate interest.\n\nFurther to Section C.1.9, the various Board Committees with oversight and control functions also have certain functions delegated by the Board of Directors, which are set forth in their corresponding regulations and are available on the Bank's website.\n\nFurther to the information included in section C.1.13:\n\nThe amount included in the item \"Remuneration of the Board of Directors accrued during the financial year\" corresponds, based on the instructions of this Report, with the amount declared as total remuneration accrued according to Table C) \"Summary of remunerations\" of section 3.4 (Statistical appendix) of BBVA's Annual Report on the Remuneration of Directors, which includes: the fixed and in-kind remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors received during the 2020 financial year; the payment of the deferred portion of the Annual Variable Remuneration for the 2017 financial year, in cash and monetised shares, together with its corresponding update, payable in 2021 if the corresponding conditions are met; as well as the remuneration",

This price stood at EUR 4.12 per share. The price used to initially determine the number of shares of the deferred part of the 2017 Annual Variable Remuneration in accordance with the policy applicable in that financial year was the average closing price of BBVA's share for trading sessions between 15 December 2017 and 15 January 2018, which was EUR 7.254 per share.\n\nWith regard to the \"Amount of entitlements accrued by current directors in regard to pensions\" indicated in section C.1.13 of this Report, during the 2020 financial year, the Bank made pension commitments to the Chairman to cover the contingencies of retirement, disability and death in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws, the BBVA Directors' Remuneration Policy and his contract entered into with the Bank. For the Chief Executive Officer, the Bank has no pension commitments, although it does have commitments to cover the contingencies for disability and death, in accordance with the BBVA Directors' Remuneration Policy and the contract entered into with the Bank.\n\nThe main characteristics of the pension system of the Chairman to cover the retirement contingency are detailed in the BBVA Directors' Remuneration Policy, and include, inter alia, the following: it is a defined contribution system; no provision for receiving the retirement pension in advance; and 15% of the agreed contribution is considered \"discretionary pension benefits\", in accordance with the requirements of the applicable regulations. They are also included in Notes 54 and 49 of the Annual Report corresponding to the annual financial statements for BBVA's Consolidated and Individual Annual Financial Statements for the 2020 financial year, respectively, which include the amounts of the entitlements accrued by the Chairman as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe balance of the item \"Provisions - Funds for pensions and similar obligations\" on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2020 includes EUR 73 million as post-employment provision commitments maintained with former members of the Board of Directors.\n\nFurther to the information included in section C.1.14:\n\nThe item \"Total remuneration of Senior Management\" includes the remuneration of the members of Senior Management (15 members as at 31 December 2020, excluding the executive directors), which includes: the annual and in-kind fixed remuneration received during the 2020 financial year; the payment of the Deferred Portion of the Annual Variable Remuneration for the 2017 financial year, in cash and monetised shares, together with its corresponding update, payable in 2021, if the corresponding conditions are met. The monetised shares stood at the same value as that indicated in the case of the executive directors (i.e. EUR 4.12 per share; see Section C.1.13). As in the case of the executive directors, this item does not include the Annual Variable Remuneration for the 2020 financial year as it has not been accrued since the members of the Senior Management waived its generation in light of the exceptional circumstances arising from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe main characteristics of the pension systems for this group are, inter alia, the following: defined contributions; no provision for receiving the retirement pension in advance; and 15% of the agreed contributions are considered \"discretionary pension benefits\", in accordance with the requirements of the applicable regulations.",

The Committee has also supported the Board in analysing and monitoring the drafting of the Budget, the Capital Plan and the Liquidity and Funding Plan prior to submission to the Board.\n\nThe Committee also undertook work to oversee, monitor and control the Group's risk management. It monitored the evolution of the risk profile and metrics; the most significant aspects relating to changes in the macroeconomic environment and other factors that impacted the Group's management and activities over the course of the financial year; as well as any developments in BBVA share prices.\n\nIn addition, it has analysed progress in the corporate transaction processes, the competence to decide on which rested with the Board, including their strategic and financial aspects, in advance of their consideration by the Board, as well as other issues and projects relating to the development of the Strategic Plan, like the Group's progress in terms of sustainability (including in environmental and social matters), or the day-to-day management of business.\n\nFinally, particularly noteworthy is the work carried out by the Committee on the prior reporting of policies submitted to the Board, except for policies relating to issues handled by other Board committees; as well as the Group's authorisation to appoint directors in subsidiaries or investee companies, and the granting of the powers vested in the Group.\n\n- \uf0b7 Audit Committee: Regarding organisational and operational rules, the operational principles of the Audit Committee are indicated in its Regulations, which lay down the basic rules of its organisation and operation.

All matters not provided for in the aforementioned Regulations will adhere to the Regulations of the Board of Directors, insofar as they are applicable.\n\nIn terms of the most significant actions carried out by the Audit Committee during the 2020 financial year, in the performance of the functions established to it by law, it has analysed the following matters, submitting the corresponding reports and proposals to the Board for approval, where appropriate.\n\nIn relation to overseeing the financial statements and public information, it analysed and oversaw the process of preparing and presenting financial and non-financial information related to the Bank as well as its consolidated Group from the annual, half-yearly and quarterly reports, in order to determine its accuracy, reliability, adequacy and clarity, prior to its submission to the Board.\n\nThese  financial  information  supervision  functions  were  performed  through  a  continuous  process throughout the year, in which it has monitored the monthly development of the balance sheet and income statement, the quarterly and semi-annual financial reports, the closing results of each period and the preparation process for the corresponding financial information, paying special attention to the accounting criteria applied and any changes therein, as well as accounting regulations and the changes in the Group's scope of consolidation.\n\nIn addition, following the health crisis caused by COVID-19, the Committee has continuously monitored and analysed the impacts that would affect the business, balance sheet and income statement of the Bank and its Group from an accounting perspective. Particularly noteworthy are the analysis and monitoring performed on (i) the extraordinary update made to the macroeconomic information required for the calculation of expected losses due to credit risk in application of the accounting standard IFRS 9; (ii) the results corresponding to the impairment test carried out on the goodwill recorded in the Group's accounts, in compliance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36, and the methodology used for this assessment; (iii) the scope and impact of the moratorium measures agreed upon, whether by public initiative or initiative of the Group itself; (iv) the extraordinary provisions applied as a result of the COVID19 crisis; and (v) changes made to policies or the accounting criteria applied, among others.\n\nHence, prior to their drafting and/or approval by the Board, the Committee oversaw the preparation of the individual and consolidated annual financial statements for the financial year, the half-yearly and quarterly financial statements, as well as other relevant financial information, including the CNMV Universal Registration Document, US SEC Form 20-F of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Prudential Relevance Report, among others, submitting to the Board the corresponding reports and/or opinions of the Committee on the financial information of the Bank and its Group.\n\nIn addition, within the financial information monitoring process, the Committee oversaw the sufficiency, suitability and effective functioning of the internal control systems established for the preparation of financial information, including tax-related systems, as well as learning from the internal reports and the reports by the executive areas of the Bank and the external auditor on the effectiveness of the internal financial control, submitting to the Board the Committee's reports on the sufficiency of the internal control systems established by the Group for the generation of financial information.\n\nSimilarly, at the same time as overseeing the main financial information of the Bank and its Group, the Committee analysed the Group's main tax figures, monitoring, inter alia, the real tax rate, total tax risk, the tax position on capital, as well as the main criteria used, the main decisions adopted and the impact on the financial information.\n\nWith regards to activities related to the external audit, the Committee has maintained appropriate relationships with the heads of the external auditor, during each of the monthly meetings it has held, in order to ascertain the planning, stage and progress of the Annual Plan established for performing its work in connection with the audit of the Bank and Group annual financial statements, of the interim financial statements, and of other financial information subject to review during the account auditing.",

It  has  also  opposed  declarations  made  by  the  external  auditor  concerning  confirmation  of  its independence with regard to BBVA and its Group, and issued the corresponding reports in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\nIn addition, the Committee has analysed the proposal for External Auditor's fees for the 2020 financial year, prior to it being submitted to the Board for consideration, as well as the quality of the work carried out by the external auditor during the financial year. It agreed to submit to the Board of Directors the proposal for the re-appointment of KPMG Auditors S.L. as auditor of the Bank and its Group for the 2021 financial year, which is submitted for approval by the next 2021 General Meeting.\n\nWith regards to Internal Audit tasks, the Committee has ensured that the Internal Audit area has the necessary material and human resources for effective performance of its functions, overseeing the efficiency and operation of the role as well as its independence from other areas of the Bank for such purpose.\n\nAs such, the Committee analysed and approved the Annual Internal Audit Plan for the 2020 financial year, overseeing its development and regularly monitoring the activity and reports issued by the area during its monthly meetings. It was also notified of the result of its most relevant work, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement identified, and the recommendations made by the Internal Audit as a result of its review work.\n\nThe Committee has also been made aware of the adjustments made to the Annual Internal Audit Plan for the financial year, resulting from the contingency situation caused by COVID-19. It has analysed the extraordinary measures taken in the area to ensure the continuity of its activity in all geographies, changes made to the working methodology, the re-planning of work and the design of new alternative work based on the risk analysis review, which had the prior agreement of the Committee.\n\nSimilarly, the Committee has analysed the proposed update to the regulations of the Group's Internal Audit Function Charter, evaluating the main envisaged changes to its regulations and content, having expressed its agreement with the proposed amendments prior to the Charter's submission to the Board of Directors for consideration.\n\nWith regard to the Strategic Plan established by the Internal Audit Area for the 2020-2024 period, the Committee  was  informed  of  and  monitored  its  progress  during  the  financial  year,  analysing  the development of all projects established for each of the strategic priorities defined, as well as the degree of implementation of the improvements identified following the review process of the Internal Audit function by an independent external expert.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the changes to the structure of the Group of companies over the financial year, as well as the Group's governance for the control, oversight and management of its corporate structure.\n\nSimilarly, the Committee has been informed of major corporate operations planned by the Group, monitoring the economic conditions and the main accounting impacts foreseen in the Group's financial statements, and issuing, prior to the decisions that the Board should take, the Committee's report on the operation.\n\nThe Committee also analysed, prior to submission for consideration by the Board, the Bank's general policy for the disclosure of economic-financial, non-financial and corporate information, drawn up in accordance with the new recommendation set out in June 2020 by the CNMV's new Good Governance Code of Listed Companies.",

The Regulations of the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee specifically provide that the Committee will meet whenever it is called to do so by its Chair, who is empowered to call the Committee and to set the agenda for its meetings, and set out the procedure for calling ordinary and extraordinary meetings.\n\nExecutives responsible for the areas that manage matters within their remits may be called to meetings, as well as, at the request thereof, those persons within the Group who have knowledge of or responsibility for the matters covered by the agenda, when their presence at the meeting is deemed appropriate. The Committee may also call on any other Group employee or manager, and even arrange for them to appear without the presence of any other manager, while ensuring that the presence of non-Committee members at its meetings is limited to those cases where it is necessary and to the items of the agenda for which they are called.\n\nThe Committee may also, through its Secretary, engage external advisory services for relevant issues when it considers that these cannot be properly provided by experts or technical staff within the Group on grounds of specialisation or independence.\n\nOther aspects of the organisation and operation of the Committee shall be subject to the Regulations of the Committee. All other matters not provided for in the aforementioned Regulations will be subject to the Regulations of the Board of Directors, insofar as they are applicable.\n\nWith respect to the Appointments and Corporate Governance Committee's most significant actions in 2020, in performing the functions assigned to it, of particular note were: the Committee's continuous analysis of the structure, size and composition of the Board of Directors, ensuring that they are suitable for the corporate bodies to best perform their functions; and the analysis of the directors' compliance with the independence and suitability criteria and the absence of any conflicts of interest for the performance of their duties, among other matters.\n\nTaking this analysis into account, and the process of ongoing refreshment of the Board described above and the director selection processes led by the Committee, the Committee carried out the corresponding proposals and reports on the appointment and re-appointment of directors to the Board, for subsequent submission to the Company's General Meeting in 2020.\n\nThe committee also carried out an analysis of the assessment of the operation of the Board and the performance of the functions of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, submitting the corresponding reports for consideration by the Board.\n\nIn addition, in 2020 the Committee reviewed and proposed an update to the Selection Policy, including, among many other matters, the new target for representation of the underrepresented gender, as indicated above.\n\nFurthermore, following Committee's assumption of new functions relating to the Bank's Corporate Governance System in 2019, it worked intensively on this matter in 2020, and in this regard, has monitored and supervised the progress made in the Bank's Corporate Governance System during the financial year, reviewed the draft annual corporate governance report for 2019 and the amendments to certain recommendations of the CNMV Good Governance Code. It has also received information on the result of the Corporate Governance Roadshow, where meetings were held with the Bank's main institutional investors and proxy advisors over the last months of 2020.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Committee analysed and reviewed the proposed new Corporate Governance General  Policy  for  the  BBVA  Group,  which  sets  out  the  general  principles,  objectives  and  main characteristics  of  corporate  governance  for  the  Group  and  its  internal  organisation,  including  the",

The Regulations of the Remunerations Committee specifically provide, amongst other things, that the Remunerations Committee will meet whenever it is called to do so by its Chair, who is empowered to call the Committee and to set the agenda for its meetings, and set out the procedure for calling ordinary and extraordinary meetings.\n\nExecutives responsible for the areas that manage matters within their remits may be called to meetings, as well as, at the request thereof, those persons within the Group who have knowledge of or responsibility for the matters covered by the agenda, when their presence at the meeting is deemed appropriate. The Committee may also call any other Group employee or manager, and even arrange for them to appear without the presence of any other manager. It will, however, seek to ensure that the presence of persons outside the Committee during its meetings be limited to those cases where it is necessary and to the items on the agenda for which they had been called.\n\nThe Committee may also, through its Secretary, engage external advisory services for relevant issues when it considers that these cannot be properly provided by experts or technical staff within the Group on grounds of specialisation or independence.\n\nOther aspects of the organisation and operation of the Committee shall be subject to the Regulations of the Committee. All other matters not provided for in the aforementioned Regulations will be subject to the Regulations of the Board of Directors, insofar as they are applicable.\n\nWith regard to the most important activities carried out by the Remunerations Committee during the 2020 financial year, the activity of the Committee has been focused on performing the functions assigned to it by Article 5 of its Regulations, as well as the development of the framework established in the BBVA Directors Remuneration Policy, approved by the General Meeting held in March 2019, and in the BBVA Group Remuneration Policy, approved by the Board of Directors in November 2017, which is generally applicable to all BBVA staff and which includes the Remuneration Policy for the Identified Staff. These policies focus on the recurring generation of value for the Group, and also seek to align the interests of its employees and shareholders with prudent risk management.\n\nTherefore, the Remunerations Committee carried out the actions detailed below during the 2020 financial year to perform its functions and implement the aforementioned remuneration policies, submitting the corresponding proposals to the Board of Directors for approval, where appropriate.\n\nHowever, as detailed below, the activities of the Remunerations Committee in the 2020 financial year have been affected by the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the activity of the other corporate bodies of the Bank.\n\nDuring the first few months of the 2020 financial year, the Committee carried out its usual activity in the area of remuneration. Thus, the Committee submitted necessary proposals to the Board for determining the amount of the Annual Variable Remuneration of executive directors for the 2019 financial year, as well as the scales of achievement for the multi-year performance indicators that would apply to the Deferred Portion of 2019 Annual Variable Remuneration and the TSR (Total Shareholder Return) indicator reference group; determining the amount of the Deferred Portion of the Annual Variable Rate for the 2016 financial year, which was to be paid to executive directors in 2020, and the updated amount; and determining the annual and multi-year performance indicators, and their corresponding weightings, used for the calculation of the Annual Variable Remuneration of executive directors for the 2020 financial year.",

Similarly, the Committee reviewed the Annual Variable Remuneration of members of Senior Management for the 2019 financial year, as well as the Deferred Portion of the 2016 Annual Variable Remuneration for Senior Managers who receive such remuneration, both to be paid in 2020.\n\nSimilarly, the Committee determined the 2019 Annual Variable Remuneration for the heads of Regulation & Internal Control and Internal Audits (under the direct authority of the Board) , for its proposal to the Board,  on  the  basis  of  the  approach  taken  by  the  Risk  and  Compliance  and  Audit  Committees, respectively, in relation to the assessment of their objectives.\n\nRegarding matters relating to the Identified Staff, which includes Senior Management, the Committee established that the scales of achievement for the multi-year indicators for the deferred 2019 Annual Variable Remuneration, as well as the TSR indicator reference group, were the same as those set for the executive directors. The Committee also established that the multi-year indicators for the 2020 Annual Variable Remuneration determined for the executive directors were also applicable to the Identified Staff.\n\nAlso in 2020, as in every year, the Committee submitted to the Board, for its approval and subsequent submission to a vote at the General Meeting: The Annual Report on the Remuneration of Directors for the 2019 financial year, which was finally approved with 92.46% of the votes; and the resolution to increase the maximum variable remuneration level of up to 200% of the fixed component applicable to a specific number of members of the Identified Staff, which was approved with 97.23% of the votes.\n\nIn March 2020, after the General Meeting, the health crisis caused by COVID-19 began, which largely determined the activity of the Remunerations Committee for the remainder of the financial year. In particular, at this time, in view of the exceptional circumstances arising from the COVID-19 crisis and as a gesture of responsibility and commitment toward customers, shareholders, employees and society in general, 330 members of the Identified Staff, including the executive directors and members of the Senior Management, waived generation of the Annual Variable Remuneration for the 2020 financial year.\n\nIn this context, the Remunerations Committee analysed the waiver of the Annual Variable Remuneration for the 2020 financial year by the executive directors and the consequences thereof in terms of resolutions previously adopted by the corporate bodies of the Bank for the generation of the same, which were mostly ineffective.\n\nLikewise, the Remunerations Committee analysed the minimum thresholds for Attributable Profit and Capital Ratio established by the executive area for determining the 2020 Annual Variable Remuneration, if applicable, both for those members of the Identified Staff who had not fully waived said Annual Variable Remuneration as well as for the rest of the Group's staff, all of which the Board was informed of.\n\nWith regard to the function of the Committee in ensuring compliance with the remuneration policies established by the Company, the Remunerations Committee carried out a review of the implementation, in the 2019 financial year, of the approved remuneration policies (the Directors' Remuneration Policy and the BBVA Group's Remuneration Policy, which includes the Remuneration Policy for the Identified Staff), based on the annual Internal Audit Area Report. In addition, the Committee has been informed of the development and outcome of identifying the BBVA Group Identified Staff in 2020.\n\nDuring 2020 the Committee has also verified the information about the remuneration of directors and senior managers contained in the Financial Statements and in the Annual Report on the Remuneration of Directors for the 2019 financial year.\n\n- \uf0b7 Risk and Compliance Committee: The Regulations of the Risk and Compliance Committee set out the operational principles of the Committee and lay down the basic rules of its organisation and operation.

The Regulations contain the procedure for the calling of ordinary and extraordinary meetings.\n\nExecutives responsible for the areas that manage matters within their remits may be called to meetings, including the Regulation & Internal Control area and the Risks area, and, at the request of the heads of these, those persons within the Group who have knowledge of or responsibility for the matters covered by the agenda, when their presence at the meeting is deemed appropriate. The Committee may also call on any other Bank employee or manager, and even arrange for them to appear without the presence of any other manager, while ensuring that the presence of non-Committee members at its meetings is limited to those cases where it is necessary and to the items of the agenda for which they have been called.\n\nThe Committee may also, through its Secretary, engage external advisory services for relevant issues when it considers that these cannot be properly provided by experts or technical staff within the Group on grounds of specialisation or independence.\n\nOther aspects of the organisation and operation of the Committee shall be subject to the Regulations of the Committee. All other matters not provided for in the aforementioned Regulations will be subject to the Regulations of the Board of Directors, insofar as they are applicable.\n\nWith regard to the most important activities carried out by the Risk and Compliance Committee during the 2020 financial year, the Committee analysed in several of its meetings and submitted a proposal for the BBVA Group's Risk Appetite Framework for the 2021 financial year (on the basis of the approach taken by the Executive Committee), as well as an update to the BBVA Group's General Risk Management and Control Model. These were submitted to the Board of Directors for its consideration and, where appropriate, its approval.\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the Committee reviewed reports on the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP), as well as regulatorily required adequacy proposals for capital and liquidity. This review was carried out to monitor the development of stress scenarios and verify their alignment with the approved Risk Appetite Framework, with assistance from the Risk, Finance and Regulation & Internal Control areas, amongst others. This made it possible to ensure that these reports and proposals faithfully reflected the Group's situation in the areas analysed prior to them being submitted for consideration by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee has participated in the annual review and updating of the Group's general risk management and control policies, both financial and non-financial, ensuring they are consistent with the Group's General Risk Management and Control Model.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee also confirmed that the model is adequate and that the Group has structural risk-management areas both at corporate level and in each geographical and/or business area. They added that these function correctly and provide the Committee with the information required to understand the Group's risk exposure at all times, thus enabling the Committee to fulfil its monitoring, supervision and control functions.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee has monitored the effectiveness of the Regulation & Internal Control area, involving itself in matters related to the Head of the area and ensuring that the area has the resources necessary to carry out its functions.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee has received monthly information from the Head of Regulation & Internal Control regarding the activity carried out by each of the units that comprise that area, with a focus on the work carried out to tackle the impact of the pandemic. In addition, the Committee has received periodic reports directly from the heads of Compliance, Non-Financial Risks and Internal Risk Control, all of which fall under the Regulation & Internal Control area.\n\nThroughout the 2020 financial year, the Risk and Compliance Committee monitored the evolution of the different risks to which the Group is exposed-both financial (e.g. credit risk, structural risks, market risk, insurance risk) and non-financial (mainly operational risks)-as part of the BBVA Group's General Risk Management and Control Model and in accordance with the Risk Appetite Framework approved by the Board of Directors.",

To further enhance its monitoring of the Risk Appetite Framework, the Committee received information about key internal and external variables that do not directly form part of the Risk Appetite Framework but affect its compliance. All of this prior to its follow-up by the other corporate bodies with risk functions.\n\nIn particular, and since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee has been continuously monitoring those risks most affected by the pandemic, with a focus on the behaviour of those credit portfolios which has been subject to legal or sectoral moratoria, as well as new lending operations granted with public guarantees.\n\nIn addition, the credit committees of Global Risk Management (GRM) informed the Risk and Compliance Committee periodically of the main credit risk operations in their respective areas of competency, as well as the Group's most significant cases of credit exposure. Each month, the Risk and Compliance Committee was also provided with information about the qualitative risk operations authorised by the committees of Global Risk Management.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee has analysed, in advance, the financial and non-financial risks of corporate operations submitted for consideration by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee received recurring information on the evolution of metrics and analysis in terms of profitability and capital, which evaluate the alignment of the resulting pricing in the financing and credit activity against the risk strategy and risk transfer in the Group.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee monitored the profitability of portfolios and businesses and the performance of the profitability indicators incorporated into the Bank's Risk Appetite Framework. All of this enabled the Committee to confirm that the prices of the assets and liabilities offered to customers were aligned with the Bank's business model and risk strategy.\n\nThe Committee was involved in establishing the multi-year performance indicators for the 2020 Annual Variable Remuneration, as well as the scales of achievement for the multi-year performance indicators for the 2019 Annual Variable Remuneration, analysing their alignment with appropriate, effective and prudent risk management, prior to their submission to the Board by the Remunerations Committee.\n\nThe Committee was informed of the Risk area's structure, resources and incentive scheme as well as its means, systems and tools (including those in development stage), having verified that the Group has adequate resources in relation to its strategy.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee participated in the review of the Group's Recovery Plan with a view to assessing its alignment with the Risk Appetite Framework approved by the Group and analysing the risk scenarios used, with the help of the Risk and Finance areas, inter alia, before being submitted to the Executive Committee and subsequently the Board of Directors for consideration.\n\nRegarding the functions of the Committee in relation to compliance, it should be noted first and foremost that during the 2020 financial year, the Committee analysed each of the policies prepared by the executive areas in this regard (e.g. conflicts of interest, anti-corruption), issuing its favourable opinion prior to their submission to the board to be approved or updated. Before being approved by the Board of Directors, the Committee also examined the new Charter of the Compliance Function, which was updated in 2020 to  ensure  its  alignment  with  new  regulations,  supervisory  expectations  and  the  BBVA  Group's organisational structure.",

The Committee examined the findings of the independent review processes carried out both internally within the Group and externally by the competent authorities, as well as the degree of progress in implementing planned measures within the various areas of activity (e.g. conduct, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, data protection). It also specifically monitored the activity of the Compliance Unit in relation to the MiFID regulations and bank transparency.\n\nMoreover, the Committee was informed, as often as appropriate, of the findings of external audits and any other reviews carried out by external experts on compliance-related matters, including existing internal control measures concerning the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nSimilarly, the Committee also monitored the main legal risks deriving from litigation to which the Group is exposed. Furthermore, regarding compliance with applicable internal regulations, the Committee was informed by the heads of the relevant executive areas of any pertinent compliance-related issues concerning the implementation of internal regulation (e.g. general policies, procedures) approved by the Group.\n\nRegarding  BBVA's  Crime  Prevention  and  Criminal  Risk  Management  Model,  the  Committee  was informed of its development over the course of the financial year and the main lines of work involved in relation to the model's various elements.\n\nThe Committee was also informed by the head of the Compliance Unit-the unit responsible for promoting and ensuring, in an independent and objective manner, that BBVA acts with integrity, particularly in areas such as anti-money laundering, conduct with clients, security market conduct, anti-corruption and other aspects of corporate conduct-of the functioning of the whistleblowing channel, as well as of the noteworthy aspects of the area.\n\nFinally, the Committee analysed the degree of implementation of the Compliance Unit's Annual Plan for the 2019 financial year. It also examined the Annual Plan set out for 2020, as well as monitoring its progress in terms of implementation, which was impacted by the crisis and extraordinary activity carried out following the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nRegarding communications and recommendations from supervisors, the Committee was made aware of the major communications and inspections carried out by the Group's supervisory bodies, whether national or foreign, being informed, where appropriate, of the recommendations, weaknesses or areas of improvement identified, as well as the action plans and other measures established by the relevant executive areas in order to overcome them in time.\n\nFinally, during the 2020 financial year, the Risk and Compliance Committee verified the progress and effectiveness of the various actions and initiatives drawn up by the Risk and Regulation & Internal Control areas to strengthen the risk and compliance culture in the Group, so as to enable employees to perform their duties in a secure environment, and to encourage the mitigation of risks, both financial and nonfinancial, to which their activities are exposed.\n\n- \uf0b7 Technology and Cybersecurity Committee: The Regulations of the Technology and Cybersecurity Committee set out the operational principles of the Committee and lay down the basic rules of its organisation and operation.

All other matters not provided for in the aforementioned Regulations will be subject to the Regulations of the Board of Directors, insofar as they are applicable.\n\nWith regard to the most relevant actions carried out by the Technology and Cybersecurity Committee during the 2020 financial year, the Committee has received information on the Group's technology strategy from the heads of the Engineering and Organization Area, regarding the main strategic projects and plans defined by that Area, with a focus on those related to resilience, cloud infrastructure, banking functionalities and the development of engineering solutions for the areas and the data platform. Additionally, the input of external advisers was made available to the Committee in order to strengthen the Committee's independence in the performance of this function.\n\nWithin the context of these plans and projects, the Committee has been informed of technological trends and of other issues pertaining to new technologies, applications, IT systems and best practices that affect or may affect the Group's technology strategy or plans.\n\nThe Committee has received recurring updates on the metrics established by the Group for management and control in the technological field.\n\nIn relation to the Committee's functions in the area of technological risk supervision and cybersecurity management for the Group, firstly, since the beginning of the crisis caused by COVID-19, the Committee was informed about (a) the management of business continuity from an operational point of view; (b) the move to remote working by the vast majority of staff; and (c) the strengthening of the Group's operational capabilities and other cybersecurity and fraud management measures during the pandemic.\n\nAlso, the Committee received information about the updated framework of technological risks to which the Group is exposed, as well as the measures for identifying, managing, monitoring and mitigating such risks.\n\nIn particular, the Committee has been provided with further detail on identification, management, monitoring and mitigation of IT-related risks faced by the Group as a result of services that are contracted to suppliers; along with the main risks associated with the use of shadow IT elements.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee has been informed of how the Bank complies with the EBA's ICT guidelines in relation to IT and security risk management.\n\nThe Committee was also informed of progress made in relation to the business continuity strategy and lessons learnt as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the main programmes in the field of cybersecurity and was informed about progress made, the implementation of artificial intelligence solutions, the evolution of the established metrics and future plans.\n\nFinally, at each of its meetings, the Committee also received information on the main cybersecurityrelated events at industry level and on those that are relevant to the BBVA Group.

In particular, the Internal Standards of Conduct in the Securities Markets establishes that all persons subject to them must notify the head of their area or the Compliance unit of situations that could potentially and under specific circumstances may entail conflicts of interest that might compromise their impartiality, before they engage in any transaction or conclude any business in the securities market in which such may arise.\n\nTo complement Section E.3 of this report, and in relation to Preliminary Proceeding No. 96/2017 - Piece No. 9regarding the provision of services by Centro Exclusivo de Negocios y Transacciones, S.L. (Cenyt) to the Bank, since 2019 this issue was reported on a recurrent basis to the Bank's corporate bodies, namely to the Board of Directors and also to its committees that have functions in relation to this matter (the Audit Committee and the Risk and Compliance Committee). These bodies have driven and overseen internal investigation procedures, ensuring that the Bank fully cooperates with the judicial authorities and develops a policy of transparency.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Bank's management bodies have continued to adopt various measures to strengthen the Bank's internal monitoring systems, outlined in the Compliance System section of the NonFinancial Information Statement included in the Individual and Consolidated Management Reports for the 2020 financial year, which include this Annual Corporate Governance Report. These measures include the approval of  new  policies  and  other  internal  developments,  improvements  in  internal  control  processes  and  the strengthening of the crime prevention model.\n\nIt is also worth noting that relevant documentation obtained from the forensic investigation hired in 2019 to help to clarify the events does not indicate any implication by any of the current members of the Board of Directors nor the Executive Chairman of the Bank, and it has not been proven that the Bank has committed any criminal activity. BBVA sustains that no criminal responsibility for the Entity is derived from the investigated events.\n\nIt must also be stressed that, to date, the case has not impacted the development of the Bank's business, nor has it negatively impacted the Bank's reputation indices, which are subject to recurrent monitoring by both the executive team and by its management bodies.\n\nBBVA has created a specific area on its corporate web page with information on issues related to the Cenyt case (https://www.bbva.com/en/specials/the-cenyt-case/).\n\nTo supplement Recommendation 64 included in Section G, it is expressly noted that, in accordance with BBVA Directors' Remuneration Policy, approved by the 2019 General Shareholders' Meeting, the Bank has no commitments to pay severance indemnity to executive directors.\n\nAs detailed in said Remuneration Policy, the contractual framework defined for executive directors establishes a post-contract non-compete agreement for a two-year period after they cease as BBVA executive directors, provided that said leave is not due to retirement, disability or serious breach of duties. As compensation for this agreement,  executive  directors  will  receive  remuneration  of  an  amount  equivalent  to  one  annual  fixed remuneration per year of duration, which shall be paid monthly over the course of the two-year duration of the non-compete agreement.\n\nAs described in Section C.1.3 above, the Bank has undertaken welfare commitments to cover retirement, disability and death contingencies with the Group Executive Chairman, which conditions are described in the BBVA Directors' Remuneration Policy. With regard to the pension commitment, this is established as a definedcontribution scheme, according to which the annual contributions to be made to cover retirement are set in advance. Pursuant to this commitment, the Group Executive Chairman is entitled to a retirement benefit when he reaches the legally established retirement age, which amount shall result from the sum of the contributions made by the Bank and their corresponding yields up to said date, provided that his leave is not due to serious breach of his duties. The system do not provide for the possibility of receiving the retirement pension in advance.\n\nRegarding adherence to codes of ethics or good practice, the BBVA Board of Directors approved in 2011 the Bank's adhesion to the C\u00f3digo de Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Tributarias (Code of Good Tax Practices) approved by the Large Corporations Forum according to the wording proposed by the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT). The Group meets the obligations assumed as a result of this adherence and, during the 2020 financial year, voluntarily prepared and submitted to the Spanish Tax Agency the Annual Fiscal Transparency Report for companies",

Introduction, basis  for  the  presentation of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, Internal Control over Financial Reporting and other information\n\n## 1.1 Introduction\n\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria, S.A. (hereinafter 'the Bank', 'BBVA\" or 'BBVA, S.A.') is a private-law entity subject to the laws and regulations governing banking entities operating in Spain. It carries out its activity through branches and agencies across the country and abroad.\n\nThe Bylaws  and other public information are available  for inspection at the Bank's registered address (Plaza  San Nicol\u00e1s,  4 Bilbao) as noted on its web site (www.bbva.com).\n\nIn addition to the activities  it carries  out directly, the Bank heads a group of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates  which perform a wide range of activities and which together with the Bank constitute the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Group (hereinafter, the 'Group' or the  'BBVA Group'). In addition to its  own  separate  financial  statements, the  Bank  is  required  to  prepare  Consolidated  Financial Statements comprising all consolidated subsidiaries of the Group.\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, the BBVA Group had 269 consolidated entities and 48 entities accounted for using the equity method (see Notes 3 and 16 and Appendix I to V).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the BBVA Group for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meetings ('AGM') held on March 13, 2020.\n\nBBVA Group's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Financial Statements for the Bank and the majority of the remaining entities within the Group have been prepared as of December 31, 2020, and are pending approval by their respective AGMs. Notwithstanding, the Board of Directors of the Bank understands that said financial statements will be approved without changes.\n\n## 1.2 Basis for the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe BBVA Group's Consolidated Financial  Statements are  presented in compliance  with IFRS-IASB (International Financial  Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board), as well as in accordance with the International Financial R epo rting Standards endorsed by the European Union (hereinafter, 'EU-IFRS') applicable  as of December  31, 2020, considering the Bank of Spain Circular  4/2017,  and  with  any  other legislation  governing financial  reporting which  is  applicable  and  with  the  format  and  mark-up requirements established in the EU Delegated Regulation 2019/815 of the European Commission.\n\nThe  BBVA Group's accompanying  Consolidated Financial  Statements for the  year  ended  December  31, 2020  were  prepared  by  the Group's Directors  (through  the  Board  of  Directors  meeting  held  on  February  8,  2021)  by  applying  the  principles  of  consolidation, accounting policies and valuation criteria described in Note 2, so that they present fairly the Group's total consolidated equity and financial position as of December 31, 2020, together with the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows generated during the year en d ed December 31, 2020.\n\nThese Consolidated Financial  Statements were  prepared on the basis of the accounting records kept by the Bank and each of the other entities in the Group. Moreover, they include  the adjustments and reclassifications  required to harmonize  the accounting policies  and valuation criteria used by the Group (see Note 2.2).\n\nAll effective  accounting standards and valuation criteria with a significant effect in the Consolidated Financial Statements were applied in their preparation.\n\nThe  amounts reflected  in  the accompanying  Consolidated Financial  Statements  are  presented  in millions  of  euros, unless it  is more appropriate to use smaller  units. Some items that appear without a balance  in these Consolidated Financial  Statements are due to how the units are  expressed. Also, in presenting amounts in millions of euros, the accounting balances  have been  rounded up or down. It is therefore possible that the totals appearing in some tables are not the exact arithmetical sum of their component figures.\n\nThe percentage changes in amounts have been calculated using figures expressed in thousands of euros.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n## 1.3 Comparative information\n\nThe information included in the accompanying consolidated financial  statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, is presented in accordance with the applicable regulation, for the purpose of comparison with the information for the year en d ed December 31, 2020.\n\n## Agreement for the sale of BBVA's U.S. subsidiary to PNC Financial Service  Group\n\nAs mentioned in Note 3, in 2020 BBVA reached an agreement to sell its entire stake in BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc., parent company of the Group companies engaged in the banking business in the United States. As required by IFRS 5 \"Non-current assets held for sale  and discontinued operations\", the balances of assets and liabilities corresponding to said companies for sale have been reclassified  from their corresponding accounting headings to the headings \"Non-current assets and disposal groups classified  as held for sale' and 'Liabilities included  in  disposal  groups classified  as  held  for sale'  respectively,  from the consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of December  31, 2020. Similarly,  as  required  by  the  aforementioned  IFRS 5, the  results generated  by  these  companies  during the financial  year  2020  are presented in the heading 'Profit (loss) after taxes from discontinued operations' of the consolidated income statement for such year, and in the heading \"Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale\"  in the consolidated statements of recognized income and expense  for such year.  Additionally, the results corresponding to the years 2019  and 2018 have  been reclassified,  to facilitate  the comparison between  years,  to that same  section  of the respective  consolidated  income  statements and consolidated  statements of recognized income and expense for both years. Finally, in the consolidated statements of cash flows, the balances corresponding to cash and cash equivalents have been reclassified  to the heading \"Total cash and cash equivalents classified as non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale\" as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nNote  21  includes  the condensed  consolidated  balance  sheets, the  condensed  consolidated  income  statements  and  the  condensed consolidated cash flow statements of the companies for sale in the United States as of and for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nConsidering the interpretation issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) in its 'IFRIC Update' of March  2020  on IAS 29  'Financial  information in  hyperinflationary  economies',  the  Group made  an  accounting  policy  change  which involves recording the differences  generated when translating the restated financial  statements of the subsidiaries  in hyperinflationary economies into euros in the line item 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified  to profit or loss - Foreign currency translation' of our consolidated balance sheet net equity.\n\nIn order  to  make  the  information  as  of  December  31,  2019  and  2018  comparable  with  information  as  of  December  31,  2020,  such information has been restated by reclassifying  \u20ac2,985 million  and \u20ac2,987 million,  respectively,  from 'Shareholders' funds - Retained earnings' and \u20ac6 million and \u20ac20 million, respectively, from 'Shareholders' funds - Other reserves' to the headings 'Accumulated o t h er comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified  to profit or loss -  Foreign currency translation and 'Accumulated other comprehensive  income  (loss)  -  Items that may  be reclassified  to profit or loss -  Share  of  other recognized  income  and expense  of investments in joint ventures and associates' as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe  reclassifications  corresponding to January  1,  2020  and  2019  are  included  as  \"Effect  of  changes  in  accounting  policies\"  in  the Consolidated Total Statements of Changes in Equity corresponding to the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n## IFRS 9- collection of interest on impaired financial  assets\n\nAs a consequence of the application of the interpretation issued by the IFRIC in its 'IFRIC Update' of March 2019 regarding the collection of interest on impaired financial assets under IFRS 9, such collections are presented since 2020 as reductions in credit-related write-offs whereas  previously  they  were  included  as  interest income.  In  order to make  the  information comparable,  the consolidated  income statement information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 has been restated by recognizing a \u20ac78 and \u20ac80 million reduction in the heading 'Interest and other income', respectively against the heading 'Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss or net gains by modification'. This reclassification has had no net impact on the profit for the years  ended December  31, 2019  and  2018,  respectively,  nor on the consolidated  net equity as  of  December  31, 2019  and 2018, respectively.\n\n## Trading derivatives recognition\n\nInformation as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been subject to certain non-significant presentation modifications, in  the balance  sheet related to the derivative  activity. In order to make  the information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 comparable with the information as of and for the year ended December  31, 2020, figures as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been restated by recognizing a \u20ac953 million and a \u20ac1,013 million reduction in the Total Assets and Total Liabilities, respectively.\n\n## 1.4 Seasonal nature of income and expense\n\nThe nature of the most significant activities carried  out by the BBVA Group's entities is mainly  related to typical activities carried  out by financial  institutions, and are not significantly affected by seasonal factors within the same year.",

The pandemic has affected and continues to adversely affect  the world economy and economic activity and conditions in the countries in which the Group operates, leading many of them to economic recession. The governments of the different countries in which the Group operates have adopted different measu r es that have conditioned the evolution of the year (see Note 7.2).\n\nIn this pandemic situation, BBVA has focused its attention on ensuring the continuity of the business operational security as a priority and monitoring the impacts on the business and on the risks of the Group (such as the impacts on results, capital or liquidity). Additionally, BBVA adopted from the beginning a series  of measures  to support its main interest groups. In this sense, the purpose and the Group's long-term strategic priorities  remain  the same  and are  even  reinforced,  with a  commitment to technology and data-driven decisionmaking.\n\nWith the aim  of mitigating the impact  of COVID-19, various  European and  International bodies  have made  pronouncements aimed  at allowing  greater  flexibility  in  the  implementation  of  the  accounting and  prudential  frameworks.  The  BBVA Group has  taken  these pronouncements into consideration when preparing these consolidated financial statements (see Note 7.2.1).\n\nThe main impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in the BBVA Group's consolidated Financial Statements are detailed in the following Notes:\n\n- Note 1.6 includes information on the consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic in the estimates made.\n- Note 4 mentions the amendment of the Group's shareholder remuneration policy, in accordance with the recommendation issued by the European Central Bank, which  no longer pays any amount as a dividend  for the financial  year  2020  until as  long as the uncertainties generated by the pandemic remain.\n- Note 7.1 details the main risks associated with the pandemic as well as the impacts that have occurred both in the operations and in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. Information on the impact of COVID-19 is included in the macroeconomic forecasts and in the calculation of expected losses.\n- Note 7.2 includes information related to the initiatives carried  out by the Group to help the most affected  clients, jointly with the corresponding governments. Likewise,  it contains, among others, information regarding the level  of  activity  and  the amount corresponding to moratorium measures, both public and private, granted by the Group worldwide.\n- Note 7.5 presents information regarding the impact on liquidity and financing risk.\n- Note 18.1 includes information concerning the impairment of the goodwill in the United States carried out during the first q u ar t er of 2020, mainly  due to the impact of COVID-19 in updating the macroeconomic  scenario and the expected evolution of interest rates.\n- Note 32 includes information with regard to the impact on the Group's capital.\n- Note 47 includes information on the impact of the update of the macroeconomic scenario affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 1.6 Responsibility for the information and for the estimates made\n\nThe information contained in the BBVA Group's Consolidated Financial Statements is the responsibility of the Group's Directors.\n\nEstimates were required to be made at times when preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements in order to calculate the recorded or disclosed amount of some assets, liabilities, income, expense and commitments. These estimates relate mainly to the following:\n\n- Loss allowances on certain financial assets (see Notes 7, 12, 13, 14 and 16).\n- The assumptions used to quantify certain provisions (see Notes 23 and 24) and for the actuarial calculation of post-employment benefit liabilities  and commitments (see Note 25).\n- The useful life and impairment losses of tangible and intangible assets (see Notes 17, 18, 20 and 21).\n- The valuation of goodwill and price allocation of business combinations (see Note 18).\n- The fair value of certain unlisted financial assets and liabilities  (see Notes 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 13).\n- The recoverability  of deferred tax assets (see Note 19).\n\nAs mentioned before, on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (see Note 1.5). The  great  uncertainty associated  to the  unprecedented  nature of  this  pandemic  entails  a  greater  complexity  of  developing  reliable estimations and applying judgment.",

However, it is possible that events may take place  in the future which could make  it necessary  to amend these estimations (upward or downward),  which  would  be  carried  out prospectively,  recognizing  the  effects  of  the  change  in  estimation  in  the  corresponding consolidated income statement.\n\nDuring 2020 there have been no relevant changes in the assumptions and estimates made as of December  31, 2019 and 2018, with the exception of those indicated in these consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 1.7 BBVA Group's Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nBBVA Group's Consolidated Financial  Statements are  prepared  under  an Internal  Control over Financial  Reporting Model (ICFR). It provides reasonable  assurance with respect to the reliability and the integrity of the consolidated financial statements. It is also aimed to ensure that the transactions are processed in accordance  with the applicable  laws and regulations.\n\nThe ICFR is in accordance with the control framework established in 2013 by the 'Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission' (hereinafter, \"COSO\"). The COSO  2013 framework  sets five components that constitute the basis of the effectiveness and efficiency  of the internal control systems:\n\n- The establishment of an appropriate control framework.\n- The assessment of the risks that could arise during the preparation of the financial information.\n- The design of the necessary  controls to mitigate the identified risks.\n- The establishment of an appropriate system of information to detect and report system weaknesses.\n- The monitoring activities over the controls to ensure they perform correctly and are effective  over time.\n\nThe ICFR is a dynamic model that evolves continuously over time to reflect the reality of the BBVA Group's businesses and processes, as well as the risks and controls designed to mitigate them. It is subject to a continuous evaluation by the internal control units located in the different entities of BBVA Group.\n\nThese internal control units are integrated within the BBVA internal control model, defined and led by Regulation & Internal Control, and which is based in two pillars:\n\n- A control system organized into three lines of defense that has been updated and strengthened in 2020, as described below:\n- \u00b7 The first line of defense (1LoD) is located within the business and support units, which are responsible for identifying risks associated  with their processes, as well  as for implementing and executing the necessary  controls to mitigate them. In 2019, in order to reinforce the adequate risk management in each area's processes, the role of the Risk Control Assurer was created.\n- \u00b7 The second line of defense (2LoD) comprises the specialized  control units for each type of risk (Finance, Legal, IT, Third Party, Compliance or Processes among others). This second line defines the mitigation and control frameworks for their areas  of  responsibility  across  the  entire  organization  and  performs  challenge  to  the control  model  (supervises  the implementation and design of the controls and assesses their effectiveness).\n- \u00b7 The third line of defense (3LoD) is the Internal Audit unit, which conducts an independent review  of the model, verifying the compliance and effectiveness  of the model.\n- A committee structure in the Group, called  Corporate Assurance, which enables  the escalation  of possible  weaknesses  and internal control issues to the management at a Group level and also in each of the countries where the Group operates.\n\nThe internal control units within Finance comply with a common and standard methodology established at the Group level, as set out in the following diagram:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Companies Processes Risk Controls   | Selection of  evaluation Scope 01   | 02 Documentation of process models                                                                                 | Risk identification evaluation and  prioritization 03                                                                             | 04 Documentation of control models        | 05 Identification and  management of  residual risk                                            | 06 Evaluation of the effectiveness of the ICFR                            |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Companies Processes Risk Controls   | Selection of  evaluation Scope 01   | Definition and  documentation of  the processes ' map that is directly and  indirectly involved in the preparation | Identification of risks linked to processes that can trigger errors in the financial information.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n## 2. Principles of  consolidation, accounting policies and measurement bases  applied and recent IFRS pronouncements\n\nThe  Glossary  includes  the  definition  of  some  of  the  financial  and  economic  terms  used  in  Note  2  and  subsequent  Notes  of  the accompanying consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.1 Principles of consolidation\n\nIn terms of its consolidation, in accordance  with the criteria  established by IFRS, the BBVA Group is made  up of four types of entities: subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and structured entities, defined as follows:\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group (for definition of control, see Glossary). The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully  consolidated with those of the Bank. The share of non-controlling interests from subsidiaries in the Group's consolidated total equity is presented under the heading 'Minority interests (Non-controlling interests)' in the consolidated balance  sheet. Their share in the profit or loss for the period or year  is presented under the heading 'Attributable to minority interest (non-controlling interests)' in the accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 31).\n\nNote  3 includes  information related  to the main  subsidiaries  in the  Group as  of December  31, 2020.  Appendix I  includes  other significant information on all entities.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are  those entities for which  there is a  joint arrangement to joint control with third parties other than the Group (for definitions of joint arrangement, joint control and joint venture, refer to Glossary).\n\nThe investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see Note 16). Appendix II shows the main figures for joint ventures accounted for using the equity method as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates are entities in which the Group is able to exercise significant influence (for definition of significant influence, see Glossary). Significant influence is deemed  to exist when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights of an investee directly or indirectly, unless it can be clearly  demonstrated that this is not the case.\n\nHowever, certain entities in which the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights are not included as Group associates, since the Group does not have  the ability  to exercise  significant  influence  over  these entities. Investments in  these entities, which  do not represent material  amounts for the Group, are classified  as 'Financial  assets at fair value  through other comprehensive income' or 'Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nIn contrast, some investments in entities in which the Group holds less than 20%  of the voting rights are accounted for as Group associates, as  the Group is considered to have  the ability  to exercise  significant influence over these entities. As of December  31, 2020, these entities are not significant to the Group.\n\nAppendix II shows the most significant information related to the associates (see Note 16), which are accounted for using the equity method.\n\n## Structured Entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity that has been  designed so that voting or similar  rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the voting rights relate to administrative matters only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements (see Glossary).\n\nIn those cases  where  the Group sets up entities or has a holding in such entities, in order to allow its customers access to certain investments,  to transfer  risks  or  for  other  purposes, in  accordance  with  internal  criteria  and  procedures  and  with  applicab le regulations, the Group determines  whether control over the entity in question actually  exists  and therefore whether it should be subject to consolidation.\n\nSuch methods and procedures determine whether there is control by the Group, considering how the decisions are made about the relevant  activities,  assessing  whether  the  Group  has  control  over  the  relevant  elements,  exposure  to  variable  returns  from involvement with the investee and the ability to use control over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.\n\n## Structured entities subject to consolidation\n\nTo determine  if a  structured entity is controlled by the Group, and  therefore should be  consolidated into the Group, the existing contractual rights (different from the voting rights) are analyzed. For this reason, an analysis  of the structure and purpose of each investee is performed and, among others, the following factors will be considered:\n\n- -Evidence  of the current ability to manage the relevant activities  of the investee  according to the specific business needs (including any decisions that may arise only in particular circumstances).\n- -Potential existence of a special  relationship with the investee.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n- -Implicit or explicit Group commitments to support the investee.\n- -The ability to use the Group's power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group's returns.\n\nThese types of entities include  cases where  the Group has a high exposure to variable  returns and retains decision-making power over the investee, either directly or through an agent.\n\nThe main structured entities of the Group are the asset securitization funds, to which the BBVA Group transfers loans and advances, and other vehicles, which allow the Group's customers to gain access to certain investments or to allow for the transfer of risks or for other purposes (see Appendices I and V). The BBVA Group maintains the decision-making power over the relevant activities of t h ese vehicles  and financial  support through securitized market standard contracts. The most common ones are: investment positions in equity note tranches, funding through subordinated debt, credit enhancements  through derivative instruments or liquidity lines, management rights of defaulted securitized assets, 'clean-up' call  derivatives, and asset repurchase clauses by the grantor.\n\nFor these reasons, the loans and receivable  portfolios related to the vast majority of the securitizations carried  out by the Bank or Group subsidiaries are not derecognized in the books of said entity and the issuances of the related debt securities are recorded as liabilities  within the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFor additional information on the accounting treatment for the transfer and derecognition of financial  instruments, see Note 2.2.2. 'Transfers and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities'.\n\n- Non-consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group owns other vehicles also  for the purpose of allowing customers access  to certain investments, to transfer risks, and for other purposes, but without the Group having control of the vehicles,  which  are  not consolidated  in  accordance  with  IFRS  10  'Consolidated Financial Statements'. The balance  of assets and liabilities  of these vehicles  is not material in relation to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs of December  31, 2020,  there was  no material  financial  support from the Bank or its subsidiaries  to unconsolidated structured entities.\n\nThe Group does not consolidate any of the mutual funds it manages since the necessary control conditions are not met. Particularly, the BBVA Group does not act as arranger but as agent since it operates the mutual funds on behalf and for the benefit of investors or parties (arranger  or arrangers) and, for this reason  it does not control the mutual funds when exercising  its authority for decision making.\n\nThe mutual funds managed by the Group are not considered structured entities (generally, retail funds without corporate identity over which investors have participations which gives them ownership of said managed equity). These funds are not dependent on a capital structure that could prevent them from carrying out activities without additional financial support, being in any case insufficient as far as the activities themselves are concerned. Additionally, the risk of the investment is absorbed by the fund participants, and the Group is only exposed when it becomes a participant, and as such, there is no other risk for the Group.\n\nIn all  cases, the operating results of equity method investees acquired by the BBVA Group in a particular period only include the period from the date of acquisition to the financial statements date. Similarly, the results of entities disposed of during any year only include the period from the start of the year to the date of disposal.\n\nThe consolidated financial  statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have the same presentation date as the Consolidated Financial Statements. If financial statements at those same dates are not available,  the most recent will be used, as long as these are not older than three months, and adjusted to take into account the most significant transactions. As of December  31, 2020, financial  statements as of December  31 of all  Group entities were  utilized except for the case  of the consolidated financial  statements of 6 associates deemed  non-significant for which financial  statements as of November 30, 2020 were used.\n\n## Separate financial  statements\n\nThe separate financial  statements of the parent company of the Group are  prepared under Spanish regulations (Circular  4/2017 of the Bank  of Spain,  and following  other regulatory requirements of  financial  information applicable  to the Bank). The  Bank uses  the cost method to account in its separate financial statements for its investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities, which are consistent with the requirements of Bank of Spain Circular 4/2017 and IAS 27 'Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements'.\n\nAppendix IX shows BBVA's financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## 2.2 Accounting principles and policies and applied valuation methods\n\nThe accounting principles and policies and the valuation methods applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements may differ from those used, at the individual level,  by some of the entities that are  part of the BBVA Group; This is why, in the consolidation process, the necessary  adjustments and reclassifications  are  made to standardize  such principles  and criteria among themselves  and bring them into line with the IFRS-EU.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nIn preparing the accompanying consolidated Annual Accounts, the following accounting principles and policies  and assessment criteria have been applied:\n\n## 2.2.1 Financial instruments\n\nIFRS 9 became  effective as of January 1, 2018 and replaced  IAS 39 regarding the classification  and measurement of financial  assets and liabilities,  the impairment  of financial  assets  and  hedge accounting. However,  the Group has  chosen to continue applying IAS 39  for accounting for hedges, until the completion of the macro-hedging project of IFRS 9 as permitted by IFRS 9.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\n## Classification of financial  assets\n\nIFRS 9 contains three main categories for financial assets classification: measured at amortized cost, measured at fair value with changes through other comprehensive income, and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification  of financial  instruments in the categories of amortized cost or fair value  depends on the business model with which the entity manages  the assets and the contractual characteristics  of the cash flows, commonly known as the \"solely payments of principle and interest\" criterion (hereinafter, the SPPI).\n\nThe assessment of the business model should reflect the way the Group manages groups of financial assets and does not depend on the intention for an individual  instrument. Thus, for each  entity within the BBVA Group there are  different business models  for managing assets.\n\nIn order to determine the business model, the following aspects are taken into account:\n\n- The way  in which the performance of the business model (and that of the assets which comprise such business model) is evaluated and reported to the entity's key personnel;\n- The risks and the way in which the risks that affect the performance of the business model are managed;\n- The way  in which business model managers are remunerated;\n- The frequency, amount and timing of sales in previous years, the reasons for such sales and expectations regarding future sales.\n\nRegarding the SPPI  test, the analysis  of the cash flows aims  to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the assets correspond only to payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding at the beginning of the transaction. Interest is understood here as the consideration for the time value of money; and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a specific  period; and for financing and structure costs, plus a profit margin.\n\nThe most significant judgments used by the Group in evaluating compliance with the conditions of the SPPI test are the following:\n\n- Modified time  value: in the event that a  financial  asset includes  a  periodic interest rate adjustment but the frequency  of this adjustment does not coincide with the term of the reference interest rate (for example, the interest rate reset every six months to a one-year rate), the Group assesses, at the time of the initial recognition, this mismatch to determine whether the contractual cash  flows (undiscounted) differ  significantly  or not from the cash flows  (undiscounted) of a benchmark  financial  asset, for which there would be no change in the time value of money. The defined tolerance  thresholds are 10%  for the differences  in each period and 5% for the analysis accumulated throughout the financial asset life.\n- Contractual clauses: The contractual clauses can modify the calendar or the amount of the contractual cash flows are analyzed to verify if the contractual cash flows that would be generated during the life of the instrument due to the exercise of those clauses are only payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. To do this, the contractual cash flows that may be generated before and after the modification are analyzed.\n\nThe main criteria taken into account in the analysis are:\n\n- o Early termination clauses: generally  a contractual clause that permits the debtor to prepay a debt instrument before maturity is consistent with SPPI when the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (which may include reasonable additional compensation for the early termination of the contract).\n- o Instruments with an interest rate linked to contingent events:\n- \uf0a7 An instrument whose interest rate is reset to a higher rate if the debtor misses a particular payment may meet the SPPI criterion because  of the relationship between missed payments and an increase in credit risk.\n- \uf0a7 An instrument with contractual cash flows that are indexed to the debtor's performance - e.g. net income or is adjusted based on a certain index or stock market value would not meet the SPPI criterion.\n- o Perpetual instruments: to the extent that they can be considered instruments with continuous (multiple) extension options, they meet the SPPI test if the contractual flows meet it.

The debt tranches of the instrument will comply with the requirement that their cash flows represent only payment of principal and interest on the outstanding principal if:\n- a) the contractual terms of the tranche being assessed for classification (without looking through to the underlying pool of financial  instruments) give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\n- b) the underlying pool of financial instruments comprises instruments with cash flow that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, and\n- c) the exposure to credit risk in the underlying pool of financial instruments inherent in the tranche is equal to or lower than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments (for example, the credit rating of the tranche being assessed for classification  is equal to or higher than the credit rating that would apply to a single tranche that funded the underlying pool of financial instruments)\n\nIn any event, the contractual conditions that, at the time of the initial  recognition, have a minimal  effect  on cash flows or depend on the occurrence of exceptional and highly unlikely events do not prevent compliance with the conditions of the SPPI test.\n\nBased on the above characteristics, financial  assets will  be classified  and valued as described below.\n\nA debt instrument will be classified  in the amortized cost portfolio if the two following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- The financial  asset is managed within a business model whose purpose is to maintain the financial assets to maturity, to receive contractual cash flows; and\n- The contractual conditions of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are only payments of principal and interest.\n\nA debt instrument will be classified  in the portfolio of financial  assets at fair  value with changes through other comprehensive income if the two following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- The financial  asset  is managed with a business model whose purpose combines collection of the contractual cash flows  and sale of the assets, and\n- The  contractual characteristics  of  the instrument generate  cash flows  which  only  represent the return of the principal  and interest.\n\nA  debt instrument  will  be  classified  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  profit and  loss  provided  that the entity's  business  model  for  their management or the contractual characteristics of its cash flows do not require classification into one of the portfolios described above.\n\nIn general, equity instruments will be measured at fair value through profit or loss. However the Group may make an irrevocable election, at initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the fair value through 'other comprehensive income'.\n\nFinancial assets will  only be reclassified  when BBVA Group decides to change the business model. In this case, all of the financial  assets assigned to this business model will be reclassified.  The change of the objective of the business model should occur before the date of the reclassification.\n\n## Measurement of financial  assets\n\nAll financial  instruments are initially  recognized at fair  value, plus, those transaction costs which are  directly attributable to the issue of the particular instrument, with the exception of those financial assets which are classified  at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAll changes in the value of financial  assets due to the interest accrual and similar  items are recorded in the headings \"Interest income and other similar income\" or \"Interest expenses\", of the consolidated income statement of the year  in which the accrual  occurred (see  Note 37), except for trading derivatives that are not economic and accounting hedges.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe changes in fair value after the initial recognition, for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, are treated as described below, according to the categories of financial  assets.\n\n## 'Financial  assets  held for trading', 'Non-trading financial  assets  mandatorily at fair  value  through profit and loss' or 'Financial  assets designated at fair value through profit or loss'\n\nFinancial  assets are recorded under the heading 'Financial  assets held for trading' if the objective of the business model is to generate gains by buying and selling these financial instruments or generate short-term results. The financial assets recorded in the heading 'Nontrading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss' are assigned to a business model which objective is to obtain the contractual cash flows and / or to sell those instruments but its contractual cash flows do not comply with the requirements of the SPPI test. Financial assets are classified  in 'Financial  assets designated at fair value through profit or loss' only if it eliminates  or significantly reduces a  measurement or recognition inconsistency (an 'accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or financial  liabilities, or recognizing gains or losses on them, on different bases.\n\nThe assets recognized under these headings of the consolidated balance  sheet are measured upon acquisition at fair value and changes in the fair value (gains or losses) are recognized as their net value under the headings 'Gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net', 'Gains (losses) on non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, net' and 'Gains (losses) on financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, net' in the accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 41). Changes in fair value resulting from variations in foreign exchange rates are recognized under the heading 'Exchange differences, net' in the accompanying consolidated income statements (Note 41).\n\n## 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income'\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nAssets recognized under this heading in  the consolidated balance  sheets are  measured  at  their fair  value.  This category of valuation implies  the  recognition of  the information  in  the income  statement as  if  it  were  an  instrument valued  at  amortized  cost, while  the instrument is valued at fair value in the balance sheet. Thus, both interest income on these instruments and the exchange differences and impairment that arise in their case are recorded in the profit and loss account, while subsequent changes in its fair value (gains or losses) are recognized temporarily (by the amount net of tax effect) under the heading 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - I t ems that may be reclassified  to profit or loss - Fair value changes of debt instruments measured at fair  value through other comprehensive income' in the consolidated balance  sheets (see Note 30).\n\nThe amounts recognized under the headings 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified  to pro fit or loss - Fair value  changes of financial  assets measured  at fair value through other comprehensive income' continue to form part of the Group's consolidated equity until the corresponding asset is derecognized from the consolidated balance  sheet or until a loss allowance is recognized on the corresponding financial instrument. If these assets are sold, these amounts are derecognized and included under the headings 'Gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities,  net' (see Note 41).\n\nThe net loss allowances  in 'Financial  assets at fair  value through other comprehensive income' over the year  are recognized under the heading  'Impairment or  reversal  of impairment  on financial  assets  not measured  at  fair  value  through profit or loss or  net gains by modification - Financial  assets at fair value  through other comprehensive income' (see Note 48) in the consolidated income statement for that period.\n\nInterest income on these instruments are recorded in the consolidated profit and loss account (see Note 37). Changes in foreign exchange rates are recognized under the heading 'Exchange differences, net\" in the accompanying consolidated income statements (see Note 41).\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAt the time of initial  recognition of specific  investments in equity instruments, the BBVA Group may  make  the irrevocable  decision to present subsequent changes  in fair  value  in other comprehensive  income. Subsequent changes in  this valuation will  be recognized in \"Other accumulated comprehensive income - Items that will not be reclassified  in results - Changes in the fair value of equity instruments measured  at fair value  with changes in other comprehensive  income\". Dividends received  from these investments are  recorded in the heading \"Dividend income\" in the consolidated income statement (see Note 38). These  instruments are not subject to the impairment model of IFRS 9.\n\n## 'Financial assets at amortized cost'\n\nThe assets under this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nNet loss allowances  of assets recorded under these headings arising  in each  period are  recognized under the heading 'Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial  assets not measured at fair value  through profit or loss or net gains by modification - financial assets measured at amortized cost' in the consolidated income statement for such period (see Note 47).\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\n## Classification of financial  liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS 9, financial liabilities  are classified  in the following categories:",

The Group has the option to designate irrevocably, on the initial moment of recognition, a financial liability as at fair value through profit or  loss  provided  that  doing  so  results  in  the  elimination  or  significant  reduction  of  measurement  or recognition inconsistency, or if a group of financial liabilities,  or a group of financial assets and financial  liabilities,  has to be managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.\n\n## Measurement of financial  liabilities\n\nFinancial  liabilities  are  initially recorded at fair value, less  transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the issuance  of instruments, except for financial instruments that are classified at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nVariations in the value of financial liabilities  due to the interest accrual and similar items are recorded in the headings 'Interest income and other similar income' or 'Interest expense', of the consolidated income statement for the period in which the accrual occurred (see Note 37), except for trading derivatives that are not economic and accounting hedges.\n\nThe changes in fair value after the initial recognition, for reasons other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, are treated as described below, according to the categories of financial  liabilities.\n\n## 'Financial liabilities  held for trading' and 'Financial liabilities  designated at fair value through profit or loss'\n\nThe subsequent changes in the fair value  (gains or losses) of the liabilities  recognized under these headings of the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as  their net value under the headings 'Gains  (losses) on financial  assets and liabilities  held for trading, net' and 'Gains  (losses) on financial  assets and liabilities  designated at fair  value  through profit or loss, net' in the accompanying  consolidated income statements (see Note 41). Nevertheless, the changes in the own credit risk of the liabilities  designated under the fair value option is presented in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss - Fair value changes of financial  liabilities  at fair value  through profit or loss attributable to changes in their credit risk', unless this treatment brings about or increases  an asymmetry in the income statement. However, changes in fair value resulting from variations in foreign exchange rates are recognized under the heading 'Exchange differences,  net' in the accompanying consolidated income statements (Note 41).\n\n## 'Financial liabilities  at amortized cost'\n\nThe liabilities  under this category are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the 'effective interest rate' method.\n\n## Hybrid financial  liabilities\n\nWhen a  financial  liability  contains an embedded  derivative,  the Group analyzes  whether the economic  characteristics  and risks  of the embedded derivative and the host instrument are closely related.\n\nIf the characteristics and risks of the host and the derivative are closely  related, the instrument as a whole will be classified  and measured according  to the  general  rules  for financial  liabilities.  If, on  the other hand, the economic  characteristics  and risks  of  the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host, its terms meet the definition of a derivative and the hybrid contract is not measured  at fair  value  with  changes in fair  value  recognized  in profit or loss, the embedded  derivative  shall  be separated from the host and accounted for as a derivative separately at fair value with changes in profit and loss and the host instrument will be classified  and measured according to its nature.\n\n## 'Derivatives-Hedge Accounting' and 'Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest-rate risk'\n\nThe Group uses financial  derivatives as a tool for managing financial risks, mainly interest rates and exchange rates (See  Note 7).\n\nWhen these transactions meet certain requirements, they are considered \"hedging\".\n\nChanges occurring subsequent to the designation of the hedging relationship in the measurement of financial instruments designated as hedged items as well as financial  instruments designated as hedge accounting instruments are recognized as follows:\n\n- In fair  value  hedges, the changes  in the fair  value  of the derivative  and the hedged item  attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized  under the  heading  'Gains  (losses)  from  hedge  accounting, net' in  the  consolidated  income  statement,  with  a corresponding offset under the headings where hedging items (\"Hedging derivatives\") and the hedged items are recognized, as applicable,  except for interest-rate risks hedges (which are almost all of the hedges used by the Group), for which the valuation changes  are  recognized  under  the  headings  'Interest  and  other  income'  or  'Interest  expense',  as  appropriate,  in  the accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 37).\n- In fair value hedges of interest rate risk of a portfolio of financial instruments (portfolio-hedges), the gains or losses that arise in the measurement  of the hedging instrument are  recognized in  the consolidated  income  statement, with the corresponding",

These  differences  are recognized under the headings 'Interest and other income' or 'Interest expense' at the time when the gain or loss in the h ed ged instrument affects profit or loss, when the forecast transaction is executed or at the maturity date of the hedged item (see Note 37).\n- Differences  in  the  measurement  of  the  hedging items  corresponding to the  ineffective  portions of  cash  flow  hedges  are recognized directly in the heading 'Gains (losses) from hedge accounting, net' in the consolidated income statement (see Note 41).\n- In the hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the differences attributable to the effective portions of hedging items are recognized temporarily under the heading \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - Hedging of net investments in foreign operations (effective  portion)\" in the consolidated balance sheets with a  balancing entry under the heading 'Hedging derivatives'  of the Assets or Liabilities  of the consolidated balance  sheets as applicable.  These differences  in valuation are  recognized under the heading 'Exchange differences,  net\" in the consolidated income statement when the investment in a foreign operation is disposed of or derecognized (see Note 41).\n\n## Loss allowances on financial assets\n\nThe 'expected losses' impairment model is applied  to financial assets valued at amortized cost, to debt instruments valued at fair value with  changes  in  other accumulated  comprehensive  income,  to financial  guarantee  contracts and  other commitments.  All  financial instruments valued at fair value through profit or loss are excluded from the impairment model\n\nThe standard classifies  financial  instruments into three categories, which depend on the evolution of their credit risk from the moment of initial  recognition. The first category includes  the transactions when they are  initially  recognized  (Stage 1); the second comprises  the financial  assets for which a significant increase in credit risk has been identified since its initial recognition (Stage 2) and the third one, the impaired financial  assets (Stage 3).\n\nThe calculation of the provisions for credit risk in each of these three categories must be done differently. In this way, expected loss up to 12  months for the  financial  assets  classified  in  the first  of  the aforementioned  categories  must be  recorded,  while  expected  losses estimated for the remaining life of the financial assets classified  in the other two categories must be recorded. Thus, IFRS 9 differentiates between the following concepts of expected loss:\n\n- Expected  loss  at  12  months: expected  credit  loss  that arises  from  possible  default  events  within  12  months following  the presentation date of the financial statements; and\n- Expected loss during the life of the transaction: this is the expected credit loss that arises from all possible default events over the remaining life  of the financial instrument.\n\nBoth, the modeling for expected losses estimates and the factors affecting such losses forecasts require considerable  judgment, which must be carried out on a weighted probability basis.\n\nThe BBVA Group has applied the following definitions:\n\n## Default\n\nThe Group has applied a definition of default for financial  instruments that is consistent with that used in internal credit risk management, and coherent with the definition applied  by the Group within the prudential context. The Group has considered the existence of default when one of the following situations occurs:\n\n- \u00b7 Payment past-due for more than 90 days; or\n- \u00b7 There are reasonable  doubts regarding the full reimbursement of the instrument.\n\nIn accordance  with IFRS 9, the 90-day past-due stipulation may be waived  in cases where  the entity considers it appropriate, based on reasonable  and  documented information  that it  is  appropriate  to use  a  longer  term. As  of  December  31,  2020,  the Group has  not considered periods higher than 90 days for any significant portfolio.\n\nThese  criteria  are  aligned  in  all  the geographies  where  the Group  operates, being  only  minor  differences  kept  in  order  to facilitat e management adoption al  a  national level.  In this sense,  national criteria  are  permitted, within the Group standards and searching  for",

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower,\n- \u00b7 A breach of contract (e.g. a default or past due event),\n- \u00b7 A lender having granted a concession to the borrower - for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial  difficulty - that the lender would not otherwise consider,\n- \u00b7 It becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization,\n- \u00b7 The disappearance  of an active market for that financial asset because  of financial difficulties, or\n- \u00b7 The purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.\n\nIt may  not be possible to identify a single  discrete event. Instead, the combined effect  of several  events may  cause  financial  assets to become credit-impaired.\n\nThe definition of impaired  financial assets in the Group is aligned with the definition of default explained in the above paragraphs.\n\nCredit risk management for wholesale  counterparties is carried  out at the customer (or group) level. For this reason, the classification of any of a client's exposures as impaired, whether due to more than 90 days of default or due to any of the subjective criteria, implies  the classification  as impaired of all  the client's exposures. There may be some justified exception that, in any case, are not significant.\n\nRegarding retail clients, which are  managed at the operation level, the scoring systems review  their score, among other reasons, in the event of a breach in any of their transactions which also triggers the necessary recovery actions. These include refinancing measures that, where  appropriate, may  lead  to all  customer transactions being considered  impaired.  Furthermore, given the granularity of the retail portfolios, the differential  behavior of these clients in relation to their products and collateral provided, as well as the time necessary to find the best solution, the Group has established as an indicator that when a transaction of a retail client has default in excess of 90 days and this represents more than 20% of the client's total balance, all  its transactions are considered impaired, this without prejudice to the fact that lower limits have been established due to management practices in some geography.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nThe objective of the impairment requirements is to recognize lifetime expected credit losses for financial instruments for which there have been  significant increases  in  credit risk since  initial  recognition considering all  reasonable  and  supportable information, including that which is forward-looking.\n\nThe model developed by the Group for assessing the significant increase  in credit risk has a two-prong approach that is applied globally (for more detail on the methodology used, see Note 7.2.1):\n\n- \u00b7 Quantitative criterion: the Group uses a quantitative analysis based on comparing the current expected probability of default over the life of the transaction with the original adjusted expected probability of default, so that both values are comparable in terms of expected default probability for their residual life  (see Note 7.2.1).\n- \u00b7 Qualitative criterion: most indicators for detecting significant risk increase are included in the Group's systems through rating and scoring systems or macroeconomic scenarios, so the quantitative analysis covers the majority of circumstances. The Group uses additional qualitative criteria to identify significant increase  in credit risk and thus, to include circumstances that are not reflected in the rating/score systems or macroeconomic scenarios used. Such qualitative criteria are the following:\n- o More than 30 days past due. According to IFRS 9, default of more than 30 days is a presumption that can be rebutted in  those cases  in which  the  entity considers,  based  on reasonable  and documented  information, that such nonpayment does not represent a significant increase  in risk. As of December  31, 2020, the Group has not considered periods higher than 30 days.\n- o Watch list: They are subject to special watch by the Risk units because they show negative signs in their credit quality, even though there may be no objective evidence of impairment.\n- o Refinance or restructuring that does not show evidence of impairment, or that, having been previously identified, the existence of significant increase  in credit risk is still considered.\n\nAlthough the standard introduces a series  of operational simplifications, also known as practical solutions, for analyzing the increase in significant risk, the Group does not use them as a general  rule. However, for high-quality assets, mainly  related to certain  government institutions and bodies, the standard allows for considering that their credit risk has not increased significantly because  they have a low",

This possibility is limited to those financial instruments that are classified as having high credit quality and high liquidity to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio ('LCR'). This does not prevent these assets from being assigned the credit\n\nrisk coverage that corresponds to their classification as Stage 1 based on their credit rating and macroeconomic expectations.\n\nThe classification  of financial  instruments subject to impairment under IFRS 9 is as follows:\n\n- Stage 1- without significant increase in credit risk\n\nFinancial assets which are not considered to have significantly increased in credit risk have loss allowances  measured at an amount equal to 12 months expected credit losses derived from defaults.\n\n- Stage 2- significant increases  in credit risk\n\nWhen the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since the initial recognition, the loss allowances  of that financial instrument is calculated as the expected credit loss during the entire life of the asset.\n\n- Stage 3 - Impaired\n\nWhen there is objective evidence that the instrument is credit impaired, the financial asset is transferred to this category in which the provision for losses of that financial instrument is calculated as the expected credit loss during the entire life of the asset.\n\nWhen the recovery of any recognized amount is considered remote, such amount is written-off on the consolidated balance sheet, without prejudice to any actions that may be taken in order to collect the amount until the rights extinguish in full either because it is time-barred debt, the debt is forgiven, or other reasons.\n\n## Method for calculating expected credit loss\n\n## Method for calculating expected loss\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the measurement of expected losses must reflect:\n\n- A considered and unbiased amount, determined by evaluating a range of possible results;\n- The time value of money, and\n- Reasonable and supportable information that is available  without undue cost or effort and that reflects current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nExpected losses are measured both individually and collectively\n\nThe individualized  estimate  of credit losses results from calculating the difference  between  the expected  cash flows  discounted at the effective  interest rate of the transaction and the carrying amount of the instrument (See Note 7.2.1).\n\nFor the collective measurement of expected losses the instruments are classified into groups of assets based on their risk characteristics. Exposure within each group is segmented according to credit risk common characteristics, which indicate the payment capacity of the borrower according to the contractual conditions. These risk characteristics have to be relevant in estimating the future flows of each group. The characteristics of credit risk may consider, among others, the following factors (see Note 7):\n\n- Type of instrument.\n- Rating or scoring tools.\n- Credit risk scoring or rating.\n- Type of collateral.\n- Amount of time at default for stage 3.\n- Segment.\n- Qualitative criteria which can have a significant increase in risk.\n- Collateral value if it has an impact on the probability of a default event.\n\nThe estimated losses are derived from the following parameters:\n\n- PD: estimate of the probability of default in each period.\n- EAD: estimate of the exposure in case  of default at each  future period, taking into account the changes in exposure after the presentation date of the financial statements.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n- LGD: estimate of the loss in case  of default, calculated  as the difference  between the contractual cash flows and receivables, including  guarantees. For these  purposes, the  probability  of  executing  the guarantee  is  considered  in  the estimation,  the moment until its ownership and subsequent realization, the expected cashflows and acquisition and sale costs.\n- CCF: cash conversion factor is the estimate made on off-balance  sheet to determine the exposure subject to credit risk in the event of a default.\n\nAt the BBVA Group, the calculated expected credit losses are based on internal models developed for all portfolios within the IFRS 9 scope, except for the cases that are subject to individual analysis.\n\nThe calculation and recognition of expected losses includes exposures with governments and credit institutions, for which, despite h aving a reduced number of defaults in the information databases, internal models have been developed, considering, as sources of information, the data  provided by external  rating agencies  or other observed in the market, such as changes in bond yields, prices of credit default swaps or any other public information on them.\n\n## Use of present, past and future information\n\nIFRS 9 requires incorporation of present, past and future information to detect any significant increase in risk and measure expected loss.\n\nThe standard does not require identification of all possible scenarios for measuring expected loss. However, the probability of a loss event occurring and the probability it will not occur have to be considered, even though the possibility of a loss may be very low. To achieve this, the Group generally evaluates the linear relationship between its estimated loss parameters (PD, GDP, EAD) with the historical and future forecasts of the macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, when there is no linear relation between the different future economic scenarios and their associated expected losses, more than one future economic scenario must be used for the measurement.\n\nThe approach used by the Group consists of using a methodology based on the use of three scenarios. The first is the most probable scenario (base  scenario) that is consistent with that used in the Group's internal management processes, and two additional ones, one more positive and the other more negative. The combined outcome of these three scenarios is calculated  considering the weight given to each of them. The main macroeconomic variables  that are valued in each of the scenarios for each of the geographies in which the Group operates are the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the real  estate price index, interest rates and the unemployment rate, although, in the first place, the main goal is seeking the greatest predictive capacity with respect to the former two (see Note 7.2.1).\n\n## 2.2.2 Transfers and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe accounting treatment of transfers of financial assets is determined by the form in which risks and benefits associated with the financial assets involved are transferred to third parties. Thus the financial assets are only derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet when the cash  flows that they generate are  extinguished, when their implicit  risks  and benefits  have been  substantially transferred  to third parties or when the control of financial asset is transferred even in case  of no physical transfer or substantial retention of such assets. In the latter case, the financial  asset transferred is derecognized from the consolidated balance  sheet, and any right or obligation retained or created as a result of the transfer is simultaneously recognized.\n\nSimilarly,  financial  liabilities  are derecognized from the consolidated balance  sheet only if their obligations are extinguished or acquired (with a view to subsequent cancellation or renewed placement).\n\nThe Group is considered to have transferred substantially all the risks and benefits if such risks and benefits account for the majority of the risks and benefits involved in ownership of the transferred financial assets. If substantially all the risks and benefits associated with the transferred financial  asset are retained:\n\n- The transferred financial  asset is not derecognized from the consolidated balance  sheet and continues to be measured using the same criteria as those used before the transfer.\n- A financial liability is recognized at the amount equal to the amount received, which is subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value with changes in the income statement, whichever the case.\n- Both the income  generated  on the transferred  (but not derecognized) financial  asset  and the  expense  of the new  financial liability  continue to be recognized.\n\n## Treatment of securitizations\n\nThe securitizations to which the Group entities transfer their credit portfolios are consolidated entities of the Group. For more in fo r mat ion, refer to Note 2.1 'Principles of consolidation'.\n\nThe Group considers that the risks and benefits of the securitizations are  substantially retained if the subordinated bonds are held and/ or if subordination funding has been granted to those securitization funds, which means that the credit loss risk of the securitized assets will be assumed. Consequently, the Group is not derecognizing those transferred loan portfolios.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nOn the other hand, the Group has carried out synthetic securitizations, which are transactions where risk is transferred through derivatives or financial  guarantees and in which  the exposure of these securitizations remains  in  the balance  sheet of the Group. The  Group has established the synthetic securitizations through received financial guarantees. As for the commissions paid, they are accrued during the term of the financial guarantee.\n\n## 2.2.3 Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are considered to be those contracts that require their issuer to make specific payments to reimburse the holder of the financial  guarantee for a loss incurred when a specific  borrower breaches  its payment obligations on the terms - whether original or subsequently modified -  of a debt instrument, irrespective  of the legal  form it may  take. Financial  guarantees may  take  the form of a deposit, bank guarantee, insurance contract or credit derivative, among others.\n\nIn their initial recognition, financial guarantees are recognized as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, which is generally the  present  value  of  the  fees,  commissions  and  interest  receivable  from  these  contracts  over  the  term  thereof,  and  the  Group simultaneously recognizes a corresponding asset in the consolidated balance sheet for the amount of the fees and commissions received at the inception of the transactions and the amounts receivable at the present value of the fees, commissions and interest outstanding.\n\nFinancial guarantees, irrespective of the guarantor, instrumentation or other circumstances, are reviewed periodically  so as to determine the credit  risk to which  they are  exposed  and, if  appropriate, to consider whether  a  provision is required  for them. The  credit risk  is determined  by  application  of  criteria  similar  to those established  for quantifying  loss allowances  on  debt instruments measured  at amortized cost (see Note 2.2.1).\n\nThe provisions recognized for financial  guarantees are  recognized under the heading 'Provisions - Provisions for contingent risks and commitments' on the liability  side in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 24). These provisions are recognized and reversed  with a charge or credit, respectively to 'Provisions or reversal of provision' in the consolidated income statements (see Note 46).\n\nIncome from financial  guarantees is recorded under the heading 'Fee  and commission income'  in the consolidated income statement and is calculated by applying the rate established in the related contract to the nominal amount of the guarantee (see Note 40).\n\nSynthetic securitizations made by the Group to date meet the requirements of the accounting regulations for accounting as guarantees. Consideration as a financial guarantee means recognition of the commission paid for it over the period.\n\n## 2.2.4 Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale\n\nThe heading ' Non-current assets and disposal groups classified  as held for sale ' in the consolidated balance  sheet includes the carrying amount of individual items or items integrated in a group (\"disposal group\") or that form part of a significant business line or geographic area that it is intended to be disposed of ( ' discontinued operation ' ) whose sale is highly probable that it will take place under the co n d it ions in which such assets are currently located within a period of one year from the date to which the financial  statements refer. Additionally, assets that were expected to be disposed of within a year but which disposal is delayed and is caused by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Group can be classified as held for sale (see Note 21).\n\nSymmetrically,  the heading ' Liabilities  included in disposal groups classified  as held for sale ' in the consolidated balance  sheet reflects the balances payable  arising from disposal groups and discontinued operations.\n\nThe heading \"Non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale\" includes the assets received by the subsidiaries for the satisfaction, in whole or in part, of the payment obligations of their debtors (foreclosed or received  in payment of debt or recoveries  from financial leasing transactions, unless the Group has decided  to make continued use of those assets). The BBVA Group has specific units focused on real estate management and sale of these types of assets.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified  as  held for sale  are  measured, at the acquisition date and at any later date  deemed necessary, at either their carrying amount or the fair value of the property (less costs to sell), whichever is lower. An impairment or reversal of impairment for the difference  is recognized if applicable.  When the amount of the sale  less estimated costs of sale  is higher than the carrying value, the gain is not recognized until the moment of disposal and derecognition from the balance sheet.\n\nNon-current assets  and disposal  groups held  for sale  groups classified  as  held for sale  are  not depreciated  while  included  under the heading ' Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale ' .\n\nIn the case  of real  estate assets  foreclosed or received  in payment of debts, they are  initially  recognized at the lower  of: the restated carrying amount of the financial  asset and the fair value at the time of the foreclosure or receipt of the asset less estimated sales costs. The carrying  amount of the financial  asset  is updated at the time  of the foreclosure, treating the real  property received  as a  secured collateral  and taking into account the credit risk coverage that would correspond to it according to its classification  prior to the delivery. For these purposes, the collateral will  be valued at its current fair value (less sale  costs) at the time of foreclosure. This carrying amount will  be compared  with the previous carrying amount and the difference  will  be  recognized as a provision increase,  if  applicable.  On the other hand, the fair value  of the foreclosed assets is based mainly  on appraisals  or valuations carried out by independent experts on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications of impairment by appraisal, evaluating the need to apply a discount on the asset",

The remaining income and expense items associated with these assets and liabilities  are classified  within the relevant consolidated income statement headings.\n\nIncome and expense  for discontinued operations, whatever their nature, generated during the year, even if they have occurred before their classification as discontinued operations, are presented net of the tax effect as a single amount under the heading ' Profit (loss) aft er tax from discontinued operations ' in the consolidated income statement (see Note 1.3 and 21). This heading includes the earnings from their sale or other disposal (net of tax effects).\n\n## 2.2.5 Tangible Assets\n\n## Property, plant and equipment for own use\n\nThis heading includes the assets under ownership or acquired under lease terms (right to use), intended for future or current use by the BBVA Group and that it expects to hold for more than one year. It also includes tangible assets received by the consolidated entities in full or partial settlement of financial  assets representing receivables  from third parties which are expected to be held for continuing use.\n\nFor more information regarding the accounting treatment of right to use assets under lease terms, see Note 2.2.18 \"Leases\".\n\nProperty, plant and equipment for own use are presented in the consolidated balance sheets at acquisition cost, less any accumulated depreciation and, where  appropriate, any estimated impairment losses resulting from comparing the net carrying amount of each item with its corresponding recoverable amount (see Note 17).\n\nDepreciation  is calculated  using the straight-line method, during the useful life  of the asset, on the basis  of the acquisition cost of the assets less their residual value; the land is considered to have an indefinite life and is therefore not depreciated.\n\nThe  tangible  asset  depreciation  charges  are  recognized  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  income  statements  under  the  heading \"Depreciation and Amortization\" (see Note 45) and are based  on the application of the following depreciation rates (determined on the basis of the average years of estimated useful life of the various assets):\n\n| Type of assets                | Annual Percentage                                       |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Buildings for own use         | 1% - 4%                                                 |\n| Furniture                     | 8% - 10%                                                |\n| Fixtures                      | 6% - 12%                                                |\n| Office  supplies and hardware | 8% - 25%                                                |\n| Lease use rights              | The lesser of the lease  term or the useful life of the |\n\nunderlying asset\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group entities analyze whether there are internal or external indicators that a tangible asset may be impaired. When there is evidence of impairment, the Group analyzes whether this impairment actually exists by comparing the asset's net carrying amount with its recoverable amount (defined as the higher between its recoverable amount less disposal costs and its value in use). Wh en the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable  amount, the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount and depreciation charges going forward are adjusted to reflect the asset's remaining useful life.\n\nSimilarly,  if there is any indication that the value of a previously impaired  tangible asset is now recoverable, the consolidated entities will estimate  the recoverable  amounts of the asset  and recognize  it in  the consolidated income  statement, recording the reversal  of the impairment loss recognized in previous years and thus adjusting future depreciation charges. Under no circumstances may the reversal of an impairment loss on an asset raise its carrying amount above that which it would have if no impairment losses had been recognized in prior years.\n\nIn the BBVA Group, most of the buildings held for own use are assigned to the different Cash-Generating-Units (CGU) to which they belong. The corresponding impairment analyses are  performed for these CGUs to check whether sufficient cash flows are generated to support the value of the assets comprised within.\n\nOperating and maintenance expense relating to tangible assets held for own use are recognized as an expense in the year they are incurred and  recognized  in  the  consolidated  income  statements  under  the  heading  \"Administration costs  -  Other  administrative  expense  Property, fixtures and materials\" (see Note 44.2).",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nOther assets leased  out under an operating lease\n\nThe criteria used to recognize the acquisition cost of assets leased  out under operating leases, to calculate their depreciation and their respective estimated useful lives and to recognize the impairment losses on them, are the same as those described in relation to tangible assets for own use.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe heading ' Tangible assets - Investment properties ' in the consolidated balance  sheets reflects the net values  (purchase cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, if appropriate, estimated impairment losses) of the land, buildings and other str u ct ures that are  held either to earn rentals or for capital  appreciation through sale and that are  neither expected  to be sold off in the ordinary course of business nor are destined for own use (see Note 17).\n\nThe criteria used to recognize the acquisition cost of investment properties, calculate  their depreciation and their respective  estimated useful lives and recognize the impairment losses on them, are the same as those described in relation to tangible assets held for own use.\n\nThe BBVA Group determines periodically the fair value of its investment properties in such a way that, at the end of the financial year, the fair value  reflects the market conditions of investment property assets' market at such date. This fair value will  be determined taking as references  the valuations performed by independent experts.\n\n## 2.2.6 Business combinations\n\nA business combination is a transaction, or any other deal, by which the Group obtains control of one or more businesses. It is accounted for by applying the 'acquisition method'.\n\nAccording to this method, the acquirer has to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, including those that the acquired entity had not recognized in the accounts. The method involves the measurement  of the consideration received for the business combination and its allocation to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities measured according to their fair value, at the purchase date, as well  as the recognition of any non-controlling participation (minority interests) that may arise from the transaction.\n\nIn  a  business  combination achieved  in  stages,  the  acquirer  shall  measure  its  previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  at  its acquisition-date  fair  value  and  recognize  the  resulting  gain  or  loss,  if  any,  in  profit  or  loss  under  the  heading  'Gains  (losses)  on derecognition of non-financial assets and subsidiaries, net' of the consolidated income statements. In prior reporting periods, the acq u irer may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognized in  other comprehensive  income  shall  be recognized on the same  basis  as  would be required  if the acquirer  had  disposed directly of the previously held equity interest.\n\nIn addition, the acquirer shall recognize an asset in the consolidated balance sheet under the heading ' Intangible asset - Goodwill ' if on t he acquisition date there is a positive difference between:\n\n- the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of all  the non-controlling interests and the fair value of stock previously held in the acquired business; and\n- the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities  assumed.\n\nIf this difference  is negative, it shall be recognized directly in the income  statement under the heading ' Negative goodwill recognized in profit or loss ' .\n\nNon-controlling interests in the acquired entity may be measured in two ways: either at their fair value; or at the proportional percentage of net assets identified in the acquired entity. The method of valuing non-controlling interest may be elected in each business combination. BBVA Group has always elected  for the second method.\n\n## 2.2.7 Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents a portion of consideration transferred in advance by the acquiring entity for the future economic benefits from assets that cannot be individually identified and separately  recognized. Goodwill  is never amortized. It is subject periodically to an impairment analysis, and is written off if there has been impairment (see Note 18).\n\nGoodwill is assigned to one or more CGUs that expect to be the beneficiaries  of the synergies derived from the business combinations. The CGUs represent the Group ' s smallest identifiable asset groups that generate cash flows for the Group and that are largely independent of the flows generated from the Group ' s other assets or groups of assets. Each unit or units to which goodwill is allocated:\n\n- Is the lowest level  at which the entity manages goodwill internally.\n- Is not larger than an operating segment.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment (including the allocated goodwill in their carrying amount). This analysis is performed at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication of impairment.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the impairment of a  cash-generating unit to which  a  part of goodwill  has been  allocated,  the carrying amount of that cash-generating unit, adjusted by the theoretical amount of the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interests, in  the event they are not valued at fair value, is compared with its recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable  amount of a cash-generating unit is equal to the fair value less sale costs or its value in use, whichever is greater. Value in use is calculated  as the discounted value  of the cash flow projections that the unit ' s management estimates  and is based  on the latest budgets approved for the coming years.  The main assumptions used in its calculation  are: a growth rate to extrapolate the cash flows indefinitely,  and  the discount rate  used  to discount the cash  flows,  which  is  equal  to the cost  of the  capital  assigned  to  each  cashgenerating unit, and equivalent to the sum of the risk-free rate plus a risk premium inherent to the cash-generating unit being evaluated for impairment.\n\nIf the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the related recoverable amount, the Group recognizes an impairment loss; the resulting loss  is apportioned by reducing, first, the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated  to that unit and, second, if there are still impairment losses remaining to be recognized, the carrying amount of the remainder of the assets. This is done by allocating the remaining loss in proportion to the carrying amount of each of the assets in the unit. In the event the non-controlling interests are measured at fair value, the deterioration of goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests will be recognized. In any case, an impairment loss recognized for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nGoodwill impairment losses are recognized under the heading \"Impairment or reversal of impairment on non-financial assets - Intangible assets' (see Note 49).\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThese assets may have an indefinite useful life if, based on an analysis  of all relevant factors, it is concluded that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash flows for the consolidated entities. In all other cases they have a finite useful life (see Note 18).\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life  are amortized according to the duration of this useful life, using methods similar to those used to depreciate  tangible assets. The defined  useful life  intangible asset  is made  up mainly  of IT applications  acquisition costs which  have a useful life  of 3 to 5 years. The amortization charge of these assets is recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statements under the heading \"Depreciation and amortization\" (see Note 45).\n\nThe consolidated entities recognize any impairment losses on the carrying amount of these assets with charge to the heading 'Impairment or reversal of impairment on non-financial assets- Intangible assets' in the accompanying consolidated income statements (see Note 49). The criteria used to recognize the impairment losses on these assets and, where applicable, the recovery of impairment losses r eco g n ized in prior years, are similar  to those used for tangible assets.\n\n## 2.2.8 Insurance and reinsurance contracts\n\nThe assets and liabilities  of the BBVA Group ' s insurance subsidiaries are  recognized according to their nature under the corresponding headings of the consolidated balance sheets, and the initial recognition and valuation is carried out according to the criteria set out in IFRS 4.\n\nThe  heading  'Insurance  and  reinsurance  assets'  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  includes  the amounts  that the consolidated insurance subsidiaries are entitled to receive  under the reinsurance contracts entered into by them with third parties and, more specifically,  the reinsurer's share of the technical provisions recognized by the consolidated insurance subsidiaries.\n\nThe  heading  'Liabilities  under insurance  and  reinsurance  contracts'  in  the accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  includes  the technical provisions for direct insurance and inward reinsurance  recognized by the consolidated insurance subsidiaries to cover claims arising from insurance contracts open at period-end (see Note 23).\n\nThe income or expense  reported by the BBVA Group's consolidated insurance subsidiaries on their insurance activities  is recognized, in accordance with their nature, in the corresponding items of the consolidated income statements.\n\nThe consolidated insurance entities of the BBVA Group recognize the amounts of the premiums written and a charge for the estimated cost of the claims  that will  be incurred at their final  settlement to their consolidated income  statements. At the close of each  year  the amounts collected and unearned, as well  as the costs incurred and unpaid, are accrued.\n\nThe most significant provisions recorded by consolidated insurance entities with respect to insurance policies issued by them are set out by their nature in Note 23.\n\nAccording to the type of product, the provisions may be as follows:",

These  amounts are  calculated  by applying  to each  temporary  difference  the tax  rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realized  or the liability settled (see Note 19).\n\nThe \"Tax Assets\" line item in the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets includes the amount of all the assets of a tax nature, broken down into: \"Current' (amounts of tax  recoverable  in the next twelve  months) and \"Deferred\"  (which includes  the amount of tax to be recovered in future years, including those arising from tax losses or credits for deductions or rebates that can be compensated). The \" Tax Liabilities\"  line item in the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets includes the amount of all the liabilities  of a tax nature, except for provisions for taxes, broken down into: \"Current' (income tax payable  on taxable profit for the year  and other taxes payable  in the next twelve months) and \"Deferred\" (the amount of corporate tax payable in subsequent years).\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  attributable  to taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with  investments in  subsidiaries,  associates  or joint venture entities are recognized as such, except where the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it",

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the consolidated entities will generate enough taxable profits to make deferred tax assets effective  and do not correspond to those from initial recognition (except in the case of business combinations), which also does not affect the fiscal outcome.\n\nThe  deferred  tax assets  and liabilities  recognized are  reassessed  by the consolidated  entities at  each  balance  sheet date  in order to ascertain  whether they still qualify  as deferred  tax assets and liabilities,  and the appropriate adjustments are made  on the basis of the findings of the analyses  performed. In those circumstances in which it is unclear how a specific  requirement of the tax law  applies  to a particular transaction or circumstance, and the acceptability of the definitive tax treatment depends on the decisions taken by the relevant taxation authority in future, the entity recognizes current and deferred tax liabilities  and assets considering whether it is probable or not that a taxation authority will  accept  an  uncertain tax  treatment. Thus, if the entity concludes  that it is not probable that the taxation authority will  accept  an  uncertain  tax  treatment, the entity  uses  the amount expected  to be  paid  to (recovered  from) the  taxation authorities.\n\nThe income and expense directly recognized in consolidated equity that do not increase or decrease taxable income are accounted for as temporary differences.\n\n## 2.2.10 Provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities\n\nThe heading ' Provisions ' in the consolidated balance sheets includes amounts recognized to cover the BBVA Group ' s current obligations arising as  a result of past events. These  are certain  in terms of nature but uncertain in terms of amount and/or settlement date. The settlement of  these  obligations is  deemed  likely  to entail  an outflow  of resources  embodying economic  benefits  (see  Note 24).  The obligations may arise in connection with legal or contractual provisions, valid expectations formed by Group entities relative to third parties in relation to the assumption of certain responsibilities or through virtually certain developments of particular aspects of the regulations applicable  to the operation of the entities; and, specifically,  future legislation to which the Group will  certainly be subject. The provisions are recognized in the consolidated balance  sheets when each and every one of the following requirements is met:\n\n- They represent a  current obligation that has arisen  from a  past event. At the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, there is more probability that the obligation will have to be met than that it will not.\n- It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.\n- The amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.\n\nAmong other items, these provisions include the commitments made to employees by some  of the Group entities mentioned in Note 2.2.11, as well as provisions for tax and legal litigation.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence  is conditional on, and will be confirmed only by, the occurrence or non-occurrence of events beyond the control of the Group. Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet or in the consolidated income statement; however, they will be disclosed, should they exist, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provided that it is probable will give rise to an increase  in resources embodying economic benefits.\n\nContingent liabilities  are  possible  obligations of  the  Group  that  arise  from  past  events  and  whose  existence  is  conditional  on  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events beyond the control of the Group. They also include the existing obligations of the Group when it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle them; or when, in extremely rare cases, their amount cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated balance  sheet or the income statement (excluding contingent liabilities from businesses combinations) but are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.\n\n## 2.2.11 Pensions and other post-employment commitments\n\nBelow  we  provide a  description of  the most significant  accounting policies  relating  to post-employment and  other employee  benefit commitments assumed by BBVA Group entities (see Note 25).\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits for current active employees which are accrued and settled during the year and for which a provision is not required in the en t ity's accounts. These include wages and salaries, social security charges and other personnel expense.\n\nCosts are  charged  and recognized under the heading 'Administration costs - Personnel  expense  -  Other personnel expense'  of the consolidated income statement (see Note 44.1).\n\n## Post-employment benefits - Defined-contribution plans\n\nThe Group sponsors defined-contribution plans for the majority of its active employees. The amount of these benefits is established as a percentage of remuneration and/or as a fixed amount.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe  contributions made  to  these  plans  in  each  year  by  BBVA  Group  entities  are  charged  and  recognized  under  the  heading 'Administration costs - Personnel expense-  Defined-contribution plan expense' of the consolidated income statement (see Note 44.1).\n\n## Post-employment benefits - Defined-benefit plans\n\nSome Group entities maintain pension commitments with employees  who have already  retired or taken early  retirement, certain closed groups of active  employees  still accruing defined  benefit pensions, and in-service death and disability  benefits provided to most active employees. These commitments are covered by insurance contracts, pension funds and internal provisions.\n\nIn  addition, some  of  the  Spanish  entities  have  offered  certain  employees  the  option  to retire  before  their  normal  retirement  age, recognizing the necessary  provisions to cover the costs of the associated benefit commitments, which include both the liability for the benefit payments due as well  as the contributions payable to external pension funds during the early retirement period.\n\nFurthermore, certain Group entities provide welfare  and medical  benefits which extend beyond the date of retirement of the employees entitled to the benefits.\n\nAll  of these  commitments are  quantified  based  on actuarial  valuations, with  the amounts recorded under the  heading 'Provisions  Provisions for pensions and similar obligations' in the consolidated balance sheet and determined as the difference between the value of the defined-benefit commitments and the fair value of plan assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 25).\n\nCurrent service  cost is  charged and recognized under the heading 'Administration costs - Personnel  expense  - Defined-benefit  plan expense' of the consolidated income statement (see Note 44.1).\n\nInterest credits/charges relating to these commitments are charged and recognized in net terms under the headings 'Interest and o t h er income' or, where appropriated, 'Interest expense' of the consolidated income statement (see Note 37).\n\nPast service costs arising from benefit plan changes as well as early retirements granted during the year are recognized under the h eading 'Provisions or reversals  of provisions' of the consolidated income statement (see Note 46).\n\n## Other long-term employee benefits\n\nIn addition to the above commitments, certain Group entities provide long-term service awards to their employees, consisting of monetary amounts or periods of vacation granted upon completion of a number of years of qualifying service.\n\nThese commitments are quantified based on actuarial valuations and the amounts recorded under the heading 'Provisions - Other longterm employee benefits' of the consolidated balance  sheet (see Note 24).\n\n## Valuation of commitments: actuarial assumptions and recognition of gains/losses\n\nThe present value of these commitments is determined based on individual member data. Active employee  costs are determined using the 'projected unit credit' method, which treats each period of service  as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit and values each unit separately.\n\nIn establishing the actuarial assumptions we take into account that:\n\n- They should be unbiased, i.e. neither unduly optimistic nor excessively conservative.\n- Each assumption does not contradict the others and adequately reflect the existing relationship between economic variables such as price inflation, expected wage increases,  discount rates and the expected return on plan assets, etc. Future wage and benefit levels should be based on market expectations, at the balance  sheet date, for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.\n- The interest rate used to discount benefit commitments is determined by reference to market yields, at the balance sheet date, on high quality bonds.\n\nThe BBVA Group recognizes  actuarial  gains (losses) relating to early  retirement benefits, long service  awards  and other similar  items under the heading 'Provisions or reversal of provisions' of the consolidated income statement for the period in which they arise (see Note 46).  Actuarial  gains  (losses)  relating  to  pension  and  medical  benefits  are  directly  charged  and  recognized  under  the  heading \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss - Actuarial gains (losses) on d efined benefit pension plans\" of equity in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 30).\n\n## 2.2.12 Equity-settled  share-based payment transactions\n\nEquity -settled share-based payment transactions, provided they constitute the delivery of such equity instruments once completion of a specific period of services has occurred, are recognized as an expense for services being provided by employees, by way  of a balancing entry  under  the  heading  'Shareholders'  funds  -  Other  equity  instruments' in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  These  services  are measured  at fair  value for the employees  services  received,  unless such fair  value cannot be  calculated  reliably.  In such case, they are",

Non-market vesting conditions are  not taken into account when  estimating the initial  fair  value  of equity  instruments, but they are  taken  into  account when  determining  the number  of  equity instruments  to  be  issued.  This  will  be recognized on the consolidated income statement with the corresponding increase in total consolidated equity.\n\n## 2.2.13 Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are recognized in the financial  statements when the BBVA Group agrees to terminate employment contracts with its employees and has established a detailed plan.\n\n## 2.2.14 Treasury shares\n\nThe value of common stock issued by the BBVA Group's entities and held by them - basically, shares and derivatives on the Bank's sh ar es held  by some  consolidated entities  that comply  with  the requirements to be  recognized as  equity instruments - are  recognized as  a decrease  to net equity, under the heading \"Shareholders' funds - Treasury stock\" in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 29).\n\nThese  financial  assets are  recognized at  acquisition cost, and the gains or losses  arising on their disposal  are  credited or debited, as appropriate, to the heading ' Shareholders ' funds - Retained earnings ' in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 28).\n\n## 2.2.15 Foreign-currency transactions and exchange differences\n\nThe BBVA Group ' s functional currency, and thus the currency in which the Consolidated Financial Statements are presented, is the euro. As such, all balances and transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro are deemed to be denominated in ' foreign currency ' .\n\nConversion to euros of the balances held in foreign currency is performed in two consecutive stages:\n\n- Conversion of the foreign currency to the entity's functional currency (currency of the main economic environment in which the entity operates); and\n- Conversion to euros of the balances held in the functional currencies of the entities whose functional currency is not the euro.\n\n## Conversion of the foreign currency to the entity's functional currency\n\nTransactions  denominated  in foreign  currencies  carried  out by  the  consolidated entities  (or  entities  accounted for  using the  equity method)  are  initially  accounted  for  in  their  respective  currencies.  Subsequently,  the  monetary  balances  in  foreign  currencies  are converted to their respective functional currencies using the exchange rate at the close of the financial year. In addition,\n\n- Non-monetary items valued at their historical cost are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable  on the purchase date.\n- Non-monetary items valued  at their fair value  are converted at the exchange rate in force on the date on which such fair value was determined.\n- Monetary items are converted to the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.\n- Income and expense are  converted at the period's average  exchange rates for all the operations carried  out during the year. When applying this criterion the BBVA Group considers whether significant variations have taken place in exchange rates du ring the year which, owing to their impact on the statements as a whole, may require the application of exchange rates as of the date of the transaction instead of such average exchange rates.\n\nThe  exchange differences  produced when  converting the balances  in foreign currency  to the functional currency of  the consolidated entities are  generally  recognized under the heading \"Exchange differences,  net\" in the consolidated income  statements (see  Note 41). However, the exchange differences in non-monetary items measured at fair value are recorded to equity under the heading 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss - Fair value changes of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income' in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 30).\n\n## Conversion of functional currencies to euros\n\nThe balances  in the financial  statements of consolidated entities whose  functional currency is  not the euro are  converted to euros as follows:\n\n- Assets and liabilities: at the closing spot exchange rates as of the date of each of the consolidated balance sheets.\n- Income and expense and cash flows are converted by applying the exchange rate applicable  on the date of the transaction, and the average exchange rate for the financial year may be used, unless it has undergone significant variations during the year.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n- Equity items: at the historical exchange rates.\n\nThe exchange differences  arising from the conversion to euros of balances in the functional currencies of the consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the euro are recognized under the heading 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified  to profit or loss - Foreign currency translation' in the consolidated balance sheets (Notes 30 and 31 respectively). Meanwhile, the differences  arising from the conversion to euros of the financial statements of entities accounted for by the equity method are recognized under the heading 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss - of other recognized income and expense of investments in joint ventures and associates\" (Note 30) until the item to which they relate is derecognized, at which time they are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe  financial  statements of  companies  of  hyperinflationary  economies  are  restated for  the effects  of  changes  in  prices  before  their conversion to euros following the provisions of IAS 29 \"Financial information in hyperinflationary economies\" (see Note 2.2.19). Both t h ese adjustments  for  inflation  and  the  exchange  differences  that  arise  when  converting  the  financial  statements  of  companies  into hyperinflationary economies are accounted for in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - Items that may be reclassified  to profit or loss - Foreign currency translation'.\n\nThe breakdown of the main consolidated balances  in foreign currencies, with reference  to the most significant foreign currencies, is set forth in Appendix VII.\n\n## Venezuela\n\nLocal financial  statements of the Group subsidiaries in Venezuela are expressed in Venezuelan Bolivar, and converted into euros for the consolidated financial  statements. Venezuela is a country with strong exchange restrictions that has different rates officially published, and, since December  31, 2015, the Board of Directors considers that the use of these exchanges rates for converting bolivars into euros in preparing the Consolidated Financial  Statements does not reflect  the true picture of the financial  statements of the Group and the financial  position of the Group subsidiaries  in this country. Therefore, since  the year  ended December  31, 2015, the exchange  rate for converting bolivars into euros is an estimation taking into account the evolution of the estimated inflation in Venezuela.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the impact on the financial statements that would have resulted by applying the last published official  exchange rate instead of the exchange rate estimated by BBVA Group was not significant (see Note 2.2.19).\n\n## 2.2.16 Recognition of income and expense\n\nThe most significant policies used by the BBVA Group to recognize its income and expense are as follows.\n\n- Interest income and expense and similar items:\n\nAs a general rule, interest income and expense and similar items are recognized on the basis of their period of accrual using the effective  interest rate method.\n\nThey shall be recognized within the consolidated income statement according to the following criteria, independently from the financial  instruments' portfolio which generates the income or expense:\n\n- \u00b7 The interest income past-due before the initial recognition and pending to be received  will  form part of the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument.\n- \u00b7 The interest income accrued after the initial recognition will form part of the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument until it will be received.\n\nThe financial  fees  and commissions that arise  on the arrangement of loans  and advances  (basically  origination and analysis fees) are deferred and recognized in the income statement over the expected life of the loan. From that amount, the transaction costs identified as directly  attributable to the arrangement of the loans and advances will  be deducted. These fees  are part of the effective interest rate for the loans and advances.\n\nOnce a debt instrument has been impaired, interest income is recognized applying the effective  interest rate used to discount the estimated recoverable  cash flows on the carrying amount of the asset.\n\n- Income from dividends received:\n\nDividends shall be recognized within the consolidated income statement according to the following criteria, independently from the financial instruments' portfolio which generates this income:\n\n- \u00b7 When the right to receive payment has been declared  before the initial recognition and when the payment is pending to be received, the dividends will not form part of the gross carrying amount of the equity instrument and will not be r eco g n ized as income. Those dividends are accounted for as financial assets separately from the net equity instrument.\n- \u00b7 If the right to receive payment is received after the initial recognition, the dividends from the net equity instruments will be recognized within the consolidated income statement. If the dividends correspond indubitable to the profits of the issuer before the date of initial recognition, they will not be recognized as income but as reduction of the gross carrying amount of the equity instrument because it represents a partial recuperation of the investment. Amongst other circumstances, the generation date can be considered to be prior to the date of initial  recognition if the amounts distributed by the issuer as from the initial recognition are higher than its profits during the same period.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n- Commissions, fees and similar items:\n\nIncome and  expense  relating  to commissions  and similar  fees  are  recognized in  the consolidated  income  statement using criteria that vary according to the nature of such items. The most significant items in this connection are:\n\n- \u00b7 Those relating to financial  assets and liabilities  measured at fair value through profit or loss, which are recognized when collected/paid.\n- \u00b7 Those arising from transactions or services that are provided over a period of time, which are recognized over the life  of these transactions or services.\n- \u00b7 Those relating to a singular transaction, which are recognized when this singular transaction is carried out.\n- Non-financial income and expense:\n\nThese are recognized for accounting purposes on an accrual basis.\n\n- Deferred collections and payments:\n\nThese  are recognized  for accounting purposes at the amount resulting from discounting the expected  cash flows  at market rates.\n\n## 2.2.17 Sales of assets and income from the provision of non-financial services\n\nThe heading 'Other operating income'  in the consolidated income statements includes the proceeds of the sales  of assets and income from the services  provided by the Group entities that are not financial institutions. In the case of the Group, these entities are mainly  real estate and service  entities (see Note 42).\n\n## 2.2.18 Leases\n\nEffective January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 replaced  IAS 17 'Leases'. The single lessee accounting model requires the lessee to record assets and liabilities  for all lease  contracts. The standard provides two exceptions to the recognition of lease assets and liabilities that can be applied in the case  of short-term contracts and those in which the underlying assets have low value. BBVA elected  to apply both exceptions. A lessee  is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset, which is recorded under the headings ''Tangible assets - Property plants and equipment'' and ''Tangible assets - Investment properties'' of the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 17) and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments which is recorded under the heading '' Financial liabilities  at amortized cost - Other financial  liabilities'' in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 22.5).\n\nAt the initial date of the lease, the lease  liability represents the present value of all lease  unpaid payments. The liabilities  registered under this heading of the consolidated balance  sheets are  measured after their initial  recognition at amortized cost, this being determined in accordance with the 'effective  interest rate' method.\n\nThe right to use assets are initially recorded at cost. This cost consists of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any payment made before the initial date less any lease  incentives received,  all direct initial expenses  incurred, as well  as an estimate of the expenses  to be incurred by the lessee, such as expenses related to the removal and dismantling of the underlying asset. The right to use assets recorded under this heading of the consolidated balance sheets are measured after their initial recognition at cost less:\n\n- The accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment\n- Any remeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe interest expense on the lease  liability  is recorded in the consolidated income statements under the heading 'Interest expense'  (see note 37). Variable payments not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability  are recorded under the heading 'Administration costs - Other administrative expense' (see Note 44).\n\nAmortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the lifetime of the lease contract, on the basis of the cost of the assets. The tangible  asset  depreciation  charges  are  recognized  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  income  statements  under  the  heading \"Depreciation and Amortization\" (see Note 45).\n\nIn case of electing one of the exceptions in order not to recognize the corresponding right to use and the liability in the consolidated balance sheets, payments related to the corresponding lease  are  recognized in the consolidated income statements, over the contract period, lineally,  or in the way  that best represents the structure of the lease  operation, under the heading \"Other operating expense'  (see  Note 42).\n\nOperating  lease  and  sublease  incomes  are  recognized  in the  consolidated  income  statements under the  headings 'Other  operating income' (see Note 42).",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nAs a lessor, lease  contracts are classified  as finance leases  from the inception of the transaction if they substantially transfer all the risks and  rewards  incidental  to ownership  of  the asset  forming the subject-matter  of  the  contract.  Leases  other  than  finance  leases  are classified  as operating leases.\n\nWhen the consolidated entities act as  the lessor of an asset under finance leases,  the aggregate present values  of the lease  payments receivable  from the lessee  plus the guaranteed residual value  (normally the exercise  price of the lessee's purchase option on expiration of the lease  agreement) are recognized as financing provided to third parties and, therefore, are included under the heading 'Loans and advances'  in the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets (see Note 14).\n\nWhen the consolidated entities act as lessors of an asset in operating leases, the acquisition cost of the leased assets is recognized under \"Tangible assets - Property, plant and equipment - Other assets leased out under an operating lease\" in the consolidated balance sheets (see  Note 17). These assets are  depreciated  in line with the criteria  adopted for items of tangible assets for own use, while  the income arising from the lease arrangements is recognized in the consolidated income statements on a straight-line basis within 'Other operating income' and \"Other operating expense\" (see Note 42).\n\nIf a fair value sale and leaseback  results in a lease, the profit or loss generated from the effectively transferred part of the sale is r eco g n iz ed in the consolidated income statement at the time of sale (only for the effectively  transmitted part).\n\nThe assets leased out under operating lease contracts to other entities in the Group are treated in the Consolidated Financial Statements as for own use, and thus rental expense and income is eliminated in consolidation and the corresponding depreciation is recognized.\n\n## 2.2.19 Entities and branches located in countries with hyperinflationary economies\n\nIn accordance  with the EU-IFRS criteria, to determine whether an economy has a high inflation rate the country's economic situation is examined, analyzing whether certain circumstances are fulfilled,  such as whether the population prefers to keep its wealth or savings in non-monetary assets or in a relatively  stable foreign currency, whether prices can be set in that currency, whether interest rates, wages and prices are pegged to a price index or whether the accumulated inflation rate over three years reaches  or exceeds 100%. The fact that any of these circumstances is fulfilled will  not be a decisive factor in considering an economy hyperinflationary, but it does provide some reasons to consider it as such.\n\n## Argentina\n\nSince 2018, the economy of Argentina has been considered hyperinflationary under the above criteria. As a result, the financial statements of the BBVA Group's entities located in Argentina have therefore been adjusted to correct for the effects of inflation in accordance  with IAS 29 'Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies'.\n\nDuring 2020,  2019  and 2018,  the increase  in  the reserves  of Group entities  located  in Argentina derived  from  the re-expression  for hyperinflation (IAS 29) amounts to \u20ac343, \u20ac470 and \u20ac703 million, respectively, of which \u20ac228, \u20ac313 and \u20ac463 million, respectively, have been recorded within 'Equity - Accumulated other comprehensive income /(loss)' and \u20ac115, \u20ac157 and \u20ac240 million, respectively,  within 'Minority interests - Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)'. Furthermore, during 2020, 2019 and 2018 the decrease  in the reserves  of  Group  entities  located  in  Argentina derived  from  the  conversion (IAS  21)  amounted to  \u20ac482, \u20ac460  and  \u20ac773 million, respectively, of which \u20ac320, \u20ac305 and \u20ac515 million, respectively, have been recorded within 'Equity - Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)',  and  \u20ac162,  \u20ac155  and  \u20ac258  million,  respectively,  within  'Minority  interests  -  Accumulated  other  comprehensive income/(loss)'.  The  net  impact  of  both effects  is  presented  under  the  caption  'Other  increases  or  (-)  decreases  in  equity'  in  the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The net loss in the profit attributable to the parent company of the Group in 2020, 2019 and 2018 derived from the application of IAS 29 amounted to \u20ac148, \u20ac190  and \u20ac209 million, respectively. In addition, there is a net loss in the profit attributable to the parent company of the Group in 2020, 2019 and 2018 derived from the application of IAS 21 which amounted to \u20ac26, \u20ac34 and \u20ac57 million, respectively.\n\nThe breakdown of the General Price  Index ('GPI') and the inflation index used as of December  31, 2020 for the inflation of the financial statements of the Group companies located in Argentina is as follows:\n\n| General Price Index   0   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| GPI                       | 387    |\n| Average GPI               | 331    |\n| Inf lation of the period  | 36.5%  |\n\n## Venezuela\n\nSince  2009,  the  economy  of  Venezuela  has  been  considered  hyperinflationary  under  the  above  criteria.  As  a  result,  the  financial statements of  the BBVA Group's entities located  in  Venezuela  have  therefore been  adjusted  to correct for  the effects  of  inflation in accordance with IAS 29 'Financial  reporting in hyperinflationary economies'.\n\nThe losses recognized under the heading 'Profit attributable to the parent company' in the accompanying consolidated income statement as a result of the adjustment for inflation on net monetary position of the Group entities in Venezuela amounted to \u20ac5, \u20ac8 and \u20ac12 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively (see Note 2.2.15).",

        "page_content": "## 2.3 Recent IFRS pronouncements\n\n## Standards and interpretations that became  effective in 2020\n\nThe following amendments to the IFRS standards or their interpretations (hereinafter 'IFRIC') became effective in 2020.\n\n## IAS 1 and IAS 8 - 'Definition of Material'\n\nThe  amendments  clarify  the  definition  of  'material'  in  the preparation  of  the financial  statements  by  aligning  the  definition  of  the Conceptual  Framework,  IAS 1  and  IAS 8  (which,  before  such  amendment,  contained  similar  but not  identical  definitions).  The  new definition of material  is as follows: 'information is material  if its omission, misrepresentation or obscuration can reasonably be expected to influence the decisions made by the primary users of a specific entity's general purpose financial statements, based on those financial statements.'\n\nThe implementation of this standard has had no significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 3 - 'Definition of a business'\n\nThe amendment  clarifies  the difference  between  'acquiring  a business'  or 'acquiring  a  group of assets'  for accounting purposes. To determine whether a transaction is the acquisition of a business, an entity has to evaluate and conclude that the following two conditions are met:\n\n- The fair value of the assets acquired is not in a single asset or group of similar assets.\n- The set of acquired activities and assets includes, as a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together contribute to the ability to create products.\n\nThe implementation of this standard has had no significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Modifications - IBOR Reform\n\nThe IBOR Reform (Phase 1) refers to the amendments issued by the IASB on IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 to avoid that some accounting hedges have to be discontinued in the period before the reform of the reference rates becomes effective. BBVA Group applies IAS 39 for hedge accounting, and therefore the amendments to IFRS 9 referred to in this section do not apply.\n\nIn some cases, and/or jurisdictions, there may exist uncertainty about the future of some reference  rates or their impact on the entity's contracts, which  directly  causes  uncertainty about  the  timing or  amounts of  cash  flows  of  the  hedged  instrument or  the hedging instrument. Due to such uncertainties, some entities may be forced to discontinue an accounting hedge, or not be able to designate new hedging relationships.\n\nConsequently, the amendments include several  temporary simplifications  of the requirements for the application  of hedge accounting which apply to all hedging relationships that are affected by the uncertainty arising from the Reform. A hedging relationship is affected by the reform if it generates uncertainty about the timing or amount of cash flows of the hedged financial  instrument or the hedge linked to the specific  benchmark. The simplifications  refer to the requirements on the highly probable future transaction in cash flow hedges, on prospective and retrospective  effectiveness  (exemption  from compliance  with the 80%-125%  effectiveness  ratio) and on the need to separately identify the risk component.\n\nAs the amendments aim is to provide temporary exceptions to the application of certain specific  hedge accounting requirements, these exceptions should terminate once the uncertainty is resolved or the hedge ceases to exist.\n\nThe  Group  also  has  cash  flow  and  fair  value  hedge  accounting relationships  which  are  exposed  to different  IBORS,  predominantly EURIBOR, LIBOR in US dollars and to a much lesser degree Sterling LIBOR and other benchmark interest rates. The Group considers that the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 are applicable  when there is uncertainty about future cash flows.\n\nThe nominal amount of the hedging instruments directly affected by the IBOR reform as of December 31, 2020 is the following:\n\n| Millions of Euros   | LIBOR USD   | LIBOR GBP   | Other - TIIE (*)   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|---------|\n| Cash flow hedges    | 9,084       | -           | 574                | 9,658   |\n| Fair value hedges   | 10,608      | 266         | 1,477              | 12,351  |",

        "page_content": "Translation of the Consolidated Financial Statements originally issued in Spanish and prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS, as adopted by the European Union (see Notes 1 to 56). In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Group considers that, in general, there is no uncertainty regarding EURIBOR as it has been replaced by the hybrid EURIBOR which uses a methodology that meets the standards required by the various international organizations. In the case of accounting hedges which are referenced to other benchmark interest rates, despite the uncertainty, based on the simplifications provided by the standard, the hedging relationships for the annual period that ended on December 31, 2020, will not be affected by the IBOR reform.\n\n## IFRS 16 -Leases - COVID-19 modifications\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB approved an  amendment to IFRS 16  to include  a practical  expedient  to the accounting treatment for rent concessions (payment deferrals  and temporary rent reductions) that occur due to a direct consequence of COVID-19 (see Note 1.5).\n\nThe amendment permits lessees to account for rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications to the initial ones. It is applicable to rent concessions related to COVID-19, which reduces lease  payments before June 30, 2021. This amendment is effective  from June 1, 2020.\n\nThe implementation of this standard has had no significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective as of December 31, 2020\n\nThe  following  new  International Financial  Reporting Standards together with their Interpretations had been  published  at the  date  of preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial  statements, but are not mandatory as of December 31, 2020. Although in some cases the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') allows early adoption before their effective  date, the BBVA Group has not proceeded with this option for any such new standards.\n\n## IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Modifications - IBOR reform\n\nOn August 27, 2020, the IASB issued the second phase of the IBOR reform that involves the introduction of amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16, to ensure that the financial statements reflect the economic effects of the IBOR reform. The amendments focus on the accounting for financial instruments once a new benchmark has been introduced.\n\nSuch modifications introduce the practical simplification of accounting for changes in the cash flows of the financial  instruments directly caused by the IBOR reform and, if they take place  under an 'economically  equivalent'  context, through the effective interest rate of the financial  instrument update.  Similarly,  a  practical  simplification  will  be  applied  to IFRS 16  'Leases'  for leases,  when  accounting for modifications in lease  agreements as a consequence of the IBOR reform. Additionally, some exemptions to the hedging requirements are introduced  so  as  not  to  discontinue  certain  hedging  relationships.  However,  similar  to  the  phase  1  amendments,  these  phase  2 amendments do not provide exceptions to the valuation requirements applicable to hedged items and hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9 or IAS 39. Thus, once the new benchmark has been implemented, the hedged items and hedging instruments must be valu ed according to the new index, and any possible ineffectiveness  that may exist in the hedge will  be recognized in profit or loss. On the other hand, new disclosures are introduced.\n\nThe IBOR transition is considered to be a complex initiative, which affects BBVA Group in different geographical areas and business lines, as  well  as  in  a  multitude of products, systems  and processes.  Therefore,  BBVA Group has  established  an  IBOR transition program, provided with a robust governance structure by means of an Executive Steering Committee, with representation from senior management of the affected areas, which reports directly to the Group's Global Leadership Team. At the local level, each geography has defined a local governance structure with the participation of senior management. The coordination between geographies is realized through the Pr o ject Management Office (PMO) and the Global Working Groups that incorporate a multi-geographic and transversal view on the areas of L eg al, Risk, Regulatory, Engineering, Finance and Accounting. The project also involves both Corporate Assurance of the different geographies and business lines and Global Corporate Assurance of the Group.\n\nThe IBOR transition project within BBVA Group takes  into account the different approaches and timings of transition to the new  RFRs (risk-free rate) when evaluating the economic, operational, legal, financial, reputational or compliance risks associated with the transition, as well  as defining the lines of action to mitigate them. A relevant aspect of this transition is its impact on contracts referenced to L I B OR (mainly dollar) and EONIA rates that mature after 2021. In this regard, in the case of the EONIA, BBVA aims to carry out a novation of the contracts maturing after 2021 (it should be noted that these exposures are immaterial  in the Group) and has already  begun, proactively, the renegotiation of collateral contracts to adapt them to the operations against clearing houses homogeneously which already migrated last  July.  The  Group already  has  new  fallbacks  in  place  which  incorporate  the \u20acSTR  as  a  replacement  rate,  as  well  as  language  to incorporate this benchmark as the main reference  rate in new contracts. In the case  of LIBOR, BBVA Group has identified  the stock of contracts expiring after 2021 and is working on the implementation of tools/systems that will allow  the stock to be migrated to solutions such as those proposed by ISDA (Group entities are either already adhering to the ISDA protocol or in the process of doing so). Likewise, BBVA Group continues to work on adapting all  its systems and processes  to deal  with alternative  Risk Free  Rates, such as SOFR  and SONIA. In the case  of EURIBOR, the European authorities have encouraged amendments of its methodology so that it complies with the requirements of the European Regulation on Benchmarks. BBVA actively participates in various working groups, including the EURO RFR WG which works specifically,  amongst others, on the definition of fallbacks in contracts, in anticipation of an option to change the in d ex in the future.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nBBVA Group has a significant number of financial  assets  and liabilities  referenced  to IBOR rates, especially  EURIBOR, which are  used, among others, in loans, deposits, debt issuances and financial  derivatives. Furthermore, although the exposure to EONIA is lower in the banking book, this benchmark interest rate is used in financial derivatives  in the trading book, as well as in the collateral  agreements and most are booked in Spain. In the case of LIBOR, the USD is the most relevant currency for both cash products and financial derivatives in the banking book and the trading book. Other LIBOR currencies (CHF, GBP and JPY) have a much lower specific  weight.\n\nThese modifications introduced in the second phase of the reform will be mandatory as of January 2021, with possible early adoption. In this sense, based on the progress of the transition to the new indices in the Group, the BBVA Group has considered that it is not necessary to early  adopt IBOR reform phase  2 in  the BBVA Group in 2020.  On January  13, 2021,  the European Commission has  endorsed the aforementioned modifications.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 establishes the principles for the accounting for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4. The new standard introduces a sin gle accounting model for all insurance contracts and requires the entities to use updated assumptions.\n\nAn entity shall divide the contracts into groups and recognize and measure groups of insurance contracts at the total of:\n\n- the fulfilment cash flows, that comprises the estimate of future cash flows, an adjustment to reflect the time value of money and the financial risk associated with the future cash flows and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and\n- the contractual service margin that represents the unearned profit.\n\nThe  amounts recognized  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  shall  be  disaggregated  into  insurance  revenue,  insurance  service expenses  and insurance finance  income or expenses.  Insurance revenue and insurance service  expenses  shall exclude  any investment components. Insurance revenue shall be recognized over the period the entity provides insurance coverage and in proportion to the value of the provision of coverage that the insurer provides in the period.\n\nThis Standard  will  be applied  to the accounting years  starting on or after January  1, 2023. In 2019,  the Group established  an IFRS 17 implementation project with the objective of harmonizing the criteria in the Group and with the participation of all the affected areas.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 4 includes  a deferral  in the temporary exception option regarding the application of IFRS 9 for entities whose business model is predominantly an insurance model until January 1, 2023, aligning it with the entry into force of the IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts rule. This modification will  be applicable  from January 1, 2021, although it will not have an impact on the Group since the Bank will not take such option.\n\n## 3. BBVA Group\n\nThe BBVA Group is an international diversified  financial  group with a significant presence  in retail banking, wholesale  banking and asset management. The Group also operates in the insurance sector.\n\nThe  following  information is  detailed  in  the  appendices  of these  consolidated  financial  statements of  the Group for  the  year  ended December 31, 2020:\n\n- Appendix I shows relevant information related to the consolidated subsidiaries and structured entities.\n- Appendix II shows relevant information related to investments in joint ventures and associates accounted for using the equ ity method.\n- Appendix III shows the main changes and notification of investments and divestments in the BBVA Group.\n- Appendix IV shows fully consolidated subsidiaries with more than 10% owned by non-Group shareholders.\n\nThe following table sets forth information related to the Group's total assets as of December 31, 2020, 2019  and 2018, broken down by the Group's entities according to their activity:",

This operation has resulted in a profit net of taxes of 304 million euros and a positive impact on the fully loaded CET1 of the BBVA Group of 7 basis points.\n\n## Significant transactions in the Group in 2019\n\n## Divestitures\n\n## Sale  of BBVA's stake in BBVA Paraguay\n\nOn August 7, 2019, BBVA reached an agreement with Banco GNB Paraguay, S.A., an affiliate  of Grupo Financiero Gilinski, for the sale  of its wholly-owned subsidiary Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria Paraguay,  S.A. ('BBVA Paraguay').  BBVA owned, directly and indirectly, 100%  of its share capital in BBVA Paraguay.\n\nOn January  22, 2021 and  after obtaining all  required authorizations, BBVA has  completed the sale  to Banco  GNB Paraguay,  S.A., an affiliate  of Grupo Gilinski,  of its 100%  direct and indirect stake share capital  in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria Paraguay, S.A. ('BBVA Paraguay').\n\nThe  amount received  by BBVA amounts to approximately  USD250  million  (approximately  \u20ac210  million). The  transaction results in a capital  loss  of  approximately  \u20ac9  million  net  of  taxes.  A  positive  impact  on BBVA Group's  Common Equity  Tier  1  (fully  loaded)  of approximately 6 basis points is estimated to be recognized during the first quarter of 2021 (see Note 56).\n\n## Significant transactions in the Group in 2018\n\n## Divestitures\n\n## Sale  of BBVA's stake in BBVA Chile\n\nOn November 28, 2017, BBVA received a binding offer (the 'Offer') from The Bank of Nova Scotia group ('Scotiabank') for the acquisition of BBVA's stake in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria Chile, S.A.

On July 27, 2020, the ECB prolonged this recommendation until January 1, 2021 by adopting recommendation ECB/2020/35.\n\nOn December  15, 2020 the ECB issued recommendation ECB/2020/62, repealing  recommendation ECB/2020/35 and recommending that significant credit institutions exercise extreme prudence when deciding on or paying out dividends or performing share buy-backs aimed at remunerating shareholders. Recommendation ECB/2020/62 circumscribes prudent distributions to results of 2019 and 2020 but excluding distributions regarding 2021 until September 30, 2021, when the ECB will reevaluate the economic situation. BBVA intends to reinstate its dividend policy  of the Group announced on February 1, 2017 once the recommendation ECB/2020/62 is repealed and there are no additional restrictions or limitations.\n\n## Proposal on allocation of earnings for 2020\n\nThe Board of Directors will submit for the approval of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting the proposal to apply the result of Banco Bilbao  Vizcaya  Argentaria, S.A. for  the 2020  financial  year  amounting to \u20ac2,182  million  of losses  to the prior years'  losses  account. Furthermore, the offsetting of the prior years'  losses will  likewise  be submitted for approval,  the amount of which amounts to \u20ac2,182",

For this reason, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.\n\n## 6. Operating segment reporting\n\nOperating segment reporting represents a basic tool in the oversight and management of the BBVA Group's various activities. The BBVA Group compiles reporting information on disaggregated business activities. These business activities are then aggregated in accordance with the organizational structure determined by the BBVA Group and, ultimately, into the reportable operating segments themselves.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the structure of the information by operating segments of the BBVA Group remains basically the same as that of the financial year ended 2019, although BBVA reached agreements that, in some cases, could affect its structure. Due to the agreement reached  for the sale  of the Group's entire stake in BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc., parent company of the Group companies  related to the banking business in the United States, the balance sheet items of the companies for sale and the gains and losses generated by them h ave been  classified  in  accordance  with IFRS 5 'Non-current assets  held  for sale  and  discontinued operations' (see  Notes  2.2.4 and  21).

Their measurement includes the design and application of scenario analyses  and stress testing and considers the controls to which the risks are subjected. As part of this process, a forward projection of the risk appetite framework variables  in stress scenarios is conducted in order to identify possible deviations from the established  thresholds. If any such deviations  are detected, appropriate measures  are taken  to keep the variables within the target risk profile.\n\nIn this context, there are a number of emerging risks that could affect the evolution of the Group's business. These risks are  included in the following blocks:\n\n- The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely  affecting  the world economy and economic activity and conditions in the countries in which the Group operates, leading many of them to economic recession in 2020 and relatively moderate activity growth in 2021, so that probably only from 2022 will the GDP levels observed before the crisis recover. Among other challenges, these countries are  experiencing widespread  increases  in unemployment levels  and falls  in production, while public debt has increased significantly due to support and spending measures implemented by government authorities. In addition, there is an increase  in defaults on debts by both companies and individuals, volatility in financial markets, including exchange rates, and falls  in the value  of assets  and investments, all  of which  have had  a negative  impact on the Group's in the year  2020  and is expected to continue to affect in the future.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nFurthermore, the Group may be affected by the measures adopted by regulatory authorities in the banking sector, including but not limited  to, the recent reductions in reference  interest rates, the relaxation of prudential requirements, the suspension of dividend payments, the adoption of payment deferrals measures for bank clients (such as those included in Royal Decree  Law 11/2020  in Spain, as well  as in the CECA-AEB agreement to which BBVA has adhered and which, among other things, allows loan debtors to extend maturities and defer  interest payments) and  facilities  to grant credit through a line  of guarantees or public  guarantees, especially  to companies  and the self-employed  individuals,  as well  as  any  changes in the financial  asset purchase programs.\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has experienced a decline in its activity. For example, the granting of n ew loans  to  individuals  has  significantly  decreased  since  the  beginning  of  mobility  restriction  measures  approved  in  certain countries in which the Group operates. In addition, the Group faces several  risks, such as a greater risk of impairment of the value of its assets (including financial  instruments valued at fair value, which may  undergo significant fluctuations) and of the securities held for liquidity reasons, a possible significant increase in non-performing loans and a negative impact on the cost  of the Group's financing and its access to financing (especially  in an environment where credit ratings are affected).\n\nFurthermore, in several  of the  countries in  which  the Group operates, including Spain,  the Group has temporarily  closed  a significant number of its offices and reduced opening hours to the public, and the teams that provide central services have been working remotely. Although these measures  have  been gradually  reversed  due to the continued expansion  of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear how long it will  take until normal operations can fully resume. On the other hand, the pandemic could adversely  affect  the business and operations of third parties that provide critical  services  to the Group and, in particular, the higher demand and / or lower availability  of certain resources could in some cases make it more difficult to maintain the service levels.  In addition, the  generalization  of  remote  work  has  increased  the  risks  related  to cybersecurity,  as  the  use  of  noncorporate networks has increased.\n\nAs a result of the above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on the Group's results and capital base. During the first half of the year the main accumulated impacts were:\n\n- (i) an  increase  in  the  cost  of  risk  associated  with  the  lending  activity,  mainly  due  to  the  deterioration  of  the macroeconomic  environment, which has had a negative impact  of \u20ac2,009 million  in the Group (including the initial adverse  effect of the payment deferral)  and provisions for credit risk and contingent commitments for \u20ac95 million, (see Notes 7.2, 46 and 47); and\n- (ii) a deterioration in the goodwill of the Group's subsidiary in the United States, mainly  due to the deterioration of the macroeconomic scenario in the United States, which has had a net negative impact of \u20ac2,084 million on the Group's attributed profit in this period (although this impact does not affect the tangible book value, nor the solvency or the liquidity of the Group) (see Notes 18.1 and 49).\n\nFrom June 30, 2020 on, and as a consequence of the general deterioration of the global macroeconomic scenario, its specific effects cannot be isolated, affecting all of the Group's consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks\n\nThe Global economy is being severely  affected  by the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply, demand and financial  factors caused an unprecedented fall in GDP in the first half of 2020. Supported by strong fiscal and monetary policy measures, as well  as greater control over the spread of  the virus, global  growth rebounded more  than expected  in  the third quarter, before slowing down in the fourth, when the number of infections rose again in many regions, mainly in the United States and Europe. As for 2021, the unfavorable evolution of the pandemic is expected to adversely  affect activity in the short t erm, while  new  fiscal  and  monetary stimuli,  as  well  as  the  administering of  coronavirus vaccines,  are  expected  to support recovery from mid-year onwards.\n\nFollowing the massive fiscal  and monetary stimuli to support economic activity and reduce financial tensions, g o ver n ment debt has increased  across  the board and interest rates  have  been cut, and are  now at  historical low  levels.  Additional countercyclical measures may be required. Similarly, a significant reduction in current stimuli is not expected, at least u ntil the recovery takes hold.\n\nTensions in the financial markets have moderated rapidly since the end of March 2020, following the decisive actions t aken by the main  central  banks and  the fiscal  packages  announced in  many countries. In recent months, the markets have shown relative  stability and, at certain  times, risk-taking movements. Likewise,  progress related  to the development of COVID-19 vaccines and prospects for economic recovery should pave the way for financial volatility to persist at relatively low levels in general going forward.\n\nBBVA Research estimates that global GDP contracted by around 2.6% in 2020 and will  expand by around 5.3% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022. Activity will recover gradually and heterogeneously among countries. Various epidemiological, financial and geopolitical factors are also contributing to the persistent exceptionally high uncertainty.\n\nWith regard to the banking system, in an environment in which much of the economic activity has been at a stand still for several  months, the services  provided have  played  an essential  role, basically  for two reasons: firstly,  the banks have ensured the proper functioning of collections and payments for households and companies, thereby contributing to the",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nmaintenance of economic activity; secondly, the granting of new lending or the renewal of existing lending has reduced the impact of the economic slowdown on household and business income. The support provided by the banks over the months of lockdown and public guarantees have been essential  in softening the impact of the crisis  on companies'  liquidity and solvency, meaning that banking has become its main source of funding for most companies.\n\nIn terms of profitability, European and Spanish banking have deteriorated, primarily because many entities recorded high provisions for impairment on financial assets in the first two quarters of 2020 as a result of the worsening macroeconomic environment following the pandemic outbreak. Pre-pandemic  profitability levels  remained  far from the levels prior to the previous financial  crisis. This is in addition to the accumulation of capital since the previous crisis and the very low interest rate environment that we have been experiencing for several years. Nevertheless, the banks are facing this situation from a healthy position and with solvency that has been constantly increasing since the 2008 crisis, with reinforced capital and liquidity buffers and, therefore, with a greater lending capacity.\n\nThe BBVA Group has a General  Risk Management and Control Model appropriate to its business model, its organization, the countries in which it operates and its corporate governance system, which allows  it to carry out its activity within the framework of the risk management and control strategy and policy defined by the corporate bodies. This model deals with management in global form adapting itself to the circumstances  of each moment. This Model is applied integrally  in the Group.\n\nIn  this  sense,  from  the  beginning  of  the  crisis,  the  BBVA  Group  implemented  specific  measures  for  the  proper management of these associated  risks, establishing different global initiatives  that define the risk  management strategy during the crisis, with common action protocols that should be implemented and adapted, when needed, to local needs.\n\nThe  BBVA Group global  risk  unit -  Global  Risk  Management  (hereinafter,  'GRM')  -  has  increased  the  frequency  and intensity of the evaluation of potential impacts on the different groups and clients, in order to prevent their future evo lu tion, and carried out appropriate adjustments and reclassifications, reinforcing its processes, governance and teams in Ho lding and countries to act in a coordinated manner, focusing priority on crisis management\n\nOver the past year,  it has been found that the pandemic  has a global impact, affecting to a greater extent the sectors in which there is a high level of human interaction (transport, especially air transport, leisure, especially hotel establishments, as well  as industries and activities  dependent on them), regardless  of the regional area  in question. For this reason, the Bank's  risk  management  has  clearly  been  intensified  by  sectorial  vectors  over  other  conditioning factors  such  as geographic.\n\n## Regulatory and reputational risks\n\nFinancial institutions are exposed to a complex and ever-changing regulatory environment defined  by governments and regulators. This can  affect their ability  to grow and the capacity  of certain businesses  to develop, and result in stricter liquidity and capital requirements with lower profitability ratios. The Group constantly monitors changes in the regulatory framework  that allow  for anticipation and  adaptation to them  in a  timely  manner, adopt industry practices  and  more efficient and rigorous criteria in its implementation.\n\nThe financial  sector is under ever closer scrutiny by regulators, governments and society itself. In the course of activities, situations which might cause relevant reputational damage to the entity could raise and might affect the regular course of business. The attitudes and behaviors of the Group and its members are governed by the principles of integrity, honesty, long-term vision and industry practices through, inter alia, the internal control model, the Code of Conduct, the Corpor ate Principles in tax matters and Responsible Business Strategy of the Group.\n\n## Business, operational and legal risks\n\nNew technologies and forms of customer relationships: Developments in the digital world and in information technologies pose significant challenges  for financial  institutions, entailing threats (new competitors, disintermediation, etc.) but also opportunities (new  framework  of relations  with customers, greater  ability  to adapt to their  needs, new  products and distribution channels, etc.). Digital transformation is a priority for the Group as it aims to lead digital banking of the future as one of its objectives.\n\nTechnological risks and security breaches: The Group is exposed to new threats such as cyber-attacks, theft of internal and  customer  databases,  fraud  in  payment  systems,  etc.  that require  major  investments  in  security  from  both the technological and human point of view. The Group gives great importance to the active operational and technological risk management and control.\n\nThe financial  sector faces  an  environment of increasing  regulatory and litigious pressure, and  thus, the various Group entities  are  usually  party  to individual  or  collective  judicial  proceedings  (including class  actions)  resulting from  their activity and operations, as well  as arbitration proceedings. The Group is also party to other government procedures and investigations, such as those carried out by the antitrust authorities in certain countries which, among other things, h ave in the past and could in the future result into sanctions, as well as lead to claims by customers and others. In addition, the regulatory framework, in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, is evolving towards a supervisory approach more focused  on the  opening of sanctioning proceedings  while  some  regulators are  focusing  their attention on consumer protection and behavioral risk.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nIn Spain  and  in  other jurisdictions  where  the  Group operates,  legal  and regulatory  actions  and  proceedings  against financial  institutions, prompted in  part  by  certain  judgments  in  favor  of  consumers  handed  down  by  national  and supranational courts, have increased significantly in recent years and this trend could continue in the future. The legal and regulatory actions and proceedings faced by other financial institutions in relation to these and other matters, especially if  such actions or proceedings result in favorable resolutions for the consumer, could also adversely affect the Group.\n\nAll of the above may  result in a significant increase  in operating and compliance  costs or even  a reduction of revenues, and it is possible that an adverse outcome in any proceedings (depending on the amount thereof, the penalties imposed or the procedural or management costs for the Group) could damage the Group's reputation, generate a knock-on effect or otherwise adversely  affect the Group.\n\nIt is  difficult to predict the outcome of legal  and regulatory actions and proceedings, both those to which the Group is currently exposed  and those that may  arise  in the future, including actions and proceedings relating to former Group subsidiaries  or  in  respect  of  which  the  Group  may  have  indemnification  obligations,  but  such  outcome  could  be significantly  adverse  to the Group. In addition, a decision  in any matter, whether against the Group or against another credit entity facing similar claims as those faced by the Group, could give rise to other claims against the Group. In addition, these actions and proceedings attract resources from the Group and may occupy a great deal of attention on part of the Group's management and employees.\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, the Group had \u20ac612 million  in provisions for the proceedings it is facing (included in the line \"Provisions for litigation and pending tax cases\" in the consolidated balance  sheet) (see  Note 25), of which \u20ac574 million correspond to legal  contingencies and \u20ac38 million  to tax related  matters. However, the uncertainty arising from these proceedings (including those for which no provisions have been made, either because it is not possible to estimate them or for other reasons) makes  it impossible to guarantee that the possible losses arising from these proceedings will  not exceed, where applicable,  the amounts that the Group currently has provisioned and, therefore, could affect the Group's consolidated results in a given period.\n\n\u0301\n\nAs a result of the above, legal  and regulatory actions and proceedings currently faced  by the Group or to which it may become  subject  in the future or otherwise  affected  by, individually  or in the  aggregate, if  resolved  in  whole or  in part adversely  to the Group s interests, could have a material adverse  effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSpanish judicial authorities are investigating the activities of Centro Exclusivo de Negocios y Transacciones, S.L. (Cenyt ). Such investigation includes the provision of services by Cenyt to the Bank. On 29th July, 2019, the Bank was named as an official  suspect  (investigado)  in  a  criminal  judicial  investigation (Preliminary  Proceeding No. 96/2017  - Piece  No. 9, Central Investigating   Court No. 6 of the National  High Court) for alleged  facts  which  could be constitutive of bribery, revelation of secrets and corruption. On February 3, 2020, the Bank was notified by the Central Investigating Court No.  6 of the National  High Court of the order lifting the secrecy  of the proceedings. Certain  current and former  officers  and employees  of the Group, as well  as former directors  have  also  been  named  as  official  suspects  in  connection  with this  investigation. The Bank  has been  and  continues  to  proactively  collaborate  with  the  Spanish  judicial  authorities, including  sharing  with  the  courts  the  relevant  information obtained in the internal investigation hired by the entity in 2019 to contribute to the clarification of the facts. As of the date of the approval of the consolidated financial statements, no formal accusation against the Bank has been made.\n\nThis criminal judicial  proceeding is at the pre-trial phase. Therefore, it is not possible at this time to predict the scope or duration  of  such  proceeding  or  any  related  proceeding  or  its or their  possible  outcomes  or  implications  for  the Group,  including any fines, damages or harm to the Group's reputation caused thereby.\n\n## 7.2 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises  from the probability that one party to a financial  instrument will  fail  to meet  its contractual obligations for reasons of insolvency or inability to pay and cause a financial  loss for the other party.\n\nThe general principles governing credit risk management in the BBVA Group are:\n\n- Risks taken should comply with the general risk policy established by the Board of Directors of BBVA.\n- Risks taken should be in line  with the level  of equity and generation of recurring revenue of the BBVA Group prioritizing risk diversification and avoiding relevant concentrations.\n- Risks taken  should be  identified,  measured  and assessed  and  there should be  management  and monitoring procedures, in addition to sound mitigation and control mechanisms.\n- Risks should be managed in a prudent and integrated manner during their life cycle and their treatment should be based on the type of risk. In addition, portfolios should be actively managed on the basis of a common metric (economic capital).\n- The main criterion when granting credit risks is the capability  of the borrower or obligor to fulfill on a timely basis all financial obligations with its business income or source of income without depending upon guarantors, bondsmen or pledged assets.",

These moratoriums have  been both legislative  (based  on national laws)  and non-legislative (based  on sectorial or individual schemes), aimed at mitigating the effects of COVID-19. Depending on the cases, the payment of principal and / or interest has been postponed, maintaining the original contract. Generally,  these deferrals  have  been given for a period of less  than one year. This measure has been extended to different sectors, being Leisure, Real Estate and Auto the main users. The deadline to qualify for the moratorium has been extended in some geographies in recent months, having already come to an end in Mexico and Argentina. In the others, where this measure  is still in force, this period ends in the first quarter of 2021, except Turkey (in May 2021), Colombia (in July 2021) and the USA (in January 2022).\n\nSpecifically,  the Group's participation in the following moratorium or public guarantee measures by geography stands out:\n\n- \u00b7 In Spain, payment  deferral  measures  have  been covered  mainly  by Royal Decree  Law  8/2020  and 11/2020,  as well  as  the agreement promoted by the Spanish Banking Association (hereinafter 'AEB') to which BBVA has adhered.\n\nThe moratoriums covered  by the Royal Decree  Law have been  proposed to the especially  vulnerable  groups indicated in the regulation. These measures  consist of payment deferral  of three months of principal and interest. In addition, the possibility of customers joining sector agreements for the remaining term until the limit established has been offered that, once said legal moratorium has expired. By type of customer, they are aimed at individuals, individual or self-employed entrepreneurs, and by type of product, mortgage, personal loans or consumer loans.\n\nThe moratoriums granted under the sectorial  agreement  of the AEB are  aimed  at  individuals  for up to 12 months of capital deferral  in  the case  of mortgage loans and up to 6 months in personal  loans. Said  sector agreement has been  in force  until September 29, 2020, but it has been extended until March 30, 2021, although the new conditions only provide for the payment deferral of capital in mortgages up to 9 months, remaining 6 months on personal loans.\n\nIn  addition, the  Official  Credit  Institute (ICO) has  published  several  aid  programs aimed  at  the  self-employed,  SMEs  and companies, through which a guarantee of between 60% and 80% is granted for a period of up to 5 years to the new financing granted. The amount of the guarantee and its length depends on the size of the company and the type of product. The ICO has also subsidized individuals the amount of the rent up to 6 months in loans up to 6 years.\n\n- \u00b7 In Mexico, the National Banking Commission of Securities ('CNBV') published official letters P285/2020 of March 26, 2020 and  P293/2020  of  April  15,  2020,  allowing  the  granting of  capital  and  interest  payment  deferral  for  a  period  4  months extendable  for additional  2  additional  months. These measures  were  mainly  used  by  individuals  and  companies,  affecting mortgage loans, personal loans and consumer loans, including credit cards.\n- \u00b7 In the United States, payment deferral measures have been mainly encouraged by the CARES Act, signed on March 27, 2020, which includes a wide range of supporting measures for companies and individuals, as well  as an interagency statement (Office of the Comptroller of the Monetary Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office  of Consumer Financial Protection and National Administration of Credit Unions) of April 7, 2020.",

These  supporting measures are granted to both individuals and companies.\n\nLikewise,  public support programs have been recognized guaranteeing up to 80% of loans granted to companies for a period of 1 year.\n\n- \u00b7 In Colombia,  the  binding legislation  for payment  deferral  comes  from  the Financial  Superintendency,  specifically  from  its Circulars 07/2020 and 14/2020, as well as from Resolution No. 385. The payment deferral consists of the deferral of payments of principal and interest until 6 months. The term to avail themselves of them has been extended until July 2021.\n- \u00b7 In Peru, measures  were  approved  through various official  letters  issued by  the Superintendency  of Banking and  Insurance ('SBS'),  allowing  the deferral  of principal and interest payments initially  up to 6 months and then extended to 12, mainly  to individuals, self-employed and small companies.\n- Additionally, there have been public support programs such as 'Reactiva',  'Crecer'  or 'FAE' aimed at companies and microcompanies with guaranteed amounts that, depending on the program and the type of company, are in a range of between 60% and 98%.\n- \u00b7 In Argentina, payment deferral measures are based on state legislation such as Royal Decree 544/2020 or Decree 319/202, as well as various Central Bank regulations. Aimed at a broad group of customers, they facilitate deferral of capital and interest for up to 3 months.\n\nCertain public support programs offering guarantees of up to 100%  to micro-SMEs or

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nrelief  to debtors and that the economic value  of the affected loans has not been significantly  impacted, the payment deferral  measures granted  have  not  been  considered  substantial  contractual  modifications  and,  therefore,  modified  loans  are  accounted  for  as  a continuation of the originals. When a payment deferral  does not generate interest collection rights, a temporary loss of value is triggered for the transaction, which is  calculated  as the difference  between  the current value  of  the original and the modified  cash  flows,  both discounted at the effective interest rate of the original transaction. The difference is recognized at the initial time in the income statement under the heading 'Impairment or (reversal)  of impairment on financial  assets not measured  at fair  value  through profit or loss or net gains by modification' in the balance sheet as a reduction of the asset value  of the loans. From that point on, said correction accrues as net interest income at the original effective  interest rate within the period of the payment deferral.  Thus, at the end of the moratorium period, the impact on net attributed profit is basically neutral. As of December 31, 2020, the temporary value loss of the payment deferral included in the consolidated income statements amounted to \u20ac304 million, from which \u20ac300 million have already  been recognized as a higher interest margin as of that date.\n\nRegarding the classification  of exposures according to their credit risk, the Group has maintained a rigorous application of IFRS 9 when granting the payment deferrals  and has reinforced the procedures for monitoring credit risk both throughout the life of the transactions and at their maturity.\n\nThis means that the payment deferrals  granting does not imply in itself an automatic trigger for a significant increase  in risk and that the transactions subject to the payment deferrals are initially  classified  in the stage they had previously, unless, based on their risk profile, they should be classified in a worse stage. On the other hand, as evidence of payment has ceased  to exist or has been reduced, the Group has introduced additional indicators or segmentations to identify the significant increase in credit risk that may have occurred in some transactions or a set  of them and, where  appropriate, it has  been classified  in  Stage 2. Furthermore, the indications provided by  the European Banking Authority (EBA) have been taken into account to not consider forbearance the payment deferrals that meet a series of requirements. All this without prejudice to maintaining its consideration as a forbearance if it was previously qualified as such or classifying the exposure in the corresponding stage previously stated.\n\nOn the other hand, the treatment planned for the payment deferrals that expire and may require additional support will be in accordance with the updated evaluation  of the customer's credit quality  and the characteristics  of the solution granted. If applicable,  they will  be treated as Refinancing or Restructuring as described in Note 7.2.7 of the Financial Statements.\n\nRegarding public support for the loans' lending, it does not affect the evaluation of the significant increase in risk since it is valued through the credit quality of the instrument. However, in estimating the expected loss, the existence of the guarantor implies a possible reduction in the level  of provisions necessary since, for the hedged part, the loss that would be incurred in the foreclosure of the guarantee is taken into account.\n\nThe public guarantees granted in the different geographies in which the Group operates have been considered as an integral part of the terms and conditions of the loans granted under the consideration that the guarantees are granted at the same time that the financing is granted to the client and in a way inseparable  from it.\n\n## 7.2.1 Measurement of Expected Credit Loss (ECL)\n\nIFRS 9 requires determining the expected credit loss (ECL) of a financial instrument in a way that reflects an unbiased estimation remo ving any conservatism or optimism, including the time value of money and a forward-looking perspective (including the economic forecast), all  this based  on the information that is available  at a  certain point in  time and that is reasonable  and  bearable  with respect  to future economic conditions.\n\nTherefore, the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses is highly complex and involves the use of significant analysis  and estimation including formulation and incorporation of forward-looking economic conditions into the ECL model.\n\nThe  modeling  of  the  ECL calculation  is  subject  to a  governance  system  that is  common to  the entire  Group. Within this  common framework,  each  geography  makes  the  necessary  adaptations  to  capture  its  particularities.  The  methodology, assumptions  and observations used by each  geography are reviewed  annually, and after a validation and approval process, the outcome of this review  is incorporated into the ECL calculations.\n\n## Risk parameters by homogeneous groups\n\nExpected losses can be estimated both individually and collectively.  Regarding the collective estimate, the instruments are distributed in homogeneous groups  (segments)  that  share  similar  risk  characteristics.  Following  the  guidelines  established  by  the  Group for  the development of models under IFRS 9, each geography performs the grouping based on the information available, its representativeness or relevance  and compliance with the necessary statistical requirements.\n\nDepending on the portfolio or the parameter  being estimated, one risk  driver  or another will  apply and  different segments will  reflect differences  in PDs and LGDs. Thus, in each segment, changes in the level of credit risk will  respond to the impact of changing conditions on the common range of credit risk drivers. The effect on the group's credit risk in response to changes in forward-looking information will be considered as well.  Macroeconomic modeling for each segment is carried out using some of the shared risk characteristics.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThese  segments share  credit  risk  characteristics  such that changes in  credit  risk  in a  part of  the portfolio are  not concealed  by  the performance of other parts of the portfolio. In that sense, the methodology developed for ECL estimation indicates the risk drivers that have to be taken into account for PD segmentation purposes, depending on whether the estimation is for retail or wholesale portfolios.\n\nAs an example  of the variables that can be taken into consideration to determine the final models, the following stand out:\n\n- PD - Retail: Contractual residual maturity, credit risk scoring, type of product, days past due, forbearance, time on books, time to maturity, nationality of the debtor, sale  channel, original term, indicator of credit card activity, percentage  of initial  drawn balance.\n- PD  - Wholesale:  Credit Risk Rating, type of product, watch-list level,  forbearance  (client), time  to maturity, industry sector, updated balance (y/n), written off, grace period.\n- LGD - retail: credit Risk Scoring, segment, type of product, secured / unsecured, type of collateral,  sales channel, nationality, business area, debtor's commercial segment, forbearance (account) EAD (this risk driver could be correlated with the time on books or the LTV so, before  including it, an assessment  should be done in order to avoid a  double counting effect), time on default of the account (for defaulted exposures), geographical location.\n- LGD - wholesale: credit Risk Rating, geographical location, segment, type of product, secured / Unsecured, type of collateral, business area, forbearance (client), debtor's commercial segment time on default of the deal (for defaulted exposures).\n- CCF: wholesale/retail,  percentage of initial drawn balance,  debtor's commercial  segment, days past due, forbearance, credit limit activity, time on books.\n\nIn the BBVA Group, the expected losses calculated are based on the internal models developed for all the Group's portfolios, unless clients are subject to individualized estimates.\n\nExposures with other credit institutions, sovereign debt or with public administrations are characterized  by a low number of defaults, so the Group's historical bases do not contain sufficiently representative information to build impairment models based on them. However, there are external sources of information that, based on broader observations, are capable of providing the necessary inputs to develop models of expected losses. Therefore, based on the rating assigned to these exposures and taking into account the inputs obtained from these  sources, the calculations  of expected  losses  are  developed  internally,  including  their projection based  on the  macroeconomic perspectives.\n\n## Individual estimation of expected credit losses\n\nThe Group periodically  and individually  reviews  the situation and credit rating of its customers, regardless of their classification, taking into consideration the information deemed necessary  to do so. It also has procedures in place within the risk management framework to identify the factors that may lead to increased risk and, consequently, to a greater need for provisions.\n\nThe monitoring model established  by the Group consists of continuously monitoring the risks to which it is exposed, which guarantees their proper classification  in the different categories of IFRS 9. The original analysis  of the exposures is reviewed  through the procedures for updating the rating tools (rating and scoring), which periodically  review  the financial  situation of clients, influencing the classificatio n by stages of exposures.\n\nWithin this credit risk management framework, the Group has procedures that guarantee the review, at least annually, of all its wholesale counterparties through the so-called  financial  programs, which  include  the current and  proposed positioning of  the Group with  the customer  in  terms  of  credit  risk.  This  review  is  based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  client's  up-to-date financial  situation, which  is complemented  by  other  information  available  in  relation  to  individual  perspectives  on  business  performance,  industry  trends, macroeconomic  prospects or other public data. As a  result of this analysis,  the preliminary  rating of the client is obtained, which, after undergoing the internal procedure, can be revised down if deemed appropriate (for example, general economic environment or evolution of the sector). These  factors in addition to the information that the client can  provide are  used  to review  the ratings even  before  the scheduled financial plan reviews are conducted if circumstances warrant.\n\nAdditionally, the Group has established procedures to identify wholesale  customers in the internal Watch List category, which is defined as that risk in which, derived from an individualized credit analysis, an increase in credit risk is observed, either due to economic or financial difficulties or because  they have suffered, or are expected to suffer, adverse situations in their environment, without meeting the criteria for classification as impaired risk. Under this procedure, all a customer's Watch List exposures are considered Stage 2 regardless of when they originated, if as a result of the analysis the customer is considered to have significantly increased  risk.\n\nFinally,  the Group has so-called  Workout Committees, both local and  corporate, which analyze  not only the situation and evolution of significant clients in Watch List and doubtful situations, but also those significant clients in which, without having still rated on Watch L ist, they may present some Stage 2 rated exposure for a quantitative reason (PD comparison from origination). This analysis is carried out in order to decide if, derived from this situation, all the client's exposures should be considered in the Watch List category, which would imply the migration of all the client's operations to Stage 2 regardless of the date on which they originated.\n\nWith this, the Group ensures an individualized review of the credit quality of its wholesale counterparties, identifying the situations in wh ich a change in the risk profile of these clients may have occurred and proceeding, where appropriate, to estimate individualized credit losses.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nAlong with  this review,  the Group  individually  estimates  the  expected  losses  of  those clients  whose  total exposure  exceeds  certain thresholds, including  those that part  of their operations may  be classified  in  stage 1  and part  in stage  2. In setting thresholds, each geography determines  the minimum amount of a client's  exposure  whose expected  losses must be estimated  individually  taking into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7 For clients with exposures in stage 3. The analysis of clients with total risk above this threshold implies analyzing at least 40% of the total risk of the wholesale  portfolio in stage 3. Although the calibration of the threshold is done on the wholesale portfolio, clients of other portfolios must be analyzed if they exceed the threshold, staying in Stage 3.\n- \u00b7 For all other situations. The analysis of clients with total risk above this threshold implies analyzing at least 20% of the total risk of the Watch List wholesale portfolio. Although the threshold calibration is carried out on the exposure classified as Watch List, wholesale  clients  or clients  belonging to other portfolios that  have  exposures  classified  in  stage 2  and  whose  total exposure exceeds  the mentioned threshold must be analyzed individually, considering both the exposures classified in stage 1 as in stage 2.\n\nRegarding the methodology for the individual estimation of expected losses, it should be mentioned, firstly, that these are measured as the difference  between  the asset's carrying  amount and  the estimated future cash  flows  discounted at the financial  asset's effective interest\n\nThe estimated recoverable  amount should correspond to the amount calculated under the following method:\n\n- The present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective  interest rate; and\n- The estimation of the recoverable  amount of a collateralized  exposure reflects the cash flows that may result from the liquidation of the collateral.\n\nThe estimated future cash flows depend on the type of approach applied, which can be:\n\nGoing concern scenario: when the entity has updated and reliable  information about the solvency and ability of payment of the holders or guarantors. The operating cash flows  of the debtor, or the guarantor, continue and can be used to repay the financial  debt to all creditors. In addition, collateral may be exercised  to the extent it does not influence operating cash flows. The following aspects should be taken into account:\n\n- o Future operating cash flows should be based on the financial statements of the debtor.\n- o When the projections made on these financial statements assume a growth rate, a constant or decreasing growth rate must be used over a maximum growth period of 3 to 5 years, and subsequently constant cash flows\n- o The growth rate should be based on the analysis of the evolution of the debtor's financial statements or on a sound and applicable  business restructuring plan, taking into account the resulting changes in the structure of the company (for example, due to divestments or the interruption of unprofitable lines of business).\n- o (Re)-investments that are needed to preserve cash flows should be considered, as well  as any foreseeable  future cash-flow changes (e.g. if a patent or a long-term loan expires).\n- o When the recoverability of the exposure relies  on the realization of the disposal of some assets by the debtor, the selling price should reflect the estimated future cash flows that may result from the sale of the assets less the estimated costs associated with the disposal.\n- Gone concern scenario: when the entity does not have updated and reliable  information, it should consider that the estimation of loan receivable  flows is of high uncertainty. Estimation should be carried out through the estimation of recoverable amounts from the effective real guarantees received. It will not be admissible as effective  guarantees, those whose effectiveness depends substantially on the creditworthiness of the debtor or economic group in which it takes part. Under a  gone concern scenario, the collateral is exercised and the operating cash flows of the debtor cease. This could be the case if:\n- o The exposure has been past due for a long period. There is a rebuttable presumption that the allowance should be estimated under a gone concern criterion when arrears are greater than 18 months.\n- o Future operating cash flows of the debtor are estimated to be low or negative.\n- o Exposure is significantly collateralized,  and this collateral is central to cash-flow generation\n- o There is a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimation of the future cash flows. This would be the case if the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of the two previous years had been negative, or if the business plans of the previous years had been flawed (due to material discrepancies  in the back-testing)\n- o Insufficient information is available  to perform a going concern analysis",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails. Significant increase in credit risk\n\nAs  indicated  in  Note  2.2, the  criteria  for  identifying  the  significant  increase  in  risk  are  applied  consistently  throughout  the Group, distinguishing between quantitative reasons or by comparison of probabilities of default and qualitative reasons (more than 30 days of default, watch list consideration or non-impaired refinancing).\n\nTo manage credit risk, the Group uses all relevant information that is available and that may affect the credit quality of the exposures. Th is information may come mainly from the internal processes of admission, analysis and monitoring of operations, from the strategy d efined by the Group regarding the price of operations or distribution by geographies, products or sectors of activity, from the observance of the macroeconomic  environment, from market  data such as  interest rate curves, or prices  of the different financial  instruments, or from external sources of credit rating.\n\nThis set  of information is  the basis  for determining the rating and  scoring (see  note 7.1.4 for more  information on rating and scoring systems) corresponding to each  of the exposures and which  are  assigned  a probability  of default (PD)  that, as already  mentioned, it undergoes  an  annual  review  process  that  assesses  its  representativeness  (backtesting)  and  is  updated  with  new  observations. Furthermore, the projection of these PDs over time has been modeled based on macroeconomic expectations, which allows obtaining the probabilities of default throughout the life of the operations.\n\nBased on this common methodology, and in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 and the EBA guidelines on credit risk management practices (EBA / GL / 2017/06), each  geography has established  absolute and relative thresholds for identifying whether the expected changes in the probabilities of default have increased significantly compared to the initial moment, adapted to the particularities of each one of them in terms of origination levels, product characteristics, distribution by sectors or portfolios, and macroeconomic situation. To establish the aforementioned thresholds, a series of general principles are considered, such as:\n\n- Uniformity: Based on the rating and scoring systems that, in a homogeneous manner, are implemented in the Group's units.\n- Stability: The thresholds must be established to identify the significant increase in risk produced in exposures since their initial recognition and not only to identify those situations in which it is already foreseeable  that they will reach the level of impairment. For this reason, it is to be expected that of the total exposures there will always  be a representative group for which said increased  risk is identified.\n- Anticipation: The thresholds must consider the identification of the increased risk in advance  with respect to the recognition of the exposures as impaired  or even before a real default occurs. The calibration of the thresholds should minimize the cases in which the instruments are classified in stage 3 without having previously been recognized as stage 2.\n- Indicators or metrics: It is expected that the classification of the exposures in stage 2 will have sufficient permanence to allow them to develop an anticipatory management of them before, where appropriate, they end up migrating to stage 3.\n- Symmetry: IFRS 9 provides for a symmetric treatment both to identify the significant increase in risk and to identify that it has disappeared, so the thresholds also work to improve the credit classification of exposures. In this sense, it is expected that the cases in which the exhibitions that improve from stage 3 are directly classified  into stage 1 will be minimal.\n\nThe identification  of the significant increase  in risk from the comparison of the probabilities  of default should be  the main  reason why exposures in stage 2 are recognized.\n\nSpecifically,  a contract will be transferred to stage 2 when the following two conditions are met by comparing the current PD values  and the origination PD values:\n\n| \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 -  (%)  and                             |\n|----------------------------------------------|\n| 1 \u2217 100 > \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c |\n\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\n\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\n\nCurrent PD - Origination PD > Absolute threshold (pbs)\n\nThese absolute and relative  thresholds are consistently established for each geography and for each portfolio, taking into account their particularities and based on the principles described.

BBVA Group uses the classical credit risk parameters PD, LGD and EAD in order to calculate the ECL for the credit portfolios.\n\nBBVA Group's methodological approach in order to incorporate the forward looking information aims to determine the relation between macroeconomic variables  and risk parameters following three main steps:\n\n- Step 1: Analysis and transformation of time series data.\n- Step 2: For each dependent variable  find conditional forecasting models that are economically  consistent.\n- Step 3: Select  the best conditional forecasting model from the set of candidates defined  in Step 2, based on their forecasting capacity.\n\n## How economic scenarios are reflected in calculation of ECL\n\nThe forward looking component is added to the calculation of the ECL through the introduction of macroeconomic scenarios as an input. Inputs highly depend on the particular combination of region and portfolio, so inputs are adapted to available data regarding each of them.\n\nBased  on  economic  theory and  analysis,  the main  indicators most directly  relevant  for  explaining  and  forecasting  the selected  risk parameters (PD, LGD and EAD) are:\n\n- The net income of families, corporates or public administrations.\n- The outstanding payment amounts on the principal and interest on the financial instruments.\n- The value of the collateral  assets pledge to the loan.\n\nBBVA Group approximates these variables by using a proxy indicator from the set included in the macroeconomic scenarios provided by the economic research department.\n\nOnly a single specific  indicator for each of the three categories can be used and only one of the following core macroeconomic indicators should be chosen as first option:\n\n- The  real  GDP  growth for the purpose of  conditional forecasting can  be seen  as  the only 'factor'  required for capturing the influence of all potentially relevant macro-financial  scenarios on internal PDs and LGD.\n- The most representative short term interest rate (typically  the policy rate or the most liquid sovereign yield  or interbank rate) or exchange rates expressed in real terms.\n- A comprehensive and representative index of the price of real estate properties expressed in real terms in the case of mortgage loans and a representative and real term index of the price of the relevant commodity for corporate loan portfolios concentrated in exporters or producer of such commodity.\n\nReal GDP growth is given priority over any other indicator not only because it is the most comprehensive indicator of income and economic activity but also because it is the central variable  in the generation of macroeconomic scenarios.\n\n## Multiple scenario approach under IFRS 9\n\nIFRS 9 requires  calculating an unbiased  probability weighted measurement of expected  credit losses ('ECL') by evaluating a  range of possible outcomes, including forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nThe BBVA Research teams within the BBVA Group produce forecasts of the macroeconomic variables under the baseline scenario, which are used in the rest of the related processes of the Group, such as budgeting, ICAAP and risk appetite framework, stress testing, etc.\n\nAdditionally, the BBVA Research teams produced alternative scenarios to the baseline scenario so as to meet the requirements under the IFRS 9 standard.\n\n## Alternative macroeconomic scenarios\n\n- For each of the macro-financial  variables, BBVA Research produces three scenarios.\n- BBVA Research tracks, analyzes and forecasts the economic environment to provide a consistent forward looking assessment about the most likely scenario and risks that impact BBVA's footprint. To build economic scenarios, BBVA Research co mb in es official  data, econometric techniques and expert knowledge.\n- Each of these scenarios corresponds to the expected value  of a different area  of the probabilistic  distribution of the possible projections of the economic variables.",

This effect is calculated taking into account the weighted weight of the expected loss determined for each scenario.\n\nIt is important to note that in general, it is expected that the effect of the overlay is to increase the ECL. It is possible to obtain an overlay that does not have  that effect,  whenever  the relationship between  macro  scenarios  and losses  is  linear.  However,  the overlay  is  not expected to reduce the ECL On the other hand, the BBVA Group also takes into account the range of possible scenarios when defining its significant increase  in credit risk. Thus, the PDs used in the quantitative process to identify the significant increase in credit risk will be those that result from making a weighted average of the PDs calculated  under the three scenarios.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  generated  a  macroeconomic  uncertainty  situation with  a  direct  impact  on  credit  risk  of  the  entities, particularly,  on the expected  credit losses under IFRS 9. Even though the situation is unclear and of an unforeseeable  time length, the expectation is that this situation will  provoke a severe  recession followed by an economic recovery, which will not achieve  the pre-crisis GDP levels in the short-term, supported by the measures issued by governments and monetary authorities.\n\nThis situation has allowed the accounting authorities and the banking supervisors to adopt measures in order to mitigate the impacts that this crisis could imply on the calculation of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 as well  as on solvency, urging:\n\n- the entities to evaluate  all  the available  information, weighing more the long-term forecasts against the short-term economic situation\n- the governments to adopt measures to avoid the effects of impairment,\n- the entities to develop managerial measures as the design of specific products adapted to the situation which could occur du ring this crisis.\n\nAlmost all  accounting and  prudential  authorities have  issued  recommendations  or measures  within  the  COVID-19 crisis  framewor k regarding the estimation of the expected losses under IFRS 9 in a coordinated manner.\n\nThe common denominator of all of these recommendations is that, given the difficulty of establishing reliable  macroeconomic forecasts, the transitory term of the economic shock and the need to incorporate the effect of the mitigating measures issued by the governments, a  review  of the automatic application  of the models in  order to increase  the weight of the long-term macroeconomic  forecasts  in the calculation of the expected losses is needed. As a result thereof, the expected outcome over the lifetime of the transactions will have more weight than the short-term macroeconomic impact.\n\nIn this respect, the BBVA Group has taken into account those recommendations in the calculation of the expected credit losses under IFRS 9, considering that the economic situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is transitory and will be followed by a recovery, even if there is  uncertainty over the level  and the time period  of such recovery.  As a consequence,  different scenarios  have  been  taken into consideration in the calculation of expected losses, resulting in the model management believes suits best the current economic situation and the combined recommendations issued by the authorities. In addition to the outcome of the calculation of the scenarios, individual analysis of exposures which could be most affected by the circumstances caused by the COVID-19, have been taken into account.\n\nThe estimate for the next five  years  of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), of the variation in the unemployment rate and of the House Price Index (HPI), for the most relevant countries where it represents a significant factor, is determined by BBVA Research and it has b een used at the time of the calculation of the expected credit loss as of December 31, 2020:\n\n|      | Spain    | Spain        | Spain   | Spain   | Mexico   | Mexico            | Turkey   | Turkey       |    |\n|------|----------|--------------|---------|---------|----------|-------------------|----------|--------------|----|\n| Date | GDP      | Unemployment | HPI     | GDP     |          | Unemployment  HPI | GDP      | Unemployment |    |\n| 2020 | (11.20%) | 16.44%       | (1.44%) | (8.85%) | 4.57%    | 1.71%             | 2.07%    | 13.45%       |    |\n| 2021 | 6.63%    | 16.03%       | (3.28%) | 4.58%   | 5.40%    | (1.23%)           | 9.08%    | 12.60%       |    |\n| 2022 | 6.27%    | 12.72%       | 4.56%   |         | 3.80%    | 5.17%  0.32%      | 5.30%    | 11.58%       |    |\n| 2023 | 2.95%    | 10.82%       | 5.79%   |         | 1.62%    | 5.04%  0.31%      | 4.13%    | 11.58%       |    |\n| 2024 | 2.07%    | 9.58%        | 3.66%   | 1.47%   | 4.91%    | 1.01%             | 4.11%    | 11.19%       |    |\n| 2025 | 2.01%    | 8.55%        | 3.57%   | 1.47%   | 4.76%    | 1.72%             | 4.10%    | 10.85%       |    |",

sensitivity  exercise  has been  carried  out on the expected  losses  due  to variations  in the key  hypotheses as  they are  the ones that introduce the greatest uncertainty in estimating such losses.  As a  first step, GDP and  House Prices  have  been  identified  as the most relevant  variables.  These  variables  have  been  subjected  to  shocks  of  +/-  100  bps  in  their  entire  projection  window.  Independent sensitivities  have  been  assessed,  under  the  assumption  of  assigning  a  100%  probability  to  each  determined  scenario  with  these independent shocks.\n\nVariation in provisions is  determined both by re-staging (that is: in worse scenarios due to the recognition of lifetime credit losses for additional operations that are  transferred to stage 2 from stage1 where  12 months of losses are  valued: or vice  versa  in improvement scenarios) as well  as variations in the collective  risk parameters (PD and LGD) of each financial  instrument due to the changes defined in the macroeconomic forecasts of the scenario.\n\n|                | BBVA Group         | BBVA Group   | BBVA Group   | BBVA Group   | BBVA Group    | Spain              | Spain      | Spain      | Spain              | Mexico     | Mexico   | Mexico             | Turkey     | Turkey   |\n|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|------------|------------|--------------------|------------|----------|--------------------|------------|----------|\n| GPD            | Total  Portafoli o | Retail       | Mortgage s   | Wholesale r  | Fixed  income | Total  Portafoli o | Mortgage s | Companie s | Total  Portafoli o | Mortgage s | Cards    | Total  Portafoli o | Mortgage s | Cards    |\n| -100pb         | 3.55%              | 3.47%        | 3.72%        | 3.91%        | 1.58%         | 3.72%              | 4.39%      | 3.96%      | 3.91%              | 2.20%      | 6.30%    | 1.56%              | 1.58%      | 1.62%    |\n| +100pb         | (3.25%)            | (3.14% )     | (3.03%)      | (3.69%)      | (1.97% )      | (3.32%)            | (3.57%)    |            | (3.53%)  (3.64%)   | (2.07%)    | (5.78% ) | (1.47%)            | (1.55%)    | (1.47% ) |\n| Housin g price |                    |              |              |              |               |                    |            |            |                    |            |          |                    |            |          |\n| -100pb         |                    |              |              |              |               |                    | 5.41%      | 0.79%      |                    | 3.13%      |          |                    |            |          |\n| +100pb         |                    |              |              |              |               |                    | (5.35%)    | (0.77%)    |                    | (4.47%)    |          |                    |            |          |\n\n## Additional adjustments to expect loss measurement\n\nIn addition to what is described on individualized  and collective  estimates of expected losses and macroeconomic estimates, the Group may supplement the expected losses if it deems  it necessary  to collect  the effects  that may not be included, either by considering risk drivers or by the incorporation of sectorial particularities  or that may affect a set of operations or borrowers. These adjustments should be temporary, until the reasons that motivated them disappear or materialize.\n\nFor this reason, the expected  losses have been supplemented with additional amounts that have been considered necessary to collect the  particular  characteristics  of  borrowers,  sectors  or  portfolios  and  that  may  not  be  identified  in  the  general  process.  Of  the supplementary amounts recognized throughout the year, at the end of the year 2020, 244 million euros are pending allocation to specific borrowers, of which 223 million euros are located in Spain (mainly 57 million euros based on the volume of arrears pending maturity and whose behavior pattern is still subject to uncertainty, 127 million euros in sectors most affected by the pandemic and 40 million euros as a complement to the individualized analyzes) and 21 million euros in the United States in relation to the uncertainty of the Oil & Gas sector.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n- In the case  of financial  instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, exposure to credit risk is considered equal to its carrying amount (not including loss allowances) with the only exception of trading and hedging derivatives.\n- The maximum credit risk exposure on financial commitments and guarantees granted is the maximum that the Group wo uld be liable  for if these guarantees were  called  in, or the higher amount pending to be disposed from the customer in the case  of commitments.\n- The calculation of risk exposure for derivatives is based on the sum of two factors: the derivatives fair value and their potential risk (or \"add-on\").\n\nThe breakdown by geographical location and Stage of the maximum credit risk exposure, the accumulated allowances  recorded and the carrying amount of the loans and advances to customers as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is shown

The BBVA Group applies a credit risk hedging and mitigation policy deriving from a banking approach focused on relationship banking. The existence of guarantees could be a necessary but not sufficient instrument for accepting risks, as the assumption of risks by the Group requires prior evaluation of the debtor's capacity for repayment, or that the debtor can generate sufficient resources to allow the amortization of the risk incurred under the agreed terms.\n\nThe policy of accepting risks is therefore organized into three different levels in the BBVA Group:\n\n- Analysis of the financial risk of the transaction, based on the debtor's capacity for repayment or generation of funds.\n- The constitution of guarantees that are adequate, or at any rate generally accepted, for the risk assumed, in any of the generally accepted forms: monetary, secured, personal or hedge guarantees; and finally\n- Assessment of the repayment risk (asset liquidity) of the guarantees received.\n\nThis is carried out through a prudent risk policy that consists of the analysis of the financial risk, based on the capacity for reimbursement or generation of resources of the borrower, the analysis of the guarantee, assessing, among others, the efficiency, the robustness and the",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nrisk, the adequacy of the guarantee with the operation and other aspects such as the location, currency, concentration or the existence of limitations. Additionally, the necessary  tasks for the constitution of guarantees must be carried out - in any of the generally  accepted forms (collaterals, personal guarantees and financial hedge instruments) - appropriate to the risk assumed.\n\nThe procedures for the management and valuation of collateral are set out in the corporate general policies (retail and wholesale), which establish  the  basic  principles  for  credit  risk  management,  including  the  management  of  collaterals  assigned  in  transactions  with customers. The criteria  for the systematic,  standardized and effective  treatment of collateral  in credit transaction procedures in BBVA Group's wholesale and retail banking are included in the Specific  Collateral Rules.\n\nThe methods used to value the collateral are in line with the best market practices and imply the use of appraisal  of real-estate collateral, the market  price  in  market  securities,  the trading price  of shares  in  mutual funds, etc.  All the  collaterals  received  must be  correctly assigned and entered in the corresponding register. They must also have the approval of the Group's legal units.\n\nThe valuation of the collateral is taken into account in the calculation of the expected losses. The Group has developed internal models to estimate the realization value of the collaterals received, the time that elapses until then, the costs for their acquisition, maintenance and subsequent sale,  from real  observations based  on its own experience.  This modeling is part of the LGD estimation processes  that are applied to the different segments, and is included within the annual review and validation procedures.\n\nThe following is a description of the main types of collateral  for each financial  instrument class:\n\n- Debt instruments held for trading: The guarantees or credit enhancements obtained directly from the issuer or counterparty are implicit in the clauses of the instrument (mainly guarantees of the issuer).\n- Derivatives  and hedging derivatives:  In derivatives,  credit  risk is  minimized  through contractual netting agreements,  where positive- and negative-value derivatives with the same counterparty are offset for their net balance. There may likewise be other kinds of guarantees and collaterals, depending on counterparty solvency and the nature of the transaction (mainly collaterals).\n\nThe summary of the offsetting effect (via netting and collateral) for derivatives and securities operations as of December 31, 2020 is presented in Note 7.3.2.\n\n- Other  financial  assets  designated  at  fair  value  through profit  or  loss  and  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through other comprehensive income: The guarantees or credit enhancements obtained directly from the issuer or counterparty are inherent to the structure of the instrument (mainly personal guarantees).\n- As of December  31, 2020, 2019  and 2018, BBVA Group had no credit risk exposure of impaired  financial  assets at fair valu e through other comprehensive income (see Note 7.2.2).\n- Financial assets at amortized cost:\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances to credit institutions: These usually have the counterparty's personal guarantee or pledged secu r it ies in the case of repos.\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances  to customers: Most of these loans and advances are backed by personal guarantees extended by the  customer. There  may  also  be  collateral  to secure  loans  and  advances  to  customers (such  as  mortgages, cash collaterals, pledged securities and other collateral), or to obtain other credit enhancements (bonds or insurances).\n- \u00b7 Debt securities: The guarantees or credit enhancements obtained directly from the issuer or counterparty are inherent to the structure of the instrument.\n- Financial  guarantees, other contingent risks and drawable  by third parties: these have the counterparty's personal guarantee or other types of collaterals.\n\nThe  disclosure  of impaired  loans  and advances  at amortized  cost covered  by  collateral  (see  Note  7.2.6), by type  of collateral,  as  of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is the following:\n\n|                                               | Maximum                    | Of which  secured  by collateral   | Of which  secured  by collateral   | Of which  secured  by collateral   | Of which  secured  by collateral   | Of which  secured  by collateral   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | exposure  to  credit  risk | Residential  properties            | Commercial  properties             | Cash                               | Others                             | Financial                          |\n| Impaired loans and advances at amortized cost | 14,678                     | 2,717                              | 789                                | 18                                 | 52                                 | 575                                |\n| Total                                         | 14,678                     | 2,717                              | 789                                | 18                                 | 52                                 | 575                                |",

To analyze the performance of PD, the Group has a series of tracking tools and historical databases that collect the pertinent internally generated information. These tools can be grouped together into scoring and rating models.\n\n## Scoring\n\nScoring  is  a  decision-making  model  that  contributes to  both the  arrangement  and  management  of  retail  loans:  consumer  loans, mortgages, credit cards for individuals, etc. Scoring is the tool used to decide to originate a loan, what amount should be originated and what strategies can help establish the price, because it is an algorithm that sorts transactions by their credit quality. This algorithm en ab les the BBVA Group to assign a score to each transaction requested by a customer, on the basis of a series  of objective characteristics that have statistically been shown to discriminate between the quality and risk of this type of transactions. The advantage of scoring lies in its simplicity and homogeneity: all that is needed is a series of objective data for each customer, and this data is analyzed automatically using an algorithm.\n\nThere are three types of scoring, based on the information used and on its purpose:\n\n- Reactive  scoring: measures  the  risk  of  a  transaction  requested  by  an  individual  using variables  relating  to the  requested transaction and to the customer's socio-economic data available at the time of the request. The new transaction is approved or rejected depending on the score.\n- Behavioral scoring: scores transactions for a given product in an outstanding risk portfolio of the entity, enabling the credit r ating to be  tracked  and  the customer's needs  to be  anticipated.  It  uses  transaction  and  customer  variables  available  internally. Specifically,  variables that refer to the behavior of both the product and the customer.\n- Proactive scoring: gives a score at customer level using variables related to the individual's general behavior with the entity, and to his/her payment behavior in all  the contracted products. The purpose is to track the customer's credit quality and it is used to pre-approve new transactions.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nRating  tools, as  opposed  to  scoring  tools, do  not  assess  transactions  but  focus  on  the  rating  of  customers  instead:  companies, corporations, SMEs, general governments, etc. A rating tool is an instrument that, based on a detailed financial study, helps determine a customer's  ability  to meet  his/her  financial  obligations. The  final  rating is  usually  a  combination  of  various  factors:  on  one  hand, quantitative factors, and on the other hand, qualitative factors. It is a middle road between an individual analysis  and a statistical analysis.\n\nThe main difference between ratings and scorings is that the latter are used to assess retail products, while ratings use a wholesale banking customer approach. Moreover, scorings only include objective variables, while ratings add qualitative information. And although both are based on statistical studies, adding a business view, rating tools give more weight to the business criterion compared to scoring tools.\n\nFor  portfolios  where  the  number  of  defaults  is  low  (sovereign  risk,  corporates,  financial  entities,  etc.)  the  internal  information  is supplemented by 'benchmarking' of the external rating agencies (Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch). To this end, each year the PDs compiled by the rating agencies  at each level  of risk rating are compared, and the measurements  compiled by the various agencies  are mapped against those of the BBVA master rating scale.\n\nOnce the probability of default of a transaction or customer has been calculated, a \"business cycle  adjustment\" is carried  out. This is a means of establishing a measure of risk that goes beyond the time of its calculation. The aim is to capture representative information of the behavior of portfolios over a complete economic cycle.  This probability is linked  to the Master Rating Scale  prepared by the BBVA Group to enable uniform classification of the Group's various asset risk portfolios.\n\nThe table below shows the abridged scale used to classify the BBVA Group's outstanding risk as of December 31, 2020:\n\n| External  rating     | Internal  rating         | Probability of default  (basis points)   | Probability of default  (basis points)   | Probability of default  (basis points)   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Standard&Poor's List | Reduced List (22 groups) | Average                                  | Minimum from  >=                         | Maximum                                  |\n| AAA                  | AAA                      | 1                                        | -

These calculations  establish the levels  of probability of default for the BBVA Group's Master Rating Scale. Although this scale is common to the entire Group, the calibrations (mapping scores to PD sections/Master Rating Scale levels)  are carried  out at tool level for each country in which the Group has tools available.\n\nThe table below outlines the distribution by probability of default within 12 months and stages of the gross carrying amount of loans and advances to customers in percentage terms of the BBVA Group as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:",

The use of refinancing and restructuring for other purposes, such as to delay loss recognition, is contrary to BBVA Group policies.\n\nThe BBVA Group's refinancing and restructuring policies are based on the following general principles:\n\n- Refinancing and restructuring is authorized according to the capacity of customers to pay the new installments. This is done by first identifying the origin of the payment difficulties  and then carrying out an analysis  of the customers' viability, including an updated analysis of their economic and financial situation and capacity to pay and generate funds. If the customer is a co mpany, the analysis also covers the situation of the industry in which it operates.\n- With the aim  of increasing  the solvency of the transaction, new guarantees and/or guarantors of demonstrable solvency are obtained where  possible.  An essential  part  of this process  is  an  analysis  of  the effectiveness  of  both the new  and  original guarantees.\n- This analysis  is carried out from the overall customer or group perspective.\n- Refinancing and restructuring transactions do not in general increase the amount of the customer's loan, except for the expense inherent to the transaction itself.\n- The capacity  to refinance and restructure a loan is not delegated to the branches, but decided on by the risk units.\n- The decisions made are reviewed from time to time with the aim of evaluating full compliance with refinancing and restructuring policies.\n\nThese general principles are adapted in each case according to the conditions and circumstances of each geographical area in which the Group operates, and to the different types of customers involved.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nIn the case of retail customers (private individuals), the main aim of the BBVA Group's policy on refinancing and restructuring a loan is to avoid  default  arising  from a  customer's temporary liquidity  problems  by  implementing structural solutions that do not  increase  the balance of the customer's loan. The solution required is adapted to each case and the loan repayment is made easier, in accordance  with the following principles:\n\n- Analysis of the viability of transactions based on the customer's willingness and ability to pay, which may be reduced, but sh ould nevertheless  be  present.  The  customer  must  therefore  repay  at  least  the  interest  on  the  transaction  in  all  cases.  No arrangements may be concluded that involve a grace period for both principal and interest.\n- Refinancing and restructuring of transactions is only allowed on those loans in which the BBVA Group originally entered into.\n- Customers subject to refinancing and restructuring transactions are excluded from marketing campaigns of any kind.\n\nIn the case of non-retail customers (mainly companies, enterprises and corporates), refinancing/restructuring is authorized according to an economic and financial  viability plan based on:\n\n- Forecasted  future  income,  margins  and  cash  flows  to  allow  entities  to implement  cost adjustment  measures  (industrial restructuring) and a  business development plan  that can help  reduce the level  of leverage  to sustainable  levels  (capacity  to access the financial  markets).\n- Where appropriate, the existence  of a divestment plan for assets and/or operating segments that can generate cash to assist the deleveraging process.\n- The capacity  of shareholders to contribute capital and/or guarantees that can support the viability of the plan.\n\nIn accordance  with the Group's policy,  the conclusion of a  loan  refinancing  and restructuring transaction does  not mean  the  loan is reclassified  from \"impaired\" or \"significant increase in credit risk\" to normal risk. The reclassification to \"significant increase in credit risk\" or normal risk categories must be based on the analysis  mentioned earlier  of the viability,  upon completion of the probationary periods described below.\n\nThe Group maintains the policy of including risks related to refinanced and restructured loans as either:\n\n- \"Impaired assets\", as although the customer is up to date with payments, they are classified  as unlikely to pay when there are significant doubts that the terms of their refinancing may not be met; or\n- \"Significant increase in credit risk\" until the conditions established for their consideration as normal risk are met.\n\nThe assets classified  as \"Impaired assets\" should comply with the following conditions in order to be reclassified  to \"Significant increase in credit risk\":\n\n- The customer has to have paid a significant part of the pending exposure.\n- At least one year must have elapsed  since its classification  as \"Impaired asset\".\n- The customer does not have past due payments and objective criteria, demonstrating the borrower's ability to pay, have been verified.\n\nThe conditions established for assets classified  as 'Significant increase in credit risk' to be reclassified  out of this category are as follows:\n\n- The customer must have paid past-due amounts (principal and interest) since the date of the renegotiation or restructuring of the loan or other objective criteria,  demonstrating the borrower's ability  to pay, have  been verified;  none of its exposures is more than 30 days past-due.\n- At least two years must have elapsed  since completion of the renegotiation or restructuring of the loan and regular payments must have been made during at least half of this probation period; and\n- It is unlikely that the customer will have financial  difficulties and, therefore, it is expected that the customer will be able to meet its loan payment obligations (principal and interest) in a timely manner.\n\nThe economic impact caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has required the adaptation of the repayment schedule of a large volume of loans in all geographies and portfolios. In general, this support has been conducted through the concession of deferrals  that comply with the principles  established  by  the  EBA,  which  has  allowed  for  the  application  of  a  differential  accounting  and  prudential  treatment.\n\nRenewals  and renegotiations will  be classified  as normal  risk, provided that there is no significant increase  in risk. This classification  is applicable  at the initial moment, and in the event of any deterioration, the criteria established  in the existing governance are followed. In this sense, the aforementioned conditions are considered, including, among others, no facility with more than 30 days delinquency  and not being identified as 'unlikely  to pay'.\n\nThe BBVA Group's refinancing and restructuring policy provides for the possibility of two modifications in a 24 month period for loans that are not in compliance with the payment schedule.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe internal models used to determine  allowances  for loan losses consider the restructuring and renegotiation of a loan, as well as redefaults  on such a  loan,  by assigning a  lower  internal  rating to restructured and  renegotiated loans than the  average  internal  rating assigned to non-restructured/renegotiated loans. This downgrade results in an  increase  in the probability of default  (PD) assigned to restructured/renegotiated loans  (with the resulting PD being  higher than the average  PD of  the non- renegotiated loans in  the same portfolios).\n\nFor quantitative information on refinancing and restructuring transactions see Appendix XI.\n\n## 7.2.8 Risk concentration\n\n## Policies for preventing excessive risk concentration\n\nIn order to prevent the build-up of excessive  risk concentrations at the individual,  sector, portfolio and geography levels,  BBVA Group maintains  updated  maximum  permitted  risk  concentration  indices  which  are  tied  to  the  various  observable  variables  related  to concentration risk.\n\nTogether with the limits for individual  concentration, the Group uses the Herfindahl  index to measure  the concentration of the Group's portfolio and the banking group's subsidiaries. At the BBVA Group level, the index reached implies a \"very low\" degree of concentration.\n\nThe limit on the Group's exposure or financial commitment to a specific customer therefore depends on the customer's credit rating, the nature of the risks involved, and the Group's presence in a given market, based on the following guidelines:\n\n- The aim is, as much as possible, to reconcile the customer's credit needs (commercial/financial,  short-term/long-term, et c.) with the interests of the Group.\n- Any legal limits that may exist concerning risk concentration are taken into account (relationship between risks with a cu st o mer and the capital of the shareholder's entity that assumes them), the markets, the macroeconomic situation, etc.\n\n## Risk concentrations by geography\n\nThe breakdown of the main figures in the most significant foreign currencies in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is set forth in Appendix XII.\n\n## Sovereign risk concentration\n\n## Sovereign risk management\n\nThe risk  associated  with the transactions involving sovereign risk is  identified, measured,  controlled and tracked by  a centralized  unit integrated in the BBVA Group's Risk Area. Its basic functions involve the preparation of reports in the countries where sovereign risk exists (called  'financial  programs'), tracking such risks, assigning ratings to these countries and, in general, supporting the Group in terms of reporting requirements for any transactions involving sovereign risk. The risk policies  established in the financial programs are approved by the relevant risk committees.\n\nThe country risk unit tracks the evolution of the risks  associated with the various countries to which the Group are exposed (including sovereign risk) on an ongoing basis in order to adapt its risk and mitigation policies to any macroeconomic and political changes that may occur. Moreover, it regularly updates its internal ratings and forecasts for these countries. The methodology is based on the assessment of quantitative and qualitative parameters which are in line with those used by certain multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, rating agencies and export credit organizations.\n\nFor additional information on sovereign risk in Europe see Appendix XII.\n\n## Risk related to the developer and Real-Estate sector in Spain\n\nThe relative weight of the investment in Real Estate developments has dramatically  decreased during the last years, especially since 2014 and during 2018, when doubtful assets exited the balance sheet and recovery of the sector concluded. A corporate sales policy has been rolled out to eliminate those real estate assets from the balance sheet which have been most difficult to commercialize. The sales of 80% of the Group's share in Divarian and of other performing and NPL wholesale portfolios to Funds and specialized investors have been some of the most relevant transactions (see Note 3).\n\n## Policies  and strategies established by the Group to deal with risks related to the developer and real-estate sector\n\nBBVA Group has teams  specializing  in the  management  of the  Real  Estate  Sector  risk,  given  its  economic  importance  and  specific technical component. This specialization is not only in risk teams, but throughout the handling, commercial, problem risks and legal, etc. It also  includes  the research  department of the BBVA Group (BBVA Research),  which  helps determine  the medium/long-term vision needed to manage this portfolio.",

The monitoring of the work, sales  prospects and the legal  situation of the project are  essential aspects for the admission and follow-up of new real estate transactions. With regard the participation of the Risk Acceptance teams, t h ey have  a  direct  link  and  participate  in  the  committees  of  areas  such  as  Valuation,  Legal,  Research  and  Recoveries.  This  guarantees coordination and exchange of information in all the processes.\n\nIn this context, and within the current Real Estate cycle, the strategy with clients is subject to an Asset Allocation limit and to an action framework that allows defining a target portfolio, both in volume and in credit quality.\n\n## Risk monitoring policies\n\nThe base information for analyzing the real estate portfolios is updated monthly. There is a systematic monitoring of developments under close monitoring with the evolution of works and sales. Since 2013, there are no threats of new defaults in the portfolio.\n\n## Policies  applied in the management of real estate assets in Spain\n\nThe internal Rules on Real Estate Financing, which establish recommendations for financing a  new housing development business, are reviewed  and updated annually.\n\nThe recommendations represent guidelines  about how to manage the credit admission  activity of BBVA Group entities based on best practices  of markets  in which  this activity  is  performed.  It is  expected  that a  high percentage  of  the current  transactions  will  be  in compliance with the latter.\n\nFor quantitative information about the risk related to the developer and Real-Estate sector in Spain see Appendix XII.\n\n## 7.3 Market risk\n\nMarket risk originates from the possibility of experiencing losses in the value of positions held as a result of movements in market variables that affect  the valuation of financial  assets and liabilities.  Market risk in the Group's trading portfolios stems mainly from the portfolios originated by Global Markets valued at fair value and held for the purpose of trading and generating short-term results. Market risk in the field  of banking book is clearly  and distinctly addressed and can be broken down into structural risks relating to interest rate, exchange rate and equity (see Note 7.4).\n\n## 7.3.1 Market risk in trading portfolios\n\nThe main risks in the trading portfolios can be classified as follows:\n\n- Interest-rate risk: This  arises  as  a result  of exposure to movements  in the different interest-rate curves  involved in  trading. Although the  typical  products that  generate  sensitivity  to the  movements  in  interest  rates  are  money-market  products (deposits, interest-rate  futures, call  money  swaps,  etc.)  and  traditional  interest-rate  derivatives  (swaps  and  interest-rate options such as caps, floors, swaptions, etc.), practically all the financial products are exposed to interest-rate movements due to the effect that such movements have on the valuation of the financial discount.\n- Equity risk:  This  arises  as  a  result  of movements  in  share  prices.  This risk  is  generated  in  spot positions in shares  or  any derivative products whose underlying asset is a share or an equity index. Dividend risk is a sub-risk of equity risk, arising as an input for any equity option. Its variation may affect the valuation of positions and it is therefore a factor that generates risk on the books.\n- Exchange-rate risk: This is caused by movements in the exchange rates of the different currencies in which a position is held. As in the case  of equity risk, this risk is generated in spot currency positions, and in any derivative product whose underlying asset is an exchange rate. In addition, the quanto effect (operations where  the underlying asset and the instrument itself are denominated in  different currencies)  means  that in  certain  transactions in  which the underlying asset  is not a  currency, an exchange-rate risk is generated that has to be measured and monitored.\n- Credit-spread risk: Credit spread is an indicator of an issuer's credit quality. Spread risk occurs due to variations in the levels of spread of both corporate and government issues, and affects positions in bonds and credit derivatives.\n- Volatility risk: This occurs as a result of changes in the levels  of implied  price volatility of the different market instruments on which derivatives are traded. This risk, unlike the others, is exclusively  a component of trading in derivatives and is defined as a first-order convexity risk that is generated in all possible underlying assets in which there are products with options that req u ire a volatility input for their valuation.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe metrics developed  to control and monitor market risk  in the BBVA Group are  aligned with market practices  and are  implemented consistently across all the local market risk units.\n\nMeasurement procedures are established  in terms of the possible impact of negative market conditions on the trading portfolio of the Group's Global Markets units, both under ordinary circumstances and in situations of heightened risk factors.\n\nThe  standard metric  used to measure  market  risk is  Value  at Risk ('VaR'), which  indicates  the maximum  loss that may  occur  in the portfolios at a  given confidence  level  (99%) and  time horizon (one day).  This statistic value  is  widely  used in  the market and  has the advantage of summing up in a single metric the risks inherent to trading activity, taking into account how they are related and providing a prediction of the loss that the trading book could sustain as a result of fluctuations in equity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and  credit  spreads.  The  market  risk  analysis  considers  various  risks,  such as  credit  spread  risk, basis  risk,  as  well  as  volatility  and correlation risk.\n\nWith respect to the risk measurement models used by the BBVA Group, the Bank of Spain has authorized the use of the internal market risk model to determine bank capital requirements deriving from risk positions on the BBVA S.A. and BBVA Mexico trading book, which jointly accounted for around 72%, 72% and 76% of the Group's trading-book market risk as of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the rest of the geographical areas where the Group operates (applicable mainly to the Group's South America subsidiaries, Garanti BBVA and BBVA USA), bank capital for the risk positions in the trading book is calculated using the Standardized Approach defined by the B asel Committee on Banking Supervision (which is referred to herein as the \"standard model').\n\nThe current management structure includes the monitoring of market-risk limits, consisting of a scheme of limits based on VaR, economic capital (based on VaR measurements) and VaR sub-limits, as well as stop-loss limits for each of the Group's business units.\n\nThe model used estimates VaR in accordance with the historical simulation methodology, which involves estimating losses and gains t hat would have taken place in the current portfolio if the changes in market conditions that took place over a specific period of time in the past were repeated. Based on this information, it predicts the maximum expected loss of the current portfolio within a given confidence level. This model  has the advantage  of reflecting precisely  the historical  distribution of the market variables  and not assuming any  specific distribution of probability. The historical period used in this model is two years.\n\nVaR figures are estimated with the following methodologies:\n\n- VaR without smoothing, which awards equal  weight to the daily information for the previous two years. This is currently the official  methodology for measuring market risks for the purpose of monitoring compliance with risk limits.\n- VaR with smoothing, which gives a greater weight to more recent market  information. This metric  supplements the previous one.\n\nThe use of VaR by historical simulation methodology as a risk metric has many advantages, but also certain limitations, among which it is worth highlighting:\n\n- The estimate of the maximum daily loss of the Global Markets portfolio positions (with a confidence level  of 99%) depends on the market movements of the last two years, not picking up the impact of large market events if they have not occurred within that historical window\n- The  use  of the 99%  confidence  level  does  not consider potential losses  that can  occur  beyond this level.  To mitigate  this limitation, different stress exercises  are also performed, as described later.\n\nAt the same time, and following the guidelines established by the Spanish and European authorities, BBVA incorporates metrics in addition to VaR with the aim of meeting the Bank of Spain's regulatory requirements with respect to the calculation of bank capital for the trading book. Specifically,  the measures incorporated in the Group since December 2011 (stipulated by Basel 2.5) are:\n\n- VaR: In regulatory terms, the VaR charge incorporates the stressed VaR charge, and the sum of the two (VaR and stressed VaR) is  calculated.  This  quantifies  the  losses  associated  with  the movements  of  the risk  factors  inherent  to market  operations (including interest-rate risk, exchange-rate  risk, equity risk  and credit  risk, among others). Both VaR and  stressed VaR are rescaled  by a regulatory multiplier set at three and by the square root of ten to calculate the capital charge.\n- Specific  Risk - Incremental Risk Capital ('IRC') Quantification of the risks of default and downgrading of the credit ratings of the bond and credit  derivative  positions in the portfolio. The IRC charge is exclusively  applied  in  entities in respect of which  the internal market risk model is used (i.e. BBVA, S.A. and BBVA Mexico). The IRC charge is determined based on the associated losses  (calculated  at 99.9% confidence  level  over a one year  horizon under the hypothesis of constant risk) due to a rating change and/or default of the issuer with respect to an asset. In addition, the price risk is included in sovereign positions for the specified  items.\n- Specific  Risk  -  Securitization  and  correlation  portfolios. Capital  charges  for  securitizations  and  correlation  portfolios  are assessed based on the potential losses associated with the rating level of a specific  credit structure. They are calculated  by the standard model.  The scope  of  the correlation portfolios refers  to the First To Default  (FTD)-type market  operation and/or tranches of market CDOs and only for positions with an active market and hedging capacity.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nValidity tests are performed regularly on the risk measurement models used by the Group. They estimate the maximum  loss that could have been incurred in the assessed positions with a certain level  of probability (backtesting), as well  as measurements of the impact of extreme market  events on risk positions (stress testing). As an additional control measure, backtesting is conducted at a trading desk level  in order to enable more specific  monitoring of the validity of the measurement models.\n\n## Market risk in 2020\n\nThe Group's market risk  related to its trading portfolio remained at low levels  compared  to other risks managed by BBVA, particularly credit risk. This is due to the nature of the business. In 2020 the average VaR was \u20ac27 million, above the figure of 2019, with a maximum level  in the year reached on the day May 14, 2020 of \u20ac39 million. The evolution in the BBVA Group's market risk during 2020, measured as VaR without smoothing (see Glossary) with a 99% confidence level  and a 1-day horizon (shown in millions of Euros) is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy type of market risk assumed by the Group's trading portfolio, the main risk factor for the Group continued to be that linked to in t er est rates, with a  weight of 56% of the total at December 31, 2020 (this figure includes the spread risk). The relative weight of this risk has increased  compared  with the close  of 2019  (58%). Exchange-rate risk  accounted for 22% of  the total risk,  increasing its weight  with respect to December 2019 (13%), while equity, volatility and correlation risk has decreased, with a weight of 22% at the close of 2020 (vs. 29% at the close of 2019).\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018  the VaR was  \u20ac32 million, \u20ac20 million  and \u20ac17 million, respectively.  The total VaR figures for 2020, 2019 and 2018 can be broken down as follows:",

The aim of backtesting is to validate the quality and precision of the internal market risk model used by BBVA Group to estimate the maximum daily loss of a portfolio, at a 99% level  of confidence and a 250-day time horizon, by comparing the Group's results and the risk measurements generated by the internal market risk model. These tests showed that the internal market risk model of both, BBVA, S.A. and Global Markets Mexico is adequate and precise.\n\nTwo types of backtesting have been carried  out in 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n- \"Hypothetical\" backtesting: the daily VaR is compared with the results obtained, not taking into account the intraday results or the changes in the portfolio positions. This validates the appropriateness of the market risk metrics for the end-of-day position.\n- \"Real\" backtesting: the daily VaR is compared with the total results, including intraday transactions, but discounting the possible minimum charges or fees involved. This type of backtesting includes the intraday risk in portfolios.\n\nIn addition, each of these two types of backtesting was carried out at a risk factor or business type level, thus making a deeper comparison of the results with respect to risk measurements.\n\nFor the period between  the year ended December  31, 2019 and the year  ended December  31, 2020, the backtesting of the internal VaR calculation model was carried out, comparing the daily results obtained to the risk level  estimated by the internal VaR calculation model. In that period, there were no negative exceptions in BBVA S.A., while in BBVA Mexico there were  a total of 3 exceptions. The COVID-19 epidemic  together with the fall in the oil price resulted in a sharp depreciation of the local currency, a considerable  spike in stock market volatility, a breakdown of the correlation between different curves and an abrupt movement in local interest rate curves.\n\nAt the end of the year the comparison showed the internal VaR calculation model was  working correctly, within the \"green\" zone (0-4 exceptions), thus validating the internal VaR calculation model, as has been the case  each year since the internal market risk model was approved for the Group.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nA number of stress tests are carried  out on the BBVA Group's trading portfolios. First, global and local historical scenarios are used that replicate  the behavior of an extreme past event, such as for example  the collapse  of Lehman Brothers or the \"Tequilazo\"  crisis. These stress tests are  complemented with simulated scenarios, where  the aim is  to generate scenarios that have  a significant impact  on the different portfolios, but without being anchored to any specific  historical scenario.  Finally, for some portfolios or positions, fixed stress tests are also carried out that have a significant impact on the market variables affecting these positions.\n\n## Historical scenarios",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe historical benchmark stress scenario  for the BBVA Group is Lehman Brothers, whose sudden collapse  in September  2008 led to a significant  impact  on the behavior  of financial  markets  at a  global  level.  The following  are  the most relevant  effects  of this historical scenario:\n\n- Credit shock: reflected mainly in the increase of credit spreads and downgrades in credit ratings.\n- Increased  volatility  in  most of  the financial  markets  (giving rise  to a great  deal  of variation  in  the prices  of different  assets (currency, equity, debt).\n- Liquidity shock in the financial systems, reflected by a major movement in interbank curves, particularly in the shortest sections of the euro and dollar curves.\n\n## Simulated scenarios\n\nUnlike  the historical scenarios, which are fixed and therefore not suited to the composition of the risk portfolio at all times, the scenario used  for the exercises  of economic  stress  is  based  on resampling  methodology. This methodology is  based  on the  use  of  dynamic scenarios that are recalculated periodically  depending on the main risks affecting the trading portfolios. On a data window wide enough to collect different periods of stress (data are taken from January 1, 2008  until the date of the assessment), a simulation is performed by resampling of historic observations, generating a distribution of losses and gains that serve to analyze the most extreme of births in the selected  historical  window. The  advantage of this methodology is  that the period of stress is  not predetermined, but depends on the portfolio maintained at each time, and making a large number of simulations (10,000 simulations) allows a greater richness of information for the analysis of expected shortfall than what is available  in the scenarios included in the calculation of VaR.\n\nThe main features of this approach are: a) the generated simulations respect the correlation structure of the data, b) there is flexibility in the inclusion of new risk factors and c) it allows the introduction of a lot of variability in the simulations (desirable for considering extreme events).\n\nThe impact of the stress test under multivariable simulation of the risk factors of the portfolio based on the expected shortfall (expected shortfall calculated  at a 95% confidence level,  20 days) as of December  31, 2020 is as follows:\n\n|                    | Europe   | Mexico   | Peru   | Venezuela   | Argentina   | Colombia   | Turkey   |\n|--------------------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n| Expected shortfall | (121)    | (69)     | (8)    | -           | (8)         | (4)        | (8)      |\n\n## 7.3.2 Financial Instruments offset\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities  may be netted in certain cases. In particular, they are presented for a net amount on the consolidated balance sheet only when the Group's entities satisfy the provisions of IAS 32-Paragraph 42, so they have  both the legal  right to net recognized amounts, and the intention of settling the net amount or of realizing the asset and simultaneously paying the liability.\n\nIn addition, the Group has presented as gross amounts assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for which there are master netting arrangements in place, but for which there is no intention of settling the net amount. The most common types of events that trigger the  netting of reciprocal  obligations are  bankruptcy of  the  entity, surpassing certain  level  of  indebtedness threshold, failure  to pay, restructuring and dissolution of the entity.\n\nIn the  current market  context, derivatives  are  contracted under  different  framework  contracts  being the  most widespread  the ones developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives  Association ('ISDA') and, for the Spanish market, the Framework  Agreement on Financial  Transactions  ('CMOF'). Almost all  portfolio derivative  transactions have  been concluded  under these framework  contracts, including in them the netting clauses mentioned in the preceding paragraph as \"Master Netting Agreement\", greatly reducing the credit exposure  on these instruments. Additionally, in  contracts signed with  counterparties, the collateral  agreement  annexes  called  Credit Support Annex ('CSA') are included, thereby minimizing exposure to a potential default of the counterparty.\n\nMoreover, many of the transactions involving assets purchased or sold under a repurchase agreement  are transacted through clearing houses that articulate mechanisms to reduce counterparty risk, as well as through the signing of various master agreements for bilateral transactions, the most widely used being the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), published by the International Capital M arket Association ('ICMA'), to which the clauses related  to the collateral  exchange are usually added within the text of the master agreement itself.",

Every month, with the participation of the CEO and representatives from the areas of Finance, Risks and Business Areas; this committee monitors the structural risks and is presented with proposals with regard to action plans related with its management for its approval. These management proposals are made  by the Finance area  with a forward-looking focus, maintaining the alignment with the risk appetite framework, trying to guarantee the recurrence of results and financial  stability, as well  as  to preserve  the solvency  of  the entity. All  balance  management  units have  a  local  ALCO, which  is  permanently  attended  by members of the corporate center, and there is a  corporate ALCO where  management  strategies are  monitored and presented  in the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nGRM area  acts  as  an  independent  unit, ensuring adequate  separation  between  the  management  and  risk  control  functions, and  is responsible for ensuring that the structural risks in the Group are managed according to the strategy approved by the Board of Direct ors.\n\nConsequently,  GRM  deals  with  the  identification,  measurement,  monitoring and  control  of  those  risks  and  their  reporting  to  the corresponding corporate bodies. Through the Global Risk Management Committee (GRMC), it performs the function of control and risk assessment  and  is  responsible  for developing  the strategies, policies,  procedures  and  infrastructure necessary  to identify,  evaluate, measure and manage the significant risks that the BBVA Group faces. To this end, GRM, through the corporate unit of Structural Risks, proposes a scheme  of limits and alerts that defines the risk appetite set for each of the relevant structural risk types, both at Group level and by management units, which will be reviewed annually, reporting the situation periodically to the Group's corporate bodies as well as to the GRMC.\n\nWithin the three lines of defense scheme in which BBVA's internal control model is established according to the most advanced standards in terms of internal control, the first line of defense is composed by the Finance area, which is responsible for managing the structural risk.\n\nWhile  GRM, as  a  second  line  of  defense,  is  in  charge  of  identifying  risks,  and  establishing  policies  and  control models,  periodically evaluating their effectiveness.\n\nIn the second line of defense, there are  also the Internal Risk Control units, which independently review  the Structural Risk control, and Internal  Financial  Control, which  carry  out a  review  on the  design  and effectiveness  of  the operational  controls over  structural  risk management.\n\nThe third line  of defense  is represented by the Internal Audit area, which, with total independence, is  responsible for reviewing  specific controls and processes.\n\n## 7.4.1 Structural interest rate risk\n\nThe structural interest-rate risk ('IRRBB') is related to the potential impact that variations in market interest rates have on an entity's n et interest income  and  equity. In order to properly  measure  IRRBB, BBVA takes  into account the main  sources that generate  this risk: repricing risk, yield curve risk, option risk and basis risk, which are analyzed with an integral vision, combining two complementary points of view: net interest income (short term) and economic value (long term).\n\nThe exposure of a financial entity to adverse interest rates movements is a risk inherent to the development of the banking business, wh ich is also, in turn, an opportunity to create economic value. Therefore, interest rate risk must be effectively  managed so that it is limited in accordance with the entity's equity and in line with the expected economic result.\n\nThis function falls to the Global ALM (Asset & Liability Management) unit, within the Finance area, who, through ALCO, aims to guarantee the recurrence of results and preserve the solvency of the entity, always adhering to the risk profile defined by the management bodies of the BBVA Group. The interest rate risk management of the balance  sheet aims  to promote the stability of the net interest income and book value with respect to changes in market interest rates, types of markets in the different balance-sheets, while  respecting solvency and internal limits, as well  as complying with current and future regulatory requirements. Likewise,  a specific  monitoring of the banking book instruments registered at market value (fair value) is developed, which due to their accounting treatment have an impact on results and / or equity.\n\nIn this regard, the BBVA Group maintains an exposure to fluctuations on interest rates according to its objective strategy and risk profile, being carried out in a decentralized and independent manner in each of the banking entities that compose its structural balance-sheet.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe management is carried out in accordance with the guidelines established by the European Banking Authority (EBA), with a monitoring of interest rate risk metrics, with the aim of analyzing the potential impact that could be derived from the range of scenarios in the different balance-sheets of the Group.\n\n## Nature of Interest Rate Risk\n\nRepricing risk arises  due to the difference  between the repricing or maturity terms of the assets and liabilities,  and represents the most frequent interest rate risk faced by financial entities. However, other sources of risk as changes in the slope and shape of the yield  curve, the reference  to different indexes  and the optionality risk embedded in certain banking transactions, are also taken into account by the risk control system.\n\nBBVA's structural interest-rate risk management process is formed from a set of metrics and tools that enables the capture of additional sources to properly monitor the risk profile of the Group, backed-up by an assumptions set that aims to characterize the behavior of the balance sheet items with the maximum accuracy.\n\nThe IRRBB measurement is carried out on a monthly basis, and includes probabilistic measures based on methods of scenario simulation, which  enables  to capture  additional sources of risk  to the parallel  shifts, as the changes in slope  shape  and the basis of yield  curves. Additionally, sensitivity analysis to multiple parallel  shocks of different magnitude are also assessed on a regular basis. The process is run separately for each currency to which the Group is exposed, considering, at a later stage, the diversification effect among currencies and business units.\n\nThe risk measurement model is complemented by the assessment  of ad-hoc scenarios  and stress tests. As stress testing has become more relevant during the recent years, the evaluation of extreme  scenarios of rupture of historical interest rates levels,  correlations and volatility has continued to be enhanced, while  assessing, also, BBVA Research market scenarios, and incorporating the set of scenarios defined according to EBA guidelines.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group worked to improve the control and management model in accordance with the guidelines established by the EBA on the management of interest rate risk in the banking book. It is worth highlighting, among other aspects, the reinforcement of the st r ess analysis,  including the evaluation of the impacts on the main  balance  sheet accounts of the Group that could derive from the range of interest rate scenarios defined according to the EBA guidelines mentioned above.\n\n## Key assumptions of the model\n\nIn order to measure structural interest rate risk, the setting of assumptions on the evolution and behavior of certain balance  sheet items is particularly  relevant, especially  those related to products without an explicit or contractual maturity.\n\nThe  assumptions  that characterize  these  balance  sheet  items  must  be  understandable  for  the  areas  and  bodies  involved  in  risk management  and  control  and  remain  duly  justified  and  documented.  The  modeling  of  these  assumptions  must  be  conceptually reasonable and consistent with the evidence based on historical experience, reviewed  at least once a year.\n\nIn view  of  the  heterogeneity of  the  financial  markets  and  the  availability  of  historical  data,  each  one of  the  entities  of the  Group is responsible  for determining the behavior assumptions to be  applied  to the balance  sheet  items, always  under the guidelines  and the applicability  of the corporate models existing in the Group.\n\nAmong the balance  sheet assumptions stand out those established for the treatment of items without contractual maturity, mainly for demand customer deposits, and those related  to the expectations on the exercise  of interest rate options, especially  those relating to loans and deposits subject to prepayment risk.\n\nFor the modeling of demand deposits, a segmentation of the accounts in several  categories  is previously carried out depending on the characteristics of the customer (retail / wholesale) and the product (type of account / transactionality / remuneration), in order to outline the specific behavior of each segment.\n\nIn order to establish the remuneration of each  segment, the relationship between the evolution of market interest rates and the interest rates of managed  accounts is analyzed,  with the aim  of determining the translation dynamic  (percentages  and lags) of interest rates variations to the remuneration of the accounts.\n\nThe  behavior assigned  to each  category of accounts is  determined  by an  analysis  of the historical  evolution of  the balances  and  the probability of cancellation  of the accounts. For this, the volatile  part of the balance  assigned to a short-term maturity is isolated,  thus avoiding fluctuations in the level  of risk caused by specific  variations in the balances  and promoting stability in the management of the balance.  Once  the stable  part is  identified, a medium  / long term maturity model is applied  through a decay  distribution based on the average term of the accounts and the conditional cancellation probabilities throughout the life of the product.\n\nAdditionally, the relationship of the evolution of the balance of deposits with the levels of market interest rates is taken into account, wh ere appropriate, including the potential migration between the different types of deposits (on demand / time deposits) in the different in t er est rate scenarios.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nEqually relevant is the treatment of early cancelation options embedded in credit loans, mortgage portfolios and customer deposits. The evolution of market interest rates may condition, along with other variables, the incentive that customers have to prepay loans or deposits, modifying the future behavior of the balance amounts with respect to the forecasted contractual maturity schedule.\n\nThe detailed  analysis  of the historical information related  to prepayment data, both partial and total prepayment, combined with other variables  such as interest rates, allows  estimating future amortizations and, where  appropriate, their behavior linked  to the evolution of such variables.\n\nThe approval and updating of the risk behavior models of structural interest rate risk are subject to corporate governance under the scope of GRM-Analytics. In this way, the models must be properly inventoried and cataloged and comply with the requirements established in the  internal  procedures  for  their  development,  updating  and  management  of  the  changes.  The  models  are  also  subject  to  the corresponding internal validations based on their relevance and the established monitoring requirements.\n\nThe table below shows the profile of average interest rate risk in terms of sensitivities of the main currencies in the BBVA Group in 2020:\n\n## Sensitivity to interest-rate analysis - December 2020\n\n|            | Impact on net interest income (*)   | Impact on net interest income (*)   | Impact on economic value (**)   | Impact on economic value (**)   |\n|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|            | 100 basis-point  increase           | 100 basis-point  decrease (***)     | 100 basis-point  increase       | 100 basis-point  decrease (***) |\n| EUR        | [1.5% , 3.5%]                       | [-1.5% , -0.5%]                     | [3.5% , 5.5%]                   | [-3.5% , -1.5%]                 |\n| MXN        | [0.5% , 1.5%]                       | [-1.5% , -0.5%]                     | [-1.5% , -0.5%]                 | [0.5% , 1.5%]                   |\n| TRY        | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                      | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                      | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                  | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                  |\n| Other      | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                      | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                      | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                  | [-0.5% , 0.5%]                  |\n| BBVA Group | [3.5% , 5.5%]                       | [-3.5% , -1.5%]                     | [3.5% , 5.5%]                   | [-3.5% , -1.5%]                 |\n\nDuring 2020, central banks and governments have carried out monetary stimulus measures to mitigate the economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,  which  has significantly  affected  the global economy,  spreading to most countries. In Europe, the monetary stimulus measures of the European Central Bank have continued, and the Euribor have fallen, reaching historical low records. In the United States, the reference rates (Libor) have maintained a downward trend, in line with the cuts made by the Federal Reserve in the first q uar ter of the  year.  Also in Mexico,  the monetary policy  rate  has  fallen  significantly  during the  year.  In Turkey, although it  initially  showed  a downward trend in interest rates, aggressive increases  have been registered since August, reversing the declines  of previous quarters, ending the year with an increase of 500 basis points above December's level  of 2019.\n\nIn South America, monetary policy has been expansionary, with a reduction in reference  rates in the economies of Colombia and Peru, reaching  historical  low records,  affected  by  the contraction in  activity. On  the other hand, in Argentina there is  a  strongly restrictive monetary policy, with a high increase in interest rates in the second half of the year, due to the strong volatility of the markets, affected by the devaluation of the exchange rate.\n\nThe  BBVA Group, at  an aggregate level,  continues to maintain  a  moderate  risk  profile, in  accordance  with  the established  objective, showing a favorable position to a rise in interest rates on net interest income. Effective management of the balance  sheet structural risk has mitigated the negative impact of the downward trend in interest rates and the volatility experienced as a result of the effects of COVID19, and is reflected in the strength and recurrence of the margin of interests:\n\n- In Europe and the United States, the downward trend in interest rates remains limited  by current levels,  preventing extremely adverse scenarios from occurring. Both balance sheets are characterized  by a loan portfolio with a high proportion referenced to a variable interest rate (mainly mortgages in Spain and loans to companies in both countries) and a liability composed mainly of  customer  deposits. The  COAP  portfolios act  as  hedging  of  the  bank  balance,  mitigating  its  sensitivity  to interest  rate movements. This profile has remained stable during 2020 on both balance sheets. In Spain, the sensitivity of the interest margin has increased  in the year due to the maintenance  of higher balances  of sensitive  liquid assets as a result of the generation of liquidity  on the balance  sheet  and the additional  financing  of TLTRO III (see  Note 22), and due  to maturity of  a  part of the coverage  of the mortgage portfolio. In the United States, the sensitivity has  been reduced  due to the balance  sheet  hedges carried out in late 2019 and early 2020.\n- In Mexico, a balance  has been maintained between balances referenced  to fixed and variable  interest rates. Among the assets most sensitive to interest rate movements, the wholesale  portfolio stands out, while consumer and mortgages are mostly at a fixed rate. The COAP portfolio is used to balance  the longer term of customer deposits. The sensitivity of the interest margin remains  limited and stable during 2020, considering the new  interest rate scenario that emerged in March, with a downward trend in rates benchmark throughout 2020.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n- In Turkey, the interest rate risk on the balance sheet increased during 2020, as a result of regulatory requirements (such as the Asset Ratio, applied by the Banking Regulation Supervision Agency (BRSA) and the Good Bank, established by the Central B ank of Turkey (CBRT)) that encourage loan growth. As a result of the establishment of these Regulations, the growth of loans, mo stly at a fixed rate, together with the increase  in the COAP portfolio, negatively affected  sensitivity, being offset by inflation-linked bonds and floating bonds, as well as due to the increase in deposits in the liability side.\n- In South America, the risk profile on interest rates continues to be low, as most of the countries in the area have a composition of fixed  / variable  and  very similar  maturities between  assets and liabilities,  showing a  sensitivity of the margin interest rate limited and with slight variations throughout 2020. Likewise, in countries with balances  in several  currencies, interest rate risk is  also managed  for each  of the currencies,  showing a  very  low level  of risk. The  measures  promoted by central  banks  and governments have  contributed to raising  deposits  and  excess  liquidity  in  Colombia  and  Peru,  as  well  as  their  positions in monetary assets, generating a slight positive variation in margin sensitivity.\n\n## 7.4.2 Structural exchange-rate risk\n\nStructural exchange rate risk, inherent to the business of international banking groups that develop their activities in different geographies and currencies, is defined as the possibility of impacts on solvency, equity value  and results driven by fluctuations in the exchange rates due to exposures in foreign currencies.\n\nIn the BBVA Group, structural exchange-rate risk arises from the consolidation of holdings in subsidiaries with functional currencies o t her than the euro. Its management is centralized in order to optimize the joint management of permanent foreign currency exposures, t aking diversification into account.\n\nThe corporate Global ALM unit, through ALCO, designs and executes hedging strategies with the main purpose of preserving the stability of consolidated capital ratios and income flows generated in a currency other than the euro in the BBVA Group, keeping a value generation perspective to preserve the Group's equity in the long term. To this end, a dynamic management strategy is carried out, considering hedge transactions according to market expectations and their costs.\n\nThe risk monitoring metrics included in the framework of limits, in line with the Risk Appetite Framework, are integrated into management and supplemented with additional assessment indicators. At the corporate level they are based on probabilistic metrics that measure the maximum deviation in the Group's Capital, CET1  ('Common Equity Tier  1') ratio, and net attributable profit. The  probabilistic metrics make  it possible to estimate the joint impact of exposure to different currencies taking into account the different variability  in exchange rates and their correlations.\n\nThe  suitability  of these  risk  assessment  metrics  is  reviewed  on a  regular  basis  through back-testing  exercises.  The  final  element  of structural exchange-rate risk control is the stress and scenario analysis  aimed to assess the vulnerabilities  of foreign currency structural exposure not contemplated by the risk metrics and to serve as an additional tool when making management decisions. The scenarios are based both on historical situations simulated by the risk model and on the risk scenarios provided by BBVA Research.\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, the main  currencies of the geographies where  the Group operates have depreciated  against the euro during the year: Mexican peso (-13.1%), US Dollar (-8.5%), Turkish lira (-26.7%), Colombian peso (-12.6%), Peruvian sol (-16.3%) and A rgen t ine peso (-34.8%).\n\nThe Group's structural exchange-rate risk exposure level has in some cases increased due to the restrictions related to dividend payments from the subsidiaries which have offset the reduction in risk due to the depreciation of the currencies. The hedging policy intends to keep low levels of sensitivity to movements in the exchange rates of emerging markets currencies against the euro. The risk mitigation level in the capital ratio due to the book value of the BBVA Group's holdings in foreign emerging markets currencies stood at around 65% and, as of the end of 2020, CET1 ratio sensitivity to the depreciation of 10% in the euro exchange rate for each currency is estimated: USD +9 bps; Mexican  peso -5 bps; Turkish lira  -2 bps; other currencies  -1 bp (excluding hyperinflation  economies). On the other hand, hedging of emerging markets currency denominated earnings in 2020 reached 65%, concentrated in Mexican peso, Turkish lira and the main Latin American currencies.\n\nFor the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, the estimated sensitivities of the result attributable to the parent company are shown below, taking into account the coverage against depreciations and appreciations of 1% of the average  rate in the main currencies. To the extent that hedging positions are periodically modulated, the sensitivity estimate attempts to reflect an average (or effective) sensitivity in the year:",

This exposure is modulated in some portfolios with positions held on derivative  instruments on the same underlying assets, in order to adjust the portfolio sensitivity to potential changes in equity prices.\n\nThe management of structural equity portfolios is a responsibility of Global ALM and other Group's units specialized in this area. Their activity  is  subject  to  the  risk  management  corporate  policy  on  structural  equity  risk  management,  complying  with  the  defined management principles and Risk Appetite Framework.\n\nThe structural equity risk metrics, designed by GRM according to the corporate model, contribute to the effective monitoring of the risk by  estimating the  sensitivity  and  the capital  necessary  to cover  the  possible  unexpected  losses  due  to changes  in  the  value  of  the shareholdings in the Group's investment portfolio, with a level  of confidence that corresponds to the objective rating of the entity, taking into account the liquidity of the positions and the statistical behavior of the assets to be considered\n\nIn order to analyze  the risk profile  in depth, stress tests and scenario analysis of sensitivity to different simulated scenarios are carried out. They are  based on both past crisis  situations and forecasts made by BBVA Research. These  analyses  are  carried  out regularly to assess  the vulnerabilities  of structural equity  exposure not contemplated by  the risk metrics  and to serve  as  an additional  tool when making management decisions.\n\nBacktesting is carried out on a regular basis on the risk measurement model used.\n\nGlobal  Equity markets have  been severely  affected  by the outbreak of the coronavirus in the first quarter. The extraordinary fiscal  and monetary response fostered their recovery although this has been uneven across different  geographies and sectors. In this sense, the Spanish equity market has shown one of the worst performances as it fell 15% during 2020.\n\nStructural equity risk, measured in terms of economic capital, has remained  fairly  stable in the period. The aggregate sensitivity of the BBVA Group's consolidated equity to a 1% fall  in the price of shares of the companies making up the equity portfolio decreased  to -\u20ac20 million as of December  31, 2020, compared to -\u20ac26 million as of December  31, 2019. This estimation takes into account the exposure in shares valued at market prices, or if not applicable, at fair value (excluding the positions in the Treasury Area portfolios) and the net deltaequivalent positions in derivatives on the same underlyings\n\n## 7.5 Liquidity and funding risk\n\nLiquidity and funding risk is defined as the incapacity of a bank in meeting its payment commitments due to lack of funds or that, to face those commitments, should have to make use of funding under burdensome terms\n\n## 7.5.1 Liquidity and Funding Strategy and Planning\n\nThe BBVA Group is a multinational financial  institution whose business is focused mainly  on retail and commercial  banking activities. In addition to the retail business model, which forms its core business, the Group engages in corporate and investment banking, through the global CIB (Corporate & Investment Banking) division.\n\nLiquidity and funding risk management aims to maintain a solid balance sheet structure which allows a sustainable business model. The Group's liquidity and funding strategy is based on the following pillars:\n\n- The principle  of the funding self-sufficiency  of its subsidiaries, meaning that each  of the Liquidity Management Units (LMUs) must cover its funding needs independently on the markets where  it operates. This avoids possible contagion due to a crisis affecting one or more of the Group's LMUs.",

This approach helps prevent and limit  liquidity risk by reducing the Group's vulnerability during periods of high risk. This decentralized management prevents possible contagion from a crisis affecting only one or a few Group entities, which must act independently to meet their liquidity requirements in the markets where they operate.\n\nWithin this strategy, the BBVA Group is organized into eleven LMUs compose of the parent company and the bank subsidiaries in each geography, plus the branches that depend on them.\n\nIn addition, the policy for managing liquidity and funding risk is also based on the model's robustness and on the planning and in t eg ration of risk  management into the budgeting process of each  LMU, according to the financing risk appetite  that it decides  to assume  in its business.\n\nLiquidity and funding planning is part of the strategic processes for the Group's budgetary and business planning. This objective is to allow a recurrent growth of the banking business with suitable maturities and costs within the established risk tolerance levels  by using a wide range of instruments which allow the diversification of the funding sources and the maintenance of a high volume of available liquid assets.\n\n## 7.5.2 Governance and monitoring\n\nThe responsibility for liquidity and funding management in the development of normal business activity lies with the Finance area as a first line  of defense  in  managing the risks inherent to this activity,  in accordance  with  the principles  established  by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and in line  with the most demanding standards, policies,  procedures and controls in the framework established by the governing bodies. Finance, through the Balance-Sheet Management area, plans and executes the funding of the structural long-term gap of each LMU and proposes to the Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) the actions to be taken on this matter, in accordance with the policies established by the Risk Committee in line with the metrics of the Risk Appetite Framework approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nFinance is  also responsible  for preparing the regulatory reporting of liquidity, coordinating with the responsible areas  in each  LGU the necessary processes to cover the requirements at corporate and regulatory level, ensuring the integrity of the information provided.\n\nGRM is responsible for ensuring that the liquidity and financing risk in the Group is managed in accordance with the framework established by governing bodies. It also deals with the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of such risks and their communication to the relevant corporate bodies. In order to carry out this task properly, the risk function in the Group has been configured as a single, g lo bal function, independent of the management areas\n\nAdditionally, the Group has, in its second line of defense, an Internal Risk Control unit, which performs an independent review of the control of Liquidity and Financing Risk, and a Financial Internal Control Unit that reviews the design and effectiveness  of the controls operations on liquidity management and reporting.\n\nAs the third line of defense of the Group's internal control model, Internal Audit is in charge of reviewing specific  controls and processes in accordance with a work plan that is drawn up annually.\n\nThe Group's fundamental objectives regarding the liquidity and funding risk are determined through the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and through the Loan-to-Stable Customer Deposits (LtSCD) ratio.\n\nThe LCR ratio is a regulatory metric that aims to guarantee the resilience of entities in a scenario of liquidity tension within a time horizon of 30 days. Within its risk appetite framework  and system of limits and alerts, BBVA has established a required LCR compliance level  for the entire Group and for each individual LMU. The internal levels  required are aimed at efficiently  meeting the regulatory requirement, at a widely level  above 100%.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe  LtSCD ratio measures  the relationship  between  net lending  and stable  customer funds. The  aim  is  to preserve  a  stable funding structure in the medium term for each of the LMUs which make  up the BBVA Group, taking into account that maintaining an adequate volume  of stable  customer funds is key  to achieving  a  sound liquidity  profile.  In geographical  areas  with dual-currency balances,  the indicator is also controlled by currency to manage the mismatches that might occur.\n\nStable customer funds are considered to be the financing obtained and managed from the LMUs among their target customers. Those funds are characterized by their low sensitivity to market changes and by their less volatile behavior at aggregated level per operation due to the loyalty of the customer to the entity. The stable resources are calculated by applying to each identified customer segment a haircut determined by the analysis of the stability if the balances by which different aspects are evaluated (concentration, stability, level of loyalty). The main source of stable resources arises from wholesale  funding and retail customer funds.\n\nIn order to establish the target (maximum) levels  of LtSCD in each LMU and provide an optimal funding structure reference  in terms of risk appetite, the corporate Structural Risks unit of GRM identifies  and assesses  the economic and financial  variables  that condition the funding structures in the different geographical areas.\n\nAdditionally, liquidity and funding risk management aims to achieve  a proper diversification of the funding structure, avoiding excessive dependence on short-term funding by establishing a maximum level  for the short-term funds raised, including both wholesale financing and the least  stable  proportion of customer funds In relation to long-term financing, the maturity profile  does not present significant concentrations, which makes it possible to adapt the schedule of the planned issuance plan to the best financial conditions in the markets. Lastly, concentration risk is monitored at LMU level, with the aim of ensuring a correct diversification of both the counterparty and type of instrument.\n\nOne of the fundamental metrics within the general management framework of the liquidity and funding risk is the maintenance of a liquidity buffer consisting of high quality assets free  of charges which can be sold or offered as  collateral  to obtain funding, either under normal market conditions or in stress situations.\n\nThe Finance is responsible for the collateral  management and determining the liquidity buffer within the BBVA Group. According to the principle of auto-sufficiency of the Group's subsidiaries, each LMU is responsible for maintaining a buffer of liquid assets which complies with the regulatory requirements applicable  under each jurisdiction. In addition, the liquidity buffer of each LMU must be aligned with the liquidity and funding risk tolerance as well  as the management limits set and approved for each case.\n\nIn this context, the short-term resistance of the liquidity risk profile is promoted, ensuring that each LMU has sufficient collateral  to deal with the risk of the closure  of wholesale  markets. Basic  capacity  is the internal metric  for the management  and control of short-term liquidity risk, which is defined as the relationship between the explicit assets available  and the maturities of wholesale liabilities  and volatile resources, at different time periods up to the year, with special  relevance  at 30 and 90 days, with the objective of preserving the survival period above 3 months with the available buffer, without considering the balance inflows.\n\nAs a  fundamental element of the liquidity and financing risk  monitoring scheme, stress tests are carried out. They enable to anticipate deviations from the liquidity targets and the limits set in the appetite, and to establish tolerance ranges in the different management areas. They also play a major role in the design of the Liquidity Contingency Plan and the definition of specific measures to be adopted to rectify the risk profile if necessary.\n\nFor each  scenario,  it  is checked  whether  BBVA has  a  sufficient  stock of  liquid  assets  to guarantee  its capacity  to meet  the liquidity commitments/outflows in  the different  periods analyzed.  The  analysis  considers  four scenarios:  one central  and  three  crisis-related (systemic crisis; unexpected internal crisis with a considerable rating downgrade and/or affecting the ability to issue in wholesale markets and the perception of business risk by the banking intermediaries and the entity's clients; and a mixed scenario, as a combination of the two aforementioned scenarios). Each scenario considers the following factors: existing market liquidity, customer behavior and sources of  funding, the  impact  of  rating  downgrades,  market  values  of  liquid  assets  and  collateral,  and  the  interaction  between  liquidity requirements and the development of BBVA's credit quality.\n\nThe stress tests conducted on a  regular basis  by GRM reveal  that BBVA maintains  a sufficient  buffer of liquid  assets to deal  with the estimated liquidity outflows in a scenario  resulting from the combination of a systemic  crisis and an unexpected internal crisis, during a period of longer than 3 months in general  for the different LMUs (with the exception of Turkey where despite closing the year above 3 months, the  regulatory  requirements  have  led  to  non-compliance  during  certain  periods),  including  in  the  scenario  of  a  significant downgrade of the Bank's rating by up to three notches.\n\nTogether with the results of the stress tests and the risk metrics, the early warning indicators play an important role within the corporate model  and  the  Liquidity  Contingency Plan.  They  are  mainly  indicators  of  the funding  structure, in  relation  to  asset  encumbrance, counterparty concentration, flights of customer deposits, unexpected use  of credit facilities,  and of the market, which help  anticipate possible risks and capture market expectations.\n\nFinance is the area responsible for the elaboration, monitoring, execution and update of the liquidity and funding plan and of the market access strategy to guarantee and improve the stability and diversification  of the wholesale funding sources.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nIn order to implement and establish management in an anticipated manner, limits are  set on an annual basis for the main management metrics that form part of the budgeting process for the liquidity and funding plan. This framework of limits contributes to the planning of the joint future performance of:\n\n- The loan book, considering the types of assets and their degree of liquidity, as well  as their validity as collateral in collateralized funding.\n- Stable customer funds, based on the application of a methodology for establishing which segments and customer balances are considered to be stable or volatile funds based on the principle of sustainability and recurrence of these funds.\n- Projection of the credit gap, in order to require a degree of self-funding that is defined in terms of the difference between the loan-book and stable customer funds.\n- Incorporating the planning of securities portfolios into the banking book, which include both fixed-interest and equity securities, and are classified  as financial  assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and at amortized cost, and additionally on trading portfolios.\n- The structural gap projection, as a result of assessing the funding needs generated both from the credit gap and by the securities portfolio in the banking book, together with the rest of on-balance-sheet wholesale funding needs, excluding trading portfolios. This gap therefore needs to be funded with customer funds that are not considered stable or on wholesale markets.\n\nAs a result of these funding needs, the BBVA Group plans the target wholesale  funding structure according to the tolerance set in each LMU target.\n\nThus, once the structural gap has been identified and after resorting to wholesale markets, the amount and composition of wholesale structural funding is established in subsequent years, in order to maintain a diversified funding mix and guarantee that there is not a high reliance  on short-term funding (short-term wholesale funding plus volatile customer funds).\n\nIn practice, the execution of the principles of planning and self-funding at the different LMUs results in the Group's main source of funding being customer deposits, which consist mainly of demand deposits, savings deposits and time deposits.\n\nAs sources of funding, customer deposits are complemented by access to the interbank market and the domestic and international cap it al markets  in order to address  additional  liquidity requirements, implementing  domestic and international programs for the issuance  of commercial  paper and medium and long-term debt.\n\nThe process  of analysis  and assessment  of the liquidity and funding situation and of the inherent risks is  a process  carried  out on an ongoing basis in the BBVA Group, with the participation of all the Group areas involved in liquidity and funding risk management. This process is  carried  out at both local  and corporate level.  It is incorporated into the decision- making  process for liquidity  and funding management, with integration between the risk appetite strategy and establishment and the planning process, the funding plan and the limits scheme.\n\n## 7.5.3 Liquidity and funding performance\n\nDuring 2020, the BBVA Group has maintained a robust and dynamic funding structure with a predominantly retail nature, where cu st o mer resources represent the main source of funding.\n\nDuring 2020, liquidity conditions have remained  comfortable in all the countries where the BBVA Group operates. Since the beginning of March, the global crisis caused by COVID-19 has had a significant impact on financial  markets. The effects  of this crisis on the Group's balance  sheets materialized  fundamentally at first, through greater provision of credit lines by wholesale  clients in view  of the worsening financing conditions in the markets, with no significant effect  on the retail world. These provisions were largely paid off over the following quarters. Dealing with this situation of initial uncertainty, the different central banks provided a joint response through specific measures and programs to facilitate the financing of the real economy and the provision of liquidity in financial  markets, increasing liquidity buffers in almost all areas  with BBVA presence\n\nThus, the performance of the indicators show that the robustness of the funding structure remained steady during 2020, 2019 and 2018, in the sense that all LMUs held self-funding levels with stable customer resources above the requirements.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe liquidity situation of the Group's main management units is detailed below:\n\nIn the Euro Liquidity Management Unit (UGL), the liquidity and financing situation remains solid and comfortable with a large high-quality liquidity  buffer that has  been  increased  during the year  as  a  result of  the growth in  customer deposits and the actions  taken by  the European Central Bank, which have meant an injection of liquidity in the system. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, there was initially a greater demand for credit through the increase in the use of credit lines by the Corporate & Investment Banking wholesale business, wh ich was  also accompanied  by a growth in customer deposits. Subsequently, there were  partial  refunds of those lines  while  deposits have continued to grow. In addition, it is important to note the measures implemented by the ECB to deal with this crisis, which have included different  actions such  as: the expansion  of  asset purchase  programs, especially  through the PEPP  (Pandemic  Emergency  Purchase Program) for  750,000  million  of euros in  a  first tranche  announced in March  and expanded  with  a second  tranche for  an additional 600,000  million euros until June 2021 or until the ECB considers that the crisis has ended, the coordinated action of central banks for the provision of US dollars, a temporary package  of measures  to make flexible  the collateral  eligible  for financing operations, the relaxation and improvement of the conditions of the TLTRO III program and the creation of the new  program of long-term refinancing operations without specific emergency objective (PELTRO). In this regard, BBVA attended the TLTRO III program windows in March and June (with an  amount drawn  down  at the end  of December  of  35,032 million  euros) due to its  favorable  conditions in  terms of cost and  term, amortizing the corresponding part of the TLTRO II program (see Note 22).\n\nIn the United States there is a comfortable liquidity situation with significant growth in deposits during the year, driven mainly by stimulus measures from the American government and the Federal Reserve. This has led to an increase in the liquidity buffer and the liquidity and financing  indicators are  comfortable. As in  the euro zone, during the end of the first  quarter of 2020  there was  an increase  in loans stemmed mainly from an increase  in the use of credit lines by wholesale  clients and the stimulus program of the American  government aimed  at SMEs and freelances  (Paycheck  Protection Program). Subsequently, there were repayments that bring the percentage of use of credit lines to levels prior to the pandemic.\n\nIn Mexico, the liquidity position has remained solid during the year due to the increase in deposits driven by the success of the commercial actions  carried  out by  the entity,  especially  in the  second  semester,  as  well  as  by  the  stimulus measures  implemented  by  Banxico throughout the year to provide liquidity to the financial system, which made it possible to offset the increase in the use of credit lines as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. This good performance in deposits, together with the normalization in credit growth, has reduced the credit gap, resulting in the entity being in a comfortable situation in liquidity and financing ratios.\n\nAt Garanti BBVA, the liquidity situation remained comfortable during 2020, with a contraction of loans and a growth of deposits in fo r eign currency, as  well  as  a higher growth in loans  than deposits in local  currency. As a  result of the COVID-19 crisis, the Turkish regulator established  the so-called  asset ratio to mainly  increase  loans and discourage the accumulation of deposits, causing an increase  in the credit gap, which was covered with the excess liquidity that the entity had. Subsequently, the asset ratio requirement was reduced in the third quarter (from 100% to 90%) and was eliminated  in December. All in all, Garanti BBVA has shown a solid liquidity buffer.\n\nIn South America, an adequate liquidity situation is maintained throughout the region, favored by the support of the different central banks and governments that, with the aim of mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, have implemented measures for stimulating economic activity and providing greater liquidity to financial systems. In Argentina, the outflow of deposits in US dollars in the banking system s lo wed down during 2020, and even showed some growth in the fourth quarter. BBVA Argentina continues to maintain a solid liquidity position BBVA Colombia,  after  the  actions  carried  out to  adjusting  excess  liquidity  by  reducing  wholesale  deposits,  continues  to  show  a comfortable liquidity position. BBVA Peru has seen its comfortable liquidity situation strengthened as a result of the continuous increase in the volume of deposits during the second semester, as well  as the funds from the Central Bank's support programs.\n\nThe wholesale  financing markets in which  the Group operates, after the first two months of 2020 of great stability were  followed  by a strong correction derived from the COVID-19 crisis and limited access  to the primary market. This situation has been stabilizing due to the evolution of the pandemic, the development of vaccines, various geopolitical events and the actions of the Central Banks. Secondary market volumes ended the year reaching the levels  of January 2020, while primary market volumes have been reactivated, lowering the issue premiums\n\nThe main transactions carried out by the companies that form part of the BBVA Group in 2020 were:\n\n- During the first quarter of 2020 BBVA, S.A. made 2 senior non-preferred securities issues for a total of 1,400 million euros and another Tier 2 for 1,000 million euros (for further information, see 'Solvency' section of the Consolidated Management Report). In the second quarter of 2020, an  issuance  of senior preferred  securities  for 1,000  million  euros was  executed  as a  socialCOVID-19  bond, the  first  of  its  kind  for  a  private  financial  entity  in  Europe  (for  further  information, see  'Solvency'  and 'Responsible Banking' sections of the Consolidated Management Report). In the third quarter, three public issues were made: the first is the first green convertible bond of a financial  institution world-wide for an amount of 1,000 million euros; the second is a Tier 2 subordinated securities issue denominated in pound sterling, for an amount of 300 million pounds; and the third is an issuance of preferred securities registered with the US SEC (Securities  Exchange Commission) in two tranches with maturities of three and five  years, for a total of 2,000 million dollars. On the other hand, in February 2020, BBVA exercised the call  option of a convertible bond of 1,500 million euros, and in January 2021, the entity has early amortized three preferred issuances (for more information on these transactions see the section 'Solvency'  of this report).\n- In 2020, BBVA M\u00e9xico successfully carried out a local senior issuance of 15,000 million Mexican pesos (614 million euros) in three tranches (two tranches in Mexican pesos at 3 and 5 years and another tranche in US dollars at 3 years), in order to advance",

It also carried out an international issue of senior unsecured securities for an amount of 500 million US  dollars of 5 years with a rate of 1.875%, which represents the lowest in history for a financial institution in Mexico and for any private financial  institutions in Latin America. Furthermore, wit h in the measures  adopted by Banxico throughout the year, BBVA Mexico  has participated  in auctions of US  dollars with credit institutions (swap line with the Fed) initially for an amount of 1,250 million US dollars, partially renewing that position from June to September,  for  an  amount of  US  $  700  million.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n## 8. Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Framework and processes control\n\nAs part of the process established in the Group for determining the fair  value in order to ensure that financial  assets and liabilities  are properly following the IFRS 13 principles:  Fair value  is the price that would be received  to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market or most advantageous market, at the measurement date.\n\nBBVA has established, at a geographic level, a structure of Risk Operational Admission and Product Governance Committees responsible for  validating  and  approving  new  products or  types  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  before  being  contracted.  Local  management responsible for valuation, which are independent from the business (see Management Report - Risk) are members of these committees.\n\nThese  areas  are  required  to ensure,  prior to the approval  stage, the  existence  of  not only technical  and human  resources, but  also adequate informational sources to measure the fair value of these financial  assets and liabilities,  in accordance  with the rules established by the valuation global area  and using models that have been validated and approved by the responsible areas.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nAll financial  instruments, both assets and liabilities are initially  recognized at fair value, which at that point is equivalent to the transaction price, unless there is evidence to the contrary in the market. Subsequently, depending on the type of financial instrument, it may continue to be recognized at amortized cost or fair value through adjustments in the consolidated income statement or equity.\n\nWhen possible, the fair value is determined as the market price of a financial  instrument. However, for many of the financial  assets and liabilities  of the Group, especially  in the case of derivatives, there is no market price available,  so its fair value is estimated on the basis of the price established in recent transactions involving similar instruments or, in the absence thereof, by using mathematical measurement models that are sufficiently tried and trusted by the international financial community. The estimates of the fair value derived from the use of such models take into consideration the specific features of the asset or liability to be measured and, in particular, the various types of risk associated with such asset or liability. However, the limitations inherent in the measurement models and possible inaccuracies  in the assumptions and parameters required by these models may mean  that the estimated fair value of an asset or liability does not exactly match the price for which the asset or liability  could be exchanged or settled on the date of its measurement.\n\nAdditionally, for financial  assets and liabilities  that show significant uncertainty in inputs or model parameters used for valuation, criteria is established to measure said uncertainty and activity limits are set based on these. Finally, these measurements are compared, as much as  possible,  against  other sources  such  as  the  measurements  obtained  by  the business  teams  or those obtained  by  other  market participants.\n\nThe process for determining the fair value requires the classification  of the financial  assets and liabilities  according to the measurement processes used as set forth below:\n\n- Level 1: Valuation using directly the quotation of the instrument, observable and readily and regularly available  from independent price sources and referenced to active markets that the entity can access at the measurement date. The instruments classified within this level are fixed-income securities, equity instruments and certain derivatives.\n- Level 2: Valuation of financial instruments with commonly accepted techniques that use inputs obtained from observable data in markets.\n- Level 3: Valuation of financial  instruments with valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs in the market. As of December 31, 2020, the affected instruments at fair value accounted for approximately 0.55% of financial assets and 0.40% of the Group's financial liabilities. Model selection and validation is undertaken by control areas outside the business areas.\n\n## 8.1 Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  fair  value  of the  Group's financial  instruments in  the accompanying  consolidated balance  sheets and  its corresponding carrying amounts, as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below:",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n## Main valuation techniques\n\nThe main techniques used for the assessment of the majority of the financial  instruments classified in Level 3, and its main unobservable inputs, are described below:\n\n- The net present value (net present value method): This technique uses the future cash flows of each financial instrument, wh ich are established in the different contracts, and discounted to their present value. This technique often includes many observable inputs, but may also include unobservable inputs, as described below:\n- \u00b7 Credit  Spread:  This  input represents  the  difference  in  yield  of  a  debt  security  and  the  reference  rate,  reflecting  the additional return that a market participant would require to take the credit risk of that debt security. Therefore, the credit spread of the debt security is part of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Recovery rate: This input represents the percentage of principal and interest recovered  from a debt instrument that h as defaulted.\n- Comparable prices (similar asset prices): This input represents the prices of comparable financial instruments and benchmarks used  to  calculate  a  reference  yield  based  on  relative  movements  from  the  entry  price  or  current  market  levels.  Further adjustments to account for differences that may exist between financial instrument being valued and the comparable financial instrument may  be added. It can  also be assumed  that the price  of the financial  instrument is equivalent to the comparable instrument.\n- Net asset value: This technique utilizes certain assumptions to use net asset value as representative of fair value, which is equal to the total value of the assets and liabilities  of a fund published by the managing entity.\n- Gaussian  copula: This  model  is  used  to integrate  default  probabilities  of  credit  instruments referenced  to more  than  one underlying CDS. The joint density function used to value the instrument is constructed by using a Gaussian copula that relates the marginal densities by a normal distribution, usually extracted from the correlation matrix of events approaching default by CDS issuers.\n- Black  76: variant of Black  Scholes model, whose  main application  is the valuation of bond options, cap floors and swaptions where the behavior of the Forward and not the Spot itself, is directly modeled.\n- Black  Scholes: The  Black  Scholes model  postulates log-normal distribution for the prices  of securities, so that the expected return under the risk neutral measure is the risk free  interest rate. Under this assumption, the price of vanilla options can be obtained  analytically,  so  that  inverting  the  Black-  Scholes  formula,  the  implied  volatility  for  process  of  the  price  can  be calculated.\n- Heston: This model, typically  applied to equity OTC options, assumes stochastic behavior of volatility. According to which, the volatility follows a process that reverts to a long-term level and is correlated with the underlying equity instrument. As opposed to local  volatility  models, in which  the volatility  evolves  deterministically,  the Heston model is  more flexible,  allowing  it to be similar to that observed in the short term today.\n- Libor market model: This  model assumes  that the dynamics  of the interest rate  curve can  be modeled  based  on the set of forward contracts that compose the underlying interest rate. The correlation matrix is parameterized  on the assumption that the correlation between  any two forward contracts decreases  at a constant rate, beta, to the extent of the difference in their respective due dates. The input 'Credit default volatility'  is a volatility input of the credit factor dynamic applied in rate/credit hybrid operative. The multifactorial frame of this model makes it ideal for the valuation of instruments sensitive to the slope or curve, including interest rate option.\n- Local Volatility: In the local  volatility models of the volatility, instead of being static, evolves over time according to the level  of moneyness  of the underlying, capturing the existence  of  smiles.  These  models  are  appropriate  for pricing path dependent options when use Monte Carlo simulation technique is used.",

The Group incorporates in its valuation, for all exposures classified  in any of the categories valued at fair value, both the counterparty credit risk and its own. In the trading portfolio, and in the specific case of derivatives, credit risk is recognized through such adjustments.\n\nAs a general rule, the calculation of CVA is the sum of the expected positive exposure in time t, the probability of default between t-1 and t, and the Loss Given Default of the counterparty. Consequently, the DVA is calculated as the sum of the expected negative exposure in time  t, the probability  of  default  of  BBVA between  t-1 and  t, and  the Loss Given  Default  of BBVA. Both  calculations  are  performed throughout the entire period of potential exposure.\n\nThe calculation  of the expected positive and negative exposure is done through a Montecarlo simulation of the market variables involved in all trades' valuation under the same legal netting set.\n\nThe information needed to calculate the probability of default and the loss given default of a counterparty comes from the credit markets. The counterparty's Credit Default Swaps are used if liquid quotes are available.  If a market price is not available, BBVA has implemented a mapping process based on the sector, rating and geography of the counterparty to assign probabilities of default and loss given default calibrated directly to market.\n\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the valuation adjustments to the credit assessment of the derivative  asset as 'Credit Valuation Adjustments' ('CVA') was \u20ac-142 million, \u20ac-106 and \u20ac-163 million respectively, and the valuation adjustments to the derivative liabilities  as 'Debit Valuation Adjustment' (DVA) was \u20ac124 million, \u20ac117 and \u20ac214 million, respectively.  The impact recorded under 'Gains  or (-) losses on financial  assets and liabilities  held for trading, net' in the consolidated income statement as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 corresponding to the mentioned adjustments was a net impact of \u20ac-29 million, \u20ac67 and \u20ac-24 million respectively.\n\nAdditionally, as of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, \u20ac-9, \u20ac-8 and \u20ac-12 million related to the 'Funding Valuation Adjustments' ('F VA') were recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, being the impact on results \u20ac-1 million, \u20ac4 and \u20ac-2 million, respectively.",

This review has been carried  out in the context of availability  of new information, more adjusted to the changes that have occurred both in market conditions and in the composition of the credit portfolio. The effect on the consolidated results and solvency ratios, resulting from this review, does not represent any change (see Note 8.2).\n\nDuring 2019, certain interest rate yields  were adapted to those observable  in the market, which mainly  affected  the valuation of certain deposit classes recorded under 'Financial liabilities at amortized cost' and certain insurance products recorded under 'Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - Other financial liabilities', and, as a result thereof, their classification changed from Level 3 to Level 2. Additionally, \u20ac1,285 million in assets held for trading and \u20ac649 million in liabilities held for trading were classified in Level 3, mainly due to certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, due to the non-observability and liquidity in the interest rate yield for the financing of assets applied in the calculation of their fair value.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,  the profit/loss  on sales  of financial  instruments classified  as  Level  3  recognized  in  the accompanying consolidated income statement was not material.\n\n## Transfers between levels\n\nThe Global  Valuation Area, in collaboration with the Group, has established  the rules for an  appropriate financial  instruments held  for trading classification according to the fair value hierarchy defined by IFRS.\n\nOn a monthly basis, any new assets added to the portfolio are classified,  according to this criterion, by the subsidiaries. Then, there is a quarterly review  of the portfolio in order to analyze the need for a change in classification of any of these assets.\n\nThe financial  instruments transferred between  the different  levels  of measurement for the years  ended December  31, 2020, 2019  and 2018 are at the following amounts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:",

This analysis is carried out on a monthly basis, based on the crit eria defined  by  the Global  Valuation Area  taking  into account the  nature of the  methods used  for the assessment  and the reliability  and availability  of inputs and proxies used. In order to establish, with a sufficient degree of certainty, the valuation risk that is incurred in such assets without applying diversification criteria between them.\n\nAs of  December  31,  2020,  the effect  on profit for the  year  and total  equity of  changing the main  unobservable  inputs used for  the measurement  of Level  3  financial  instruments for other reasonably  possible unobservable  inputs, taking the highest (most favorable input) or lowest (least favorable input) value of the range deemed probable, would be as follows:",

The valuation of the borrowed deposits corresponding to the interest rate risk is in the heading \"Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedges of interest rate risk'.\n- Cash-flow  hedges: Most of the hedged items  are  floating interest-rate loans  and asset  hedges linked  to the inflation  of the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income portfolio. This risk is hedged using foreign-exchange, interestrate swaps, inflation and FRA's ('Forward Rate Agreement').\n- Net  foreign-currency  investment  hedges:  These  hedged  risks  are  foreign-currency  investments  in  the  Group's  foreign subsidiaries. This risk is hedged mainly with foreign-exchange options and forward currency sales and purchases.\n\nNote 7 analyzes the Group's main risks that are hedged using these derivatives.\n\nThe details of the net positions by hedged risk of the fair  value of the hedging derivatives recognized in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets are as follows:",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n## Goodwill in business combinations\n\nThere were no significant business combinations during 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Impairment Test\n\nAs mentioned in  Note  2.2.8, the CGUs  to which  goodwill  has  been  allocated,  are  periodically  tested  for impairment  by  including the allocated  goodwill  in  their  carrying  amount. This  analysis  is  performed  at  least  annually  and  whenever  there  is  any  indication  of impairment. Furthermore, it is analyzed  whether certain changes in the valuation assumptions used could give rise to differences in the result of the impairment test.\n\nThe BBVA Group performs estimations on the recoverable amount of certain CGU's by calculating the value in use through the d isco u nted value of future cash flows method.\n\nThe main hypotheses used for the value in use calculation are the following:\n\n- The forecast cash flows, including net interest margin and cost of risk, estimated by the Group's management, and based on the latest available  budgets for the next 4 to 5 years, considering the macroeconomic  variables  of each  CGU, regarding the existing  balance  structure as  well  as  macroeconomic  variables  such as  the evolution of  interest  rates  and  the CPI  of  the geography where the CGU is located, among others.\n- The constant growth rate  for extrapolating cash  flows, starting in the fourth or fifth year, beyond the period covered by the budgets or forecasts.\n- The discount rate on future cash flows, which coincides with the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, and which consists of a risk-free rate plus a premium that reflects the inherent risk of each of the businesses evaluated.\n\nThe  focus used  by  the Group's  management  to determine  the values  of the assumptions is  based  both on its projections and  past experience. These values are verified and use external sources of information, wherever possible. Additionally, the valuation of the goodwill of the CGU of Turkey has been reviewed by independent experts (not the Group's external auditors).\n\nAs of  December  31, 2020,  as  a  result  of the  CGU's  assessment,  the Group concluded  there is  no  evidence  of further indicators  of impairment losses that requires recognizing significant additional impairment  losses in any of the CGUs where goodwill that the Group has recognized in the consolidated balance sheet is allocated.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Group identified an indicator of impairment of goodwill in the United States CGU and as a result of the goodwill impairment  test, the Group estimated impairment  in the United States CGU, of \u20ac2,084 million,  which was  mainly  due to the negative impact  of the update of the macroeconomic  scenario  following  the COVID-19 pandemic  (see  Note 1.5) and the expected  evolution of interest rates. This recognition did not affect the tangible book value nor the liquidity nor the solvency ratio of the BBVA Group.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Group estimated impairment losses in the United States CGU of \u20ac1,318 million, which was mainly as a result of the negative evolution of interest rates, especially  in the second half of the year, which accompanied  by the slowdown of the economy caused  the expected  evolution of results below  the previous estimation. This recognition did not affect the tangible book value  nor the liquidity nor the solvency ratio of the BBVA Group.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, no impairment had been identified in any of the main CGUs.\n\n## Goodwill - the United States CGU\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, the remaining goodwill corresponding to the United States CGU has been reclassified  to the heading \"Noncurrent assets and disposal groups classified  as held for sale\"  in the consolidated balance  sheets (see  Notes 1.3, 3 and 21). Pursuant to IFRS 5.15, the CGU must be measured at the lower of fair  value less costs to sell and the carrying amount. Given the price agreed in the sale agreement, the fair value less costs to sell is higher than carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the CGU, which means that as of December 31, 2020 these will  remain valued at their carrying amount (included goodwill) on the reclassification date.\n\nThe most significant assumptions used in the latest impairment tests of such CGU are:\n\n## Impairment test assumptions CGU goodwill - United States\n\n|                          | March 2020   | December 2019   | December 2018   |\n|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Discount rate (*)        | 10.3%        | 10.0%           | 10.5%           |\n| Sustainable  growth rate | 3.0%         | 3.5%            | 4.0%            |\n\nIn accordance with paragraph 33.c of IAS 36, as of March 31, 2020, the Group used a constant growth rate of 3.0%, based on the real GDP growth rate of the United States, the expected inflation and the potential growth of the banking sector in the United States.",

Tax assets and liabilities\n\n## 19.1 Consolidated tax group\n\nPursuant to current  legislation,  BBVA consolidated tax  group in  Spain  includes  the  Bank  (as  the  parent  company)  and  its  Spanish subsidiaries that meet the requirements provided for under Spanish legislation regulating the taxation regime for the consolidated profit of corporate groups.\n\nThe Group's non-Spanish banks and subsidiaries file  tax returns in accordance with the tax legislation in force in each country.\n\n## 19.2 Years open for review by the tax authorities\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the BBVA consolidated tax group in Spain is currently under inspection for the years 2014 to 2016 inclusive for the main taxes applicable  to it.\n\nThe remainder  of the Spanish  consolidated entities in general have the last four years open for inspection by the tax authorities for the main taxes applicable,  except for those in which there has been an interruption of the limitation period due to the start of an inspection.\n\nOn the other hand, in relation to the main jurisdictions in which the Group is present and carries out its activity, in the case of Mexico, BBVA Bancomer S.A., is currently under inspection by the Mexican Tax  Authorities for the years  2016  and 2017 corresponding to Corporate Income Tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nIn addition, in the case  of Turkey, the head entity in this country, Garanti BBVA A.S., is currently under inspection by the Tax Authorities of that country for all the taxes applicable  to it corresponding to the years 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn view of the varying interpretations that can be made of some applicable  tax legislation, the outcome of the tax inspections of the open years  that may  be conducted by the tax authorities in the future may  give rise to contingent tax liabilities  which cannot be  reasonably estimated at the present time. However, the Group considers that the possibility of these contingent liabilities becoming actual liabilities is remote and, in any case, the tax charge which might arise therefore would not materially affect the Group's accompanying consolidated financial  statements.\n\n## 19.3 Reconciliation\n\nThe reconciliation of the Group's corporate income tax expense resulting from the application of the Spanish corporation income tax rate and the income tax expense recognized in the accompanying consolidated income statements is as follows:",

It is considered that sufficient taxable income will be generated for the recovery of above mentioned unsecured deferred tax assets when they become deductible according to the tax laws.\n\nOn the other hand, the Group has not recognized certain negative tax bases and deductions for which, in general, there is no legal period for offsetting, amounting to approximately \u20ac 2,156 million euros, which are mainly originated by Catalunya Banc.",

amounting to \u20ac35,032 million as of December 31, 2020, that basically explains the change compared to the previous year (see Note 7.5).\n\nOn April 30, 2020, the European Central Bank modified some of the terms and conditions of the TLTRO III facilities in order to support the continued access of companies and households to bank credit in the face of interruptions and temporary shortages of funds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Entities whose  eligible  net lending exceeds  0%  between March  1, 2020 and  March 31, 2021 will  pay an interest rate 0.5% lower than the average rate of the deposit facilities during the period that includes from June 24, 2020 to June 23, 2021. This means  that the interest rate applicable  to the facilities  drawn down is -1%. Outside of this period, the average  interest rate of the deposit facilities  will  be  applied  (currently  -0.5%) provided  that the financing  objectives  are  met  according  to the conditions of  the European Central Bank.\n\nThe Group is reasonably certain about the fulfillment of these financing objectives. Therefore, the effective  interest rate of each facility is -0.5% and the accounting registration of the discount in the interest rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is recognized during the annual period from June 24, 2020 to June 23, 2021.\n\nThe  positive  remuneration currently  being generated  by  the drawdowns  of  the TLTRO  III facilities  is  recorded  under  the heading  of \"Interest income  and other similar  income  - other income\" in the consolidated income  statements and amounts to \u20ac211 million  as  of December 31, 2020 (See Note 37.1).\n\n## 22.2 Deposits from credit institutions\n\nThe  breakdown  by  geographical  area  and  the  nature  of  the  related  instruments  of  this heading  in  the  accompanying consolidated balance sheets is as follows:",

As a result, on January 29, 2021 the total early redemption of the issuance took place.\n\n## 22.5 Other financial liabilities\n\nThe breakdown of the balance under this heading in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is as follo ws:\n\n| Other financial  liabilities  (Millions of Euros)   |        |        |        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                                     | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n| Lease liabilities                                   | 2,674  | 3,335  |        |\n| Creditors for other financial liabilities           | 2,408  | 2,623  | 2,891  |\n| Collection accounts                                 | 3,275  | 3,306  | 4,305  |\n| Creditors for other payment obligations             | 5,000  | 4,494  | 5,648  |\n| Total                                               | 13,358 | 13,758 | 12,844 |",

Assets and liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts\n\nThe Group has insurance subsidiaries mainly  in Spain and Latin America (mostly in Mexico). The main product offered by the insurance subsidiaries  is life  insurance to cover the risk of death (risk insurance) and life-savings insurance. Within life  and accident insurance, a distinction is made  between freely  sold products and those offered to customers who have taken mortgage or consumer loans, which cover the principal of those loans in the event of the customer's death.\n\nThere are two types of savings products: individual insurance, which seeks to provide the customer with savings for retirement or other events, and group insurance, which is taken out by employers to cover their commitments to their employees.\n\nThe insurance business is affected  by different risks, including those that are related to the BBVA Group such as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk and the methodology for risk measurement applied  in the insurance activity is similar (see  Note 7 and Management Report - Risk), although it has a differentiated management due to the particular characteristics of the insurance business, such as the coverage  of contracted obligations and the long term of the commitments. Additionally, the insurance business generates certain specific risks, of a probabilistic nature:\n\n- Technical risk: arises from deviations in the estimation of the casualty rate of insurances, either in terms of numbers, the amount of such claims and the timing of its occurrence.\n- Biometric risk: depending on the deviations in the expected mortality behavior or the survival of the insured persons.\n\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated in each country. In this regard, it should be noted that the insurance industry is undergoing a gradual regulatory transformation through new risk-based capital regulations, which have already been published in several  countries.\n\nThe heading 'Assets under reinsurance and insurance contracts' in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the amounts that the consolidated insurance  entities are  entitled to receive  under the reinsurance  contracts entered into by them with third parties and, more specifically,  the share of the reinsurer in the technical provisions recognized by the consolidated insurance subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the balance under this heading amounted to \u20ac306 million, \u20ac341 million and \u20ac366 million respectively.\n\nThe most significant provisions recognized by consolidated insurance subsidiaries with respect to insurance policies  issued by them are under the heading 'Liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts' in the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets.\n\nThe breakdown of the balance under this heading is as follows:\n\n## Technical  reserves (Millions of Euros)\n\n|                                                     | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mathematical reserves                               | 8,731  | 9,247  | 8,504  |\n| Individual life  insurance   (1)                    | 6,268  | 6,731  | 6,201  |\n| Savings                                             | 5,431  | 5,906  | 5,180  |\n| Risk                                                | 836    | 825    | 1,021  |\n| Group insurance  (2)                                | 2,463  | 2,517  | 2,303  |\n| Savings                                             | 2,298  | 2,334  | 2,210  |\n| Risk                                                | 165    | 182    | 93     |\n| Provision for unpaid claims reported                | 672    | 641    | 662    |\n| Provisions for unexpired risks and other provisions | 548    | 718    | 668    |\n| Total                                               | 9,951  | 10,606 | 9,834  |\n\nThe cash flows of those 'Liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts' are shown below:",

The most important insurance entities are located in Spain and Mexico (which together account for approximately 96% of the insurance revenues), where the modeling methods and  techniques  are  reviewed  by  the insurance  regulator  in  Spain  (General  Directorate  of  Insurance)  and  Mexico  (National Insurance and Bonding Commission), respectively. The modeling methods and techniques used to calculate  the mathematical  reserves for the insurance products are compliant with IFRS and primarily  involve the valuation of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the technical  interest rate  for each  policy. To ensure this technical  interest rate, asset-liability  management is carried  out, acquiring a portfolio of securities that generate the cash flows needed to cover the payment commitments assumed with the customers.\n\nThe table below shows the key assumptions as of December 31, 2020, used in the calculation of the mathematical reserves for insurance products in Spain and Mexico, respectively:\n\n|                                   | 2020                                                                 | 2020                                                                                    | 2020                                  | 2020                             | 2019                                               | 2019                                                                                    | 2019                                                       | 2019                             | 2018  Average                                 | 2018  Average                                                                                  | 2018  Average                         | 2018  Average            |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                   | Mortality table                                                      | Mortality table                                                                         | Average technical  interest type      | Average technical  interest type | Mortality table                                    | Mortality table                                                                         | Average technical  interest type                           | Average technical  interest type | Mortality table                               | Mortality table                                                                                | technical  interest type              | technical  interest type |\n|                                   | Spain                                                                | Mexico                                                                                  | Spain                                 | Mexico  Spain                    |                                                    | Mexico                                                                                  | Spain                                                      | Mexico  Spain                    |                                               | Mexico                                                                                         | Spain                                 | Mexico                   |\n| I ndividual life  i nsurance  (1) | GRMF  80-2,   GKM 80  / GKMF  95,  PASEM,  GKMF  80/95,  PERFM  2000 | Tables of  the  Comisi\u00f3n  Nacional  de  Seguros y  Fianzas  2000- individual  Tables of | 0.25% - 2.87%                         | 2.5%                             | GRMF  80-2,  GKMF  80/95.

Furthermore, on the basis  of the information available  and with the exceptions indicated  in Note 7.1 \"Risk factors\", BBVA considers that the liabilities  that may arise from such proceedings will  not have, on a case-by-case  basis, a significant adverse  effect on the Group's business, financial situation or results of operations.\n\n## IRPH index\n\nIn relation to consumer mortgage loan contracts linked to the interest rate index known as IRPH (average  rate for mortgage loans over three  years  for  the acquisition  of free  housing), the Spanish  Supreme  Court issued  on 14  December  2017  its  judgment 669/2017 confirming that it was not possible to determine the lack of transparency of the interest rate of the loan merely by reference to one or o ther of the official indexes nor, therefore, was it abuse according to Directive 93/13. In a separate legal proceeding, albeit concerning the same clause, the matter was referred  to the Court of Justice of the European Union (the EU Court of Justice), raising a preliminary  question in which the application  of the above referred  IRPH index and the decision  of the Supreme  Court on the matter was  questioned again. On March 3, 2020, the EU Court of Justice resolved the referred question for a preliminary ruling.\n\nIn that resolution, the EU Court of Justice concluded that the fact that the main elements  relating to the calculation of the saving banks IRPH index used by the bank to which the question referred (Bankia, S.A.) were provided in the Bank of Spain Regulation (Circular 8/1990), published in the Spanish Official  Gazette, which allowed  consumers to understand the calculation of such index. In addition, the EU Court of Justice indicated that the national court shall determine whether the bank that is party to this proceeding complied with the applicable information  obligations  under  national  legislation.  In  the  event  that  the  entity  had  not  complied  with  the  applicable  transparency regulations, the EU Court of Justice decision does not declare the contract null and void but provides that the national court could replace the IRPH index applied in the case under trial for a substitute index. The resolution sets forth that, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary of the parties to the contract, the referred substitute index could be the IRPH index for credit entities in Spain (as established in the fifteenth additional provision of Law 14/2013, of September 27, 2013).\n\nOn November 13, 2020, the Supreme Court has issued new judgments on which it has again analyzed  the legality of the above referred clause  after the EU Court of Justice ruling which indicated that it was  up to the national judge to rule on its transparency and possible abuse. In the particular cases  analyzed,  the Supreme  Court has  ruled that, even  if the entity had not adequately  complied  with some regulatory requirement of transparency, such as reporting the evolution of the index in the past, this would not mean that the clause was abusive. In short, it considers that the control rules are  different from transparency  and abuse, so that if the clause  is not abusive, the possible breach of any obligation of transparency cannot have legal consequences. Following these rulings, the Supreme Court is rejecting the appeals on the grounds of the existence of case law on the matter and lack of interest in the case. Therefore, BBVA considers that the ruling of the EU Court of Justice and these recent rulings of the Supreme Court should not have significant effects on the Group's business, financial  situation or results of operations.\n\n## Revolving credit cards\n\nThere are also claims  before the Spanish courts challenging the application of certain interest rates and other mandatory regulations to certain revolving credit card contracts. On March 4, 2020, the Supreme Court issued a ruling (number 149/2020)  confirming the nullity of a revolving credit card agreement entered into by another entity (Wizink Bank) on the grounds that the interest applied to the card was usurious. In that ruling, the Supreme Court recognized that the reference  to the \"normal interest on money\" to be used for this product must be the average  interest applicable  to credit transactions by means  of credit and revolving cards  published in the Bank of Spain's statistics, which  is slightly higher than 20%  annually.  The  Supreme  Court also  considered usurious a  rate of 26.82% annually,  when compared  to  such  average  rate.  The  Supreme  Court concluded  that  for  an  interest  rate  to  be  usurious,  it  must  be  \"manifestly disproportionate to the circumstances of the case\", and therefore the ruling limits its effects to the case under analysis, and the market ing by credit entities of this product must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBBVA considers that this ruling of the Supreme Court should not have a significant effect on the Group's business, financial  situation or results of operations.",

Post-employment and other employee benefit commitments\n\nAs stated in Note 2.2.11, the Group has assumed commitments with employees including short-term employee benefits (see Note 44.1), defined contribution and defined benefit plans (see Glossary), healthcare and other long-term employee benefits.\n\nThe Group sponsors defined-contribution plans for the majority of its active employees with the plans in Spain and Mexico being the most significant.  Most defined  benefit  plans  are  closed  to new  employees  with  liabilities  relating  largely  to  retired  employees,  the  most significant being those in Spain, Mexico and Turkey. In Mexico, the Group provides medical benefits to a closed group of employees  and their family members, both active service and in retirees.\n\nThe breakdown of the net defined  benefit liability  recorded  on the balance  sheet as of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is  provided below:\n\n| Net defined benefit liability (asset) on the consolidated balance sheet (Millions of Euros)                           |       |       |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|                                                                                                                       | Notes | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  |\n| Pension commitments                                                                                                   |       | 4,539 | 5,050 | 4,678 |\n| Early retirement commitments                                                                                          |       | 1,247 | 1,486 | 1,793 |\n| Medical benefits commitments                                                                                          |       | 1,562 | 1,580 | 1,114 |\n| Other long term employee benefits                                                                                     |       | 49    | 61    | 62    |\n| Total commitments                                                                                                     |       | 7,398 | 8,177 | 7,647 |\n| Pension plan assets                                                                                                   |       | 1,608 | 1,961 | 1,694 |\n| Medical benefit plan assets                                                                                           |       | 1,484 | 1,532 | 1,146 |\n| Total plan assets (1)                                                                                                 |       | 3,092 | 3,493 | 2,840 |\n| Total net liability / asset                                                                                           |       | 4,305 | 4,684 | 4,807 |\n| Of which: Net asset on the consolidated balance  sheet (2)                                                            |       | (16)  | (8)   | (41)  |\n| Of which: +Net  liability  on the consolidated balance sheet for provisions for pensions  and similar obligations (3) | 24    | 4,272 | 4,631 | 4,787 |\n| Of which: Net liability  on the consolidated balance sheet for other long term employee  benefits (4)                 | 24    | 49    | 61    | 62    |\n\nThe impact relating to benefit commitments charged to consolidated income statement for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\n\n## Consolidated income statement impact (Millions of Euros)\n\n|                                                               | Notes   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Interest and other expense                                    |         | 44     | 63     | 77     |\n| Interest expense                                              |         | 265    | 293    | 282    |\n| Interest income                                               |         | (220)  | (230)  | (206)  |\n| Personnel expense                                             |         | 121    | 143    | 130    |\n| Defined contribution plan expense                             | 44.1    | 72     | 95     | 72     |\n| Defined benefit plan expense                                  | 44.1    | 49     | 49     | 58     |\n| Provisions or (reversal) of provisions                        | 46      | 210    | 213    | 125    |\n| Early retirement expense                                      |         | 224    | 190    | 141    |\n| Past service  cost expense                                    |         | (8)    | 18     | (33)   |\n| Remeasurements  (*)                                           |         | (11)   | 7      | (10)   |\n| Other provision expense                                       |         | 4      | (1)    | 28     |\n| Total impact on consolidated income statement: debit (credit) |         | 375    | 419    | 332    |",

These  amounts are  partially  offset by the effect  in other geographies and experience.  In 2019,  this heading amounted to \u20ac329 million  euros mainly  due to the variation in two geographies. Firstly, as a consequence of the \u20ac231 million euros increase  in actuarial losses on commitments in Spain, due to the variation in discount rates from 1.75% to 1%. Secondly, driven by the \u20ac83 million euros increase in actuarial losses on commitments in Mexico, due to the decrease in discount rates from 10.45% to 9. 04 %.\n\n## 25.1 Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined  benefit commitments relate  mainly  to employees  who have  already  retired or taken early  retirement, certain  closed groups of active employees  still accruing defined benefit pensions, and in-service  death and disability benefits provided to most active employees. For the latter, the Group pays the required premiums to fully insure the related liability. The change in these pension commitments du ring the years ended December  31 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below:\n\n|                                              | 2020                         | 2020         | 2020                    | 2019                         | 2019         | 2019                   | 2018                         | 2018         | 2018                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n|                                              | Defined  benefit  obligation | Plan  assets | Net  liability  (asset) | Defined  benefit  obligation | Plan  assets | Net liability  (asset) | Defined  benefit  obligation | Plan  assets | Net liability  (asset) |\n| Balance at the beginning                     | 8,116                        | 3,493        | 4,622                   | 7,585                        | 2,839        | 4,746                  | 8,384                        | 3,006        | 5,378                  |\n| Current service cost                         | 53                           | -

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nThe most significant commitments are  those in Spain and Mexico  and, to a lesser  extent, in Turkey.  The remaining commitments are located mostly in Portugal and South America. Unless otherwise required by local regulation, all defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants, who instead are able to participate in the Group's defined contribution plans.\n\nBoth the costs and the present value of the commitments are determined  by independent qualified  actuaries  using the 'projected unit credit' method. In order to guarantee the good governance of these plans, the Group has established specific benefits committees. These benefit  committees  include  members  from  the  different  areas  of  the  business  to  ensure  that  all  decisions  are  made  taking  into consideration all of the associated impacts.\n\nThe following table sets out the key  actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of these commitments as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\nActuarial assumptions (%)\n\n|                            | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   | 2019   | 2019   | 2019                | 2019   | 2018   | 2018   | 2018                | 2018   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|---------------------|--------|\n|                            | Spain  | Mexico | Turkey | Spain  | Mexico | The  United  States | Turkey | Spain  | Mexico | The  United  States | Turkey |\n| Discount rate              | 0.53%  | 8.37%  | 13.00% | 0.68%  | 9.04%  | 3.24%               | 12.50% | 1.28%  | 10.45% | 4.23%               | 16.30% |\n| Rate of salary in cr eas e | -      | 4.00%  | 11.20% | -      | 4.75%  | -                   | 9.70%  | -      | 4.75%  | -                   | 14.00% |\n| Rate of pension increase   | -      | 1.94%  | 9.70%  | -      | 2.47%  | -                   | 8.20%  | -      | 2.51%  | -                   | 12.50% |\n| Medical cost trend rate    | -      | 7.00%  | 13.90% | -      | 7.00%  | -                   | 12.40% | -      | 7.00%  | -                   | 16.70% |\n| Mortality tables           | PER    |        |        | PERM/F |        |                     |        | PERM/F |        |                     |        |\n\nIn Spain, the discount rate shown as of December, 31, 2020, corresponds to the weighted average rate, the actual discount rates used are 0% and 0.75% depending on the type of commitment.\n\nIn Mexico, the discount rate shown as of December 31, 2020, corresponds to the weighted average rate, with the discount rates between 6.84% and 8.76% depending on the plan.\n\nDiscount rates used to value future benefit cash flows have been determined by reference  to high quality corporate bonds (Note 2.2.12) denominated in Euro in the case of Spain and Mexican peso for Mexico, and government bonds denominated in Turkish Lira for Turkey.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets has been set in line with the adopted discount rate.\n\nAssumed retirement ages have been set by reference to the earliest age at which employees are entitled to retire, the contractually ag r eed age in the case of early retirements in Spain or by using retirement rates.\n\nChanges in the main actuarial  assumptions may affect  the valuation of the commitments.

These include long-service  awards,  which  consist  of  either  an  established  monetary  award  or  some  vacation  days  granted  to  certain  groups of employees  when they complete a given number of years  of service. As of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the actuarial  liabilities  for the outstanding awards amounted to \u20ac50, \u20ac61 million and \u20ac62 million, respectively.

For most plans, pension payments are due on retirement, death and long term disability.\n\nIn addition, during the year 2020, Group entities in Spain offered certain employees the option to take retirement or early retirement ( t hat is, earlier than the age stipulated in the collective labor agreement in force). This offer was accepted by 781 employees (616 and 489 du ring years  2019  and 2018,  respectively).  These  commitments include  the compensation and indemnities  due as  well  as the contributions payable  to external  pension  funds during the early  retirement period.

However, a significant number of the insurance contracts are with BBVA Seguros, S.A. - a consolidated subsidiary and related party - and consequently these policies cannot be considered plan assets under IAS 19. For this reason,  the  liabilities insured  under  these  policies  are  fully  recognized  under  the  heading  \"Provisions  -  Pensions  and  other postemployment defined  benefit obligations\" of the accompanying consolidated balance  sheet (see  Note 24), while  the related assets held  by the insurance  company  are  included  within the Group's consolidated assets  (recorded  according to the classification  of the corresponding financial  instruments). As of December  31, 2020  the value  of these  separate  assets was  \u20ac2,572 million, (\u20ac2,620  and \u20ac2,543  million  as  of  December  31,  2019  and  2018,  respectively)  representing  direct  rights  of  the  insured  employees  held  in  the consolidated balance  sheet, hence these benefits are effectively  fully funded.",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nOn the other hand, some pension commitments have been funded through insurance contracts with insurance companies not related to the Group. In this case  the accompanying  consolidated balance  sheet reflects  the value  of the obligations net of  the fair  value  of the qualifying insurance policies. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the value of the aforementioned insurance policies  (\u20ac249, \u20ac266 and \u20ac260 million, respectively)  exactly match the value of the corresponding obligations and therefore no amount for this item has b een recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance  sheet.\n\nPension benefits are paid by the insurance companies  with whom BBVA has insurance contracts and to whom all insurance premiums have been paid. The premiums are determined by the insurance companies using 'cash flow matching' techniques to ensure that benefits can be met when due, guaranteeing both the actuarial and interest rate risk.\n\nIn Mexico, there is a defined  benefit plan for employees  hired prior to 2001. Other employees  participate  in a defined  contribution plan. External funds/trusts have been constituted locally to meet benefit payments as required by local regulation.\n\nIn 2008, the Turkish government passed a  law  to unify the different existing pension systems under a single  umbrella  Social  Security system. Such system provides for the transfer of the various previously established funds.\n\nThe financial sector is in this stage at present, maintaining these pension commitments managed by external pension funds (foundations) established for that purpose.\n\nThe  foundation that maintains  the assets and  liabilities  relating  to employees  of  Garanti  BBVA in Turkey,  as  per the  local  regulatory requirements, has registered  an obligation amounting to \u20ac250 million  as  of December  31, 2020  pending future transfer to the Social Security system.\n\nFurthermore, Garanti BBVA has set up a defined benefit pension plan for employees, additional to the social security benefits, reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## 25.1.2 Medical benefit commitments\n\nThe change in defined benefit obligations and plan assets during the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\n\n## Medical benefits commitments\n\n|                                             | 2020                         | 2020         | 2020                    | 2019                         | 2019         | 2019                    | 2018                         | 2018         | 2018                    |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n|                                             | Defined  benefit  obligation | Plan  assets | Net  liability  (asset) | Defined  benefit  obligation | Plan  assets | Net  liability  (asset) | Defined  benefit  obligation | Plan  assets | Net  liability  (asset) |\n| Balance at the beginning                    | 1,580                        | 1,532        | 48                      | 1,114                        | 1,146        | (32)                    | 1,204                        | 1,114        | 91                      |\n| Current service cost                        | 21                           | -

However,  in accordance  with local  regulation, some  commitments are  not externally  funded and  covered  through internally held provisions, principally those relating to early retirements.\n\nPlan assets are those assets which will be used to directly settle the assumed commitments and which meet the following conditions: they are not part of the Group sponsoring entities assets, they are available only to pay post-employment benefits and they cannot be r et u rned to the Group sponsoring entity.\n\nTo manage  the assets associated  with defined  benefit  plans, BBVA Group has  established  investment policies  designed according to criteria of prudence and minimizing the financial risks associated with plan assets.\n\nThe investment policy consists of investing in a low risk and diversified portfolio of assets with maturities consistent with the term of the benefit obligation and which, together with contributions made to the plan, will be  sufficient to meet benefit  payments when due, thus mitigating the plans' risks.\n\nIn those countries where  plan  assets  are  held  in  pension  funds or trusts, the investment  policy  is  developed  consistently  with  local regulation. When selecting specific  assets, current market conditions, the risk profile of the assets and their future market outlook are all taken into consideration. In all  the cases, the selection  of assets  takes into consideration the term of the benefit obligations as  well  as short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nThe risks associated with these commitments are  those which give rise to a deficit in the plan assets. A deficit could arise from factors such as a fall in the market value of plan assets, an increase in long-term interest rates leading to a decrease in the fair value of fixed in co me securities, or a deterioration of the economy resulting in more write-downs and credit rating downgrades.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation of plan assets of the main companies of the BBVA Group as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n## Plan assets breakdown (Millions of Euros)\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash or cash equivalents                 | 38     | 56     | 26     |\n| Debt securities (government bonds)       | 2,707  | 2,668  | 2,080  |\n| Mutual funds                             | 1      | 2      | 2      |\n| Insurance contracts                      | 140    | 142    | 132    |\n| Total                                    | 2,887  | 2,869  | 2,241  |\n| Of which: Bank account in BBVA           | 4      | 4      | 3      |\n| Of which: Debt securities issued by BBVA | -      | -      | -      |\n| Of which: Property occupied by BBVA      | -      | -      | -      |\n\nIn addition to the above there are  plan assets  relating to the previously mentioned insurance contracts in Spain  and the foundation in Turkey.\n\nThe following table provides details of investments in listed securities (Level 1) as of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:",

As of December 31, 2020, almost all of the assets related to employee commitments corresponded to fixed income securities.\n\n## 25.2 Defined contribution plans\n\nCertain Group entities sponsor defined contribution plans. Some of these plans allow  employees  to make  contributions which are then matched by the employer.\n\nContributions are recognized as and when they are accrued,  with a charge to the consolidated income statement in the corresponding year. No liability is therefore recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (see Note 44.1).\n\n## 26. Common stock\n\nAs of December  31, 2020,  2019 and  2018, BBVA's common stock amounted to \u20ac3,267,264,424.20 divided into 6,667,886,580 fully subscribed and paid-up registered shares, all of the same  class and series, at \u20ac0.49 par value each, represented through book-en t r ies. All of the Bank shares carry the same voting and dividend rights, and no single stockholder enjoys special  voting rights. Each and every share is part of the Bank's common stock.\n\nThe  Bank's shares are  traded on the stock markets of  Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao  and Valencia  through the Sistema  de  Interconexi\u00f3n Burs\u00e1til Espa\u00f1ol (Mercado Continuo), as well  as on the London and Mexico stock markets. BBVA American Depositary Shares (ADSs) traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 'BBVA'.\n\nAdditionally, as of December  31, 2020, the shares of Banco BBVA Peru, S.A., BBVA Banco Provincial, S.A., Banco BBVA Colombia, S.A., Banco BBVA Argentina, S.A., and Garanti BBVA A.S., were listed on their respective local stock markets. Banco BBVA Argentina, S.A. was also quoted in the Latin American market (Latibex) of the Madrid Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Also, the Dep o sit ary Receipts ('DR') of Garanti BBVA, A.S. are listed in the London Stock Exchange. BBVA is also currently included, amongst other indexes, in the IBEX 35\u00ae Index, which is made up by the 35 most liquid securities  traded on the Spanish Market and, technically,  it is a price index that is weighted by capitalization and adjusted according to the free float of each company comprised in the index.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, State Street Bank and Trust Co., The Bank of New York Mellon SA NV and Chase Nominees Ltd in their capacity as international custodian/depositary banks, held 10.94%, 1.31%, and 8.36% of BBVA common stock, respectively. Of said positions h eld by the custodian banks, BBVA is not aware  of any individual shareholders with direct or indirect holdings greater than or equal to 3% of BBVA common stock outstanding.\n\nOn April 18, 2019, Blackrock, Inc. reported to the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) that, it had an indirect h o lding  of BBVA common stock totaling 5.917%, of which  5.480% are  voting rights attributed to shares  and  0.437% are  voting rights through financial  instruments.\n\nOn February 3, 2020, Norges Bank reported to the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) that it had an indirect holding of BBVA S.A. common stock totaling 3.366%, of which 3.235% are voting rights attributed to shares, and 0.131% are voting rights through financial  instruments.\n\nOn the other hand, BBVA is not aware of any direct or indirect interests through which control of the Bank may be exercised. Furthermore, BBVA has not received any information on stockholder agreements including the regulation of the exercise  of voting rights at its annual general meetings or restricting or placing conditions on the free  transferability of BBVA shares. No agreement is known that could give rise to changes in the control of the Bank.\n\nBBVA banking subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures worldwide, are subject to supervision and regulation from a variety of regulatory bodies  in  relation to, among other aspects,  the satisfaction  of  minimum  capital  requirements.  The  obligation to  satisfy  such  capital requirements may affect the ability of such entities to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. In addition, under the laws  of the various jurisdictions where such entities are incorporated, dividends may only be paid out through funds legally available",

Even when the minimum capital requirements are met and funds are legally  available,  the relevant regulators or o t h er public administrations could discourage or delay  the transfer of funds to the Group in the form of cash, dividends, loans or advances  for prudential reasons.\n\n## Resolutions adopted by the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Capital increase\n\nBBVA's AGM held on March 17, 2017 resolved, under agenda item four, to confer authority on the Board of Directors to increase  Bank's share capital, on one or several occasions, within the legal term of five years of the approval date of the authorization, up to the maximum amount corresponding to 50% of Bank's share capital at the time on which the resolution was adopted, likewise  conferring authority to the Board of Directors to totally or partially  exclude  shareholders' pre-emptive subscription rights over any  specific  issue that may be made under such authority.\n\nHowever,  the power  to exclude  pre-emptive  subscription rights was  limited,  such  that the  nominal  amount  of  the  capital  increases resolved or effectively  carried out with the exclusion of pre-emptive subscription rights in use of the referred authority and those that may be resolved  or carried  out to cover the conversion of mandatory convertible issues  that may  also  be made  with the exclusion  of preemptive subscription rights in use of the authority to issue convertible  securities conferred by the AGM held on March 17, 2017, under agenda item five (without prejudice to the anti-dilution adjustments and this limit not being applicable  to contingent convertible issues) shall not exceed the nominal maximum overall  amount of 20% of the share capital of BBVA at the time of the authorization.\n\nAs of the date of this document, the Bank's Board of Directors has not exercised the authority conferred by the AGM.\n\n## Convertible and/or exchangeable securities:\n\nNote 22.4 introduces the details of the convertible and/or exchangeable securities.\n\n## 27.

Capital base and capital management\n\n## 32.1 Capital base\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, own funds is calculated  in accordance  to the applicable  regulation of each  year on minimum capital requirements for Spanish credit institutions -both as individual entities and as consolidated group- that establish how to calculate them, as well  as the various internal capital adequacy  assessment processes they should have in place and the information they should disclose to the market.\n\nWith respect to the capital requirement the ECB, in its announcement on March 12, 2020, in reaction to COVID-19, has allowed the banks to use additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital instruments to meet partially the Pillar  II (P2R) requirements for 2021, which is known as \"Pillar  2 tiering.\" This measure has been reinforced by the relaxation of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) announced by various national macroprudential authorities and by other complementary  measures  published by the ECB. All of this has resulted in a  reduction of 66 basis points in the fully-loaded CET1 requirement for BBVA, with that requirement standing at 8.59% and the requirement in terms of t otal capital at 12.75%, both requirements at consolidated level. The reduction in the requirement at the total ratio level is only around 2 basis points, as a result of the lower applicable  countercyclical buffer\n\nFrom 2021  onwards, the BBVA Group has set the objective  of maintaining a fully-loaded  CET1 ratio at a  consolidated level  of between 11.5% -12.0%, increasing the target distance to the minimum requirement (currently at 8.59 %) at 291-341 basis points. At closing of the financial  year 2020, the fully-loaded CET1 ratio is within this target management range.\n\nA reconciliation of the main figures between the accounting and regulatory own funds as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is shown below:",

In terms of CET1 fully loaded, the consolidated ratio stood at 11.73% (which represents a reduction of 1 basis point compared to 2019). The difference is mainly explained by the effect of the transitory adjustments for the treatment in the solvency ratios of the impacts of IFRS 9 and subsequent modifications in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis evolution had been affected by the positive BBVA's organic profit generation which has it made possible to cover the growth of risk weighted assets (RWA) and the relative  stabilization of the financial  markets during the second half of the year, largely motivated by the measures to stimulate the economy and the announced guaranteed programs by the different national and supranational authorities and the approval by the Parliament and the European Council of regulation 2020/873 (known as CRR quick fix).",

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nRegarding the shareholder  remuneration proposal in  relation to the Group's 2020  result, explained  in Note  4, this amount has  been anticipated as a prudential buffer in the Group's capital ratios, with an impact of 11 basis points\n\nPhased-in additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) stood at 1, 89% at the end of December 2020, an improvement of +23 basis points compared to the previous year. In this respect, in July 2020, the first green CoCo from a  financial  institution worldwide was issued for an amount of \u20ac1,000  million,  with a coupon of 6%  and an option for early  amortization in five  and a  half  years. Moreover, a  CoCo of \u20ac1,500  million (coupon of 6.75%) was amortized in February, on the first date of the early  amortization option; in January 2021, the early  amortization options were implemented  for two preferential issuances,  issued by BBVA International Preferred  and Caixa  Sabadell  Preferents for 31 million  pounds sterling  and  \u20ac90m  respectively;  and  finally,  for  a  third  preferential  issuance  issued  by  Caixa  Terrassa  Societat  de Participacions  Preferents, the bondholders' meeting has approved its early  amortization on January 29, 2021 (versus the amortization option date of August 10, 2021). As of December 31, 2020, these issuances do not form part of the Group's capital adequacy ratios.\n\nThe phased-in Tier 2 ratio stood at 2.42%, an increase of +14 basis points over the previous years. Two Tier 2 issuances were  issued in 2020: an issuance of \u20ac1,000  million in January, with a maturity of 10 years and an amortization option from the fifth year, with a coupon of 1%; and another issuance of 300 million pounds sterling in July, with a maturity of 11 years and with an early  amortization option from the sixth year, with a coupon of 3.104%.\n\nRegarding the MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities)  requirements, BBVA has continued its issuance plan during 2020 by closing two public issuances of non-preferred senior debt, one in January 2020 for \u20ac1,250m with a maturity of seven years and a coupon of 0.5%, and another in February 2020 for CHF 160m with a maturity of six and a half years and a coupon of 0.125%. In M ay 2020, the first issuance  of a COVID-19 social  bond by a private financial  institution in Europe was  completed. This is a five-year  senior preferred bond, for \u20ac1,000 million and a coupon of 0.75%. Finally, in order to optimize the MREL requirement, in September BBVA issued preferred senior debt of USD 2,000 million  in two tranches, with maturities of three and five years, for USD 1,200 million and USD 800 million and coupons of 0.875% and 1.125% respectively.\n\nThe Group estimates that, following the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No. 2019/877 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of May 20 (which, among other matters, establishes the MREL in terms of RWAs and new periods for said requirement's transition and implementation), the current structure of shareholders' funds and admissible liabilities  enables compliance with the MREL.\n\n## 32.2 Leverage ratio\n\nThe leverage  ratio (LR) is a regulatory measure complementing capital  designed to guarantee the soundness and financial  strength of institutions in terms of indebtedness. This measurement  can  be used to estimate  the percentage of the assets and  off-balance sheet arrangements financed with Tier 1 capital, being the carrying amount of the assets used in this ratio adjusted to reflect the bank's current or potential leverage of a given balance-sheet position (Leverage ratio exposure).\n\nBreakdown of leverage  ratio as of December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, calculated  according to CCR, is as follows:\n\n| Leverage  ratio                     | 2020 (*)   | 2019    | 2018    |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|---------|---------|\n| Tier 1 (millions of euros) (a)      | 49,597     | 49,701  | 45,947  |\n| Exposure (millions of euros) (b)    | 735,697    | 731,087 | 705,299 |\n| Leverage ratio (a)/(b) (percentage) | 6.74%      | 6.80%   | 6.51%   |\n\n## 32.3 Capital management\n\nThe aim of capital management within BBVA and the Group is to ensure that both BBVA and the Group have the necessary capital at any given time to develop the corporate strategy reflected in the Strategic Plan, in line  with the risk profile set out in the Group Risk Appetite Framework (RAF).\n\nIn  this  regard,  BBVA's  capital  management  is  also  part  of  the  most  relevant  forward-looking  strategic  decisions  in  the  Group's management and monitoring, which include the Annual Budget and the Liquidity and Funding Plan, with which it is coordinated - all with the aim of achieving the Group's overall strategy.\n\nCapital must be allocated optimally in order to meet the need to preserve the solvency of BBVA and the Group at all times. Together with the Group's solvency risk profile included  in the RAF, this optimal allocation serves  as a guide for the Group's capital management and means a continuous need for a solid capital position that makes it possible to:\n\n- Anticipate ordinary and extraordinary consumption that may occur, even under stress;",

These amounts have been recognized with a corresponding entry under the heading 'Shareholders'  funds - Other equity instruments' in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax effect.\n\nThe characteristics  of the Group's remuneration plans based on equity instruments are described below.\n\n## System of Variable Remuneration in Shares\n\nBBVA has a specific remuneration system applicable  to those employees whose professional activities may have a material impact on the risk profile of the Group (hereinafter 'Identified Staff'), designed within the framework of applicable  regulations to credit institutions and considering best practices and recommendations at the local and international levels  in this matter.\n\nIn 2020, this remuneration scheme is reflected in the following remuneration policies:\n\n- BBVA Group Remuneration Policy , approved by the Board of Directors on November 29, 2017, that applies in general to all employees of BBVA and of its subsidiaries that form part of the consolidated group. This policy includes in a specific chapter the remuneration system applicable  to the members of BBVA Group Identified Staff, including Senior Management.\n- BBVA Directors' Remuneration Policy , approved by the Board of Directors and by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 15, 2019, that it's applicable to BBVA Directors. The remuneration system for executive directors corresponds, generally, with the applicable  system to the Identified Staff, to which they belong, incorporating some particularities of their own, derived from their condition of directors.\n\nThe Annual Variable Remuneration for the Identified Staff members is subject to specific rules for settlement and payment established in their corresponding remuneration policies, specifically:\n\n- Variable remuneration for Identified Staff members for each financial year will  be subject to ex ante adjustments, so that it shall be reduced at the time of the performance assessment in the event of negative performance of the Group's results or other parameters such as the level of achievement of budgeted targets, and it shall not accrue or it will accrue in a reduced amount, should certain level of profits and capital ratios not be achieved.\n- 60% of the Annual Variable Remuneration will be paid, if conditions are met, in the year following that to which it corresponds (the 'Upfront Portion'). For executive directors, members of the Senior Management and Identified Staff members with particularly high variable remuneration, the Upfront Portion will be 40% of the Annual Variable Remuneration. The remaining portion will be deferred in time (hereinafter, the 'Deferred Component') for a 5 year-period for executive directors and members of the Senior Management, and 3 years for the remaining Identified Staff.\n- 50% of the Annual Variable Remuneration, both the Upfront Portion and the Deferred Component, shall be established in BBVA shares. As regards executive directors and Senior Management, 60% of the Deferred Component shall be established in shares.\n- Shares received  as Annual Variable Remuneration shall be withheld for a one-year period after delivery, except for the transfer of those shares required to honor the payment taxes.\n- The Deferred Component of the Annual Variable Remuneration may be reduced in its entirety, but never increased, based on the result of multi-year performance indicators aligned with the Group's core risk management and control metrics related to the solvency, capital, liquidity, profitability or to the share performance and the recurring results of the Group.\n- Resulting cash portions of the Deferred Component of Annual Variable Remuneration and subject to the multi-year performance indicators, finally delivered, shall be updated following the Consumer Price Index (CPI), measured as the yearon-year change prices, as agreed by the Board of Directors.\n- The entire Annual Variable Remuneration shall be subject to malus and clawback arrangements during the whole deferral and withholding period, both linked to a downturn in the financial performance of the Bank as a whole, of a specific  unit or area, or of exposure generated by an Identified Staff member, when such a downturn in financial performance arises from any of the circumstances expressly named in the remuneration policies.\n- No personal hedging strategies or insurances shall be used in connection with remuneration or liability that may undermine the effects of alignment with sound risk management.\n- The variable  component of the remuneration for a financial year shall be limited to a maximum amount of 100% of the fixed component of the total remuneration, unless the General Meeting resolves to increase this percentage up to a maximum of 200%.",

This amount has been subject to a downward adjustment due to multi-year performance indicators evaluation.\n\nLikewise, the aforesaid policy established that the deferred amounts in shares of the Annual Variable Remuneration finally vested, su bject to multi-year performance indicators, will  be updated in cash, based on the terms established  by the Board of Directors. In this regard, during 2020 a total amount of 3,085,476 euros has been delivered  to the Identified Staff as updates of the corresponding shares of the Deferred Component of 2016 Annual Variable Remuneration.\n\nDetailed information on the delivery of shares to executive directors and Senior Management is included in Note 54.\n\nLastly, in line with specific  regulation applicable in Portugal and Brazil, BBVA IFIC and BBVA Brazil Banco de Investimento have identified respectively  the staff in these countries whose  Annual Variable  Remuneration should be subject to a specific  settlement and payment scheme, more specifically:\n\n- A percentage of the Annual Variable Remuneration is subject to a three years deferral that shall be paid yearly over the mentioned period.\n- 50% of the Annual Variable Remuneration, both the Upfront Portion and Deferred Component, shall be established in BBVA Shares.\n- In BBVA IFIC, resulting cash portions of the Deferred Component of Annual Variable Remuneration and subject to multi-year performance indicators, finally delivered, shall be updated following the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measured as year-onyear price variation.\n- In BBVA Brasil Banco de Investimento, both the cash amounts and share amounts of the Deferred Component may be subject to update adjustments in cash.\n\nAccording to this remuneration scheme, during financial  year 2020 a total of 18,879 BBVA shares corresponding to the Upfront Po rt ion of 2019 Annual Variable Remuneration have been delivered  to this staff in Portugal and Brazil.\n\nAdditionally, during 2020 there have been delivered  to this staff in Portugal and Brazil a total of 5,083 BBVA shares corresponding to the first third of the Deferred  Component of 2018 Annual Variable  Remuneration, as well  as 1,323 euros as adjustments for updates.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nAlso, during 2020 financial year, \u20ac95 thousand was paid out in casualty and healthcare insurance premiums for non-executive members of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition, Tom\u00e1s Alfaro Drake and Carlos Loring Mart\u00ednez de Irujo, who left their roles as directors on 13 March 2020, received a total of \u20ac54 thousand and \u20ac111 thousand, respectively, for their membership of the Board and of the various Board Committees during the first quarter of the financial year. The Bank has also paid out a total of \u20ac18 thousand in casualty and healthcare insurance premiums.\n\n## Remuneration received by executive directors in 2020\n\nDuring the 2020 financial  year, the executive  directors received  the amount of the Annual Fixed Remuneration corresponding to such financial  year,  established  for  each  director  in  the  Remuneration  Policy  for  BBVA Directors,  which  was  approved  by  the  General Shareholders' Meeting held on 15 March 2019.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors received their Annual Variable Remuneration ('AVR') for the 2019 financial year, which, in accordance with the settlement and payment system set out in the remuneration policy applicable to such year, was due to be paid to them during the 2020 financial year.\n\nIn application of this settlement and payment system:\n\n- \u00b7 40% of the 2019 Annual Variable Remuneration corresponding to executive directors was paid in the 2020 financial  year (the Upfront Portion); in equal parts in cash and BBVA shares.\n- \u00b7 The remaining 60% of the Annual Variable  Remuneration has been deferred  (40% in cash and 60%  in shares) for a period of five years (the Deferred Portion), and its accrual and payment will be subject to compliance with a series of multi-year indicators. The application of these indicators, calculated  over the first three years of deferral, may lead  to the reduction or even forfeit of the Deferred Portion, even in its entirety, but in no event may it be increased. Provided that the relevant conditions are met, the resulting amount will then be paid, in cash and in BBVA shares, according to the following payment schedule: 60% in 2023, 20% in 2024 and the remaining 20% in 2025.\n- \u00b7 All of the shares delivered  to the executive  directors as AVR, including both as  part of the Upfront Portion and the Deferred Portion, will be withheld for a one year lock-up period after delivery,  except for the shares transferred to honor the payment of taxes accruing on the shares received.\n- \u00b7 The  Deferred  Portion of  the  Annual  Variable  Remuneration  payable  in  cash  will  be  subject  to  updating under  the  terms established by the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Executive  directors  may  not  use  personal  hedging  strategies  or  insurance  in  connection  with  the  remuneration  and responsibility that may undermine the effects of alignment with prudent risk management.\n- \u00b7 Over the entire deferral  and withholding period, the Annual Variable Remuneration for the executive directors will  be subject to variable  remuneration reduction and recovery arrangements (\"malus\" and \"clawback\").\n- \u00b7 The variable  component of the remuneration for executive  directors corresponding to the 2019 financial  year  is limited  to a maximum amount of 200% of the fixed component of the total remuneration, as agreed by the General Shareholders' Meeting held during such financial year.\n\nAdditionally, upon receipt of the shares, executive directors will not be allowed to transfer a number equivalent to twice their Annual Fixed Remuneration for at least three years after their delivery.\n\nIn 2020, the Group Executive  Chairman and the Chief Executive  Officer  likewise  received  the deferred  portion of their Annual Variable Remuneration due that year  for the 2016 financial  year  (50%  of the Annual Variable  Remuneration), after being adjusted downwards following the results of the multi-year performance indicators. This remuneration was paid in equal parts in cash and in shares, together with the corresponding update in cash, thus concluding the payment of the Annual Variable Remuneration to the executive directors for the 2016 financial  year.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  above,  the  remunerations  paid  to  executive  directors  during the  2020  financial  year  are  indicated  below, individualized and itemized:\n\n| Annual Fixed Remuneration for 2020 (thousands of euro) Group Executive Chairman   | 2,453   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Chief Executive Officer                                                           | 2,179   |\n| Total                                                                             |         |\n|                                                                                   | 4,632   |\n\nIn addition, in accordance  with the current Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors, during the 2020 financial  year, the Chief Executive Officer has received  \u20ac654 thousand for the cash in lieu of pension item (equivalent to 30% of his Annual Fixed Remuneration)-given that he  does  not have  a  retirement  pension  (see  the Pension  commitments  section  of this  Note)-and  \u20ac600  thousand for the  mobility allowance  item.",

The shares received will be withheld for a one year lock-up period (this will  not apply to those shares transferred to honor the payment of taxes arising therefrom). Likewise, senior management may  not use personal hedging strategies or insurance in connection with the remuneration; the variable component of the remuneration for senior management corresponding to the 2019 financial year will be limited to a maximum amount of 200% of the fixed component of the total remuneration; and  over the entire  deferral  and withholding period, the Annual Variable  Remuneration will  be  subject to reduction and recovery (malus and clawback)  arrangements.\n\nSimilarly,  in accordance with the remuneration policy for this group applicable in 2016 and in application of the settlement and payment system of the Annual Variable Remuneration for said financial  year, the members of Senior Management who were beneficiaries  of such remuneration received in 2020 the deferred portion of the Annual Variable Remuneration for the 2016 financial year, after being adjusted downwards following the results of the multi-year performance indicators.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nFollowing the end of the 2020 financial  year, the amount corresponding to the deferred Annual Variable Remuneration of members of Senior  Management  (15  members  as  at  31 December, 2020,  excluding  executive  directors)  for  the  2017  financial  year  has  been determined, with delivery  in 2021, if  conditions are met, in accordance  with the payment schedule set out in the remuneration policies applicable  to the 2017 financial year and applicable  to each of them.\n\nThus, based on the result of each of the multi-year performance indicators set by the Board of Directors in 2017 to calculate the deferred portion of  this  remuneration,  and  in  application  of  the  corresponding scales  of  achievement  and  their  corresponding targets  and weightings, the amount of the deferred  portion of the 2017 Annual Variable  Remuneration for members  of Senior  Management, with delivery in 2021, has been determined in the aggregate total amount, excluding executive directors, of \u20ac610 thousand and 107,740 BBVA shares, including the corresponding updates.\n\n## \u25cf Outstanding deferred Annual Variable Remuneration for the members of Senior Management\n\nAt year-end 2020, in accordance  with the conditions established in the remuneration policies  applicable  in previous years, in addition to 40%  of  the  2017  deferred  AVR in  the  case  of  some  members  of  Senior  Management, 60%  of  the  Annual  Variable  Remuneration corresponding to financial years 2018 and 2019 remains deferred and is pending payment to all members of Senior Management, and will be received  in future years if the applicable  conditions are met.\n\n## Fixed remuneration system with deferred delivery of shares for non-executive directors\n\nBBVA has a fixed remuneration system in shares with deferred delivery for its non-executive directors, which was approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 18 March 2006 and extended by resolutions of the General Shareholders' Meetings held on 11 March 2011 and 11 March 2016 for a further five year period in each case.\n\nThis system is based on the annual allocation to non-executive directors of a number of \"theoretical shares\" of BBVA equivalent to 20% of the total remuneration in cash received by each director in the previous financial year, calculated according to the average closing p r ices of  BBVA shares  during  the  60 trading  sessions  prior  to  the  dates  of  the  Annual  General  Shareholders'  Meetings  approving  the corresponding financial statements for each financial  year.\n\nThese shares will be delivered to each beneficiary, where applicable, after they leave directorship for any reason other than serious b r each of their duties.\n\nThe 'theoretical shares'  allocated to non-executive directors who are  beneficiaries  of the remuneration system in shares with deferred delivery in the 2020 financial  year, corresponding to 20% of the total remuneration received in cash by each of them in the 2019 financial year, were as follows:\n\n|                                | Theoretical shares  allocated in 2020   | Theoretical shares  accumulated as at  31 December 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Jos\u00e9 Miguel Andr\u00e9s Torrecillas | 20,252                                  | 75,912                                                    |\n| Jaime F\u00e9lix Caruana Lacorte    | 22,067                                  | 31,387                                                    |\n| Ra\u00fal Galamba  de Oliveira      | -

The amount of this pension will be determined by the annual contributions made by the Bank, together with their corresponding accumulated yields at that date.\n\nThe  annual  contribution to cover  the  retirement  contingency  for  the  Group Executive  Chairman's  defined-contribution system,  as established in the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2019, was determined as a result  of  the  conversion  of  his  previous  defined-benefit  rights  into  a  defined-contribution  system,  in  the  annual  amount  of",

The Board of Directors may  update this amount during the term of the Policy, in the same way and under the same terms as it may update the Annual Fixed Remuneration.\n\n15%  of the aforementioned  agreed annual  contribution will  be  based  on variable  components and considered  'discretionary  pension benefits',  and  therefore subject  to the  conditions  regarding  delivery  in  shares,  retention  and  clawback  established  in  the  applicable regulations.\n\nIn the event the Group Executive Chairman's contract terminates before reaching retirement age for reasons other than serious breach of duties, the retirement pension due to the Group Executive Chairman upon reaching the legally established age will be calculated based on the funds accumulated through the contributions made by the Bank under the terms set out, up to that date, plus the corresponding accumulated yield, with no additional contributions to be made by the Bank in any event from the time of termination.\n\nWith respect to the commitments to cover the contingencies for death and disability benefits for the Group Executive Chairman, the B ank will undertake the payment of the corresponding annual insurance premiums in order to top up the coverage of these contingencies.\n\nIn line with the above, during the 2020 financial  year, the following amounts have been recorded to meet the pension commitments for the  Group  Executive  Chairman:  an  amount  of  \u20ac1,642 thousand  with  regard  to  the  retirement  contingency  and  an  amount  of \u20ac377 thousand for the payment of premiums for the death and disability contingencies, as well as an upwards adjustment of \u20ac15 thousand for 'discretionary pension benefits' for the 2019 financial year, which were declared at such financial  year-end and had to be registered in the accumulated fund in 2020.\n\nAs of  31 December, 2020,  the total accumulated  amount of the  fund to meet  the retirement  commitments for  the Group  Executive Chairman amounts to \u20ac23,057 thousand.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  agreed  annual  contribution  to  the  retirement  contingency  corresponding  to  the  2020  financial  year,  15% (\u20ac246 thousand) was registered in this financial  year as 'discretionary pension benefits'. Following year-end, the amount was adjusted applying the same criteria used to determine the Annual Variable Remuneration for the rest of the Bank's staff. Thus, the 'discretionary pension benefits' for the 2020 financial  year were determined in an amount of \u20ac148 thousand, following a downwards adjustment of \u20ac98 thousand. These 'discretionary pension benefits' will  be included in the accumulated fund in the 2021 financial  year and will be subject to the conditions established for these benefits in the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors.\n\nWith regard to the Chief  Executive  Officer,  in  accordance  with the provisions of the current Remuneration Policy  for  BBVA Directors approved by the General  Shareholders' Meeting and his contract, the Bank is  not required to make  any contributions to a retirement pension, although he is entitled to an annual cash sum instead of a retirement pension equal to 30% of his Annual Fixed Remuneration. However, the Bank does have pension commitments to cover the death and disability contingencies, for which purpose the corresponding annual insurance premiums are paid.\n\nIn accordance with the above, in the 2020 financial year, the Bank paid the Chief Executive Officer  the fixed-remuneration amount set out for  cash  in  lieu  of  pension  in  the  'Remuneration  received  by  executive  directors  in  2020'  section  of  this  Note  and  furthermore, \u20ac253 thousand was recorded for the payment of the annual insurance premiums to cover the death and disability contingencies.\n\nIn the case  of the former executive  director, the Head  of GE&PA, \u20ac89 thousand were  registered as  contributions to fulfil  the pension commitments undertaken in proportion to the time he spent in office during the 2020 financial  year. This corresponds to: the sum of the annual contribution made to cover the retirement pension and the adjustment made to the 'discretionary pension benefits'' for the 2019 financial  year  that fell  due in the 2020  financial  year  once the AVR for the year  2019 had been  determined (\u20ac52 thousand); and to the death and disability premiums (\u20ac37 thousand).\n\nAs of the date on which  he left his position, the total accumulated  fund to meet the retirement commitments for the former executive director Head of GE&PA amounted to \u20ac1,404 thousand, with no additional contributions to be made by the Bank from that point on.\n\nIn accordance with the same criteria used in the case of the Group Executive Chairman, the 'discretionary pension benefits' for the 2020 financial  year  of the former executive director Head of GE&PA (calculated  in proportion to the time he remained  in office  in 2020) wer e determined in an amount of \u20ac5 thousand, following a downwards adjustment of \u20ac3 thousand, and will be included in the accumulated fund in the 2021 financial  year, subject to the conditions established in the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors.\n\nFurthermore, in the 2020 financial  year, to meet the pension commitments for members of Senior Management (15 members holding that position as at 31 December, 2020, excluding executive  directors) it was  recorded an amount of \u20ac2,739 thousand corresponding to the contribution to the retirement contingency  and of  \u20ac978 thousand corresponding to premiums to cover  the  death  and  disability contingencies, as well  as an upwards adjustment of \u20ac12 thousand for 'discretionary pension benefits' for the 2019 financial  year, which were declared  at 2019 year-end and had to be registered in the accumulated fund in 2020.\n\nAs  at 31 December, 2020,  the total  accumulated  amount of the  fund to  meet  the  retirement  commitments  for  members  of  Senior Management amounts to \u20ac22,156 thousand.\n\nAs  for  the  executive  directors,  15%  of  the  agreed  annual  contributions for  members  of  Senior  Management  to  cover  retirement contingencies will  be based on variable  components and considered 'discretionary  pension benefits',  and are  therefore subject to the",

Accordingly, the 'discretionary  pension  benefits'  for  such  financial  year,  corresponding to all members of Senior Management, were  determined to amount to a total of \u20ac255 thousand, following a downwards adjustment of \u20ac150 thousand. These 'discretionary pension benefits'  will be included in the accumulated fund in the 2021 financial  year, and will  be subject to the conditions established for these benefits in the remuneration policy applicable  to members of Senior Management, in accordance with the regulations applicable to BBVA on this matter.\n\n## Payments  for the extinction of the contractual relationship\n\nIn accordance with the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors, the Bank has no commitments to pay severance benefits to executive directors.\n\nThe contractual framework defined for the executive directors, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for BBVA Directors, establishes a post-contractual non-compete clause for executive directors, effective for a period of two (2) years after they leave their role as BBVA executive directors, provided that they do not leave due to retirement, disability or serious breach of duties. In compensation for this agreement, the Bank shall  award  them remuneration of an amount equivalent  to their Annual Fixed Remuneration for each year  of the non-compete agreement, which will be awarded  monthly over the course of the two years.\n\nAccordingly, the former executive director Head of GE&PA, who left his role on 13 March 2020, received for this concept, \u20ac625 thousand du ring the 2020 financial  year.\n\nWith regard to Senior Management, excluding executive directors, during the 2020 financial year, the Bank paid out a total of \u20ac2,185 thousand resulting from the extinction of the contractual relationship with one member of Senior Management and in fulfilment of the provisions of the member's contract (for the payment of legal severance benefits and notice). This contract includes the right to receive the corresponding leg al severance  pay, provided that the member  of Senior Management does not leave  of his own will,  for retirement, disability  or due to a serious breach of duties, which will  be calculated in accordance with the provisions of applicable  labor regulations, and a notice clause. In addition, the contract establishes a non-compete clause, effective for a period of one (1) year after the member leaves  the role as a senior manager of BBVA, provided that the member  does not leave  due to retirement, disability  or serious  breach of duties. In compensation for this agreement,  the member of Senior Management received  a total of \u20ac898 thousand during 2020.\n\nThese payments comply with the conditions set out in the regulations applicable to the group of employees with a material impact on the Group's risk profile, to which members of Senior Management belong.\n\n.",

Subsequent events\n\nOn January  22, 2021 and  after obtaining all  required authorizations, BBVA has  completed the sale  to Banco  GNB Paraguay,  S.A., an affiliate  of Grupo Gilinski,  of its 100%  direct and indirect stake share capital  in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria Paraguay, S.A. ('BBVA Paraguay').\n\nThe  amount received  by  BBVA amounts to approximately  USD250  million  (\u20ac210  million).  The  transaction results  in a  capital  loss  of approximately \u20ac9 million net of taxes. A positive impact on BBVA Group's Common Equity Tier 1 (fully loaded) of approximately  6 basis points is estimated to be recognized during the first half of 2021 (see Note 3).\n\nOn January 29, 2021, it was announced that a cash distribution in the amount of \u20ac0.059 gross per share as shareholder remuneration in relation  to the Group's result in the 2020  financial  year  was  expected  to be submitted to the relevant  governing bodies of  BBVA for consideration (see Note 4).\n\nFrom January 1, 2021 to the date of preparation of these consolidated financial  statements, no other subsequent events not mentioned above in these financial  statements have taken place  that could significantly affect the Group's earnings or its equity position.\n\n## 57.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\n## APPENDIX X. Information on  data derived from the special accounting registry and other information bonds\n\nThe Bank has implemented policies and procedures for its activities in the mortgage market and in the financing of exportation of goods and services  or the process of internationalization of companies, which allow  ensuring compliance with the applicable  regulations of the mortgage market and for the issuance of bonds.\n\n## a) Mortgage market policies and procedures\n\nInformation required pursuant to Circular 5/2011 of the Bank of Spain is indicated as follows.\n\nThe mortgage origination policy is based on principles focused on assessing the adequate ratio between the amount of the loan, and the payments, and the income of the applicant. Applicants must in all  cases prove sufficient repayment ability  (present and future) to meet their repayment obligations, for both the mortgage debt and for other debts detected in the financial  system. Therefore, the applicant's repayment ability is a key aspect within the credit decision-making tools and retail risk acceptance  manuals, and has a high weighting in the final decision.\n\nDuring the mortgage risk transaction analysis  process, documentation supporting the applicant's income (payroll, etc.) is required, and the applicant's position in the financial system is checked  through automated database queries (internal and external). This information is  used for  calculation  purposes in order  to determine  the level  of  indebtedness/compliance  with the remainder  of the system. This documentation is kept in the transaction's file.\n\nIn addition, the mortgage origination policy assesses  the adequate ratio between the amount of the loan and the appraisal value of the mortgaged asset. The policy also establishes that the property to be mortgaged be appraised  by an independent appraisal  company as established  by  Circular  3/2010  and Circular  4/2016.  BBVA selects  those companies  whose  reputation, standing in the  market  and independence ensure that their appraisals adapt to the market reality in each region. Each appraisal  is reviewed  and checked before the loan is granted and, in those cases where the loan is finally  granted, it is kept in the transaction's file.\n\nAs for issues  related  to the mortgage market, the Finance  area  annually  defines  the strategy for wholesale  finance  issues, and more specifically  mortgage bond issues, such as mortgage covered bonds or mortgage securitization. The Assets and Liabilities Committee tracks the budget monthly. The volume and type of assets in these transactions is determined in accordance with the wholesale  finance plan, the trend of the Bank's 'Loans and advances' outstanding balances and the conditions in the market.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Bank authorizes each of the issues of Mortgage Transfer Certificates and/or Mortgage Participations issued by  BBVA to  securitize  the  credit  rights  derived  from  loans  and  mortgage  loans.  Likewise,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorizes  the establishment  of  a  Base  Prospectus  for  the  issuance  of  fixed-income  securities  through which  the  mortgage-covered  bonds  are implemented.\n\nAs established  in article  24 of Royal Decree  716/2009, of April, 24, by  virtue of which certain  aspects of Law  2/1981, of 25 March, of regulation of the  mortgage market  and  other rules  of the mortgage and  financial  system are  developed, 'the  volume of outstanding mortgage-covered bonds issued by a bank may not exceed 80% of a calculation base determined by adding the outstanding principal of all the loans and mortgage loans in the bank's portfolio that are eligible' and which are not covered by the issue of mortgage bonds, mortgage participations or mortgage transfer certificates.  For these purposes, in accordance with the aforementioned Royal Decree  716/2009, in order to be eligible, loans and mortgage loans, on a general basis: (i) must be secured by a first mortgage on the freehold; (ii) the loan's amount may  not exceed  80%  of  the  appraisal  value  for  residential  mortgages, and  60%  for  other mortgage  lending; (iii)  must be established  on  assets  exclusively  and  wholly  owned  by the  mortgagor; (iv) must have  been  appraised  by  an  independent appraisal company unrelated to the Group and authorized by the Bank of Spain; and (v) the mortgaged property must be covered at least by a current damage insurance policy.\n\nThe Bank has set up a series of controls for mortgage covered bonds, which regularly control the total volume of issued mortgage co vered bonds issued and the remaining eligible  collateral,  to avoid exceeding the maximum limit set by Royal Decree 716/2009, and outlined in the preceding paragraph. In the case of securitizations, the preliminary portfolio of loans and mortgage loans to be securitized is checked according to an agreed  procedures engagement, by the Bank's external  auditor as required  by the Spanish  Securities  and Exchange Commission. There  is also  a  series  of  filters  through which some mortgage loans and  credits are  excluded  in accordance  with legal, commercial  and risk concentration criteria.",

Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. |\n| Exposure at default                                                 | EAD is the amount of risk exposure at the date of default by the counterparty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Fair value                                                          | The price that would be received  to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the measurement date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Fair value hedges                                                   | Derivatives  that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value  of assets and liabilities  or firm commitments  that  have  not  be  recognized,  or  of  an  identified  portion  of  said  assets,  liabilities  or  firm  commitments,  attributable to a specific risk, provided it could affect the income statement.                                                                                                                                  |\n| Financial Assets at  Amortized Cost                                 | Financial assets that do not meet the definition of financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss  and arise  from the financial entities' ordinary activities  to capture funds, regardless of their instrumentation or  maturity.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                                                     | Financial  instruments with determined or determinable  cash flows and in which the entire payment made by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Financial Assets at fair value  through other  comprehensive income | the entity will be recovered, except for reasons attributable to the solvency of the debtor.

It might be acceptable  to designate only some of a number of similar  financial  assets or financial  liabilities  if doing so a significant reduction (and possibly a greater reduction than  other allowable  designations) in the inconsistency is achieved.        b) The  performance of a group of financial  assets or financial  liabilities  is managed  and evaluated  on a fair  value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about  the  group  is  provided  internally  on  that  basis  to  the  entity's  key  management  personnel.

Conversely, if the entity holds, directly or indirectly (i.e. through  subsidiaries), less than 20 per cent of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity does not  have  significant  influence,  unless  such  influence  can  be  clearly  demonstrated.  A  substantial  or  majority  ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an entity from having significant influence.            |\n|                                                    | The existence  of significant  influence  by an entity is usually  evidenced  in one or more of the following ways:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Single Resolution Board  (SRB)  Solely Payments of | The Single Resolution Board (SRB) is the new European Banking Union's resolution authority.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Impairment of loans and advances to customers See notes 7.2 and 14.1 to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group's portfolio of loans and advances to customers presents a net balance of Euros 311,147 million at 31 December 2020, and the impairment provisions recognized at that date amount to Euros 12,105 million.\n\nFor the purposes of estimating impairment, financial assets measured at amortized cost are classified into three categories (stage 1, 2 or 3) according to whether a significant increase in credit risk since their initial recognition has been identified (stage 2), whether the financial assets are credit-impaired (stage 3), or whether neither of these circumstances has arisen (stage 1). For the Group, establishing this classification is a relevant process as the calculation of allowances and provisions for credit risk varies depending on the category in which the financial asset has been included.\n\nImpairment is calculated based on an expected loss model, which the Group estimates on both an individual and a collective basis. This calculation entails a considerable level of judgment as this is a subjective and complex estimate.\n\nIndividual allowances and provisions consider estimates of future business performance and the market value of collateral provided for credit transactions.\n\nIn the case of collective allowances and provisions, expected credit losses are estimated by means of internal models that use large databases, different macroeconomic scenarios, provision estimation parameters, segmentation criteria and automated processes. Such models are complex in their design and implementation and require past, present and future information to be considered. The Group periodically recalibrates and performs contrast tests on its internal models with a view to improving their predictive power on the basis of actual past experience.\n\nOur audit approach in relation to the Group's estimate of impairment of loans and advances to customers due to credit risk mainly consisted of assessing the methodology applied to calculate expected losses, particularly as regards the methods and assumptions used to estimate exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD); determining the future macroeconomic variables; and the quantitative and qualitative criteria used to adjust collective allowances and provisions. We also assessed the mathematical accuracy of the expected loss calculations.\n\nThe main procedures performed included evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls linked to the process of estimating impairment and performing different tests of detail on that estimate, to which end we brought in our credit risk specialists.\n\nOur procedures related to the control environment focused on assessing the main controls in the following key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Development and approval of the credit risk management framework, the Group's accounting policies and the methodology used to estimate expected loss.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of whether the portfolio of loans and advances to customers has been appropriately classified on the basis of credit risk, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Group, particularly as regards the correct identification and classification of refinancing and restructuring transactions.\n- \u00b7 Identification of the methods and assumptions used to estimate EAD, PD and LGD and to determine the future macroeconomic variables, considering the expected impacts of COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the functioning of the internal models for estimating both individual and collective allowances and provisions for expected losses, and of the management and valuation of collateral.",

In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)\n\n## Impairment of loans and advances to customers\n\n## See notes 7.2 and 14.1 to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a negative effect on the economy and business activities of the countries where the Group operates, leading to an economic recession in many of these countries. To mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, governments of different countries have launched initiatives to support the most affected sectors and customers through various measures such as the provision of State-backed credit facilities, penalty-free payment deferrals (moratoriums) and flexible financing and liquidity facilities. All of these aspects have impacted on the parameters considered by the Group at 31 December 2020 when quantifying expected losses on financial assets (macroeconomic variables, customer net revenues, value of pledged collateral, probability of default, etc.), thus increasing the uncertainty associated with their estimation. The Group has therefore recognized the adverse effects of COVID-19 on the impairment of financial assets in its consolidated income statement at 31 December 2020 by supplementing the expected losses with certain additional temporary adjustments deemed necessary to reflect the particular characteristics of borrowers, sectors and portfolios, which might not be identified in the general process.\n\nThe consideration of this matter as a key audit matter is based both on the significance for the Group of the loans and advances to customers portfolio, and thus of the related allowance and provision, as well as on the relevance of the process for classifying these financial assets for the purpose of estimating impairment thereon and the subjectivity and complexity of calculating expected losses, while also taking into consideration the situation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the need to make additional adjustments to the expected losses identified in the general process and, where applicable, whether these have been appropriately estimated at 31 December 2020.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of whether the aspects observed by the Internal Validation Unit in relation to the recalibration and contrast testing of the models for estimating collective allowances and provisions have been taken into consideration.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of the integrity, accuracy and updating of the data used.\n\nOur tests of detail on the estimated expected losses included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to the impairment of individually significant transactions, we assessed the suitability of the cash flow discounting models used by the Group. We also selected a sample from the credit-impaired significant risk population, for which we evaluated the appropriateness of the allowance and provision recognized by analyzing the reasonableness of the projected cash flows, the discount rates applied and the value of any related collateral. This sample included borrowers from the economic sectors most affected by COVID-19 and/or which have received government aid in relation to the pandemic.\n- \u00b7 With respect to the impairment provisions estimated collectively, we evaluated the methodology used by the Group, assessed the integrity and accuracy of the input data for the process, and determined whether the calculation engine is functioning correctly by running the calculation process again for a sample of contracts, considering the segmentation and assumptions used by the Group.\n- \u00b7 When performing our audit procedures, we took into consideration the impacts of COVID-19 and the government aid on the parameters for calculating the expected loss. To this end, we brought in our corporate business valuation specialists to assess the macroeconomic variables used by the Group in its internal models to estimate the expected loss. In addition, we assessed the estimate of the additional adjustments to the expected losses identified in the general process, recognized at 31 December 2020.\n\nWe also analyzed whether the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, in accordance with the criteria set out in the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.",

We have therefore considered the estimate of fair value using these measurement methods as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures with regard to the fair value measurement of financial instruments focused on assessing the models and valuation methods used by the Group to estimate the fair value of complex financial instruments (those classified in level 2 or 3).\n\nTo this end, we performed tests of controls and tests of detail on the Group's decisions and estimates, with the involvement of our own financial instrument valuation specialists.\n\nOur procedures relating to the assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls associated with the process of measuring financial instruments focused on the following key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Identification and approval of the risk management framework and controls relating to operations in the financial markets in which the Group operates.\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the application of the Group's accounting policies.\n- \u00b7 Examination of the key controls associated with the process of measuring financial instruments.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the integrity, accuracy and updating of the data used and of the control and management process in place with regard to existing databases.\n\nOur procedures as regards the tests of detail performed were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the reasonableness of the most significant valuation models used by the Group, and of the significant assumptions applied, particularly inputs not directly observable in the market, such as interest rates, issuer credit risk, volatility and correlations between these factors.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of complex financial instruments measured at fair value, for which we assessed the correctness of their classification, the appropriateness of the valuation criteria applied and the reasonableness of their valuation by contrasting this with a valuation performed independently by our specialists.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the adjustments made by the Group to the parameters and data that have been affected by the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nLastly, we analyzed whether the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements has been prepared in accordance with the criteria stipulated in the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.",

In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)\n\n## Risks associated with information technology\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group has a complex technological operating environment, with large data processing centers in Spain and Mexico which provide support to different countries, as well as local data processing centers, such as those in Turkey, Argentina and the United States. This technological environment must reliably and efficiently satisfy business requirements and ensure that the Group's financial information is processed correctly.\n\nIn this environment, it is essential to ensure appropriate coordination and standardization in the management of technological risks that could impact on information systems in key areas such as data and program security, systems operations, and development and maintenance of the applications and IT systems used to prepare the financial information. We have therefore considered this a key audit matter.\n\nWith the help of our information systems specialists, we performed tests relating to internal control over the processes and systems involved in generating the financial information, in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding of the information flows and identification of the key controls that ensure the processing of information in each Group entity considered relevant for audit purposes.\n- \u00b7 Testing of the key automated processes used in generating the financial information.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the relevant data and systems migrations occurring in the period.\n- \u00b7 Testing of application and system controls related with access to and processing of the information and with the security settings of those applications and systems.\n- \u00b7 Testing of controls over the operation, maintenance and development of applications and systems.\n- \u00b7 Aggregation and analysis of deficiencies identified and monitoring of the improvement measures undertaken by the entities at both local and Group level.\n\n## Other Information: Consolidated Management Report \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther information solely comprises the 2020 consolidated management report, the preparation of which is the responsibility of the Bank's Directors and which does not form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not encompass the consolidated management report. Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated management report is defined in the legislation regulating the audit of accounts, as follows:\n\n- a) Determine, solely, whether the consolidated non-financial information statement and certain information included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report, as specified in the Spanish Audit Law, have been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, and if not, to report on this matter.\n- b) Assess and report on the consistency of the rest of the information included in the consolidated management report with the consolidated financial statements, based on knowledge of the Group obtained during the audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements. Also, assess and report on whether the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated management report are in accordance with applicable legislation. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report them.",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.",
