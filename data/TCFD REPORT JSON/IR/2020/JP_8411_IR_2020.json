        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\nFirst of all, I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies for all of those who have contracted COVID-19 and the many people who have been impacted in various ways by the spread of the virus.\n\nAlthough this crisis has continued for over a year, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel as vaccination rates rise. At the same time, some of the structural changes stemming from or accelerated by the pandemic are beginning to take hold under the 'new normal', and this is having a variety of impacts on our customers and society.\n\nUnder this unprecedented situation, Mizuho Bank recently experienced a series of IT system failures. I would like to apologize again for the considerable inconvenience and concern this caused our customers and stakeholders. We view this as an issue for management to address and will reflect on what we can do to improve, taking this opportunity to strengthen our resolution to fulfil our social responsibilities and public mission as a financial services group. We will ensure that this situation never repeats itself by renewing the dedication of all members of the group to take responsibility for fully implementing efforts to prevent further incidents. I will lead these efforts and aim to achieve continuous growth for Mizuho.\n\n## Global trends and structural changes\n\nGlobally, following the dramatic deterioration the COVID-19 pandemic brought about in the real economy in 2020, we have begun to see signs of a recovery in economic activity, accompanying the rollout of vaccines and control of infection. Of course, there are still many uncertainties surrounding the new variants, the ongoing progress of vaccine rollouts, and other factors, and we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent. However, the world does seem to be gradually shifting from a pandemic to a post-pandemic state.\n\nInterest in sustainability is also on the rise worldwide. The increasing attention towards various sustainability issues has become a significant trend, focusing most prominently on the environment and mitigation of climate change but also on respect of human rights in procurement and in business and on gender equality.\n\n## The world amidst and after the pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is constraining economic activity and physical movement, directly impacting the economy and society. While the downturn in the economy is expected to subside with the rollout of vaccines, the changes in society and in people's behavior may be in part irreversible.\n\nDigitalization, the aging population and declining birthrate, and globalization -these megatrends have existed since before the pandemic and have each been the cause of societal vulnerabilities and issues. COVID-19 threw these vulnerabilities and issues into sharp relief and accelerated behavioral changes. Digitalization is driving governmental, corporate, and individual activity -including activity that was previously thought to be ill-suited to digital formats -to shift to the online, virtual sphere, drawn by rapidly expanding needs for contact-free services. The aging population and declining birthrate is creating anxieties about the future and urgency about asset and business succession for the next generation; a growing number of people are taking the pandemic as an opportunity to review their life planning in a broad sense and are placing greater priority on health, healthcare, and inheritance. Globalization is advancing and prompting movement towards development of an optimal global system for handling the various business issues exposed by the pandemic, exemplified by the imbalances in supply chains, and for handling the intensifying complexities of geopolitics.\n\nThe business activities of both the finance industry in general and Mizuho in particular can be of use here. We see it as our role to leverage our real estate, consulting, digital, and other non-financial capabilities; our industry insights; and our global network to fully address the current challenges.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nAs sustainability gains momentum worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the surface the obstacles to sustainability inherent in society as a whole and also induced changes in the behavior of governments, corporations, and individuals. In response to climate change, Japan is calling for large-scale initiatives towards becoming carbon neutral by 2050, and every Japanese company is seeing their responsibilities and strategies in relation to climate change take on greater importance. They are considering what risks and opportunities sustainability entails as a whole and what effects these will have on their organizations. They are also questioning how to incorporate these into their strategies. Particularly clients in sectors with a large environmental impact are confronting the considerable hurdle of designing a pathway to transition to low carbon, and we see every day that they are seeking a partner to guide them on such a pathway.\n\nBased on the current organization we have built and the differentiating factors we have evolved over the years, how can Mizuho assist our clients and positively contribute to society in the midst of these dramatic changes? The answer to this question is part of our strategy for creating value.\n\n## Steadily improving our fundamental earnings power\n\nThe basic policy of the 5-Year Business Plan we launched in fiscal 2019 is to update our organization by implementing structural reforms in three interconnected areas: business structure, finance structure, and corporate foundations. This will enable us to respond to our customers' and society's considerable structural changes and achieve the goal which we set as the title of the plan: 'Transitioning to the Next Generation of Financial Services'.\n\nFiscal 2020 was the second year of this plan. Despite being under an unprecedented situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, we mitigated risk from the uncertain business environment, demonstrated our financial capabilities, and captured opportunities. At the same time, while coping with the realities of the pandemic on a daily basis, we moved forward with our reforms in order to respond to accelerating structural changes and prepare for the post-pandemic era. Through these efforts, we were able to achieve our initial 5-Year Business Plan targets of establishing a stable revenue base and of reaching \u00a5700 billion in Consolidated Net Business Profits by fiscal 2021, achieving the latter one year ahead of schedule and exceeding the target amount. In comparison to our results from past fiscal years, we also performed above the level we had achieved prior to the Bank of Japan's introduction of negative interest rates in fiscal 2015, and we recorded our highest profits since our introduction of the in-house company system in fiscal 2016.\n\nIn customer divisions, our support for clients' cash flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and our retail investment business were both robust, and the profitability of loan spreads and other business outside Japan improved. We were also able to capture the activity of primary markets for corporate and other bonds, mainly in Japan and North America. Our response to financing demands throughout the pandemic has further strengthened our relationships with our clients and enabled more active dialogue with their senior management. Our efforts have also led to business strategy deals based on new forms of partnership with large corporate clients, replacing crossshareholdings as the basis of the relationship.\n\nIn markets divisions, our banking business accumulated carry income, mainly from foreign bonds, to improve revenue quality. Our sales and trading business successfully expanded product offerings with a focus on North America, an effort that had been ongoing for some time. The business also captured client flow trading during the rise in volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to strong performance.\n\nAs for expenses, we were able to off-set the increases from amortization of the core banking system and investment in focus areas by steadily moving forward with our reforms reflecting structural changes in customer needs. Both the improvement of our revenue during the fiscal year and the steady strengthening of our fundamental earnings power, focused on stable revenue, indicate we are seeing positive results. Credit-related costs remained within the range of initial estimates, even as we prepared for the future by recording reserves from a forward-looking perspective. Profits also increased in comparison to the previous year.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we will continue building firm foundations for achieving the effects of our structural reforms during the second half of our 5-Year Business Plan and for ensuring future growth. Under the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we have again been reminded of the importance of demonstrating our stable business operations and financial intermediary functions to uphold our social responsibilities as a financial institution. In addition to this, we will assess changes in the",

The nonfinancial capabilities which complement our financial capabilities will be one key way of differentiating Mizuho from our competitors. In April 2021, we established Mizuho Research & Technologies,  which  consolidates  and integrates our research, consulting, and IT development into a single core group company for non-financial functions. Mizuho Research & Technologies has knowledge and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexperience in consulting and IT implementation in the fields of digital transformation and sustainability transformation.\n\nIt will exercise such non-financial capabilities not only in providing consulting services directly to clients but also in synergizing with our in-house companies' strategies to create and capture new value chains across the financial and non-financial spectrum. Further, it will apply these non-financial capabilities to new business arising from open innovation with external partners.\n\nOn that note, our deep understanding of our customers is what enables us to go beyond the conventional boundaries of finance. In the case of our retail customers, this is our ability to offer advice tailored to each individual's personal goals and life plans in an age of longer lifespans. In the case of our corporate clients, this is our industry insight, including cross-sector insight, and our expertise in building convincing corporate and business strategies. In May 2021, we reorganized our branch network to have separate operational frameworks for retail customers and corporate clients, establishing a structure for responding to customers' unique needs in a more specialized way. In addition, we reorganized our industry-specific operational frameworks for banking and securities, which serve large corporate clients, into five industry groups composed of industries with mutual affinities. As our clients shift to business structures spanning multiple industries, we will also further enhance our perspective on inter-industry activity and further advance our business model as a financial services group.\n\nFor example, we will sharpen our insight both into individual industries and inter-industry activity and further cultivate our dialogue with the senior management of large corporations. Leveraging our research and consulting functions, we will discuss with our clients the post-COVID-19 business challenges of business structure transformation and new business expansion and offer them support from the strategy design phase, standing upstream, so to speak. By holding these discussions with an eye to how we can assist in turning such strategies into action, we will also be able to provide optimal financial services when our clients come to the implementation phases of their strategies. Drawing on our collective strength will enable us to positively contribute to our clients' entire value chains, from strategy formulation to implementation, and develop partnerships that go beyond providing simple financial services.\n\nThese sorts of insights can also be helpful to our clients outside Japan. We are currently accelerating our Global 300 strategy of developing high-level relationships with the senior management of international corporations. Along with our network of offices in Asia and our base of Japanese corporate clients, our industry insight has been a great strength in sharing business strategy with our clients worldwide.\n\nWhile leveraging our non-financial capabilities to deepen our differentiation in select domains, we are also continuing to pursue new business. One example is our strategic partnerships with tech companies in industries such as IT and communications. Separately from our strategic partnerships, we are also already embarking on new business ventures inspired by our own employees' ideas.\n\nThese assorted initiatives are one way we are strongly differentiating ourselves from our competitors in responding to our customers' changing needs in the pandemic and post-pandemic eras. We will connect them to our creation of value going forward and continue making steady progress towards achieving our business plan.",

        "page_content": "## Making sustainability a core part of Mizuho's brand\n\nThe global trend toward sustainability is an irreversible structural change. Within this trend, climate change is a crucial global issue which threatens to impact the stability of financial markets, an issue which we see as requiring action from society, our customers, and ourselves.\n\nAt Mizuho, we are approaching sustainability as a core part of our strategy. In particular, in light of the external business environment, we have identified key sustainability areas (materiality) based on society's expectations in these areas and their importance for Mizuho, and we are incorporating these into specific initiatives in the course of formulating business strategy and targets at in-house companies and units, while also taking risks and opportunities into account.\n\nOur basic approach to promoting sustainability is dialogue, also known as engagement. There are multiple reasons for this.\n\nFor example, the transition to a low-carbon society has been drawing greater attention recently, and in our relationships with clients who are facing issues in this regard we have been focusing on engagement rather than divestment. In other words, we are not simply considering whether or not to reduce our credit exposure. We are first holding dialogue with clients across multiple sessions, driven by a constructive purpose, as a way of working together with them towards a low-carbon society. That is the approach we have chosen.\n\nHere as well our non-financial capabilities are key to differentiating Mizuho. We apply our understanding of industry characteristics and of our clients to this dialogue, our experience and knowledge in sustainability transformation to the development of decarbonization roadmaps, and our financial functions to support for specific initiatives. In doing so we are utilizing our support functions from upstream to downstream in order to both create business opportunities and enhance risk management.\n\nThere are other reasons for engagement: dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders and improvement of disclosure. In June 2021, we published our second TCFD Report. Over the last year, we have revised our Environmental Policy to clarify our support for the objective of the Paris Agreement, enhanced our environmental management in our financing and investment activity, produced estimates as a first step towards measurement and management of Scope 3 emissions, and strengthened our environmental and social management of our suppliers, among other advancements. By proactively disclosing such information, we are promoting dialogue with all of our stakeholders.\n\nWe will continue to promote sustainability as part of our strategy going forward, with the aim of becoming our clients' primary partner for sustainability consulting. In our dialogue with stakeholders, we will gain their understanding and work with them together towards decarbonization. By establishing sustainability as part of Mizuho's brand, we will positively contribute to the sustainable development and prosperity of the economy, industry, and society both in Japan and around the world and to environmental conservation, in turn positively contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n## Continuous enhancement of our people and organization\n\nOur people are an absolutely vital aspect of the implementation of these strategies. Personnel who have a range of expertise and can be relied on by customers are indispensable. In our HR strategy, we are putting in place a foundation for development, evaluation, compensation, workplace environments, and flexible work styles which enable all of our employees to fully maintain their health and safety, expand their areas of responsibility in line with their expertise, and achieve professional growth. We are also further accelerating diversity and inclusion, such as women's advancement, so that all employees are able to take pride in their work, exercise their abilities to the utmost, and improve productivity.\n\nUnder our HR management, we are supporting career development while placing emphasis on areas of expertise, allowing employees to experience related divisions, such as the IT systems and customer divisions or the products and industry research and customer divisions, in a cross-divisional fashion. We are also more proactively hiring midcareer professionals in an effort to bring in new perspectives. Personnel evaluations have changed over to a dialogue format and are encouraging independent action and growth on the part of each employee.",

Simultaneously, we are endeavoring across the group to further enhance our ability to act as a unified organization not limited by rules and the scope of duties.\n\nThis requires transformation in behaviors. In tandem with introducing mechanisms to reinforce horizontal, vertical, and diagonal communication and raise our ability to act as a unified organization, we will strengthen the effectiveness of our in-house company system and our system for dual-hat assignments between Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, and other entities. An example of this within executive management is our integrating the senior managing executive officer and managing executive officer levels to simplify the vertical layers of the organization. For employees, we will create mechanisms that allow for easy communication on a daily basis -and urgent communication when required for emergencies -between branches, branches and Head Office, and departments within Head Office, and we will allocate personnel for this effort.\n\nWe will also review our internal rule-making and our everyday communication methods. For example, we will institute rules to positively assess constructive proposals and recommendations rather than negatively assessing administrative mistakes. We will consider a 'discussion-first' communication style founded on sharing the overall situation and discussion points prior to preparing comprehensive and precise documents.\n\nWithin Mizuho are a number of business segments, each with their own roles and expertise. Some of these depend on trial and error, and others depend on steady and reliable operations. Through our initiatives, every one of our employees will renew their day-to-day perspective and dedication for our customers and society, while fully accounting for their business segment and the nature of their work, and apply these to maintain consistently swift operational management. I will lead these efforts and ensure they take root throughout the organization.\n\n## In conclusion: Continuous growth, together with our customers and society\n\nFor our customers and society, fiscal 2021 is a critical year to determine the path to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and to carry out overarching structural changes oriented towards the post-pandemic era. It is also the third year of our 5-Year Business Plan, an important year for us to steadily deepen our ongoing initiatives, enhance our people and organization, and connect them to continuous growth.\n\nWe will become an even more essential and reliable partner, striding into the future in step with our customers and society. All of us will put forth our best effort to pursue these objectives as a united group. We appreciate your continued support and understanding and will do everything in our power to exceed your expectations.\n\nJuly 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMember of the Board of Directors President & Group CEO Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are keenly aware of the need to take steps overall as an organization to fundamentally prevent further incidents so that this type of situation does not happen again.\n\nTo ensure that our customers can reliably engage in transactions with Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Financial Group and Mizuho Bank will pursue efforts as an overall organization to strengthen multilayer responsive capabilities in the event of system failures by bolstering initiatives concerning IT systems and response to customers & crisis management and integrating these activities dynamically and cross-divisionally with the aim of preventing further incidents. These actions will be based on thorough reflection on past system failure incidents and of recommendations from the System Failure Special Investigative Committee, which was established on March 17, 2021 to ensure that the issues which occurred in this recent incident are addressed in a fundamental and sustainable way.\n\n## 1. Summary of incidents\n\nThe latest situation involved four system failures over a short period of time, specifically occurring on February 28, March 3, March 7, and March 12 of 2021.\n\n## (1) February 28\n\nDue to implementation of e-account bulk change processing for the Mizuho e-account service on February 28, 2021, the final Sunday of the month, all update processing involving access to the time deposits system was disabled, and this led to retention of bankbooks and cards in ATMs that accessed this system and prevented transactions involving time deposits in Mizuho Direct, an online banking service. The impact of these errors widened and led to closures of ATMs and subsequently Mizuho Direct processing sections. This triggered many errors in ATM transactions and other activities besides time deposits and numerous instances of ATMs failing to return inserted bankbooks and cards.\n\nThis system failure affected customers through (1) suspension of ATM operations (as many as 4,318 machines), (2) retention of inserted bankbooks and cards at ATMs (5,244 cases), and (3) disabling of some ATM and Mizuho Direct transactions.\n\nRegarding the retention of bankbooks and cards, despite the recovery and return of some bankbooks and cards via remote operation from the ATM monitoring locations and via the direct involvement of security companies and branch employees, it was difficult to respond sufficiently, and since February 28 was a Sunday too, numerous customers were unable to retrieve their bankbooks and cards from ATMs for a lengthy amount of time. It was only possible to return retained bankbooks and cards on the same day in 1,244 cases, and returns for up to 5,152 cases took until March 7, a week after the date of the system failure, and returns for all cases required until April 22.\n\n## (2) March 3\n\nOn March 3, 2021, a network card in network equipment at a Mizuho Bank data center failed, and this problem destabilized communications for three minutes until the switch to a network card in a different system. Impacts during this period were (1) retention of inserted bankbooks and cards at ATMs (29 cases) and (2) partial failure in Numbers Lottery ticket purchase transactions via ATM or Mizuho Direct service (7 cases).\n\n## (3) March 7\n\nOn March 7, 2021, when Mizuho Bank released a program related to consumer loan products, errors occurred related to consolidated account time deposits because of a mistake in said program's design.\n\nCustomers who experienced failed time deposit transactions via ATMs or Mizuho Direct service received notification of the system failure and failed transaction and an explanation of the circumstances. We temporarily suspended some time deposit services at ATMs with the aim of preventing ATMs from retaining bankbooks and cards.",

This resulted in mainly delays in foreign currency transfer processing.\n\nDue to this incident, 263 transfers to other domestic banks did not meet the deadline for March 12 and 761 foreign currency transfers did not complete deposit notification processing during the same day. Regarding transfers, negotiations took place with the receiving banks, including the deposit date, premised on Mizuho Bank handling the back-value costs. For transfer recipients, Mizuho Bank contacted receiving parties to confirm their view of the deposit date and confirmed completion of all deposits as of March 31.\n\nConsidering the occurrence of four system failures in a short period of time, we realize the need to identify the root causes in the group's organization, based on a thorough review of the events that occurred this time along with the background and causes of past situations and measures taken to address them, and implement fundamental and sustainable measures to prevent further incidents.\n\n## 2. Cause analysis\n\nThe System Failure Special Investigative Committee conducted a detailed cause analysis of the various events and broadly reviewed not only system failure cases from 2002 and 2011 but also other system failures to investigate past incidents and identified common points with the latest occurrences.\n\nThe Investigative Report cites deficiencies in the following areas as causes of the latest series of system failures: (1) Organizational capability to respond to crisis situations, (2) IT system management (reassignment of IT personnel, preparedness to ensure stable IT system operation, and points in common with the cause of past system failures), and (3) Focus on the customer's perspective (awareness of issues regarding the ATM bankbook and card capturing mechanisms, consideration of customers' interests in regard to the response to the failures, sensitivity to the needs of ATM users). Additionally, it stipulates an underlying cause of (4) Underlying conditions or corporate culture that prevents straightforward improvement of these issues. These are the primary issues the report identifies that should be addressed through measures to prevent further incidents.\n\nWe think these points offer important guidelines that the Mizuho group should reflect into its efforts to prevent further incidents.\n\nWe accept our responsibility for the series of system failures and have clarified where responsibility lies. (As announced on June 15, 2021).\n\n## 3. Efforts to prevent further incidents at Mizuho Financial Group and Mizuho Bank\n\nConsidering the cause analysis presented by the System Failure Special Investigative Committee, Mizuho Financial Group and Mizuho Bank think it is necessary to go beyond just surface-level and formal actions in our efforts to prevent further incidents and aim to enhance our multilayered system failure response capabilities as an overall organization with awareness of customer convenience and social infrastructure stability through ensuring that horizontal and vertical communication are conducted effectively (including branches and Head Office).\n\nIn essence, we intend to build frameworks to strengthen system failure response capabilities in a multilayered way for the purpose of preventing system failure occurrence and ensuring early detection and recovery if failures do occur in the IT system divisions, in addition to ensuring early detection of system failures and efforts to minimize the impact on customers in the divisions responsible or responding to customers and crisis management. We also plan to build a multilayered defense framework that minimizes impact on customers in the event of a crisis by centrally managing the abovementioned functions flexibly. This will be achieved through contingency planning on both the IT system and business side involving training drills, organizational preparation, personnel, and other aspects.\n\nAdditionally, we intend to pursue continuous enhancement of our people and organization from the perspective of ensuring the efficacy of this multilayered system failure response capability and fundamentally resolving root issues throughout the entire organization that lead to issues in our IT systems and response to customers & crisis management.",

However, the Committee advises that it is not enough to change the organization, rules, and procedures superficially and formally, but rather it is essential to also ensure the effectiveness and continuity of the measures. All members of executive management are committed to taking action in line with this valuable advice.\n\n## 4. Stance in future efforts\n\nMizuho Financial Group and Mizuho Bank plan to have their executive management clarify what should be targeted in the measures to prevent further incidents of IT system failures to ensure efficacy and continuity in light of their fundamental roles and responsibilities and involve all executive officers and employees in the pursuit of these goals.\n\n- \u00b7  Recognizing the seriousness of the recent system failure incidents, Mizuho Financial Group intends to formulate basic policies for the group (group-wide HR system operations, IT system failure training drills basic policy, etc.), allocate necessary corporate resources, and horizontally deploy actions at other group companies related to the recent system failures from the standpoint of ensuring suitable operations as a group. As Mizuho Bank's managing company, Mizuho Financial Group also plans to manage and supervise progress at Mizuho Bank in regard to measures to prevent further incidents.\n- \u00b7  As the entity with jurisdiction of MINORI and which is in charge of development, operation, and management of the system in addition to being a provider of a variety of financial services to customers under Mizuho Financial Group management, Mizuho Bank aims to strengthen multilayered system failure response capabilities with the goal of ensuring efficacy from the customer perspective in the full range of the above-mentioned prevention measures through rigorous implementation within frontline operations, including at group companies (outsourcing partners), and will promote cross-organizational knowledge retention through continuous drill exercises and training.\n\nTo reliably and rapidly implement the above-mentioned system failure response measures, we established the System Failure Improvement Promotion Committee headed by Mizuho Financial Group and Mizuho Bank president and CEOs.\n\nFrom a management supervision standpoint, Mizuho Financial Group has already established the System Failure Response Evaluation Committee comprised of only outside directors. It intends to shift the role and objective of this Committee from 'cause discovery and assessing the suitability of measures to prevent further incidents' to 'supervising the implementation of measures to prevent further incidents' and continue addressing the recent incidents. Additionally, Mizuho Bank, which is the entity implementing the full range of prevention measures, has established a similar committee comprised of outside and internal directors.\n\nIn order to meet the expectations of our customers and stakeholders, we will reaffirm our role as a financial institution and ensure that all members of the organization work together with commitment and responsibility toward preventing further incidents and connect these efforts to Mizuho's continuous growth.",

In 2019 with the launch of the 5-Year Business Plan, at a time when the shape of finance was greatly evolving, Mizuho was resolving on its next step while also improving its capital and earnings power. Then, as we entered fiscal 2020, we were unexpectedly faced with the pandemic and our major concern was whether it would truly be possible to achieve the objectives of the 5-Year Business Plan. Now, as we reflect on the results, there are two major points to note.\n\nThe first is the role that finance plays in society. In particular, the pandemic has prompted us to reaffirm the importance of financial institutions' traditional role. It was clear that it acted as a major support structure during this tumultuous time.\n\nThe other point is that Mizuho's results for fiscal 2020 exceeded the initial estimates in the 5-Year Business Plan. This is due to the steady progress on reforms which were an organization-wide focus, including efforts to strengthen corporate foundations. This is not only my belief but also that of the other directors.\n\nSakai As you mentioned, in formulating the 5-Year Business Plan we were aware of the need to constantly update ourselves amidst structural changes in the business environment, and so we decided to implement structural reforms in three areas-to our business model, the corporate foundations that support it, and finance. In fiscal 2019, the first fiscal year of the plan, I would say it went well overall. Fiscal 2020 was a crucial point at which our overall initiatives would finally take root. Of course the pandemic occurred just at that moment, but there are also two points I would like to reflect on regarding fiscal 2020.\n\nThe first is that structural changes have only accelerated as a result of COVID-19. Looking ahead to the post-COVID-19 era, we are beginning to see a variety of developments and changes to megatrends which are particularly impactful on our business, such as digitalization, an aging population and declining birthrate, and globalization.",

        "page_content": "The second point is that, as you mentioned in regards to the role of finance, amidst all these changes there are some things that remain constant, and the true value of financial institutions is one thing that has been reaffirmed. I believe that financial functions which serve as a lifeline for corporations and people's lifestyles are a true form of lasting value. There was an urgent and large-scale rise in demand for financing outside Japan during the January to March period of 2020 and in Japan during the April to June period of 2020; however, unlike the 2008 global financial crisis, the financial system remained robust. At Mizuho, early on we recognized that this was a time for us to commit to returning to our fundamental mission and fulfilling our role as a financial institution. We were also able to use this as an opportunity to advance our transition to the different business models which we had envisioned.\n\nFor example, providing quasi-equity financing as a strategic domain within our business targeting large corporations. When client demand was suddenly rising due to the effects of the pandemic, we fully leveraged our understanding of clients' businesses and our industry insight in order to not only support clients' cash flow needs but also to support them in terms of capital where necessary. I think that among financial institutions, our reaction was especially swift. By supporting companies in their time of need, we deepened our relationships with clients and further accelerated our strategic initiatives. These efforts formed a new foundation for our relationship with our clients, and with their understanding, we were able to make more progress than expected on reducing cross-shareholdings, including those held in our retirement benefit trust.\n\nAll members of the organization around the world came together through these efforts to realize our strategic initiatives, and this enabled us to enhance our fundamental earnings power.\n\nKobayashi  Exactly, Mizuho was able to transition the role it should fulfill as a part of the social infrastructure, for example by switching the anchor of a client relationship from cross-shareholdings to quasi-equity financing. I think this was a year in which we began to see the emergence of a single next-generation model for financial services unique to Mizuho as the company leveraged its capabilities in digital, fintech, industry insight, and other areas.\n\n## Bringing prosperity to society: Mizuho's expected role\n\nSakai The major trend towards sustainability has also been affected by COVID-19 and a wide range of themes are becoming apparent. Sustainability is linked to the underlying issue of the expansion of economic disparity and social inequity, as well as to geopolitical issues and the destabilization of the global order. Under our 5-Year Business Plan, we are directly addressing these facets of the global agenda.\n\nAs global interest in the environment and climate change is rising significantly, governments around the world are strengthening their response, including Japan which has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050. Sustainability is now one of the top priorities for corporate management. At Mizuho, when we discuss management and business strategy with our clients, sustainability is the first thing we consider.\n\nWe want to deliver benefits to our customers and other stakeholders, as set forth in our Corporate Philosophy and embodied in the name Mizuho, which evokes images of a 'bountiful harvest of rice' in Japanese. We have built in to our strategy a range of sustainability issues and challenges in order to minimize risk and maximize business opportunities, an approach which has points in common with the thinking behind stakeholder capitalism, a concept which has been gaining traction recently.\n\nKobayashi  Yes, sustainability is built into Mizuho's business and is at the core of its growth model. And the success of Mizuho's business activities brings prosperity to society. I think that all executives, regardless of the industry or company, are currently grappling with how to synchronize and synergize sustainability with their business and make it a source of growth for their company and of benefit for their stakeholders. This is what newly emerging business models seek to achieve. In this regard, Mizuho has taken the initiative in building such a business model and has been conducting dialogue with its clients since the early stages. My impression is that, as a result, a wide range of stakeholders now have an understanding of Mizuho's thinking and business model. As sustainability is becoming even more crucial, cooperation and collaboration with stakeholders is likely to become easier to pursue.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that a customized approach to sustainability on the frontlines of our business will be an important task going forward. Currently, there is a movement towards creating a globally consistent standard for evaluating sustainability, but sustainability can intrinsically vary depending on the natural environment and social environment in each country or region, so it is not necessarily globally homogenous. The thinking is that, even when",

        "page_content": "aimed at the same goal, sustainability initiatives may differ between countries and regions, and ultimately form a cycle that is positive on a global basis. In that sense, it is essential for employees on the frontlines to proactively think, act, and deliver in line with what is best for their local environment and society in order for Mizuho to bring prosperity, as you mentioned. This is especially challenging, but that is why it is worth accomplishing.\n\nSakai Although there are common global goals such as those in the Paris Agreement, the steps taken to achieve them will vary depending on economic and social circumstances and values, or on access to resources and other such factors. There will also be differences in industrial policy, including energy policy, and in corporate action. With this in mind, we can enhance the steps toward and feasibility of reaching these common global goals through a harmonious approach. I think that a customized approach to sustainability, as you mentioned, can be a source of added value for Mizuho.\n\nKobayashi  Certainly if you consider sustainability in terms of a product-oriented or market-oriented philosophy, a 'one size fits all' product-oriented approach does not work. A customized approach containing multiple traditionally recognizable elements is the most easily accepted, and each client requires advice and solutions that fit the social environment they operate in. I think that Mizuho has a major role to play in that respect.\n\nSakai With a firm understanding of the many variances between different countries and regions, we aim to support industry and business transformation which is both feasible and aligned with the local economy and society. As for Mizuho, we are drawing on our research and consulting capabilities as well as industry insight to communicate with our clients' executive management, relevant authorities, and others in order to act as a catalyst. We will start to further develop these initiatives going forward.\n\nKobayashi  I think that Mizuho can fully utilize the value it has built up in order to differentiate itself. In terms of securing both its own value and stakeholders' understanding, I think Mizuho is in a good position and can focus on non-financial value and fully leveraging it in order to transform business models.\n\nAlso, in terms of the connection between a prosperous society and business development, I think there are more ways that Mizuho can contribute indirectly. For example, in the sense of bringing prosperity to each individual, including those who are not Mizuho customers, Mizuho's role is not limited to direct finance but includes contributing to the sound development of companies, which is a vital element of a stable society. A kind of virtuous cycle can be formed as Mizuho provides services and shares knowledge, in addition to finance, through a range of channels.\n\nSakai We are not only providing funding, products, and services but also support with a human touch. We also facilitate corporate networking, including assisting innovative startups and providing business matching, which is one aspect of our 'Open & Connected' action principle. Using the channels and networks we have formed from financial transactions, we support clients' new business development, as you mentioned, and this in turn plays a role in job creation within society. Our role is to be a supportive presence for our clients and society from multiple angles based on our trustworthiness and reliability.\n\nKobayashi  From the perspective of ensuring that Mizuho remains just such a presence, the issues brought to the forefront by the recent IT system failures are important to address. Apart from IT related issues, what I feel is that the organization has yet to fully utilize the diversity of its people. I am not referring only to diversity in terms of gender, nationality, or similar but also to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe unique qualities of each individual, their areas of specialty versus areas of inexperience, or in other words diversity of perspective. I believe that Mizuho is strong when everyone is working together towards a shared objective. However, when something irregular occurs, Mizuho is weak when it comes to exercising the capabilities of the organization by ensuring each individual looks at the issue from different angles and acts independently. Of course, this is not something that can be completely changed within a year or two. It is necessary to steadily and repeatedly affirm the need for change within the organization as well as to make it a habit for executive management to always consider how meaning can change when something is viewed from a different angle. Mizuho has many strengths, including in non-financial areas, and whether these strengths are put into practice depends on the capabilities of its people. Leveraging Mizuho's diversity will surely draw out the organization's strengths.",

To realize this, the basic foundation for our efforts is to enhance our people and organization, and diversity in the broader sense is a necessary part of this. As we move forward with a range of initiatives, with the aim of better understanding our customers and society we will seek to proactively develop a broader perspective of our ways of doing things and our role, in part through utilizing externally hired talent and enabling each individual to consider a range of perspectives and to move in the directions that seem most promising. As for our objectives in terms of diversity, there is no single answer and it is not something executive management can simply give orders on.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will create a variety of frameworks enabling executive management to encourage and support the efforts of each member of the organization. As a result, all employees will be able to take the initiative, further align themselves with our customers and society, adopt a more positive approach, and move forward with confidence and pride. Together, executive management and employees can foster this kind of organization and corporate culture.\n\nKobayashi  What is important is that each employee is motivated day-to-day, in a certain sense, simply by enjoying their jobs. There are many potential sources for this enjoyment-being thanked by a customer, being the one to solve an issue that everyone was struggling with, or feeling the value that one brings to the organization, which creates confidence. And when members of the organization are enjoying themselves, customers will feel this enthusiasm too. What is important is to create an environment where being a part of this company is enjoyable and each individual can consider how to approach their work in a way that makes it enjoyable. I believe this can be a catalyst for transforming the organization. I hope you will foster that kind of environment.\n\nSakai There are many such initiatives we would like to implement going forward. As you said, the organization and its people, as well as corporate culture, are things that cannot change overnight, but encouraging confidence and fostering enjoyment, as well as diverse perspectives and a willingness to see things from a different angle, these are changes that I will work to effect within the organization.\n\n## Achieving continuous growth\n\nKobayashi  Mizuho's strategies and its ability to realize them as well as its financial situation are both at a level where we can hold a certain degree of confidence. Its central role in society has become clearer as a result of the pandemic. The areas where Mizuho still has work to do and must make a greater effort have also become clearer following the series of IT system failures. If consistent progress can be made in regards to these three areas, I believe that Mizuho can truly become stronger as an organization as well as in terms of its business model.\n\nIn the remaining three years of the 5-Year Business Plan, enhancing the organization and its people must be a priority, in addition to achieving financial performance goals. By facing and overcoming this challenge, Mizuho can build a truly robust foundation for the years beyond the end of the current business plan. 2021 will be the year to prove this. In terms of Mizuho's social mission, amidst the pandemic we are not only being tested in terms of financial capabilities but also on whether our services are truly useful to society. The remaining three years of the 5-Year Business Plan will surely be very challenging and a crucial juncture for Mizuho, but also a period with a lot to look forward to.\n\nSakai In order to achieve continued growth within the current environment, we must ensure a win-win relationship with our stakeholders. To accomplish this, we not only need to become stronger from a fiscal perspective but also enhance and fully draw on our financial and non-financial capabilities through our expanding role in society. In doing so, we can deliver benefits to our stakeholders as embodied in the name 'Mizuho' and its original meaning. We need to reconsider the role we have fulfilled thus far and concretely determine what we want to achieve going forward. In step with our customers, society, and our employees, we can work towards future continuous growth. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me today.",

        "page_content": "Income Attributable to Mizuho Financial Group by \u00a522.4 billion year-on-year to \u00a5471 billion.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio, which indicates financial soundness, was 9.1%, reaching our 5-Year Business Plan target of the lower end of the 9 - 10% range during the second year of the plan.\n\nDividends per share were \u00a575, matching our estimate at the beginning of the fiscal year based on the shareholder return policy through fiscal 2020 and in light of the performance of Net Income Attributable to Mizuho Financial Group.\n\n## Progress on finance structure reforms\n\nIn our 5-Year Business Plan that began in fiscal 2019, we aim to transition to the next generation of financial services by implementing structural reforms in the three interconnected areas of business, finance, and corporate foundations. Particularly for finance structure reforms, in addition to evaluating the efficiency of returns on invested corporate resources for each business area based on risk & return and cost & return, we are reallocating corporate resources with a focus on the stability and growth potential of revenue as well. It is through such initiatives that we aim to further strengthen our stable revenue base and continue building our business portfolio to align with growth areas.\n\n## Risk & return (gross profits ROE)\n\nToward improving risk & return, we worked to shift corporate resources from less-profitable business areas to high-profit business areas while also diligently and consistently proceeding with negotiations with individual clients to improve profitability. I would like to explain the results of these efforts in detail, namely the improvement in the loan spread outside Japan and the reduction of cross-shareholdings.\n\nWith regard to client relations outside Japan, we advanced our Global 300 strategy and built a portfolio that focuses on nonJapanese blue-chip companies with a high credit profile. However, due to the highly competitive environment, there were also transactions that failed to lead to expanded ancillary transactions, leaving them at a low level of profitability. To address this, we reviewed our invested corporate resources, evaluating the potential for future improvements in the profitability of transactions with each company. Such continual efforts resulted in the achievement of a 0.99% loan spread outside Japan in the second half of fiscal 2020, up significantly from 0.80% two years ago and 0.82% one year ago.\n\nRegarding the reduction in cross-shareholdings, for which we established a target to reduce cross-shareholdings by \u00a5300 billion over three years through the end of fiscal 2021, we have made steady progress through sincere dialogue with clients, selling a total amount of \u00a5219.4 billion (a total reduction of \u00a5252.1 billion including impairment losses) over two years. In our shift from business relationships dependent on cross-shareholdings, we are reforming our business structure while simultaneously improving risk & return. This is being accomplished through such means as investing, over a span of two years, approximately \u00a50.8 trillion of the resources secured from reducing cross-shareholdings into quasi-equity loans or preferred stock that facilitate the business structure transformation of clients.\n\n## Loan spread 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Of which, - \u00a5219.4 billion from sales (Progress rate: 73%)\n\n## Cost & return (expense ratio)\n\nAs structural changes progress, including the declining birthrate and aging population, digitalization, and the prolongation of the low interest rate environment, the most pressing issue regarding cost & return is transforming the cost structure of our retail business in Japan to a structure balanced with revenue. In addition to transitioning toward an appropriate business structure for the coming era, including with our IT systems, operations, and channels, we have also reviewed our sales framework to be more closely aligned with the diversifying needs of clients.\n\nIt is through such initiatives that we achieved Net Business Profits of \u00a542.5 billion for the Retail & Business Banking Company in fiscal 2020, a \u00a530.3 billion increase year-on-year, and we are setting the stage to continue the trend of growing profits.\n\n- For information about the progress of the fundamental structural reforms, refer to P36.",

        "page_content": "## Stable revenue and upside revenue\n\nFinancial business involves a profit structure with profit levels that fluctuate largely with the business environment, including with interest rates, foreign exchange rates, stock prices, and other economic trends. In considering our business portfolio, it is crucial that we strengthen our stable revenue base to be resistant to the effects of the business environment while also establishing a foundation that is able to reliably capture revenue opportunities during times of strong business trends.\n\nAt Mizuho, we are monitoring the progress behind the strengthening of our revenue base and the restructuring of our business portfolio by analyzing our Consolidated Net Business Profits divided into stable revenue and upside revenue.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, our stable revenue increased by \u00a559 billion yearon-year to \u00a5370 billion, resulting mainly from factors such as increased loans and improved loan spreads amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a reduction in costs focused on the Retail & Business Banking Company. In fiscal 2021, we anticipate our stable revenue to surpass the \u00a5380 billion level recorded prior to the introduction of the negative interest rate policy in fiscal 2015.\n\nOur upside revenue in fiscal 2020 was \u00a5295 billion, reaching the \u00a5270 billion planned for the final year of the 5-Year Business Plan three years ahead of schedule. On top of the strong performance in capital markets-related business both in and outside Japan, our asset management business also trended favorably on the back of rising stock prices, among other factors, allowing us to fully capture the strong tailwinds. Although revenue will fluctuate depending on the business environment, the strength of our fundamental earnings power is steadily on the rise.\n\nAs a result, our total Consolidated Net Business Profits exceeded the \u00a5700 billion third year target of the 5-Year Business Plan one year in advance at \u00a5799.7 billion.\n\n## Fiscal 2021 financial management\n\nFiscal 2021 will be a crucial year as a midway point in our 5-Year Business Plan, in which we deepen the initiatives that we have implemented so far and link them to continuous growth. While preparing ourselves thoroughly for the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic continuing, resulting in a prolonged economic downturn, we will steadily advance finance structure reforms to ensure that we meet our fiscal 2023 goals.\n\n## Fiscal 2021 earnings plans\n\nWith the exceedingly strong fiscal 2020 performance of capital markets-related business leveling off, we anticipate a drop in Consolidated Net Business Profits centered on markets divisions. However, as a result of the advancement of our structural reforms to enhance stable revenue, including the improvement of lending income among other enhancements, we expect only a slight decline from fiscal 2020 with a Consolidated Net Business Profits estimate of \u00a5790 billion.\n\nWe expect Credit-related Costs to decrease to -\u00a5100 billion, halving the amount on a year-on-year basis, as reserves were set to the greatest extent possible for credit risks from fiscal 2021 onward on a forward-looking basis in the fiscal 2020 financial results. Although reserves have been recorded financially, as we expect the difficult business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue primarily in Japan for some time, we will continue to ensure thorough credit management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Estimates for fiscal 2021 annual\n\n## CET1 Capital Ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndividends will be maintained at \u00a575 per share of common stock, unchanged from fiscal 2020.

This business plan aims to build a stronger and more resilient financial group which our customers can depend on in the coming era.\n\nIn addition to the megatrends such as digitalization, the declining birthrate and aging population, and globalization, the global spread of COVID-19 has triggered major, rapid changes in people's lifestyles and the state of the economy and society. In order to be a company that provides new value that goes beyond the conventional boundaries of finance in the coming era, we will steadily implement forward-looking structural reforms in three interconnected areas as we transition to the next generation of financial services.\n\n## Summary of initiatives up until fiscal 2020\n\nThe 5-Year Business Plan is composed of two phases. In the three-year period from fiscal 2019 to 2021 we will focus on the full implementation of the structural reforms, building the foundations for the next generation of financial services.\n\nWe have been making steady progress on the strategies outlined in the 5-Year Business Plan since the first year. In the second year (fiscal 2020), when faced with the unprecedented changes in the business environment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we further advanced our strategies and achieved strong performance, exceeding our initial targets. As for our financial results, Consolidated Net Business Profits for fiscal 2020 were \u00a5799.7 billion. In customer divisions, we surpassed our performance for fiscal 2015, the last fiscal year before the introduction of negative interest rates in Japan, reaching the highest level of profits since the introduction of our in-house company system in fiscal 2016. Additionally, we significantly exceeded the 5-Year Business Plan's initial target of \u00a5700 billion for fiscal 2021, reaching this level a year in advance.\n\nIn order to maintain the momentum of this growth, it is essential that we align ourselves with customers' needs amidst the pandemic as well as in the new world which will emerge after the pandemic, steadily advancing business structure reforms in order to build new partnerships with our customers. Fiscal 2021, the third year of the 5-Year Business Plan, is a crucial year for us to further advance the steady progress we are making on our initiatives and connect them to continued growth. While adeptly responding to changing customer needs, we will steadily advance our structural reforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our basic policy is to realize the wishes and hopes of our retail customers and the continued growth of our corporate clients, working to build a sustainable retail business which is responsive to the needs of our customers in this new era. As we implement structural reforms in three interconnected areas-business structure, finance structure, and corporate foundations-we will create new value in both finance and non-finance domains by focusing the allocation of our corporate resources on enhancements including for digital marketing in a way that enables us to better respond to customer needs, as well as on new business areas through alliances with other companies.\n\nAs structural changes in customer needs accelerate, recently society as a whole has been undergoing considerable changes including changes to people's lifestyles and the increasing adoption of remote technology. In such times, retail customers are in need of support for designing their lives in an era of increased longevity. And among SMEs and middle market clients, there is increasing demand for solutions in areas such as business structure transformation and growth support, in light of the uncertain business environment. It is essential that we fully respond to these changing needs and advance initiatives to address the accelerating use of online communication. Amidst these changes in the business environment, we must seek to take advantage of these changes in customer needs in order to create new business opportunities while also allocating our finite corporate resources in a way that enables us to establish a stable revenue base.\n\n## Trends in performance\n\nIn fiscal 2020, amid challenges such as a decline in consumption and investment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved Net Business Profits exceeding that of the previous fiscal year. This was the result of improving our top line, including in corporate and retail investment business, as well as measures such as a reduction of expenses achieved through our steady implementation of structural reforms. We will continue enhancing structural reforms in order to reduce fixed costs and expand our stable revenue base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Based on our awareness that climate change is one of the most crucial global issues having the potential to impact the stability of financial markets, we have positioned addressing climate change as a key part of our corporate strategy and have bolstered various initiatives as a result of numerous discussions at bodies including the Executive Management Committee, Risk Committee, and the Board of Directors. Our main progress in fiscal 2020 is as below.\n\n- Main progress on TCFD Recommendations in fiscal 2020\n\n| Board of Directors following deliberation at the Executive Management Committee.

We have assessed risk along two axes-our clients' sectors and our clients' measures to address transition risk-in order to identify high-risk areas (figure below; to be managed as a monitoring indicator going forward).\n\nMapping of risk assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExposure in carbon-related sectors is \u00a512.8 trillion, representing 5.5% of overall exposure, and within this amount exposure in high-risk areas composes \u00a51.8 trillion (both figures are as of March 2021).\n\n## Response policy for high-risk areas\n\nWe are more thoroughly engaging with clients to support them in formulating effective strategies for their transition risks, in disclosing their progress, and in embarking on business structure transformation towards a lower risk sector at an early stage. In undertaking such engagement with our clients, if a client does not make progress on addressing their transition risks even after a certain period of time, we carefully consider our transactions with the client. In this way, we are enhancing our risk control and reducing our exposure in high-risk areas over the medium to long term.\n\n## New indicators and targets, Scope 3 emission measures\n\n## Climate change-related indicators and targets\n\n- \u00b7 Set new target to reduce the Mizuho group's 1 worldwide Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 2\n- \u00b7 Reduce the FY2019 amount by 35% by FY2030\n- \u00b7 Aim to become carbon neutral by FY2050\n- \u00b7 Revised target to reduce the outstanding credit balance for coal-fired power generation facilities\n- \u00b7  Reduce the FY2019 amount by 50% by FY2030, and achieve an outstanding credit balance of zero by FY2040\n\n## Measurement and management of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 3 from financing and investment\n\n- \u00b7 As a first step toward Scope 3 measurement, estimated greenhouse gas emission intensity (basic units) in relation to project finance for power generation projects, based on the Financial Sector ScienceBased Targets Guidance and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry\n- \u00b7 Plan to set medium- to long-term targets for Scope 3 emissions by the end of fiscal 2022 and gradually expand scope of measurement\n- \u00b7 Became the first Japanese financial institution to join the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, a global initiative to develop an accounting standard for indirect greenhouse gas emissions from financial institutions' financing and investment (July 2021)\n- 1.  Eight group companies (Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, Mizuho Securities, Mizuho Research & Technologies, Asset Management One, Mizuho Private Wealth Management, and Mizuho Americas).\n- 2.  Scope 1: Direct emissions of greenhouse gases from company-owned or -controlled sources (such as from burning of fuel). Scope 2: Indirect emissions of greenhouse gases from the use of energy of similar resources provided by other parties.\n- 3. Scope 3: Greenhouse gas emissions from other parties involved in financial institutions' activities.",

The current status of our response to the TCFD Recommendations is as follows.\n\n## Governance\n\nDisclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors approved and established the Environmental Policy, which clarifies our stance on climate change as we work toward transitioning to a low-carbon society. We revised our Environmental Policy in April 2021 and clarified our contribution to achieving a low-carbon society (net-zero greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050, our support for the objective of the Paris Agreement, and our phased transformation to a portfolio aligned with the targets in the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 Based on our Environmental Policy, we assess our progress on environmental initiatives, including the status of our response to the TCFD Recommendations, and other relevant information under the oversight of the Board of Directors, with consideration of the deliberations of executive management and the advice of the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 We have identified key sustainability areas, including responses to climate change, and incorporated them into our 5-Year Business Plan, based on deliberation by our Executive Management Committee and Board of Directors. These enable us to advance our sustainability initiatives as an integral part of our strategy.\n\nStrategy\n\nDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.\n\n- \u00b7 We have identified the following climate-related risks and opportunities and impacts on business activities. We have further strengthened our structure for promoting sustainable business group-wide, with engagement as our starting point, to support the transition to a low-carbon society. We conduct appropriate risk management based on international concerns, trends, and other factors.\n\n## Opportunities for Mizuho\n\n- -  Utilizing engagement with clients as a starting point, expand business opportunities to support the transition to a lowcarbon society and climate change responses.\n- \u00b7 Provide sustainable finance, transition finance, and environmental finance.\n- \u00b7 Provide financial and non-financial solutions that meet the diverse needs of clients.\n- - Enhance our reputation in society through strengthened climate change response and proactive disclosure.\n\n## Risks for Mizuho\n\n- -  Our transition risks include credit risk related to financing and investment clients who are impacted by more stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations, or other policies or by delays in shifting to new technologies. Our transition risks also include operational risk related to reputational damage from financing fossil fuel projects.\n- -  Our physical risks include both acute risks, consisting of operational risk related to the possibility of extreme weather causing damage to our assets and similar risk of damage to customer assets, and chronic risks, consisting of credit risk arising from deterioration in the macro economy due to increased instances of infectious disease, heatstroke, and similar.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\n- Transition risk\n\n| Scenario                             | International Energy Agency (IEA)'s World Energy Outlook 2020 Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) 1  / Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Analysis method                      | We analyzed changes in Mizuho's credit costs by formulating an outlook for the impact on clients' financial results, based on changes to the parameter under  the scenario.

We determine related indicators which require monitoring as well as risk control measures. Reports on the status of our response are made to the Board of Directors and other bodies.\n\n## Enhanced response to transition risks\n\n- -  Based on the results of our FY2019 scenario analysis, we strengthened engagement with clients (undertook engagement with approximately 900 clients from the perspective of responsible financing and investment and, among these, in-depth engagement with approximately 70 large credit and similar clients).\n- -  Strengthened risk management by improving risk control in carbon-related sectors and revising our Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity (enhanced it to further address climate change, biodiversity, and human rights).\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climaterelated risks and opportunities where such information is material.\n\n## Targets\n\n- - Sustainable finance & Environmental finance targets:\n- FY2019 - FY2030 total: \u00a525 trillion (of which the target for environmental finance is \u00a512 trillion)\n- -  Target to reduce the outstanding credit balance for coal-fired power generation facilities based on our Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity:\n- Reduce the FY2019 amount by 50% by FY2030, and achieve an outstanding credit balance of zero by FY2040\n- - Target to reduce our own environmental footprint:\n- Reduce the FY2019 amount of worldwide Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from the eight group companies by 35% by FY2030, and aim to become carbon neutral by FY2050\n\n## Monitoring indicators\n\n- -  Scope 1 and Scope 2: CO2 emissions and energy usage\n- -  Scope 3: Environmental footprint from business trip-related CO2 emissions and new large-scale power generation projects (amount of contribution to CO2 emissions)\n- -  Environmental conservation associated with new large-scale power generation projects (amount of contribution to CO2 emission reductions)\n- -  Exposure to high-risk areas within transition risk sectors\n- \u00b7 As a first step toward Scope 3 measurement, we estimated greenhouse gas emission intensity (basic units) in relation to project finance for power generation projects, based on the Financial Sector Science-Based Targets Guidance and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. Going forward, we will set medium- to long-term targets for Scope 3 emissions by the end of fiscal 2022 and pursue initiatives to gradually expand the range of sectors subject to measurement and other factors.\n\n(Underlined portions indicate initiatives that we have enhanced since our previous Integrated Report released in September 2020.)\n\nPlease see our TCFD Report for more details on our initiatives responding to the TCFD Recommendations.\n\nhttps://www.mizuhogroup.com/binaries/content/assets/pdf/mizuhoglobal/sustainability/\n\noverview/report/tcfd\\_report\\_2021.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to provide safe and reliable services to our customers, it is important that we address the risks that accompany the use of digital technologies, particularly with regard to cybersecurity.\n\nAs we stated in the Declaration of Cybersecurity Management that we released in June 2018, we consider cyberattacks to be one of the top risks for our business, and have developed our management policies and declared our intentions to address cybersecurity as a management priority. Specifically, with Mizuho-CIRT 1 taking the lead, we have assigned high-level professionals and are drawing on intelligence and cutting-edge technology developed in collaboration with external specialized organizations, while also establishing a monitoring framework via integrated SOC 2 . We are also focusing on personnel development in the medium to long term together with our initiatives to strengthen our resilience frameworks, including the analysis of computer viruses and the development of defense-in-depth measures.

Additionally, in Japan, workers' perspectives are shifting away from the idea of belonging to a company with the assumption of lifetime employment, to the idea of belonging to a profession, which assumes a lifelong active role in one's field, and the focus is on increasing one's individual value.\n\nOur HR objectives also take these changes in customer needs and employee perspectives into consideration, and we aim to contribute to the sustainable growth of our corporate value by focusing thoroughly on maximizing employees' universally recognizable value and ensuring each employee can be fully engaged.\n\n## Overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Career development revolving around expertise\n\n## Career development support\n\n## Career field management\n\nThrough HR management with visualized criteria (for personnel transfers, personnel evaluations, training, etc.) and active dialogue, we will ascertain each employee's field of proficiency at an early stage and help them reach their full potential.\n\nSpecifically, each employee will define their career path by developing expertise through experience in their respective business fields, and through dialogue between the company and the employee, we will support self-directed career development with a focus on work experience in career fields where each individual can strengthen and demonstrate their expertise.\n\nAdditionally, by enabling career development that spans multiple fields, we will develop personnel who are highly specialized but also have an understanding of the big picture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result of these initiatives, the number of internal job applicants has increased significantly over the last two years. Also, the number of applicants for the concurrent assignment program, which provides opportunities for employees to be involved in other work they are interested in while maintaining their primary duties, increased 30% year-on-year to over 160 applicants.\n\nAs for external opportunities, the concurrent assignment program via which employees work some days at Mizuho and other days at another company, and the part-time work program for employees to operate their own businesses outside of work hours, have enabled around 300 employees to begin new initiatives in the year and a half since the launch of these programs. These, along with other initiatives, are steadily heightening the awareness of each employee to the importance of proactively learning and taking on challenges.\n\nFurthermore, we have also introduced 'second career' job postings and a flexible retirement age system as opportunities for middle-age and older employees to take on new challenges for the next step in their careers.\n\n## Supporting growth through personnel evaluations\n\nAs business grows increasingly complex and specialized, and as customer needs become more diverse, personnel evaluations must also be conducted with a focus on the expertise required for each type of business, and using this as criteria for personnel development will contribute to the enhancement of employees' universally recognizable value.\n\nAlso, we will increase opportunities for communication between managers and employees in the course of the evaluation process, and in addition to providing thorough feedback on issues hindering growth and the employee's actions in a 1-on-1 setting, we will focus on improving managers' skills as evaluators.\n\n## Revising the compensation system\n\nAs we promote career development that revolves around expertise, we will draw out employees' motivation and ambition and encourage proactivity by building a new compensation framework that focuses on job duties and performance based on each employee's acquisition and demonstration of expertise, rather than seniority or years of experience.\n\nAdditionally, to encourage employees' ambitions, we will strive for flexible compensation based on fair evaluations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Example of concurrent assignment outside Mizuho\n\nGain diverse perspectives and external insight\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Going forward we will continue to promote tailored labor management practices in partnership with industrial physicians.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe aim to proactively incorporate the perspectives and ideas of our diverse workforce into our everyday work, strategic planning, and decision-making in order to create new value. We are committed to valuing the voices of diverse groups including women, non-Japanese nationals, individuals with disabilities, and individuals who identify as LGBT.\n\nBy integrating diversity and inclusion (D&I) into every aspect of our HR strategy, we are increasing our efforts to fully engage our diverse workforce, promote diverse and flexible working styles, and transform the mindsets and behaviors of all employees and executive officers. (Refer to page 26 for D&I related KPI.)\n\nBy offering a systematic strategic development program for management-level personnel as a measure supporting career development for women, we are proactively supporting the development of their skills, and in June 2021 we joined the 30% Club Japan in an effort to further accelerate these initiatives. Also, in order to ensure that women can continue to develop their careers throughout different life events, we offer programs to support working parents and caregivers, remote work options, and other support systems that enable diverse and flexible work arrangements. Additionally, we are working to change mindsets throughout the organization via a range of initiatives, including encouraging 100% of applicable men to take childcare leave.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Strategic development programs for female employees   | Strategic development programs for female employees                                                      | Strategic development programs for female employees                                                             | Strategic development programs for female employees   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| General manager  equivalent                           | Cultivate an executive  management perspective in future  executive leader candidates                    | Strategic assignments  Coaching / Mentoring                                                                     | M-WIN  MIW-Net                                        |\n| Manager   equivalent                                  | Learn skills and mindsets useful  for career development and  foster an awareness of career  advancement | Leadership skills training  Enhancing assignments                                                               | Networks for women  working at Mizuho                 |\n| Supervisor  equivalent (under Supervisor  equivalent) | While cultivating their career  perspective, develop each  individual's strengths                        | Career design program   HR management tailored to the  individual (including transforming  management mindsets) | Network expansion  Access to role models              |\n|                                                       | Company-led initiatives                                                                                  | Company-led initiatives                                                                                         | Employee-led initiatives                              |\n\n## Promoting employee resource groups (ERGs)\n\nAiming to contribute to the creation of a corporate culture that facilitates new business ideas and discoveries, Mizuho supports ERGs as employee-led platforms for mutual learning.

There is growing momentum for the establishment of new ERGs, and the number of employees involved in these groups has grown to around 5,000 globally.\n\n## Mizuho Diversity & Inclusion Month\n\nMizuho Diversity & Inclusion Month is an interactive project held on a group-wide and global basis to broaden employees' connections with others as they are exposed to a wide variety of ideas and discuss and communicate while participating in events held throughout the month.\n\nFiscal 2020 was the second year for this event, which featured presentations and workshops by a range of departments across group companies, events held in collaboration with other companies, and ERG-hosted events, with a total of over 50 events held around the world on an online basis over the course of one month. A total of about 13,000 employees participated globally.\n\nWe will host Mizuho Diversity & Inclusion Month on a continued basis to transform employee mindsets and behaviors, thus encouraging the creation of new corporate value on a broad scale across the group.\n\nInteractive communication between senior management and employees (Online video streaming in Japan)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting employee health and wellness\n\nIn our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are prioritizing the health and safety of customers and employees, and in addition to basic measures such as wearing face masks, we are also encouraging remote work, ascertaining employee health on a daily basis, and making consultations available for employees.\n\nThrough these and other initiatives promoting employees' physical and mental health as well as their health literacy, we are aiming to enhance the performance of each individual and increase the productivity of the organization as a whole.\n\nIn 2021, Mizuho was recognized for the fourth consecutive year under the Health & Productivity Stock Selection for a number of initiatives, including those aimed at preventing overwork, such as encouraging the use of paid leave, as well as efforts to prevent increases in the severity of health conditions through measures such as requiring employees to receive subsequent testing in the event of irregularities in their annual health exam, and ensuring that the company subsidizes part of the cost of the subsequent testing, and offers special leave for comprehensive medical checkups and gynecological exams. We were also recognized for the way in which we pursue these goals through an integrated framework enabling collaboration between the company, health insurance providers, and occupational health services providers.\n\nMizuho was selected under the 2021 Health & Productivity Stock Selection, which is jointly administered by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our HR strategy as a foundation underpinning corporate value\n\nBy promoting the active engagement of each employee, our HR strategy aims to maximize the value that we provide to society and our customers, thoroughly address changing needs and expectations, and as a result, contribute to the sustainable growth of corporate value.\n\nAlso, in light of analysis into the cause of Mizuho Bank's series of IT system failures, we have also recognized that continuous enhancement of our people and organization is essential to foster resilience and support our multilayered system failure response capabilities.\n\nIn order to realize our objectives and address challenges, we will promote a new HR strategy which focuses thoroughly on developing each employee's field of proficiency (expertise) and maximizing their universally recognizable value.\n\nSpecifically, in addition to providing opportunities to learn and take on challenges which we have expanded thus far, through career field management we will provide a wide range of opportunities for employees to reach their full potential, and revise our personnel evaluation and compensation frameworks. As for career development, we will enable employees to accumulate experience in a wide range of fields at Mizuho and provide thorough, dialogue-based feedback while encouraging each employee to enhance and demonstrate their expertise, and proactively utilize specialist personnel who have broad perspectives.\n\nNobuhiro Kaminoyama Group Chief Human Resources Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Directors determines fundamental matters regarding the RAF, along with its management systems and specific risk appetites, and incorporates these in document form as the risk appetite statement (RAS).\n\nAt Mizuho, we also work to foster and promote a sound risk culture to support this risk governance framework. The effective administration of the RAF leads to the creation of a sound risk culture, and at the same time, cultivating a sound risk culture creates a foundation for the disciplined risk-taking and risk communication which are promoted as part of the administration of the RAF.\n\nTo ensure strong risk governance, we maintain a risk management and compliance structure that operates in accordance with the principles of the 'three lines of defense.'\n\n## Risk culture\n\nWe foster a sound risk culture in which all executive officers and employees maintain a high level of awareness regarding risk, and endeavor to make proper judgments and take appropriate actions rooted in good sense and ethical standards. Such judgments and actions allow us to achieve our risk appetite and enhance our corporate value.\n\nWe have also established Behavioral Guidelines for a Sound Risk Culture, and work to ensure that executive officers and employees understand these principles through messages from senior management, training sessions and other measures. For Mizuho to put the 'customer first principle' into practice and enhance our corporate value, it is essential that all members maintain an attitude of not simply avoiding risk, but rather taking\n\n## Risk appetite framework (RAF)\n\nThe purpose of our RAF is to maximize our corporate value by securing sustainable and stable profits, and to fulfill our social responsibilities. Based on such purpose, our core risk appetite is to take appropriate risk and provide solutions based on our customers' actual needs, establishing our competitive advantage against our peers.\n\nWe have positioned the RAF as the corporate management framework to support taking the types and\n\nappropriate risk. These guidelines provide a foundation for the appropriate values and courses of action for Mizuho's executive officers and employees to take when approaching risks. The guidelines are aligned with the five Mizuho Values that form a part of Mizuho's Corporate Philosophy, and executive officers and employees can refer to them when they are unsure of a risk-related judgment that needs to be made in their daily work. Putting these guidelines into practice improves our ability to address and counter risks, and fosters a sound risk culture.\n\nThese initiatives are also important from the standpoint of internal control, ultimately helping to prevent inappropriate behavior by executive officers and employees.\n\nlevels of risk that we will accept in order to implement our business and financial strategies. We will further concretely define our risk appetite in our medium-term and fiscal year business plans. The risk appetite forms the basis for establishing our business strategy, resource allocation, and earnings plans as well as monitoring the operating status, thus integrating risk management, business strategy, and profits in order to achieve disciplined risk-taking that achieves an optimal balance of risk and return.",

In addition, the Risk Committee, which advises the Board of Directors, provides advice regarding risk governance and offers suggestions to management.\n\n## Formulation and monitoring of risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite is determined through management discussions on the outlook for external factors such as the macroeconomic, regulatory, and competitive environment, along with potential risk events such as economic slowdown and turbulence in financial markets. These are then incorporated into main and risk scenarios that are shared internally.\n\nWe then formulate a group-wide risk appetite policy based on our awareness of these external environments, create specific strategies and measures according to this policy, and determine corporate resource allocation and earnings plans. Our risk appetite metrics are expressed in terms of capital strength, profitability, and liquidity, utilizing measures such as CET1 Capital Ratio, ROE, and LCR.\n\n## Mizuho's RAF Control Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the other hand, to implement the RAF in the course of business operations, the Group CRO, Group CFO, and Group CSO provide assistance overseen by the Group CEO, and implement business strategy, financial strategy, and risk management from an overall perspective. Also, heads of in-house companies, units, and groups are responsible for planning and implementing strategies based on risk appetite, and as the individuals in charge of risk-taking, conduct operations. The Internal Audit Group provides objective and comprehensive assessments of the effectiveness of the RAF from an independent perspective and offers advice and recommendations for addressing any issues that arise.\n\nFurther, the risk appetite for the entire group is shared with the in-house companies that implement strategies, to ensure the effectiveness of the RAF. The in-house companies in turn formulate individual risk appetite policies to implement the group's overall policy, and set risk appetite metrics and levels to meet group metrics and levels.\n\nMonitoring of the operational status for the established risk appetite is conducted by the Risk Management Committee (Chairman: Group CRO) on a quarterly basis and as necessary. As part of this process, the Group CRO and each in-house company work to identify issues related to risk and share information on these issues. This monitoring enables timely and appropriate actions, including flexible revisions to our risk appetite and strategies, to be discussed and carried out in the event of changes in the external environment that increase risk or impede our risk appetite and strategies.",

We define compliance as the strict observance of all laws and regulations and the pursuit of fair and honest business operations that conform to socially-accepted norms, and we view ongoing compliance as one of the basic principles of sound business management. Each of our group companies maintains their own compliance structure in line with the basic policies established by Mizuho Financial Group.\n\n## Compliance structure\n\nThe President & CEO of Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, and Mizuho Securities each generally oversee compliance matters for their respective company, and important matters concerning compliance are discussed at the Compliance Committees chaired by the head of the relevant Compliance Group.\n\nThe four core group companies also have individual compliance departments overseen by the Head of the Compliance Group. These departments are responsible for compliance planning and implementation and control overall compliance management at each company. At each organizational unit (such as branches and departments) within the four core group companies, the head of the organizational unit is responsible for guidance and implementation related to compliance matters, and the compliance officer or compliance administrator at each organizational unit reviews the status of compliance.\n\nMizuho Financial Group monitors the status of compliance of the group through reports submitted by our core group companies and adopts appropriate responses as necessary. Compliance at subsidiaries of our core group companies is monitored and managed by their respective parent company.\n\n## Compliance practices\n\nWe have established the Mizuho Code of Conduct which sets forth clear and concrete standards of ethical behavior. Furthermore, each of our group companies has also prepared a compliance manual, which serves as a practical guidebook for rigorous compliance enforcement and clarifies the laws and regulations that we must observe in our business operations and the compliance practices we are required to follow. Mizuho ensures that all executive officers and employees are fully acquainted with both the Code of Conduct and the compliance manual's content through, for example, training upon joining the company.\n\n## Compliance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe monitor the status of compliance levels through self-assessments by each department and monitoring conducted by the compliance department of each company. In addition, every fiscal year, each of our group companies establishes a compliance program which contains concrete measures for compliance enforcement such as compliance framework management, training, and assessments. Progress on the compliance program is monitored every six months.",

In light of these trends, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) are extremely important. Against this backdrop, the key challenge for financial institutions is the strengthening of their AML measures and CFT initiatives. As a financial services provider operating\n\nglobally, Mizuho Financial Group is subject to the laws and regulations of both Japan and the other jurisdictions where it operates, as well as to supervision from financial regulators based on those laws and regulations. Accordingly, we have devised AML and CFT policies and procedures that conform to the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction and we are also continually enhancing our AML and CFT measures.\n\n## Our stance towards organized crime\n\nIn order to prevent organized crime from influencing the management of our clients and to avoid any association with the harm caused by organized crime, the Mizuho Code of Conduct includes a policy covering our zero-tolerance stance on business relationships with individuals or organizations that are in any way associated with organized crime and therefore threaten the rule of law, public order, and safety.\n\nWe have also formed an Anti-Organized Crime Committee which includes external experts in industryspecific, in-depth discussions on this subject, in addition to other initiatives we are implementing on a groupwide basis to ensure that we have no direct or indirect\n\n## Measures for ensuring compliance\n\nAt Mizuho, compliance-related education and training are key measures for ensuring appropriate compliance.\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, Mizuho provided effective training tailored to a broad range of roles within the organization, from employees to senior management. We conducted 14 training sessions in total, including mandatory compliance training sessions for all employees; role-specific training for executive officers, general managers, compliance officers, and other senior management members; and e-learning training sessions on specific compliance topics.\n\nIn addition to training sessions and other programs designed to promote compliance, we are also dedicated to detecting potential compliance issues\n\nassociations with organized crime. Moreover, drawing on the discussions in this committee, these matters are also discussed and reported on at meetings of the compliance committees of Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, and Mizuho Securities.\n\nFurthermore, core group companies maintain centralized departments or appoint an officer to manage antiorganized crime efforts and to maintain effective frameworks, for example, by establishing a manual on how to manage such issues and conducting training sessions. If required, we consult with third-party experts and authorities on the handling of specific cases.\n\nat the earliest stage possible and taking appropriate action. When we become aware of potential compliance issues, such matters must be reported immediately to department and branch managers in accordance with our compliance manual. Furthermore, each group company has established a hotline which employees can call in order to speak with someone within the Compliance Division or an external law office or compliance professional.\n\nFor matters related to inappropriate accounting, internal control on financial reporting, and auditing, an internal control and auditing hotline, which connects to an external law office, is available to receive reports from both in and outside the company.\n\n## Internal reporting systems (Compliance hotline)\n\nWe have a robust internal reporting system in place, and are working to further increase its effectiveness by establishing group-wide reporting channels outside the workplace that are available in the evenings, on Saturdays and Sundays, and also by making such services available in foreign languages. To ensure that employees at each group company are fully acquainted with these systems, hotline numbers and other relevant information is included on posters within each workplace and distributed to all employees on wallet-sized cards. In fiscal 2020, Mizuho Financial Group and our core group companies received a total of 176 reports through our hotlines from both inside and outside the group, with the response status reported to members of our Audit Committee. Following inspection by an authorized registration institute under the Consumer Affairs Agency, our internal reporting system was recognized as operating properly and in accordance with the guidelines set by the Agency, and registered to the Whistleblowing Compliance Management System (a Self-declaration System).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal control and audit hotline\n\nOur audit hotline, which connects to an external law office, is available to receive reports from both in and outside the company in connection with concerns regarding accounting and financial reports.",

With this in mind, a core part of our compliance is to continuously seek to monitor and improve the operations of the group from the perspective of what is in the best interests of our customers in order to ensure that our operations are appropriate and to improve customer convenience. We manage customer protection uniformly throughout the group in order to achieve this objective.\n\n## Customer protection management structure\n\nAt Mizuho, customer protection management refers to the efforts we make to improve the protection of our customers and improve customer convenience from the following perspectives:\n\n- 1.  Ensuring the appropriateness and sufficiency of explanations provided to customers prior to conducting transactions, purchasing products, etc. as well as the provision of information (e.g. product explanations) to customers.\n- 2.  Ensuring the appropriateness and sufficiency of the handling of customer inquiries, complaints, and other communications (customer service).\n- 3.  Ensuring the appropriateness of the management of customer information (customer information management).\n- 4.  Ensuring the appropriateness of customer interaction and the handling of customer information in cases where group operations are outsourced (outsourcing management).\n- 5.  Ensuring the appropriateness of the management of measures to be taken in order to address conflicts of interest arising from transactions with customers (conflict of interest management).\n\nOur President & Group CEO generally oversees the management of customer protection, and important matters are discussed at Compliance Committee meetings (chaired by the Head of the Compliance Group). Further, the Mizuho Financial Group divisions responsible for each area of management described above also provide centralized monitoring and implementation of our core group companies' customer protection management. Core group companies oversee customer protection management at their own subsidiaries.\n\n## Information management\n\nAdvances in information technology have enabled greater utilization of data. At the same time, many countries have tightened legislation protecting personal information. There has also been closer public scrutiny of the methods companies use to protect personal information. Mizuho is aware of the vital importance of managing information in a way that ensures appropriate protection and use of information assets.

As the financial services industry and world affairs have developed, steps have been taken to steadily enhance this framework. Formulated in 2010, Basel III is a framework that tightened capital requirements along with introducing liquidity requirements to address issues that came to light in the 2008 global financial crisis. Regulatory reforms following the financial crisis were largely completed in 2017 (Basel III finalization) with reforms aimed at reducing discrepancies among banks regarding the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWA, which is the denominator of the capital ratio). The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) agreed to postpone the initial schedule for implementing Basel III finalization by one year due to the COVID-19 outbreak, with this being phased in between 2023 and 2028.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthening  qualitative  and quantitative requirements for capital (numerator of the capital ratio)\n- \u00b7 Introduction of leverage ratio and liquidity requirements\n\n## Principal requirements under Basel III and state of compliance\n\nAs a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), Mizuho Financial Group must meet some regulatory standards at a higher level. We maintain full compliance with all the requirements in the standards and, going forward, we will steadily accumulate capital and control our balance sheet to ensure that we can satisfy any new requirements that are introduced.\n\n## International financial regulations going forward\n\nWith the completion of the post-global financial crisis regulatory reforms, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which are responsible for developing international financial regulatory standards, are turning their attention to new areas. Specifically, they have shifted their focus from developing new regulatory standards to consistent implementation of regulations in individual countries and evaluating the impact of regulatory reforms (e.g., are they having the intended effect without compromising regulatory resilience).\n\nIn addition, the environment that financial institutions operate in has reached a critical turning point, including rapidly accelerating digitalization and increasing societal interest in sustainability. There is growing attention to the opportunities and risks presented to banks and\n\n| Capital ratio              | Capital                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leverage ratio             | Capital                                                                                                                                   |\n| Liquidity                  | Exposure (calculated without taking account of the risk of assets held)                                                                   |\n| coverage ratio             | Stock of high-quality liquid assets Total net cash outflows under severe stress conditions   over a specified short-term period (30 days) |\n| Net stable fund- ing ratio | Available amount of stable funding  (capital, deposits, market funding, etc.) Required amount of stable funding (loans, securities, etc.) |\n\nfinancial systems by new trends. Aside from fintech, these trends also encompass climate change-related issues such as stricter approaches to responsible financing and stronger risk management. This has led to an uptick in international discussions about these issues. For example, various international bodies, foremost among them the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, have been looking into responses to climate-related financial risk (the risk that climate change could threaten the stability of the financial system by causing deterioration in the assets of financial institutions, associated reductions of capital, and other consequences).\n\nTo address these various risks, we will work closely with government, academia, and industry, while also holding proactive internal discussions.\n\n- \u00b7 Finalization of minimum capital requirements for market risk",

Both the NPL balance and ratio remain stable at a low level.\n\n- Non-performing loans based on the Financial Reconstruction Act (MHBK + MHTB, banking book + trust banking book)\n- Claims for special attention (\u00a5 trillion) Claims with collection risk (\u00a5 trillion) Claims against bankrupt and substantially bankrupt obligors (\u00a5 trillion) NPL ratio (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Non-performing loans based on the Financial Reconstruction Act (MHBK + MHTB, banking book + trust banking book) (\u00a5 billion)\n\n|                                                              | March 31,  2021   | March 31,  2020   | Change from  March 31,  2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Claims against bankrupt and  substantially bankrupt obligors | 48.7              | 51.0              | (2.3)                          |\n| Claims with collection risk                                  | 411.0             | 386.5             | 24.5                           |\n| Claims for special attention                                 | 333.0             | 223.4             | 109.5                          |\n| Subtotal                                                     | 792.7             | 661.0             | 131.7                          |\n| Normal claims                                                | 95,144.3          | 93,890.9          | 1,253.4                        |\n| Total                                                        | 95,937.1          | 94,551.9          | 1,385.1                        |\n| NPL ratio                                                    | 0.82%             | 0.69%             | 0.12%                          |",

In line with this approach, we set forth our shareholder return policy of maintaining the current level of dividends for the time being while aiming to strengthen our capital base further to enhance returns to shareholders at an early stage.\n\nBased on this policy, annual cash dividends for fiscal 2020 were \u00a575 per share of common stock (both interim and yearend cash dividends were \u00a537.5 per share of common stock, with the interim dividends reflecting the share consolidation (one post-consolidation share per ten pre-consolidation shares) implemented on October 1, 2020), which was substantially the same amount as the previous fiscal year.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, our profit attributable to owners of parent came to \u00a5471.0 billion, outperforming the earnings estimate we announced at the beginning of the fiscal year. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (Basel III finalization fully effective basis, excluding net unrealized gains on other securities) was 9.1%, reaching the lower end of the 9 - 10% range, which is the target set in our 5-Year Business Plan. In making this decision on annual cash dividends, the Board of Directors took into account our business environment comprehensively, including our business results, our capital adequacy, and domestic and international regulatory trends, including the Basel regulatory framework.\n\n## Annual cash dividend per share of common stock (\u00a5)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe implemented the share consolidation of the shares of common stock on the basis of one post-consolidation share per ten pre-consolidation shares effective as of October 1, 2020.\n\nThe amounts for annual cash dividends per share of common stock from FY2017 through FY2019 reflect the effect of the share consolidation. If the share consolidation is not taken into consideration, the amount would be \u00a57.5 in each year.\n\nIn light of our progress on accumulating capital, we have revised our capital management policy for fiscal 2021 onwards. Our new approach will be to pursue the optimum balance between capital adequacy, growth investment, and enhancement of shareholder returns. Our shareholder return policy is to have progressive dividends as our principal approach while executing flexible and intermittent share buybacks. For dividends, we will decide based on the steady growth of our stable earnings base, taking a 40% dividend payout ratio as a guide into consideration. For share buybacks, we will consider our business results and capital adequacy, our stock price, and opportunities for growth investment in determining the execution.\n\ne\n\nu\n\nl\n\na\n\nv\n\ne\n\nt\n\na\n\nor\n\np\n\nor\n\nc",

We also believe that proactively supporting SMEs is a key part of fulfilling our social responsibility as a financial institution.\n\nIn particular, by providing consulting and support for SMEs' growth strategies, we can introduce clients to potential M&A opportunities from the standpoint of business expansion and succession, and support the growth of innovative companies with exceptional technologies or ideas.\n\n## Regional revitalization initiatives\n\nIn Japan, as a result of the trend toward concentration of businesses and other economic activity solely in Tokyo, rural populations are expected to decline and regional economies are expected to shrink in the future. As a nation, Japan must look for ways to revitalize regional areas through a virtuous cycle in which jobs draw people back to local areas and population growth creates more jobs.\n\n## Case example\n\nTransforming Hachijojima into a 'smart island'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMizuho Bank, Tokyo Prefecture's Hachijo Town, and the Hachijo Town Chamber of Commerce and Industry entered into a comprehensive partnership agreement for promoting cashless payments. With cashless payments as a starting point, the partnership is working to transform Hachijojima into a 'smart island' by applying digital technology aimed at solving local challenges.\n\nMizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Research & Technologies, Blue Lab, and other group companies are providing their combined knowledge and knowhow regarding finance and digital technology, as well as the technical insights of our clients via open collaboration, in order to contribute to the revitalization of Hachijo Town through disaster prevention to protect the safety and security of community members, tourism promotion, and other efforts. Additionally, we hope these leading-edge initiatives for boosting the local community will serve as a model for other regions.\n\n## Finance facilitation and response to the Guidelines for Personal Guarantee Provided by Business Owners\n\n## Finance facilitation\n\nMizuho works to promote finance facilitation in accordance with group-wide fundamental policies. This includes ensuring that we respond appropriately to requests for new loans or loan condition adjustments, with consideration for the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide tailored consulting.\n\n## Guidelines for Personal Guarantee Provided by Business Owners\n\nWe are committed to establishing and maintaining good relationships with our clients in line with the Guidelines for Personal Guarantee Provided by Business Owners established by the Japanese Bankers Association and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as the associated special provisions that came into effect on April 1, 2020.\n\nWe provide the option for a joint guarantee with a termination clause and multiple other lending methods as alternatives to personal guarantee provided by business owners. Also, we have established a structure for cooperation between our frontline offices and Head Office to encourage the utilization of these methods.\n\nFurthermore, a specialized business reorganization section within our Head Office provides support for SMEs' business improvement and reorganization needs. In addition, our Head Office collaborates with frontline offices to provide consultations and support for clients through partnerships with external organizations, external specialists, and other financial institutions.\n\nUtilizing our office network in Japan, we are striving to promote the revitalization of regional economies by providing our clients with funding, supporting the operations of local businesses, and collaborating with regional governments.\n\ne\n\nu\n\nl\n\na\n\nv\n\ne\n\nt\n\na\n\nor\n\np\n\nor\n\nc",

The committee is chaired by our President & Group CEO and is independent of our other business operations.\n\nThe Head of the Internal Audit Group reports the progress of individual audits and plans to the Audit Committee, responds to requests for inspections, and receives specific instructions from the committee.\n\nOur Internal Audit Committee monitors and manages internal audits at our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies through internal audit reports submitted by such subsidiaries. Our Internal Audit Committee discusses and makes decisions regarding internal audits at our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies and submits the results, together with the results of their examination of the internal audit reports, to the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors.\n\n## Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Trust & Banking\n\nBoth Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Trust & Banking have also established an internal audit committee that is independent of their other business operations and maintains the independence of the Internal Audit Group. Also, in both banks, the Head of the Internal Audit Group reports the progress of individual audits and plans to the Audit & Supervisory Committee, responds to requests for inspections, and receives specific instructions from the committee.\n\nBoth banks have established internal audit departments to conduct internal audits at their respective domestic and overseas business offices, head office departments and group companies. Specifically, the internal audit departments assess the suitability and effectiveness of business activities associated with compliance and risk management.\n\n## Other core group companies\n\nOther core group companies have also established effective and efficient internal audit structures adapted to the characteristics of their respective businesses.\n\nIn line with the Basic Policy for Internal Audit established by Mizuho Financial Group, our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies conduct internal audits, which include the internal auditing of their respective subsidiaries. In addition, with respect to the management of risks applicable across the Mizuho group, we coordinate internal audits throughout the group to assess the risk management status of the group as a whole.\n\n## Internal audit management structure\n\nInstruction\n\n(As of June 30, 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management Structure\n\n## Credit risk management\n\n## Basic approach\n\nWe define credit risk as the Mizuho group's exposure to the risk of losses that may be incurred due to a decline in, or total loss of, the value of assets (including off-balance-sheet instruments), as a result of deterioration in obligors' financial position.\n\nMizuho Financial Group manages credit risk for the group as a whole. Specifically, Mizuho Financial Group establishes the group's fundamental credit risk policy to manage major group companies, and monitors and manages the credit risks of the group as a whole.\n\n## Credit risk management structure\n\nOur Board of Directors determines the Mizuho group's basic matters pertaining to credit risk management. In addition, the Risk Management Committee broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic policies and operations in connection with credit risk management and matters relating to credit risk monitoring for the Mizuho group. Under the control of the Group Chief Risk Officer of Mizuho Financial Group, the Credit Risk Management Department and the Risk Management Department jointly monitor, analyze, and submit suggestions concerning credit risk and formulate and execute plans in connection with basic matters pertaining to credit risk management.\n\nOur principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies manage their credit risk according to the scale and nature of their exposures in line with basic policies set forth by Mizuho Financial Group. The Board of Directors of each company determines key matters pertaining to credit risk management.\n\n## Method of credit risk management\n\nWe have adopted two different but mutually complementary approaches to credit risk management. The first approach is 'individual credit management,' in which we manage the process for each individual transaction and individual obligor from execution until collection, based on our assessment of the credit quality of the\n\nobligor. Through this process, we curb losses in the case of a credit event. The second is 'credit portfolio management,' in which we utilize statistical methods to assess the potential for losses related to credit risk. Through this process, we identify credit risks and respond appropriately.\n\n## Individual credit management\n\n## 1. Credit Codes\n\nThe basic code of conduct for all of our executive officers and employees engaged in the credit business is set forth in our credit code. Seeking to fulfill the bank's mission and social responsibilities, our basic policy for credit business is determined in light of fundamental principles focusing on public welfare, safety, growth, and profitability.\n\n## 2. Internal rating system\n\nOne of the most important elements of the risk management infrastructure of our principal banking subsidiaries is the use of an internal rating system that consists of credit ratings and pool allocations. Credit ratings consist of obligor ratings which represent the level of credit risk of the obligor, and transaction ratings which represent the possibility of ultimately incurring losses related to each individual claim by taking into consideration the nature of any collateral or guarantee and the seniority of the claim.\n\nIn principle, obligor ratings apply to all obligors and are subject to regular reviews at least once a year to reflect promptly the fiscal period end financial results of the obligors, as well as special reviews as required whenever an obligor's credit standing changes. This enables our principal banking subsidiaries to monitor both individual\n\nThe Balance Sheet & Risk Management Committee and the Credit Committee, each of which is a business policy committee of our principal banking subsidiaries, are responsible for discussing and coordinating overall management of their individual credit portfolios and transaction policies towards obligors. The respective Chief Risk Officers of our principal banking subsidiaries are responsible for matters relating to planning and implementing credit risk management. The credit risk management departments of our principal banking subsidiaries are in charge of planning and administering credit risk management and conducting credit risk measuring and monitoring. Such departments regularly present reports regarding their risk management situation to Mizuho Financial Group. The credit departments of our principal banking subsidiaries determine policies and approve/disapprove individual transactions in terms of credit review, credit management and collection from obligors in accordance with the lines of authority set forth respectively by our principal banking subsidiaries. In addition, our principal banking subsidiaries have established internal audit groups that are independent of the business departments in order to ensure appropriate credit risk management.\n\nO\n\nF\n\nD",

Because we consider obligor ratings to be an initial phase of the self-assessment process regarding the quality of our loans and offbalance-sheet instruments, such obligor ratings are closely linked to the obligor classifications and are an integral part of the process for determining the provision for credit losses on loans and charge-offs in our self-assessment of loans and off-balance-sheet instruments. (Please refer to the chart below regarding the connection between obligor ratings, definition of obligor classifications of selfassessments, claims disclosed under the FRA and non-accrual, and past due & restructured loans).\n\nTo assign obligor ratings, we have a quantitative evaluation system (rating model) in place to enable proper assessment of an obligor's credit standing. The system gives a quantitative rating to an obligor\n\nbased on obliger-specific characteristics such as type of business (corporation or individual) and geography (in Japan or outside Japan). We categorize our rating models for companies in Japan into those for large companies and those for small and mediumsized companies. The former consist of 13 models according to industry-specific factors, while the latter consist of three models. For companies outside Japan, we utilize nine models.\n\nThese were developed by the Credit Risk Management Department based on a statistical methodology and approved by the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nPool allocations are applied to small claims that are less than a specified amount by pooling obligors and claims with similar risk characteristics and assessing and managing the risk for each such\n\n## Connection between obligor ratings, definition of obligor classifications of self-assessments, claims disclosed under the FRA and non-accrual, past due & restructured loans\n\n| Definition  of obligor  classifications of  self-assessment   | Obligor  ratings ( major   | Definition of ratings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Category I ( non- categorized)                                                      | Category II                                                                                           | Category III                                                                                                             | Category IV ( non- collateralized)                                                                                       | Claims  disclosed  under the FRA                      | Non-accrual,  past due &  restructured  loans              |    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n|                                                               | category) A1-A3 D1-D3      | Obligors whose certainty of debt  fulfillment is very high, hence their level  of credit risk is excellent.

Self-assessment, Provision for Credit Losses on Loans and OffBalance-Sheet Instruments and Charge-Offs\n\nWe conduct self-assessment of assets to ascertain the status of assets both as an integral part of credit risk management and in preparation\n\nfor appropriate accounting treatment, including provision for credit losses on loans and off-balance-sheet instruments and charge-offs. During the process of self-assessment, obligors are categorized into certain groups taking into consideration their financial condition and their ability to make payments, and credit ratings are assigned to all obligors, in principle, to reflect the extent of their credit risks. The related assets are then categorized into certain classes based on the risk of impairment. This process allows us to identify and control the actual quality of assets and determine the appropriate accounting treatment, including provision for credit losses on loans and offbalance-sheet instruments and charge-offs. Specifically, the credit risk management department of each of our principal subsidiaries is responsible for the overall control of the self-assessment of assets of the respective banking subsidiaries, cooperating with the administrative departments specified for each type of asset, including loan portfolios and securities, in executing and managing self-assessments. In our assessment of the probability of obligor bankruptcy, we deem an obligor that is rated as being insolvent or lower as being bankrupt.\n\n## 4. Credit review\n\nPrevention of new impaired loans through routine credit management is important in maintaining the quality of our overall loan assets.\n\nCredit review involves analysis and screening of each potential transaction within the relevant business department. In case the screening exceeds the authority of the department, the credit department in charge at headquarters carries out the review. We have specialist departments for different industries, business sizes, and regions, carries out timely and specialized examinations based on the characteristics of the client and its market, and provides appropriate advice to the business department.\n\nIn addition, in the case of obligors with low credit ratings and high downside risks, the business department and credit department jointly clarify their credit policy and in appropriate cases assist the obligors at an early stage in working towards credit soundness.",

Risk measurement\n\nWe use statistical methodologies that involve a risk measurement system (enterprise value corporate valuation model, holding period of one year) to manage the possibility of losses by measuring the expected average loss for a one-year risk horizon ('Expected Loss') and the maximum loss within a certain confidence interval ('Credit VAR'). The difference between Expected Loss and Credit VAR is measured as the credit risk amount ('Unexpected Loss').\n\nThe risk measurement system covers the following account items reported by each Mizuho Financial Group company: credit transactions including loans and discounts; securities; obligors'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nliabilities for acceptances and guarantees; deposits and foreign exchange; derivatives including swaps and options; off-balance-sheet items including commitments; and other assets involving credit risk.\n\nIn establishing transaction spread guidelines for credit transactions, we aim to ensure an appropriate return from the transaction in light of the level of risk by utilizing credit cost data as a reference.\n\nAlso, we monitor our credit portfolio from various perspectives and set guidelines noted below so that losses incurred through a hypothetical realization of the full Credit VAR would be within the amount of risk capital and loan loss reserves.\n\n## 2. Risk control methods\n\nOur principal banking subsidiaries have established guidelines to manage 'credit concentration risk,' which stems from granting excessive credit to certain corporate groups. Our principal banking subsidiaries also set the credit limit based on a verification of the status of capital adequacy. In cases where the limit is exceeded, our principal banking subsidiaries will formulate a handling policy and/or action plan.\n\nIn addition to the above, our principal banking subsidiaries monitor total credit exposure, credit exposure per rating, credit concentration per corporate group, geographic area, and business sector to make a periodical report to the Balance Sheet & Risk Management Committee and the Credit Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Market risk management\n\n## Basic approach\n\nWe define market risk as the risk of losses incurred by the group due to fluctuations in interest rates, stock prices, and foreign exchange rates. Our definition includes the risk of losses incurred when it becomes impossible to execute transactions in the market because of market confusion or losses arising from transactions at prices that are significantly less favorable than usual.\n\nMizuho Financial Group manages market risk for the Mizuho group as a whole. Specifically, Mizuho Financial Group establishes the fundamental risk management policy for the entire group, manages the market risk of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies, and monitors how the group's market risk is being managed as a whole.\n\n## Market risk management structure\n\nOur Board of Directors determines basic matters pertaining to market risk management policies. The Risk Management Committee of Mizuho Financial Group broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic policies in connection with market risk management, market risk operations, and market risk monitoring. The Group CRO of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for matters relating to market risk management planning and operations.\n\nThe Risk Management Department of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for monitoring market risk, reporting and analysing, making proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans relating to market risk management.\n\n## Market risk management method\n\nTo manage market risk, we set limits that correspond to risk capital allocations according to the risk profile of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies and thereby prevent the overall market risk we hold from exceeding our financial\n\nstrength represented by capital and other indicators. The amount of risk capital allocated to market risk corresponds to value-at-risk (the 'VAR') and additional costs that may arise in order to close relevant positions.\n\n## Setting limits\n\nWhen the above mentioned limits are set, various factors are taken into account, including business strategies, historical limit usage ratios, risk-bearing capacity (profits, equity capital, and risk management framework), profit targets and the market liquidity of the products involved. The limits are discussed and coordinated by the Risk Management Committee, discussed further by the Executive Management Committee and then determined by the President & Group CEO. For trading and banking activities, we set limits for VAR and for losses. For banking activities, we set position limits based on interest rate sensitivity (10 BPV) as needed. An excess over any of these limits is immediately reported and addressed according to a pre-determined procedure.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTo provide a system of mutual checks and balances in market operations, we have established middle offices specializing in risk management that are independent of front offices which engage in market transactions and of back offices which are responsible for book entries and settlements. When VAR is not adequate to control risk, the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices, carry out stress testing, and set stop loss limits as needed. We monitor market liquidity risk for individual financial products in the market while taking turnover and other factors into consideration.\n\nAs for the situation of market risk, the Risk Management Department submits reports to the President and Group CEO on a daily basis and to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. For the purpose of managing the market risk of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies, the Department regularly receives reports from each of them to properly identify and manage their market risk. These subsidiaries and core group companies, which account for most of the Mizuho group's exposure to market risk, establish their basic policies based on ours, and their Boards of Directors determine important matters relating to market risk management.\n\ne\n\nu\n\nl\n\na\n\nv\n\ne\n\nt\n\na\n\nor\n\np\n\nor\n\nc",

However, VAR models have the following shortcomings:\n\n- \u00b7  By its nature as a statistical approach, VAR estimates possible losses over a certain period at a particular confidence level using past market movement data. Past market movement, however, is not necessarily a good indicator of future events, particularly potential future events that are extreme in nature.\n- \u00b7  VAR may underestimate the probability of extreme market movements.\n- \u00b7  The use of a 99.0% confidence level does not take account of, nor makes any statement about, any losses that might occur beyond this confidence level.\n\n- \u00b7  VAR does not capture all complex effects of various risk factors on the value of positions and portfolios and could underestimate potential losses.\n\n## Cross-shareholdings portfolio management activities\n\nWe take the market risk management approach with use of VAR and risk indices for cross-shareholdings portfolio management activities to properly manage stock price risk. Specifically, we monitor VAR measurements and the state of risk capital on a daily basis. Moreover, in order to control stock price risk, we are working on the reduction in cross-shareholdings through careful negotiations with counterparties.\n\n## Back testing\n\nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of market risk measurements calculated using the VAR method, we carry out regular back tests to compare VAR with assumptive profits and losses. Assumptive profits and losses accounts for general market risk. The graph below shows daily VAR of trading activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and the corresponding paired distribution of profits and losses. We had one case where losses exceeded VAR during the period. In addition, we conduct evaluations of the assumptions related to the VAR models. Based on the number of times losses exceeded VAR through back testing and the results of the evaluation of the model assumptions, we will make adjustments to the models as appropriate. Changes to fundamental portions of the VAR models are subject to the approval of our Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote:  We conduct our back testing and assess the number of cases where losses exceed VAR based on a 250 business day year. The expected average number of instances where one-day trading losses exceeded VAR at the 99% confidence level is 2.5.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nBecause the VAR method is based on statistical assumptions, we conduct stress testing to simulate the levels of losses that could be incurred in cases where the market moves suddenly to levels that exceed these assumptions. The stress testing methods we use include the calculation of losses under scenarios in which stresses are applied to interest rate risk and stock price risk based on current and projected economic conditions, historical market events, etc.\n\nr\n\nou\n\nr\n\no\n\nf\n\ns\n\nn\n\no\n\nti\n\nda\n\nn\n\nou\n\nF\n\ne\n\nu\n\nl\n\na\n\nv\n\ne\n\nt\n\na\n\nor\n\np\n\nor\n\nc",

Specifically, Mizuho Financial Group establishes the fundamental liquidity risk management policy for the entire group, manages the liquidity risk of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies, and monitors how the group's liquidity risk is being managed as a whole.\n\n## Liquidity risk management structure\n\nOur Board of Directors determines basic matters pertaining to liquidity risk management policies. The Risk Management Committee of Mizuho Financial Group broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic policies in connection with liquidity risk management, operations, and monitoring, and proposes responses to emergencies such as sudden market changes. The Group Chief Risk Officer of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for matters relating to liquidity risk management planning and operations.

The former is determined for the purpose of managing limits on funds raised in the market considering our fund raising capabilities, and the latter is determined based on our funding conditions. We also carry out liquidity stress\n\n## Liquidity risk management indicators\n\nLimits on funds raised in the market are set based on a number of time horizons taking into account characteristics and strategies of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies. Such limits are discussed and coordinated by the Risk Management Committee, discussed further by the Executive Management Committee, and determined by the President & Group CEO. An excess over any of these limits is immediately reported and addressed according to a pre-determined procedure.\n\n## Liquidity categorization\n\nWe have established a group-wide framework of liquidity risk stages such as 'normal,' 'anxious,' and 'crisis,' which reflects funding conditions. In addition, we set early warning indicators ('EWIs') and monitor on a daily basis to manage funding conditions. The EWIs we use include stock prices, credit ratings, amount of liquidity reserve assets such as Japanese government bonds, and our funding situation.\n\nmatters relating to planning and running cash flow management operations, and the Financial Planning Department is responsible for monitoring and adjusting the cash flow management situation and for planning and implementing cash flow management to maintain appropriate funding liquidity. Reports on liquidity risk management are submitted to the Risk Management Committee and the Balance Sheet Management Committee (each of which is a business policy committee), the Executive Management Committee and the President & Group CEO on a regular basis.\n\nOur principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies also establish their basic policies on liquidity risk management to properly identify and manage liquidity risk.\n\ntesting to verify the sufficiency of liquidity reserve assets and the effectiveness of countermeasures against a possible outflow of funds during a stress event. The results of stress testing are used for cash flow management operations.\n\n## Liquidity stress testing\n\nWe carry out stress testing regularly based on market-wide factors, idiosyncratic factors of the group, and a combination of both types of factors to verify the sufficiency of liquidity reserve assets and the effectiveness of our liquidity contingency funding plans. Furthermore, we utilize stress testing for evaluating the appropriateness of our annual funding plan.",

Implementation of the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)\n\nWe have adopted the AMA for the calculation of operational risk equivalent in association with capital adequacy ratios based on the Basel Accords. However, we use the Basic Indicator Approach for entities that are deemed to be less important in the measurement of operational risk equivalent.\n\nThe measurement results under the AMA are used not only as the operational risk equivalent in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios but also as Operational VAR for internal risk management purposes for implementing action plans to reduce operational risk, and other countermeasures.\n\n## 2. Outline of the AMA\n\n## Outline of the measurement system\n\nWe have established our model by taking account of four elements: internal loss data; external loss data; scenario analysis and business environment; and internal control factors (BEICFs). We calculate the operational risk amount by estimating the maximum loss, using a 99.9th percentile one-tailed confidence interval and a oneyear holding period as operational risk equivalent, employing both internal loss data (i.e., actually experienced operational loss events), and scenario data to reflect unexperienced potential future loss events in the measurement.\n\nIn the measurement of operational risk equivalent as of March 31, 2021, we did not exclude expected losses and also did not recognize the risk mitigating impact of insurance.

In the measurement of operational risk equivalent as of March 31, 2021, we did not reflect the correlation effects among operational risk related to each of the seven loss event types.\n\n## Operational risk by loss event type\n\nLoss Distribution (Compound Poisson Distribution) Approach (LDA) is adopted for the calculation of operational risk. LDA is based on the assumption that Poisson Distribution applies to the occurrence frequency of operational risk events, and loss severity is expressed through a separate distribution. Operational risk is calculated for each of the seven loss event types employing both internal loss data, based on our actual experience as operational loss events, and scenario data. Scenario data, expressed as numerical values of occurrence frequency and loss severity, reflects external loss data and BEICFs, in order to estimate unexperienced potential future loss events (of low frequency and high severity).\n\nFrequency Distribution and Severity Distribution are estimated employing the above mentioned internal loss data and scenario data, and Monte-Carlo simulations are then applied to these distributions to measure operational risk.

Scenario analysis\n\n## Outline of scenario analysis\n\nIn the process of scenario analysis, scenario data is created as numerical values of occurrence frequency and loss severity reflecting external loss data and BEICFs, in order to estimate unexperienced potential future operational risk events (of low frequency and high severity).\n\nAs for external loss data, we refer to data publicly reported by domestic and overseas media, and such data are reflected in the estimation of occurrence frequency and Loss Severity Distribution in the process of scenario analysis. In addition, BEICFs are utilized as indices to adjust occurrence frequency and Loss Severity Distribution in the process of scenario analysis.\n\nWe categorize scenario analysis into four approaches in accordance with the characteristics of each loss event type and risk management structures.\n\n| Approach   | Loss event type(s) to be applied                                                                                           |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A          | Internal fraud / external fraud / clients, products, and business  practices / execution, delivery, and process management |\n| B          | Employment practices and workplace safety                                                                                  |\n| C          | Damage to physical assets                                                                                                  |\n| D          | Business disruption and system failure                                                                                     |\n\nAt Mizuho Financial Group, loss event types to which Approach A is applied account for a considerable amount of operational risk. The detailed process of Approach A is explained here as a typical example of scenario analysis.\n\n## Setting units for scenario analysis\n\nIn order to ensure completeness and sufficiency, we set units that are commonly applied across group entities that adopt AMA (the 'Group Entities') by referencing and categorizing risk scenarios recognized through control self-assessment, internal loss data of the Group Entities, external loss data, etc. Then each of the Group Entities selects the unit on which scenario analysis is conducted from the units established on a group-wide basis in accordance with its business activities and operational risk profile.\n\n## Estimation of occurrence frequency\n\nBasic occurrence frequency (once a year) is calculated for each scenario analysis unit. If a certain scenario analysis unit has relevant internal loss data of a pre-determined threshold amount or above, its basic occurrence frequency is calculated based on such data, and if not, the basic occurrence frequency (the occurrence frequency per year of losses at or above a pre-determined threshold) is calculated with reference to the situation of occurrence of internal loss data of less than the threshold amount and/or external loss data. The basic occurrence frequency is then adjusted within a pre-determined range for the purpose of reflecting the most recent BEICFs to determine the final occurrence frequency.\n\n## Estimation of Loss Severity Distribution\n\nIn order to estimate Loss Severity Distribution, we use a predetermined series of severity ranges. Basic Loss Severity Distribution is calculated for each scenario analysis unit as an occurrence ratio (in percentile figures) of loss at each severity range when losses at or above a pre-determined threshold occurred, with reference to transaction amount data, external loss data, etc. Then the basic severity distribution is adjusted, if necessary, from the viewpoint of statistical data processing to determine the final Loss Severity Distribution.\n\n## Creation of scenario data\n\nFor each scenario analysis unit, scenario data is generated as a series of combinations of occurrence frequency per year at each severity range, based on the final occurrence frequency and the final Loss Severity Distribution.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Coordinating our efforts through these headquarters, we have been taking measures to prevent further spread of the virus, with our customers' health and safety as our highest priority. Because we provide financial infrastructure that is indispensable for the functioning of society, we have been working as a unified group to maintain our provision of business funding to clients, our settlement services, and our other financial functions.\n\nA primary example of our infection prevention and business continuity measures is that we have been asking customers to schedule appointments to visit our branches and issuing numbered tickets as required by the level of crowding, avoiding congestion in lobbies and other places in order to prevent potential transmission among customers. We have also implemented thorough measures to prevent droplet transmission, installing acrylic partitions at our counters and having our staff wear face guards. For our employees, we have endeavored to prevent infection and ensure business\n\nThese offices function as a controller in the event of an emergency that may materially impact business management, by collecting and analyzing information, formulating countermeasures, and taking other necessary action. In addition, their role includes collecting and analyzing signs and indicators of a potential crisis, and reporting their findings promptly to management.\n\nParticular focus is placed on strengthening our response to natural disasters, covering not only earthquakes and tsunamis but also volcanic eruptions, large-scale wind or water damage, and facilitating initial responses to acts of terrorism and riots as well as cyberattacks that have been occurring with increasing frequency around the world.\n\nAlso, to secure the effectiveness of our measures to deal with emergencies, group-wide practice drills and training sessions are conducted on an annual basis.\n\ncontinuity by implementing such measures as shift work in response to local outbreaks and levels of crowding at peak business hours. In addition to limiting the percentage of employees working from our offices by expanding the implementation of remote work, our Head Office has promoted methods to minimize contact between employees through, for example, the proactive utilization of online meetings.\n\nRegarding COVID-19 vaccines, to enable us to reduce the burden on local municipalities and contribute toward the acceleration of vaccination in Japan, we opened mass vaccination centers for employees on July 1, 2021, with three sites in Tokyo and one site in Osaka.\n\nGoing forward, Mizuho will quickly respond to the structural shifts COVID-19 is causing in the economy, industry, and society and continue working as a unified group to support our customers and society in facing these new challenges. Through this support, we will build new forms of partnerships with our customers and aim to transition to the next generation of financial services.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming the auditor's opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n- (1) Reasonableness of self-assessment of loans, write-offs and reserve provisions\n\n## Description of Key Audit Matter\n\n## Auditor's Response\n\nAs described in (10) 'Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans' in Note 5 'Standards of Accounting Method', the Group recognizes the reserves for loan losses based on the internally established standards for self-assessment of loans and for write-offs and reserve provisions. The standards consider the obligor's financial condition, valuation of collateral and expectation of future economic conditions.\n\nWhen the credit risk of receivables held at the end of the fiscal year is significantly different from the past due to changes in the environment or other factors, the reserve is adjusted by management to consider factors such as economic uncertainty.\n\nIn this fiscal year, the Group made additional reserves for loan portfolios of similar credit risk characteristics with a high probability of losses by using the existing credit risk management framework and considering economic uncertainty of the external environment.\n\nThe Group has Loans of \u00a583,704,675 million, which represent approximately 37% of total assets, and the Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans of \u00a5575,572 million as of March 31, 2021.\n\nIn estimating the reserves for loan losses, the Group uses\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Group's process for establishing the reserves for loan losses. The controls tested included, but were not limited to, controls to evaluate and monitor obligor ratings, controls that evaluate the expected future cash flows used to determine reserve amounts and controls that evaluate the adjustments to reflect management's consideration including identification of specific loan portfolios where losses are likely to occur and determination of the method for adjusting the reserves for loan losses. We performed the following substantive procedures.\n\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of obligors to substantively test 'Forecast for obligors used for assigning internal credit ratings and for discounted cash flow method' in considering both quantitative and qualitative perspective. Our sample considered various risks, such as the type of industry, sector and financial condition of the obligor.\n\nWe assessed the obligors' business performance, fulfillment of obligation, industry characteristics, business plan establishment and progress as well as their ability to earn a profit under COVID-19 pandemic and compared those to available external sources and made inquiries to",

As described in Note 9 'Critical  Accounting Estimates', the Group considers 'Forecast for  obligors used for assigning internal credit ratings and for  discounted cash flow method' and 'Forecast of the  external environment used for making necessary  adjustment to expected loss' as key assumptions. 'Forecast for obligors used for assigning internal credit  ratings and for discounted cash flow method' is based on  the obligors' business performance, status of obligors'  debt, industry characteristics, business plan establishment  as well as their ability of earning a profit under COVID-19  pandemic. 'Forecast of the external environment used for making  necessary adjustment to expected loss' is based on | the credit risk management division. \u00b7   In assessing 'Forecast of the external environment used  for making necessary adjustment to expected loss', with  support of our specialist, we evaluated the  management's assumption by comparing significant  inputs and underlying data such as growth rate of gross  domestic product and the future prospect of the  business environment for each industry with external  sources, when available. |\n\n## (2) Appropriateness of fair value measurement of derivatives classified within Level 3\n\n## Description of Key Audit Matter\n\n## Auditor's Response\n\nAs described in Note 43 'Financial Instruments,' the Group carries various types of over-the-counter derivatives (equity related contracts, interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and credit-related contracts) for banking and certain trading activities and for securities related business at certain subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group carried financial instruments at fair value as of March 31, 2021. Among those, derivative assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are measured at fair value using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are \u00a5123,523 million and \u00a568,186 million, respectively.\n\nIn calculating fair value of Level 3 derivatives, management utilizes internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs such as correlation between interest rates and foreign exchange rates and volatility which is difficult to prove with market data.\n\nThese valuation models and unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of these derivatives involve significant judgments and have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified the fair value measurement of derivatives classified within Level 3 as a key audit matter.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Group's derivatives fair valuation processes performed by middle-office and back-office. The controls tested included, but were not limited to, controls over significant inputs included in the fair value measurements and controls over the appropriateness of the valuation techniques utilized within the internally developed valuation models. We involved our specialists to assist us in performing the following substantive procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Inspecting the outcome of the Group's independent price verification (IPV) process and assessed any issues in the fair value measurement identified through IPV and evaluated the management judgment.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating significant unobservable inputs by comparing the inputs with available information we obtained independently. To select samples, we considered the risks in terms of the degree of subjectivity involved in setting those unobservable inputs as well as the quantitative impact on the fair value measurement\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the valuation techniques used by comparing them with our understanding of market practices, and Testing the mathematical accuracy of the Group's valuation calculation. To select samples, we considered risks associated with the complexity of the valuation techniques used in addition to the quantitative impact on the fair value measurements.",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n- \u00b7 Consider internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for our risk assessments, while the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial statements is not expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and\n\nsignificant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with the ethical requirements regarding independence that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Japan, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Interest Required to Be Disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan\n\nOur firm and its designated engagement partners do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan.",

Balance Sheet Dates of Consolidated Subsidiaries\n\n- (a) Balance sheet dates of consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 are as follows:\n- (b) The consolidated subsidiary with balance sheet dates of July 31 was consolidated based on its tentative financial statement as of and for the period ended the consolidated balance sheet date.\n\nJuly 31\n\n1 company\n\nDecember 31\n\n39 companies\n\nMarch 31\n\n120 companies\n\nOther consolidated subsidiaries were consolidated based on their financial statements as of and for the period ended their respective balance sheet dates.\n\nThe necessary adjustments have been made to the financial statements for any significant transactions that took place between their respective balance sheet dates and the date of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 5. Standards of Accounting Method\n\n## (1) Credited Loans pursuant to Trading Securities and Trading Income & Expenses\n\nCredited loans held for the purpose of trading are, in line with trading securities, recognized on a trade date basis and recorded in Other Debt Purchased on the consolidated balance sheet. Other Debt Purchased related to the relevant credited loans is stated at fair value at the consolidated balance sheet date.\n\nInterest received and the gains or losses on the sale of the relevant credited loans during the fiscal year, including the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, are recognized in Other Operating Income and Other Operating Expenses on the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## (2)Trading Assets & Liabilities and Trading Income & Expenses\n\nTrading transactions intended to take advantage of short-term fluctuations and arbitrage opportunities in interest rates, currency exchange rates, market prices of securities and related indices are recognized on a trade-date basis and recorded in Trading Assets or Trading Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Income or expenses generated on the relevant trading transactions are recorded in Trading Income or Trading Expenses on the consolidated statement of income.\n\nSecurities and other monetary claims held for trading purposes are stated at fair value at the consolidated balance sheet date. Derivative financial products, such as swaps, futures and option transactions, are stated at their fair values, assuming that such transactions are terminated and settled at the consolidated balance sheet date.\n\nTrading Income and Trading Expenses include the interest received and paid during the fiscal year, the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value of securities and other monetary claims between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, and the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value of financial derivatives between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, assuming they were settled at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nFor financial derivatives, fair value is calculated on the basis of net assets or liabilities after offsetting financial assets and liabilities with respect to specific market risks and specific credit risk.\n\n## (3) Securities\n\nIn accordance with 'Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments' (the Business Accounting Deliberation Council, January 22, 1999), MHFG classifies securities, excluding those of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, into three categories based upon management's intent. These securities are accounted for as follows:\n\n- (i) Trading securities are carried at market value and included in Trading Assets.\n- (ii) Bonds held to maturity are stated at amortized cost (straight-line method) and determined by the moving average method.\n- (iii) Other securities are securities which are not classified as either trading securities or bonds held to maturity. Other securities are stated at market price (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the moving average method). Stocks and others without a quoted market price are stated at acquisition cost and determined by the moving average method. The net unrealized gains (losses) on Other securities are included directly in Net Assets, net of applicable income taxes after excluding gains and losses as a result of the fair-value hedge method.\n\nIn addition, investments in affiliates not under the equity method are stated at acquisition cost as determined by the moving average method.",

The amounts of impairment (devaluation) were \u00a54,657 million ($42,062 thousand) and \u00a541,655 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe criteria for determining whether a security's fair value has 'significantly deteriorated' are outlined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Security whose fair value is 50% or less of the acquisition cost\n- \u00b7 Security whose fair value exceeds 50% but is 70% or less of the acquisition cost and the quoted market price maintains a certain level or lower\n\n## (4) Bills Discounted\n\nIn accordance with 'Accounting and Auditing Treatment relating to Adoption of Accounting Standards for Financial Instruments for Banks' (The Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants ('JICPA') Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 24), bills discounted are accounted for as financing transactions. The banking subsidiaries have rights to sell or pledge these commercial bills, foreign exchange bills purchased and others. The face value of these bills amounted to \u00a51,614,811 million ($14,584,639 thousand) and \u00a51,341,367 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## (5) Derivative Transactions\n\nDerivative transactions are valued at fair value with changes in fair value included in current income. Fair value is calculated on the basis of net assets or liabilities after offsetting financial assets and liabilities with respect to specific market risks and specific credit risk. Derivatives qualifying as hedges are mainly accounted for using either the fair-value hedge method or the deferred method of hedge accounting (see (22) Hedge Accounting).\n\n## (6) Tangible Fixed Assets (Except for Lease Assets)\n\nDepreciation of buildings is computed mainly by the straight-line method, and that of others is computed mainly by the declining-balance method. The range of useful lives is as follows:\n\nBuildings 3 years to 50 years\n\nOthers\n\n2 years to 20 years\n\n## (7) Intangible Fixed Assets (Except for Lease Assets)\n\nAmortization of Intangible Fixed Assets is computed by the straight-line method. Development costs for internally-used software are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives of mainly from five to ten years as determined by MHFG and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## (8) Lease Assets\n\nDepreciation of lease assets booked in Tangible Fixed Assets and Intangible Fixed Assets which are concerned with finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership is mainly computed by the same method as the one applied to fixed assets owned by us.\n\n## (9) Deferred Assets\n\nBond issuance costs are expensed as incurred.",

The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed by confirming that the amount of the foreign currency position of the hedged monetary claims and liabilities is equal to or larger than that of currency swap transactions, exchange swap transactions, and similar transactions designated as the hedging instruments of the foreign exchange risk.\n\nIn addition to the above methods, these subsidiaries apply the deferred method or the fair-value hedge method to portfolio hedges of the foreign exchange risks associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates denominated in foreign currency and Other securities denominated in foreign currency (except for bonds) identified as hedged items in advance, as long as the amount of foreign currency payables of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts exceeds the amount of acquisition cost of the hedged foreign securities denominated in foreign currency.\n\n## (c) Inter-company Transactions\n\nInter-company interest rate swaps, currency swaps and similar derivatives among consolidated companies or between trading accounts and other accounts, which are designated as hedges, are not eliminated and related gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income or deferred under hedge accounting, because these intercompany derivatives are executed according to the criteria for appropriate outside third-party cover operations which are treated as hedge transactions objectively in accordance with JICPA Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 24 and 25.\n\nAs for certain assets and liabilities of MHFG and its consolidated subsidiaries, the deferred method, the fair-value hedge method or the exceptional accrual method for interest rate swaps are applied.\n\n- (d) Hedging relationships which apply 'Treatment of Hedge Accounting for Financial Instruments that Reference LIBOR' Among above (a) to (c), all hedging relationships included in the scope of applying the 'Treatment of Hedge Accounting for Financial Instruments that Reference LIBOR' (ASBJ Practical Solutions No.40, September 29, 2020) are subject to this exceptional treatment.

Additional Information\n\n## (The Board Benefit Trust ('BBT') Program)\n\nSince MHFG operates its business to contribute to the creation of value for diverse stakeholders and realize improved corporate value through the continuous and stable growth of MHFG group pursuant to MHFG's basic management policy defined under the Mizuho Financial Group's Corporate Identity, MHFG has introduced a stock compensation program using a trust (the 'Program') that functions as an incentive for each Director, Executive Officer, and Specialist Officer to exert maximum effort in performing his or her duties, and also as consideration for such exertion of effort.\n\n## (1) Outline of the Program\n\nThe Program has adopted the Board Benefit Trust ('BBT') framework. MHFG's shares on the stock market will be acquired through a trust established based on the underlying funds contributed by MHFG, and MHFG's shares will be distributed to Directors and Executive Officers of MHFG, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. (the 'Company Group') in accordance with the Rules on Distribution of Shares to be prescribed in advance. The framework consists of the stock compensation program based on the Company Group Officer's position in their respective company ('Stock Compensation I') and the stock compensation program based on the performance evaluation of the Company Group ('Stock Compensation II').\n\nStock Compensation I will be paid at the time of retirement in the form of shares of MHFG calculated based on their position.\n\nA system is adopted which enables a decrease or forfeiture of the amount depending on the performance of the company or the individual.\n\nStock Compensation II will be paid in the form of shares of MHFG and will be deferred over three years, which is calculated based on the status of achieving our Five-Year Business Plan. A system is adopted which enables a decrease or forfeiture of the amount depending on the performance of the company or the individual.\n\nUpon the payment of stock compensation under the Program, MHFG may, for a certain portion, pay a monetary amount equivalent to the market value of its stock in lieu of stock compensation in accordance with the Rules on Distribution of Shares.\n\nVoting rights related to MHFG's shares belonging to the trust assets under the trust shall not be exercised.\n\n## (2) MHFG's Shares Outstanding in the Trust\n\nMHFG's shares outstanding in the trust are recognized as Treasury Stock under Net Assets at the carrying amount (excluding the amount of incidental expenses) in the trust. The carrying amount of such Treasury Stock as of March 31, 2021 was \u00a54,144 million ($37,436 thousand) for 2,544 thousand shares (the carrying amount as of March 31, 2020 was \u00a53,485 million for 19,636 thousand shares).

The unutilized balance of these contracts amounted to \u00a5107,724,379 million ($972,944,177 thousand) and \u00a590,835,753 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

A provision is included in many of these contracts that entitles the banking subsidiaries to refuse the execution of loans, or reduce the maximum amount under contracts when there is a change in the financial situation, necessity to preserve a claim, or other similar reasons. The banking subsidiaries require collateral such as real estate and securities when deemed necessary at the time the contracts are entered into. In addition, they periodically monitor customers' business conditions in accordance with internally established standards and take necessary measures to manage credit risks such as amendments to contracts.\n\n## 15.

Matters Relating to the Conditions of Financial Instruments\n\n## (1) Policy on Financial Instruments\n\nMizuho Financial Group (MHFG), which primarily engages in banking business, incurs financial liabilities such as customer deposits and market deposits on the funding side while holding financial assets such as customer loans, stocks and bonds on the investment side, and also engages in trading business for certain financial products. Some majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries and other subsidiaries conduct securities business and other financial business.\n\nFor above funding and investment business, MHFG appropriately manages risks of each financial instrument and carefully watches term-gaps and other risk factors.\n\n## (2) Contents and Risk of Financial Products\n\nThe main financial assets of the Mizuho group consist of loans to customers, government bonds and stocks. These financial assets are subject to various types of risk that may cause the Group to incur losses due to a decline in, or total loss of, the value of assets, as a result of deterioration in a counterparty's and/or an issuer's financial position ('credit risk'), or due to a decline in the value of assets caused by fluctuations in interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates and so on ('market risk'). The Group may also be exposed to the risk of incurring losses when it becomes impossible to execute transactions in the market because of market confusion or losses arising from transactions at prices that are significantly less favorable than usual ('market liquidity risk ').\n\nThe main financing source of the Mizuho group is a stable source of deposits from its customers in addition to direct funding from the financial market. These financing sources are subject to the risk of losses ('liquidity risk') arising from funding difficulties due to market disruption or a deterioration in our financial position that makes it difficult for us to raise the necessary funds or that forces us to raise funds at significantly higher interest rates than usual.\n\nIn addition, the Mizuho group uses derivative financial products to control the interest rate risk related to the assets and liabilities of the Group, as part of our asset and liability management ('ALM'). The Group primarily utilizes the portfolio hedge by grouping numerous financial assets and liabilities such as loans and deposits into similar interest risk units in accordance with risk management policies. Some derivative products like interest rate swaps are used as hedging methods for cash-flow hedges or fair value hedges. The Group applies hedge accounting to the majority of these products, treating them as deferred hedges. The effectiveness of the hedges is assessed periodically by regression analysis and other methods to ensure whether the derivative financial products effectively work in order to offset the exposure to changes in fair value and variable cash flows from hedged items. It should be noted that the Mizuho Group uses derivative financial products for trading purposes and so on as well.\n\n## (3) Risk Management for Financial Products\n\n## (a) Commitment to Risk Management\n\nWe recognize the conducting of operations tailored to the risks and managing such risks as a key issue relating to overall management. In order to implement our business strategy while maintaining our financial stability, we maintain comprehensive risk management and control measures.\n\nWe maintain basic policies for risk management established by our Board of Directors that are applicable to the entire Mizuho group. These policies clearly define the kinds of risks to be managed, set forth the organizational structure and provide for the human resources training necessary for appropriate levels of risk management. The policies also provide for audits to measure the effectiveness and suitability of the risk management structure. In line with these basic policies, we maintain various measures to strengthen and enhance the sophistication of our risk management system.\n\n## (b) General Concept of Risk Management\n\nWe classify our risk exposures according to the various kinds of risk, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk, and manage each type of risk according to its characteristics.\n\nIn addition to managing each type of risk individually, we have established a risk management structure to identify and evaluate overall risk and, where necessary, to devise appropriate responses to keep risk within limits that are managerially acceptable in both qualitative and quantitative terms.\n\nMore specifically, we allocate risk capital to core group companies, including their respective subsidiaries, to control risk within the limits set for each company. We also control risk within managerially acceptable limits by",

To ensure the ongoing financial health of Mizuho Financial Group, we regularly monitor the manner in which risk capital is being used in order to obtain a proper grasp of the risk profile within this framework. Reports are also submitted to the Board of Directors and other committees of each company.\n\n## (c) Credit Risk Management\n\nThe Board of Directors of Mizuho Financial Group determines basic matters pertaining to credit risk management. In addition, we have established the Risk Management Committee, as one of its Business Policy Committees. This committee broadly discusses and coordinates basic policy in connection with credit risk management matters in connection with overall credit portfolio management and credit risk monitoring for the Mizuho group. Under the control of the Chief Risk Officer of Mizuho Financial Group, the Credit Risk Management Department and the Risk Management Department jointly monitor, analyze and submit suggestions concerning credit risk and formulate and execute plans in connection with basic matters pertaining to credit risk management.\n\nWe have adopted two different but mutually complementary approaches in credit risk management. The first approach is 'credit management,' in which we manage the process for each individual transaction and individual obligor from execution until collection, based on our assessment of the credit quality of the customer. Through this process, we curb losses in the case of a credit event. The second is 'credit portfolio management,' in which we utilize statistical methods to assess the potential for losses related to credit risk. Through this process, we identify credit risk and respond appropriately.\n\nWe use statistical methods to manage the possibility of losses by measuring the expected average loss for a oneyear risk horizon ('expected loss') and the maximum loss within a certain confidence interval ('credit VAR'). The difference between expected loss and credit VAR is measured as the credit risk amount ('unexpected loss').Our principal banking subsidiaries have established guidelines to manage 'credit concentration risk,' which stems from granting excessive credit to certain corporate groups.\n\nThe Board of Directors of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies determines key matters pertaining to credit risk management by establishing their respective basic policies in line with the basic policies for credit risk management set forth by Mizuho Financial Group. Their respective Business Policy Committees are responsible for discussing and coordinating overall management of their individual credit portfolios and transaction policies towards obligors.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer of each principal banking subsidiary and core group company is responsible for matters relating to planning and implementing credit risk management. Departments in charge of credit risk management are responsible for planning and administering credit risk management and conducting credit risk measuring and monitoring. Credit Departments determine policies and approves/disapproves individual transactions regarding review and management of and collection from customers in accordance with the lines of authority set forth by each principal banking subsidiary. In addition, each of our principal banking subsidiaries has also established internal audit groups that are independent of the business departments in order to ensure appropriate credit risk management.\n\n## (d) Market Risk Management\n\nThe Board of Directors of Mizuho Financial Group determines basic matters pertaining to market risk management policies. In addition, we have established the Risk Management Committee, as one of its Business Policy Committees. The committee broadly discusses and coordinates matters concerning basic policy and operations in connection with market risk management and market risk monitoring, and proposes measures to be taken in emergencies such as sudden market changes.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for matters relating to market risk management planning and operations. The Risk Management Department of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for monitoring market risk, reports and analyses, proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans relating to market risk management. In addition, the department assesses and manages the overall market risk of the Mizuho group as a whole and keeps track of the market risk situation of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies. The department also submits reports to the President & CEO on a daily basis and to our Board of Directors and the executive management committee of Mizuho Financial Group on a regular basis.\n\nTo manage market risk, we set limits that correspond to risk capital allocations. The amount of risk capital allocated to market risk corresponds to VAR and additional costs that may arise in order to close relevant positions.",

Based on a common Mizuho Group risk capital allocation framework, the above-mentioned companies manage market risk by setting limits according to the risk capital allocated to market risk by Mizuho Financial Group. They have the same market risk management structure as the Mizuho Financial Group, such as their Business Policy Committees being responsible for overall discussion and coordination of the market risk management.\n\nIn addition, they have established middle offices specializing in risk management that are independent of their front offices, which engage in market transactions, and their back offices, which are responsible for book entries and settlements. This system enables them to achieve mutual checks and control over market operations.\n\nWhen VAR is not adequate to control risk, the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices such as 10 BPV (Basis Point Value), carry out stress tests and set stop loss limits as needed.\n\n## (e) Situation of Market Risk\n\n## i.

Cross-shareholdings\n\nFor cross-shareholdings, we take the same market risk management approach as that for Banking and Trading businesses with the use of VAR and risk indices.\n\nThe risk index for the cross-shareholdings (sensitivity of the portfolio to a 1% change in the equity index of TOPIX) is \u00a524.6 billion ($222,805 thousand) and \u00a513.9 billion for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## iv. Risk management using VAR\n\nVAR is a commonly used market risk management technique with statistical assumptions to measure maximum possible loss in the market, which will be incurred to the holding portfolio in a certain period with some probability. It should be noted that in general VAR model has the following shortcomings:\n\n- \u00b7 VAR estimates could differ by assumptions of holding period, confidence interval level and approaches for the measurement.\n- \u00b7 VAR which is calculated based on historical data does not necessarily indicate an accurate future possible maximum loss.\n- \u00b7 VAR might underestimate the probability of extreme market movements when the market gets inactive as VAR assumes sales of holding portfolio and hedges in the market during the holding period for the calculation.\n- \u00b7 The use of a 99% confidence level neither takes account of, nor makes any statement about, any losses that might occur beyond this confidence level.\n\nThe historical simulation method used as the measurement technique of VAR assumes that change in a market movement follows an empirical distribution. Therefore, the model might underestimate the risk under the circumstance that the market is likely to move extremely beyond the assumption. We check the validity of the market risk measurement made by VAR approach periodically by the back-test which compares VAR with actual profit and loss. In addition to VAR, we make a wide variety of management and controls such as risk indices monitoring, implementation of stress tests, loss limit monitoring in order to make strict risk management by capturing carefully all risks, including what VAR approach is not able to cover.\n\n## (f) Liquidity Risk Management\n\nOur liquidity risk management structure is generally the same as the market risk management structure described above ('Item (d) Market Risk Management'). However, the head of the Financial Control & Accounting Group of Mizuho Financial Group is additionally responsible for matters relating to planning and running cash flow management operations, while the Financial Planning Department is responsible for monitoring and adjusting",

In addition, Cash and Due from Banks, Call Loans and Bills Purchased, Receivables under Resale Agreements, Guarantee Deposits Paid under Securities Borrowing Transactions, Call Money and Bills Sold, Payables under Repurchase Agreements, Guarantee Deposits Received under Securities Lending Transactions, and Due to Trust Accounts are omitted since these instruments are mainly settled in the short term and the fair values approximate the book values.\n\n|                                                  | Millions of yen                   | Millions of yen   | Millions of yen   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| As of March 31, 2021                             | Consolidated Balance Sheet Amount | Fair Value        | Difference        |\n| (1) Other Debt Purchased                         | \u00a53,208,004                        | \u00a53,208,136        | \u00a5132              |\n| (2) Trading Assets                               |                                   |                   |                   |\n| Trading Securities                               | 6,421,348                         | 6,421,348         | -                 |\n| (3) Money Held in Trust                          | 579,764                           | 579,764           | -                 |\n| (4) Securities                                   |                                   |                   |                   |\n| Bonds Held to Maturity                           | 885,529                           | 903,599           | 18,069            |\n| Other Securities                                 | 41,681,945                        | 41,681,945        | -                 |\n| (5) Loans and Bills Discounted                   | 83,704,675                        |                   |                   |\n| Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans *1         | (513,832)                         |                   |                   |\n|                                                  | 83,190,843                        | 84,213,843        | 1,023,000         |\n| Total Assets                                     | \u00a5135,967,435                      | \u00a5137,008,638      | \u00a51,041,203        |\n| (1) Deposits                                     | \u00a5133,312,406                      | \u00a5133,303,018      | \u00a5(9,387)          |\n| (2) Negotiable Certificates of Deposit           | 17,192,572                        | 17,191,241        | (1,331)           |\n| (3) Trading Liabilities                          |                                   |                   |                   |\n| Securities Sold, Not yet Purchased               | 2,402,420                         | 2,402,420         | -                 |\n| (4) Borrowed Money                               | 7,441,822                         | 7,435,289         | (6,533)           |\n| (5) Bonds and Notes                              | 10,321,672                        | 10,529,372        | 207,700           |\n| Total Liabilities                                | \u00a5170,670,893                      | \u00a5170,861,341      | \u00a5190,447          |\n| Derivative Transactions *2                       |                                   |                   |                   |\n| Derivative Transactions not Qualifying for Hedge |                                   |                   |                   |\n| Accounting                                       | \u00a5272,522                          |                   |                   |\n| Derivative Transactions Qualifying for Hedge     |                                   |                   |                   |\n| Accounting *3                                    | 124,703                           |                   |                   |\n| Total Derivative Transactions                    | \u00a5397,225                          | \u00a5397,225          | \u00a5 -               |",

When those are short term in nature and the book values are considered to be fair values, those other debt purchased are categorized as Level 3.\n\n## Trading Assets\n\nFair values of trading assets for which unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets are available are categorized as Level 1, which includes mainly government bonds.\n\nIn the case the market is inactive even if the quoted market price is available, those trading assets are categorized as Level 2, which includes mainly local government bonds and corporate bonds.\n\nWhen fair vales are measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows and others using significant unobservable inputs, those trading assets are categorized as Level 3, which includes mainly bonds with warrants and trust beneficiary rights.",

In the case the market is inactive even if the quoted market price is available, those securities are categorized as Level 2, which includes mainly local government bonds and corporate bonds.\n\nFair values of investment trusts are measured at the disclosed net asset value and others. Those are not categorized into Levels by applying the transitional measures set forth in Article 26 of 'Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurements.'\n\nFair values of private placement bonds are measured by discounting the total amount of principal and interest and others at interest rates based on the discount rate reflecting expected loss and various risk factors by categories based on the internal ratings and terms and are mainly categorized as Level 3 since the discount rate is unobservable.\n\nFair values of securitized products are based on valuations obtained from brokers and others, and reasonably measured prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management and are categorized as Level 3 when significant unobservable valuation inputs are used and as Level 2 when other inputs are used. In deriving reasonably measured prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management mentioned above, we used the discounted cash flow method. The price decision variables include default rates, recovery rates, prepayment rates, and discount rates.\n\nThe notes to Securities based on holding purpose are stated in '42.Fair Value of Securities and Money Held in Trust.'\n\n## Loans and Bills Discounted\n\nFair values of loans and bills discounted are measured by discounting the total amount of principal and interest and others at interest rates based on the discount rate reflecting expected loss and various risk factors by categories according to the types, internal ratings and terms of the loans and bills discounted and are categorized as Level 3 since the discount rate is unobservable.\n\nIn addition, fair values of claims against bankrupt obligors, substantially bankrupt obligors, and intensive control obligors whose bad debts are measured at the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated amounts calculated based on the recoverability from collateral and guarantees approximate the amount of claims and others minus the amount of reserves for possible losses on loans in the consolidated balance sheet as of the consolidated balance sheet date and those amount are considered to be fair values which are categorized as Level 3. Among the loans and bills discounted, for those without a fixed maturity due to loan characteristics such as limiting loans to within the value of pledged assets, book values are considered to be fair values since fair values are expected to approximate book values based on the estimated loan periods, interest rates and other conditions. Fair values of those loans and bills discounted are categorized as Level 3.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n## Deposits and Negotiable Certificates of Deposit\n\nFor demand deposits, the payment amounts required on the consolidated balance sheet date (i.e., book values) are considered to be fair values.\n\nIn addition, fair values of time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposits are calculated by classifying them based on their terms and by discounting the future cash flows. The discount rates used in such calculations are the market interest rates. Since fair values of those whose deposit terms are short (i.e., within six months) approximate book values, the book values are considered to be fair values and those fair values are categorized as Level 2.",

Those without market prices are categorized as Level 3 when the impact from unobservable valuation inputs is significant and as Level 2 when it is not significant.\n\n## Derivative Transactions\n\nDerivative transactions that can be measured at unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized as Level 1, which includes such transactions as bonds futures and interest rate futures.\n\nHowever, since most derivative transactions are over-the-counter transactions and there are no quoted market prices, market values are measured using valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method and the Black-Scholes model, depending on the type of transaction and the maturity period. The main inputs which are used in those valuation techniques are interest rate, currency rate, volatility and others. In addition, price adjustments based on credit risk of counterparty and credit risk of majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries and other consolidated subsidiaries themselves and price adjustments for unsecured funding are made. When unobservable inputs are not used or impact of unobservable inputs are not material, transactions are categorized as Level 2, which includes such transactions as plain vanilla interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards. When significant unobservable inputs are used, transactions are categorized as Level 3, which includes transactions such as commodity related transactions.",

        "page_content": "## (3) Explanation of the process of fair value measurement\n\nIn MHFG, middle-offices and back-offices have established policies and procedures related to the measurement of fair values and procedures related to usage of the valuation model. For the fair values and the level categories, the validity of the valuation techniques and valuation inputs used in fair value measurement are verified.\n\nIn fair value measurement, valuation models in which the nature, characteristics and risks of individual assets are most appropriately reflected are used. In addition, when quoted prices obtained from third parties are used, the validity of the prices is verified by appropriate methods such as confirmation of valuation techniques and used valuation inputs and comparison with the fair values of similar financial instruments.\n\n## (4) Explanation of the impact on fair values in the case where significant unobservable inputs are varied\n\n## Prepayment rate\n\nThe prepayment rate is the estimated rate at which voluntary unscheduled repayments of the principal of the underlying assets are expected to occur. The movement of the prepayment rate is generally negatively correlated with borrower delinquency. A significant change in the prepayment rate would generally significantly impact the valuation of the fair values of financial instruments either positively or negatively, depending on the structure of financial instruments.\n\n## Default rate\n\nThe default rate is an estimate of the likelihood of not collecting contractual payments. A significant increase (decrease) in the default rate would generally be accompanied by a decrease (increase) in the recovery rate and an increase (decrease) in the discount rate. It would also generally significantly impact the valuation of the fair values of financial instruments negatively (positively).\n\n## Recovery rate\n\nThe recovery rate is an estimate of the percentage of contractual payments that would be collected in the event of a default. A significant increase (decrease) in recovery rate would generally be accompanied by a decrease (increase) in the default rate. It would also generally significantly impact the valuation of the fair values of financial instruments positively (negatively).\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate is an adjustment rate to a benchmark market interest rate such as LIBOR or swap rates. It primarily consists of a risk premium component which is the amount of compensation that market participants require due to the uncertainty inherent in the financial instruments' cash flows resulting from credit risk. A significant increase (decrease) in discount rate would generally significantly impact the valuation of the fair values of financial instruments negatively (positively).\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is the likelihood of the movement of one input relative to another based on an established relationship. A significant change in correlation would significantly impact the valuation of derivatives either positively or negatively, depending on the nature of the underlying assets.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the expected change in variables over a fixed period of time. Some financial instruments benefit from an increase in volatility and others benefit from a decrease in volatility. Generally, a significant increase (decrease) in volatility would result in a significant increase (decrease) in option values and, for a long position in an option, it would result in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair values of financial instruments.",

We calculate our capital adequacy ratio on a consolidated basis based on 'the criteria used by a bank holding company for deciding whether or not the adequacy of equity capital of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries is appropriate in light of the assets owned by the bank holding company and its subsidiaries pursuant to Article 52-25 of the Banking Law' (Financial Services Agency, or FSA, Notice No.20 issued in 2006).\n\nWe also calculate our leverage ratio on a consolidated basis according to 'the criteria for evaluating the soundness of the leverage, prescribed as supplemental requirements of the criteria used by a bank holding company in deciding whether or not the adequacy of equity capital of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries is appropriate in light of the assets owned by the bank holding company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to Article 52-25 of the Banking Law' (FSA Notice No.12 issued in 2019.)\n\nLiquidity standards agreed upon by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision require our liquidity coverage ratio to surpass certain minimum standards. We calculate our consolidated liquidity coverage ratio (the 'Consolidated LCR') in accordance with the regulation 'The Evaluation Criterion on the Sound Management of Liquidity Risk Defined, Based on Banking Law Article 52-25, as One of Criteria for Bank Holding Companies to Evaluate the Soundness of Their Management and the Ones of Their Subsidiaries and Others, which is also One of Evaluation Criteria on the Soundness of the Banks' Management'(the FSA Notice No. 62 of 2014 (the 'Notice No. 62')).\n\n## \u25a0 Key Metrics\n\n## KM1: Key Metrics\n\n(millions of yen, except percentages)\n\n|

When making these assessments, we calculate the potential losses arising from assumed stress events and risk volumes, which we assess whether they balance with the group's capital. Stress events are based on risk scenarios that are formulated based on the current economic condition and the economic outlook, etc. In addition, we examine whether an appropriate return on risk is maintained in the assessments.",

The following business units have adopted AIRB approach:\n\nMizuho Financial Group, Inc., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., Mizuho Credit Guarantee Co., Ltd., Mizuho Trust Realty Company Limited, Mizuho Bank (China), Mizuho Bank (USA), Ltd., Mizuho Bank Europe N.V., and Mizuho Capital Markets LLC., Mizuho Markets Cayman LP., and Mizuho Markets Americas LLC.\n\nNote: Special purpose companies (SPCs) controlled by the above companies have also adopted the AIRB approach due to their business operations integrated with their parent companies.\n\nThe application scope of AIRB is determined through taking into account the importance for each business unit, such as the ratio of its credit RWA to that of the entire group. AIRB is generally applied to those assets held by the business units that have adopted  AIRB except for some asset classes considered immaterial for the purpose of calculating credit RWA .In addition, AIRB is used for all equity exposures regardless of what approach the business unit has adopted. With respect to credit RWA exposures under Regarded-Method, AIRB is used for those of which the look-through approach is applied except for cases where it is difficult to accurately calculate credit RWA regarding their underlying assets based on the IRB Approach and therefore reliability of credit RWA cannot be secured. The standardized approach will be applied to any of those business units and asset classes that do not meet the above conditions.\n\n## (ii) Summary of Our Internal Rating System\n\nSee pages 112 to 114 for a summary of our internal rating system and rating assignment procedures.\n\n## Estimation of parameters and validation\n\nWe use our own estimates for the parameters indicated below in the calculation of credit RWA under the Basel Framework. We generally validate the parameters by backtesting or other methods on an annual basis. Methods of estimation and validation as well as results are approved by the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe definition of default conforms to the Notice issued by Japan's Financial Services Agency.\n\n| PD   | Probability of default (likelihood of default of an obligor over a period of one year)   |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LGD  | Loss given default                                                                       |\n| EAD  | Exposure at default                                                                      |\n\n## Details of Estimates:\n\nWe estimate PD of corporate, sovereign and bank exposures per obligor rating, and that of retail exposures per pool allocations. In making estimations, we make conservative adjustments such as accounting for estimation error on the long-term average of internal default records. We supplement estimations for low default portfolios with external data. We apply the regulatory floor PD (0.03%) to A1-rated and A2-rated obligors in the measurement of credit RWA, except for sovereign exposures. The estimated parameters in almost all the PD categories such as obligor rating or pool allocations exceeded actual defaults in the last three years. The differences stemmed from such reasons as: actual defaults in the last few years were lower than the long-term average of the defaults over the entire period, which was the basis for our estimation; conservative adjustments have been made to estimated parameters.\n\nWe estimate LGD based on obligor classifications in our self-assessments or pool allocations, and protection coverage. For LGD per obligor classifications, we estimate LGD under normal economic circumstances based on prior defaulted obligor data, making adjustments in consideration of periods of economic downturn using stochastic methods. Our estimation is based on validation of the time between the default event and the closure of the exposure as well as LGD for low default portfolios etc. With regard to protection, we estimate LGD per type of collateral using some external data.\n\nWe estimate EAD based on prior defaulted obligor data.\n\n## (iii) Asset Class-based EAD Ratios to the Total EAD by Credit RWA Calculation Approach\n\n|                                 | As of March 31, 2021   | As of March 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Internal Ratings-based Approach | 98.53%                 | 98.18%                 |\n| Corporate                       | 88.99%                 | 87.78%                 |\n| Retail                          | 4.88%                  | 5.70%                  |\n| Equities                        | 2.26%                  | 1.95%                  |\n| Purchase Receivables            | 1.45%                  | 1.45%                  |\n| Others                          | 0.93%                  | 1.29%                  |\n| Standardized Approach           | 1.46%                  | 1.81%                  |\n| Total                           | 100.00%                | 100.00%                |",

Exposures to sovereign and bank is included in the category of corporate, etc. because their obligors can be presumably specified. Likewise, exposures to corporate (except specialized lending), specialized lending, equity and purchased receivables (corporate) is included in the category of corporate, etc. because the data of the respective portfolios is not separately used for PD estimation.  Since purchased receivables (retail) account for a small portion of the entire exposure, they are incorporated with any one of QRRE, residential mortgage or other retail depending on the portfolio classification of the purchased receivables.\n- 3. PD Range indicates the ranges of PD estimates for multiple consolidated internal ratings groups.\n- 4. The following shows the percentages accounted for by the respective portfolios among the credit RWA calculated by the AIRB: Corporate, etc. : 79%, QRRE: 1%, Residential mortgage : 6%, Other retail : 1%\n- 5. The number of credits is disclosed as the number of data of obligors for QRRE, residential mortgage and other retail excluding credit for business purpose.\n- 6.

Exposures to sovereign and bank is included in the category of corporate, etc. because their obligors can be presumably specified. Likewise, exposures to corporate (except specialized lending), specialized lending, equity and purchased receivables (corporate) is included in the category of corporate, etc. because the data of the respective portfolios is not separately used for PD estimation.  Since purchased receivables (retail) account for a small portion of the entire exposure, they are incorporated with any one of QRRE, residential mortgage or other retail depending on the portfolio classification of the purchased receivables.\n- 3. PD Range indicates the ranges of PD estimates for multiple consolidated internal ratings groups.\n- 4. The following shows the percentages accounted for by the respective portfolios among the credit RWA calculated by the AIRB: Corporate, etc. : 80%, QRRE: 1%, Residential mortgage : 6%, Other retail : 2%\n- 5. The number of credits is disclosed as the number of data of obligors for QRRE, residential mortgage and other retail excluding credit for business purpose.\n- 6.

In obtaining the collateral and guarantees, we evaluate the value of the collateral, guarantee performance capability of guarantor and legal enforceability, and we also conduct periodical subsequent re-evaluations. Furthermore, we monitor any concentration of risks in particular corporate groups including indirect credit exposure such as collateral issuers and guarantees. When calculating the credit risk weighted assets for capital adequacy ratio regulations, the effect of credit risk mitigation through financial collateral (mainly deposits and securities), other collateral (mainly real estate) and guarantees by \"sovereign, banks or corporations above a certain credit rating\" is reflected.\n\n## (ii) Quantitative Disclosure on Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques\n\nCounterparty risk exposures, securitization exposures, and regarded-method exposures are excluded from the amount of credit risk exposures below.\n\n## (A) CR3: Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Overview\n\n|    |                              |                      |                      |                      |                                | (Millions of yen)           |\n|----|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|    |                              | As of March 31, 2021 | As of March 31, 2021 | As of March 31, 2021 | As of March 31, 2021           | As of March 31, 2021        |\n|    |                              | a                    | b                    | c                    | d                              | e                           |\n|    |                              | Exposures            |                      | Exposures secured    | Exposures secured by financial | Exposures secured by credit |\n|    |                              | unsecured            | Exposures secured    | by collateral        | guarantees                     | derivatives                 |\n| 1  | Loans                        | \u00a565,015,186          | \u00a516,659,931          | \u00a56,795,255           | \u00a57,400,226                     | \u00a55,846                      |\n| 2  | Debt securities              | 35,863,398           | 485,654              | 346,319              | 29,734                         | -                           |\n| 3  | Other on balance debt assets | 52,242,536           | 69,344               | 2,350                | 52,901                         | -                           |\n| 4  | Total (1+2+3)                | \u00a5153,121,122         | \u00a517,214,930          | \u00a57,143,925           | \u00a57,482,862                     | \u00a55,846                      |\n| 5  | Of which defaulted           | 564,119              | 331,171              | 138,736              | 63,834                         | -                           |\n\nNotes: 1.

For derivatives transactions and repurchase transactions, in cases in which a bilateral netting agreement is valid in light of the legal system of the relevant jurisdiction, we take its effect into consideration. As to derivatives transactions with financial institutions, etc., we periodically, where necessary, deliver and receive collateral to and from the counterparty based on the replacement cost to mitigate credit risk (collateralized derivatives transactions).

When conducting a securitization as an originator, we consider such transactions from various aspects, including the effects of reduction of economic capital and improvement of return on risk as well as the practical effects of risk transfers, and make a comprehensive judgment on the structure and appropriateness of such transactions.\n\n## (b) Securitization program (ABCP/ABL) sponsor\n\nAs a means of supporting our customers in the securitization of their account receivables and notes receivables, etc., we retain securitization exposure by providing asset-backed loans (ABLs, which are on-balance-sheet transactions), and providing asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) backup lines (off-balance-sheet transactions), as sponsor to special purpose companies (in the form of Cayman Islands Corporations, etc.). In such cases, in addition to gaining firm understanding of the actual risk profile through due diligence from the viewpoint of investors, we assign internal ratings and make evaluations by assessing such transactions and carefully managing the exposure together with other direct loan assets.\n\n## (c) Investment in alternative credit risk assets ('Securitization Transactions as an Investor')\n\nWe hold securitization products, such as ABS, CMBS, RMBS, and CDO, and resecuritization products, the underlying assets of which are mainly RMBS and CDO, etc., for the purpose of investing in alternative credit risk assets that are different from conventional credit risk assets in order to diversify our investment portfolio. The Risk Management Committee, etc. set limits on the amount of investment for Securitization Transactions as an Investor, and we maintain a stringent structure for management of such transactions. In addition, we implement stress tests based on scenarios under the market liquidity depletion and sharp price declines.\n\nIn addition, we undertake various securitization program arrangements such as ABL, ABCP and trust schemes, etc., as a means of financing for our customers. We endeavor to understand the actual risk profile, including the underlying assets, and to appropriately disclose the risks and terms of the program to the customers who invest in the product.\n\nFurthermore, we actively act as servicer for securitization transactions, offer settlement account facilities (servicer cash advance) and provide interest rate swaps to securitization conduits.\n\nOne of our affiliated entities ,Mizuho Leasing Company, Ltd, holds securitization products in which we are involved as originators or sponsors.\n\nThe securitization conduits included within the scope of consolidation are as follows:\n\nROCK FIELD CORPORATION, FANTASTIC FUNDING CORPORATION, ARTEMIS FUNDING CORPORATION, N&M FUNDING CORPORATION, Denshi Saiken Kaitori Godo Kaisha, JAPAN SECURITIZATION CORPORATION, Allstar Funding Co., Ltd, SPARCS FUNDING CORPORATION, PERPETUAL FUNDING CORPORATION, Working Capital Management Co. L.P., ALWAYS CAPITAL CORPORATION, HORIZON CAPITAL CORPORATION\n\nThere are no securitization conduits that provide credit enhancement beyond what is provided in agreements.\n\n## Overview of risk profile of securitization transactions and monitoring system\n\nIn addition to price fluctuation and market liquidity risks, securitization and resecuritization products are exposed to risks related to default, recovery and granularity of underlying asset portfolio. The structure of these products also contains risks related to the originators, the administrators, trustees and managers of the underlying assets.\n\nTo address these risks, we also analyze the structure in terms of the underlying assets and credit events. We monitor the ability, quality and operating performance of originators and managers in charge of controlling the underlying assets as well as covenant information and credit status of the parties related to the program. In addition, for resecuritization products, we pay attention to the underlying assets of the underlying securitization products. We also assign internal ratings to all products and review the rating at least once a year. If there is a change in the credit situations, we will review the internal rating as appropriate. As mentioned above, we have established a system to comprehensively understand the risk characteristics of securitization exposures and manage these exposures.\n\nWe conduct credit risk measurements on all credit transactions, including securitization transactions. Furthermore, we carry out periodic monitoring on investment amount and performance on securitization transactions and report the situations to our Risk Management Committee, etc.",

        "page_content": "## Response to Basel Framework\n\nIn calculating credit risk-weighted assets of securitization exposure, we apply the internal-ratings-based approach ('IRBA') if we have sufficient information regarding all the underlying assets for IRBA. If IRBA cannot be applied to a certain asset and it has a rating obtained from an eligible external credit assessment institution, we apply the External rating-based approach ('ERBA') We apply the standardized approach ('SA') in other cases pursuant to the FSA Notice No. 20. We apply a risk weight of 1,250% under Basel III when neither IRBA, ERBA nor SA can be applied.\n\nIn terms of securitization exposure in our trading book that is subject to market risk regulations, we adopt the standardized measurement method and calculate market risk equivalent amounts in connection with the specific risks of securitization products based on risk weights according to ratings assigned by eligible external credit assessment institutions pursuant to the FSA Notice No. 20.\n\nAs for the eligible external credit assessment institutions, we refer to Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR), Moody's Investors Service Inc. (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. in determining securitization exposure risk weight.\n\n## (2) Accounting Policies for Securitization Transactions\n\nThe point at which financial assets and liabilities relating to securitization transactions begin or cease to be recognized, their evaluation and accounting treatment are pursuant to \"Accounting Standards Relating to Financial Products\"(Business Accounting Standards No. 10).\n\n## (3) Quantitative Disclosure on Securitization Exposures\n\n## (A) SEC1: Securitization Exposures in the Banking Book by Type of Underlying Assets\n\n(Millions of yen)\n\n|    |                              | As of March 31, 2021    | As of March 31, 2021    | As of March 31, 2021    | As of March 31, 2021   | As of March 31, 2021   | As of March 31, 2021                                                                            | As of March 31, 2021     | As of March 31, 2021   | As of March 31, 2021   |\n|----|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|    |                              | a                       | b                       | c                       | d                      | e                      | f                                                                                               | g                        | h                      | i                      |\n|    |                              | Bank acts as originator | Bank acts as originator | Bank acts as originator | Bank acts as sponsor   | Bank acts as sponsor   | Bank acts as sponsor                                                                            | Banks acts as investor   | Banks acts as investor | Banks acts as investor |\n|    | type of underlying assets    |                         |                         |                         |                        |                        | Traditional Synthetic Sub-total Traditional Synthetic Sub-total Traditional Synthetic Sub-total |                          |                        |                        |\n| 1  | Retail (total) -

In principle, we calculate market risk equivalent amounts by determining both general market risk and specific risk by applying the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to the former and the standardized approach to the latter, and by simply adding up both amounts. The Internal Models Approach is applied to trading transactions and calculated by adding up VAR and stressed VAR.\n\n| (A) MR1 \uff1a Market risk under standardized approach (Millions of yen)   | (A) MR1 \uff1a Market risk under standardized approach (Millions of yen)   | (A) MR1 \uff1a Market risk under standardized approach (Millions of yen)   | (A) MR1 \uff1a Market risk under standardized approach (Millions of yen)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No.                                                                    |                                                                        | As of March 31, 2021 RWA (Risk equivalent / 8%)                        | As of March 31, 2020 RWA (Risk equivalent / 8%)                        |\n| 1                                                                      | Interest rate risk (general and specific)                              | \u00a5454,781                                                               | \u00a5428,815                                                               |\n| 2                                                                      | Equity risk (general and specific)                                     | 339,581                                                                | 312,525                                                                |\n| 3                                                                      | Foreign exchange risk                                                  | 57,630                                                                 | 47,344                                                                 |\n| 4                                                                      | Commodity risk                                                         | 133,209                                                                | 182,860                                                                |\n|                                                                        | Options                                                                |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| 5                                                                      | Simplified approach                                                    | -

The historical simulation method is used for the calculation of VAR and stressed VAR under the Internal Models Approach.\n- 2. VAR is measured based on the observation period of 3 years (801 business days), a 99% confidence interval and a 1-day holding period. This 1-day VAR is scaled up to 10business day VAR using the square-root-of-time (\u221aT) rule. We update historical data on a daily basis, in principle, and do not weight such data. When re-pricing instruments, we use the full revaluation method, a sensitivity-based approach and the like. We consider change width or rate as market volatility of risk factors according to product attributes.\n- 3. When measuring stressed VAR, the same measurement approach as VAR is used except for the observation period of 1 year (265 business days). As a stressed period,\n- we select a period which has an adequate length of time and is considered the most stressful under a certain set of criteria established based on the most recent portfolio.\n- 4. When applying the internal model, we regularly verify the preconditions used for VAR measurement.",

interest rate shock scenarios (i.e. parallel up and downwards shifts in the yield curve and the like). \u0394EVE and \u0394NII change according to changes in the banking portfolio.\n\n| (A) IRRBB1

Decreased economic values and interest income are shown as positive values.\n\n- 3. When aggregating the respective \u0394EVE of multiple currencies, we use the internal model that estimates the correlations between the key currencies based on historical data. When aggregating the respective \u0394NII of multiple currencies, we simply add their respective \u0394NII.\n- 4. For the calculation of \u0394EVE and \u0394NII, we set an appropriate interest rate and spread according to a certain discount rate and reference rate.\n- 5.

With regard to subsidiaries and related companies in which we invest, we manage their risks on a consolidated basis, and manage them appropriately in accordance with their management classification. In addition, securities, a part of equity exposure, are valued as follows: Securities are stated at market price (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the moving average method). Stocks and others without a quoted market price are stated at acquisition cost and determined by the moving average method.\n\n## \u25a0 Operational risk\n\n## (1) Summary of Operational Risk Management and Procedures\n\nSee pages 120 to 121 for a summary of our operational risk management policies, etc.\n\n## (2) Approach Used for the Measurement of Operational Risk Equivalent\n\nWe use the Advanced Measurement Approach for the calculation of operational risk equivalent.

Our Consolidated LCR disclosed herein does not differ significantly from our original expectations, and we do not expect our Consolidated LCR to deviate significantly from the current level in the future.\n\n## (C) Composition of the total HQLA allowed to be included in the calculation\n\nThere are no significant changes in the composition, such as by currency or type, and geographic distribution of the HQLA allowed to be included in the calculation.

Compatibility between system for compensation of \"Subject directors and employees\" and risk management\n- The compensation of employees in risk management department, compliance department and internal audit department is decided in accordance with the salary and bonus system, and specific payment amounts are conclusively determined in accordance with employee performance evaluations made by the relevant department and the human resources department, independent from departments furthering business.\n\nEach employee of the risk management department, the compliance department and the internal audit department sets their own objectives in the employee performance evaluations, subject to the approval of their superiors. The degree to which the objectives are achieved is evaluated by taking into account the degree of the employee's contribution to the establishment of a system for risk management, compliance and internal audit.\n\n## 2.Linking compensation of \"Subject directors and employees\" with performance\n\nThe performance payments and performance-based stock compensation for \"Officers Responsible for Business Execution\" shall be made or paid in accordance with each officer's performance, the result of organizations (our inhouse companies and units, etc.) that each Officer, etc., in charge of, and the status of achieving our 5-Year Business Plan etc., against the annual business plan in addition to the standard amount of each positon. A certain amount of the performance payments and the entire amount of the performance-based stock compensation shall be made or paid in deferred payments over three years, and a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount may be made depending on the performance, etc., of the company and such officer. It should be noted that certain \"Subject directors and employees\" have entered into compensation-related contracts. Stock compensation for \"Non-Executive Officers Responsible for Management Supervision\" shall be made in accordance with the standard amount set for each position, and the payment level shall not change based on the performance of each officer. With regard to compensation for other employees, salary is determined according to their job duties and responsibilities. In addition, the proportion linked to the performance bonus is determined through appropriately and comprehensively evaluating the contribution to performance, including the degree of contribution to the organization, etc., so as not to become excessively performance based.",

The stated amount is the total amount for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\n- 4. No. 7, 'Fixed compensation,' 'Other compensation amount,' includes condolence money insurance premiums, based on the decision of our Compensation Committee.\n- 5.

For stock compensation and performance-based stock compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we plan to defer payment over the three-year period from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.\n- 7.

Basic principles\n\nWe are committed to growing together with our customers in a stable and sustainable manner and bringing together our group-wide expertise to contribute to the prosperity of economies and societies throughout the world as the leading Japanese financial services group with a global presence and a broad customer base. For this reason, we place one of the highest management priorities on continuing to disclose information to our customers, shareholders, and investors both in and outside Japan in a fair, timely and appropriate manner, in order that they may form proper judgments and appraisals of the group. To achieve this aim, we observe applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules relating to corporate disclosure, and we establish and implement appropriate Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n\n## 2. Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n## (1)  Establishment and implementation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Disclosure Controls and Procedures are established to observe applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules and to implement fair, timely and appropriate corporate disclosure. The Disclosure Controls and Procedures are the process carried out by directors, officers and employees of Mizuho Financial Group and include Internal Controls over Financial Reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Financial Reporting and the Preparation of Financial Statements. We have established the basic principles underlying our Disclosure Controls and Procedures as well as our internal rules related to Disclosure Controls and Procedures that govern the management framework for the entire Mizuho Financial Group including group companies, and we endeavor to establish, implement and continuously improve our Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Disclosure Committee is the Business Policy Committee that is responsible for discussing and coordinating matters relating to Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n\n## (2)  Evaluation of effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Disclosure Controls and Procedures are documented, and evaluation of the overall effectiveness of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures is conducted regularly by reviewing the contents of such documentation and their implementation. In addition, evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures is conducted through internal audits.\n\n## (3)   Others\n\nWe established a 'Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals' to be observed by all directors and executive officers, as well as all managers and other employees within Mizuho Financial Group who engage in financial reporting, accounting or disclosure. We have also developed the 'internal control and audit hotline', a system designed for reporting questionable accounting, internal control, or auditing matters from both inside and outside Mizuho Financial Group.\n\n## 3. Disclosure methods, other\n\n## (1) Disclosure methods\n\nWith respect to the information which is required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable domestic and international\n\nlaws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules, we follow the defined disclosure procedures such as publishing such information in business reports (Jigyo-Hokoku), annual securities reports (Yukashoken-Hokokusho), Integrated Report (Annual Review) and other disclosure publications, as well as providing such information through the information distribution systems of domestic and international stock exchanges and through press releases. We also endeavor to disclose other information in a fair, timely and appropriate manner. When we disclose such information, we basically publish on our website the information we disclose. In addition, we endeavor to utilize the latest disclosure methods and tools to provide more fair and widespread disclosure.\n\n## (2) Investor relations activities\n\nInvestor relations activities to market participants both in and outside Japan such as shareholders, investors and securities analysts are conducted by the President & Group CEO, Group CFO, Chief IR Officer, and executives and employees designated by them. In accordance with our basic principles described in section 1 above, and with due attention to two-way communication, we endeavor sincerely to facilitate a proper understanding of our management strategies, financial condition and other matters. In this way, we aim to earn the trust of the market and obtain an appropriate market reputation.\n\nBeginning with the disclosure required by applicable domestic and international laws and regulations as well as stock exchange rules, we endeavor to grasp properly the types of information desired by the market and to disclose useful and appropriate information voluntarily and proactively, in accordance with the socalled Fair Disclosure Rule ('FDR'). Regarding disclosure of information we consider particularly important, we communicate such information on an ad hoc basis as and when necessary, even if a press release has already been issued, through such means as special briefing sessions.\n\nIn addition, we respect various disclosure principles including fair disclosure. Accordingly, at individual calls, private meetings or conferences hosted or attended by representatives of Mizuho Financial Group we endeavor to limit carefully our explanations to matters already disclosed and facts commonly known.\n\nShould we happen to disclose important information such as information subject to insider trading regulations and/or undisclosed financial results that might have a significant influence on stock prices, we endeavor to take necessary action such as officially announcing the information as soon as possible, in accordance with FDR.\n\n## (3) Correction of misconceptions in the markets\n\nIf we identify significant misconceptions regarding Mizuho Financial Group in the market due to the spread of rumors or otherwise, we endeavor to investigate their causes and correct such misconceptions promptly.",
