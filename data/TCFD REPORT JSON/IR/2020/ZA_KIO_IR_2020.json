        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\n## Reporting scope and boundary\n\nThis report presents Kumba's strategic framework for creating value over the short, medium and long term; it provides a concise review of how the Company's performance and governance over the past year is delivering on this strategy and includes a frank reflection on how we have created, preserved or eroded value over time.\n\nThe report provides information relating to Kumba's business model, operating context, material risks and opportunities, and governance and operational performance for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. It covers the activities and impacts of the following operations over which we have direct control: our Sishen and Kolomela operations, our corporate office in Centurion, our operation at Saldanha port, and our marketing division. We also consider the risks, opportunities and outcomes of our business activities on the various stakeholders who are affected by what we do. These stakeholders and their interests are described on page 40 and an overview of the principal outcomes of our activities is provided on pages 22 to 27. In addition, we have published annual financial statements (AFS), a sustainability report (SR), and an Ore Reserve (and Saleable Product) and Mineral Resource (ORMR) report. The reporting process for all our reports has been guided by the principles and requirements contained in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the IIRC's recently revised International <IR> Framework, the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, the King IV TM Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa 2016 (King IV TM ), the JSE Listings Requirements, and the Companies Act No 71 of 2008.\n\n## Our approach to materiality\n\nThis report provides information that we believe is of relevance to current and prospective investors, and to any other stakeholder who wishes to make an informed assessment of Kumba's ability to generate value over the short, medium and long term. We have sought to ensure that all the information in this report relates to matters that have a material bearing on value creation at Kumba.\n\nUnderstanding our business (page 14 and 15), our business model (page 18) and our activities and impacts on the capitals across our value chain (page 20), forms the basis for appreciating how Kumba creates, preserves or erodes value, and for identifying those issues impacting value.\n\nOur ability to create value is determined by the quality of our response to our operating context (page 33), the material risks and opportunities facing our business (page 43), and the material interests of our key stakeholders (page 40). Making an informed assessment of the quality of our strategic response requires an appreciation of our strategy (page 6), our performance (page 12), our leadership team (page 82), and our governance and remuneration practices (page 86).\n\n## Our materiality process\n\nTo identify the material matters for inclusion in our integrated reports, each year we run an independently facilitated materiality discussion with around 15 members of our executive and senior management teams. This annual materiality review includes a detailed consideration of the following issues:\n\n- (i) Our business model: how Kumba creates value;\n- (ii) Outcomes: the material impacts and influence of our activities on the six capitals across our value chain;\n- (iii) The external environment: considering the most material trends, risks and opportunities impacting value;\n- (iv) Stakeholders: noting the material interests of our key stakeholders; and\n- (v) Strategy: the implications of (and for) our business strategy of this analysis. The results of this materiality process inform our annual reports. A report of the outcomes of the materiality process is available on request.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assurance\n\nWe use a combined assurance model that includes assurance obtained from management and from our internal and external assurance providers. This year, PwC assured our 2020 AFS (see page 19 of AFS), while Nexia SAB&T assured key sustainability information in our 2020 SR (see page 117 of the SR). Both of those processes inform our 2020 IR, which contains both financial and non-financial indicators. Due to the national lockdown restrictions imposed by the South African government in reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, the planned external audits for Sishen Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources and associated estimation processes have been postponed to 2021. Kumba follows a structured internal and external review programme to verify representative Ore Reserves (and saleable product) as well as Mineral Resources estimation.\n\nOur Audit Committee provides internal assurance to the Board on an annual basis on the execution of the combined assurance plan. The group's financial, operating, compliance and risk management controls are assessed by the group's internal audit function, overseen by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee report is on pages 16 to 18 of the AFS.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are collectively underpinned by key strategic enablers.\n\n## Horizon 1\n\n## (short term) Unlock our full asset potential\n\nShort-term initiatives aimed at enhancing product premium, and improve operational efficiency and contain C1 unit costs at or below US$34/tonne. These strategic initiatives, with low capital intensity and that optimise technology, include:\n\n- \u00b7 operating assets at their full potential - by improving equipment efficiency and further enhancing labour productivity at our mines\n- \u00b7 reducing external spend - through a mixture of commercial levers (driving price and supplier consolidation improvements) and technical levers (optimising specifications, demand management and total cost of ownership)\n- \u00b7 improving organisational e/ffectiveness optimising our Anglo Operating Model and driving efficiencies though a leaner and more effective head office and shared services function\n- \u00b7 optimising our product portfolio - thereby maximising price premia\n\n## Horizon 2 (medium term) Leveraging our endowment\n\nIn addition to improving the performance of our current assets, we have identified selected opportunities to leverage our endowment, grow our core business and further extend life-ofmine. These opportunities include:\n\n- \u00b7 unlocking logistics capacity to reach optimal rail and port capacity\n- \u00b7 beneficiating in situ and stockpiled/discard materials through ultra-high dense media separation (UHDMS) technologies\n- \u00b7 realising various life-extension projects around Kolomela through exploration\n- \u00b7 identifying specific business development initiatives to consolidate the Northern Cape region\n- \u00b7 reducing the carbon footprint at our operations\n\nThese opportunities are more complex in nature to deliver than Horizon 1, as these require higher capital investment, have a longer timeframe, and are largely dependent on successful negotiations with external stakeholders or on external factors such as technology development. We are confident, however, that they could deliver further margin improvements and extend the life of our Northern Cape operations to 2040.\n\n## Horizon 3 (long term)\n\nOptimising competencies and assets to sustain and expand the business\n\nWhile Horizons 1 and 2 focus on core business activities, Horizon 3 involves identifying a wide range of potential business extension opportunities that fit well with Kumba's strategic direction, while operating within a circular economy and remaining relevant within a decarbonising world.\n\nThese opportunities seek to leverage Kumba's capabilities and resources, including its access to the broader Anglo American Group, and its agility as a mid-tier player.\n\nThree transformation horizons",

        "page_content": "Our business\n\nChairperson's review\n\nLooking back on a year of unprecedented\n\nchallenges, Kumba has emerged a resilient\n\ncorporate citizen. Its rapid and effective\n\nresponse to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\ndemonstrated both its underlying ethos\n\nof 'zero harm' and 'safety first', as well\n\nas its strategic and operational agility\n\nin responding to a volatile operating\n\nenvironment.\n\nDr Mandla Gantsho\n\nChairperson\n\nRe-imagining mining to\n\n## Caring response to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe immediate priority in the Company's response to the pandemic was to protect the lives and livelihoods of employees and their dependants, as well as of suppliers and host communities. Through its WeCare Covid-19 response programme, Kumba proactively implemented a comprehensive set of riskbased prevention and control measures. Dedicated resources have been provided for extensive screening, testing, case management and return-to-work activities, backed up by specific interventions to support the mental health and wellbeing of employees.\n\nWorkplace initiatives were complemented by collaborative community response plans aimed at supporting host communities. Kumba provided essential services such as water, healthcare packs and food parcels, distributed PPE and bulk sanitisers to clinics and hospitals in the area, and donated face masks to schools. The Company also successfully implemented a community primary healthcare plan, supporting remote host community clinics in screening, testing, tracing and caring for those who tested positive while managing existing chronic diseases. These initiatives, and the collaborative manner in which they were developed and rolled out, are indicative of the \"peoplefirst\" mindset that informs Kumba's decisions and actions.\n\n## Strong financial performance in a buoyant commodity market\n\nKumba has delivered a very satisfactory financial and operational performance, supported by a buoyant commodity market and favourable exchange rate. We saw exceptional growth in EBITDA of 37% to R45.8 billion, a return on capital employed of 109% (up from 83% in 2019), and cash flow from operations up 16% to R40.3 billion. Given Kumba's strong performance and balance sheet, the Board declared a final cash dividend of R41.30 per share. Combined with the interim dividend of R19.60 per share, this represents a total pay-out ratio of 86% of headline earning per share for 2020, in excess of our 50 to 75% dividend pay-out policy. In total, this year the Company declared R19.6 billion in value for\n\n16\n\nKumba Iron Ore Limited\n\nIntegrated Report 2020\n\nshareholders, and R29.2 billion in value for employees, the fiscus and BEE suppliers, supporting our investment commitment in South Africa.\n\nOperational performance were in line with guidance. Production volumes were mainly impacted by Covid-19-related restrictions, weather-related delays and equipment reliability challenges. The Company delivered significant cost savings of R1.3 billion, exceeding the target and demonstrating the benefits of our margin enhancement strategy. A strong collaborative spirit with Transnet and other parties enabled optimal use of the iron ore export channel (IOEC). A value adding R3.6 billion of investment has increased Sishen's life-of-mine potential by three to four years to 2039.\n\nThe Company's performance, along with a constructive global iron ore market, confirms the merit of the Tswelelopele transformation journey. While all iron ore producers benefited from the increase in ore prices, Kumba's competitive advantage of higher product quality realised a greater product premium. While we anticipate ore prices will moderate over the medium term, we are confident that demand for Kumba's high quality iron ore products will remain buoyant. Kumba is progressing its ambition to extend the life-ofmine to 2040. We have increased the Sishen life-of-mine to 2035 through pit optimisation and the Board has approved the ultra-high dense media separation (UHDMS) project. This will maximise product quality and extend Sishen's life-of-mine to 2039.\n\n## A challenging socio-economic environment in South Africa\n\nPrior to the pandemic, South Africa faced, among others, a depressed economy, energy supply challenges, poor performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and high levels of joblessness and indebtedness. Going forward, the uncertainty around the modalities of an e/ffective Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, the unresolved bigger question of the empowerment requirements that apply to the minerals industry in the context of the 'once empowered, always empowered' principle and the potential for social unrest in the run up to local government elections, continue to present risks\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "to the country's long-term investment climate. To instil investor confidence, we will also need to see concerted action in addressing constraints relating to energy and transport infrastructure, and the scourge of corruption.\n\nWe are encouraged by the promise of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry and government's stated commitment to address corruption. However, action is eagerly awaited. We are also appreciative of the support provided by government, especially by the minister and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, to the mining sector during the various stages of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. If it was not for this support, the minerals industry would not have been able to safely take advantage of the buoyant global commodity markets and thus preserve livelihoods to the extent we did.\n\nAs a sector, and a Company, we remain committed to working with government to stimulate inclusive economic development, aided by a regulatory and policy environment that fosters long-term innovation and attracts foreign direct investment.\n\n## Pleasing results on our ESG performance\n\nLast year I referred to growing investor interest on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, specifically within the extractive sector. This interest has further intensified this year,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noverall workforce (2019: 23%), 21% of core disciplines (2019: 20%), and 27% of management positions.\n\nThis pleasing ESG performance is a tribute to the focus and commitment of Kumba's leadership team and employees and reflects the successful infusion of a culture of safety and responsibility across the Company.\n\n## Ensuring good governance\n\nKumba is committed to maintaining excellent standards of corporate governance and to ensuring full application of the King IV TM principles, with the Board providing an effective oversight function that empowers management to manage the business effectively and efficiently in delivering on its strategy. During the year, we enhanced our strategy and investment oversight through the work of a dedicated committee in this regard. We are confident that the composition of the Kumba Board has the right balance of skills, experience and diversity of perspective needed to fulfil our fiduciary responsibilities and to provide the necessary oversight over both the development and implementation of the Company's strategic direction. During the reporting period there was only one change to the Board membership. Mrs Nonkululeko Dlamini, who was appointed to the Board as a shareholder representative of the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) in November 2016, resigned as non-executive director with effect\n\nimprove people's lives\n\naccompanied by heightened pressure for a shift to 'stakeholder\n\ncapitalism' and growing calls globally for companies to serve a\n\nsocial purpose. As I mentioned last year, Kumba has a long\n\ntradition of leadership on sustainability challenges, both in its own\n\nright and as part of the Anglo American Group. This is reflected\n\nin the Company's purpose - to re-imagine mining to improve\n\npeople's lives - and its commitment to FutureSmart Mining\u2122, an\n\ninnovation-led approach that strives to fundamentally reshape\n\nmining to be safer, more sustainable, and better harmonised with\n\nthe needs of our host communities and society more broadly.\n\nIt is pleasing to see that the Company has continued to deliver\n\nstrong ESG performance. This is most strikingly demonstrated\n\nby Kumba's safety performance, with the Company remaining\n\nfatality-free for four years and seven months and achieving an\n\n83% reduction in high potential incidents. On occupational health,\n\nit is pleasing to report that there were no new cases of any\n\noccupational diseases, this was the fifth consecutive year with\n\nno cases of noise-induced hearing loss, and the Company has\n\neliminated direct employee exposure to respirable dust and silica\n\nabove the occupational exposure limit. In terms of environmental\n\nperformance: this was the fifth successive year with no major\n\n(level 3 to 5) environmental incidents. The Company reduced\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 10% (ahead of its 2020 target of 4%)\n\nand developed a roadmap to achieving carbon neutrality by\n\n2040; and achieved its 2020 target of 17% reduction in freshwater\n\nusage against a 2015 baseline.\n\nKumba has an exemplary track record of leadership in driving\n\ntransformation and facilitating broad-based black economic\n\nempowerment (BBBEE) by stimulating local and inclusive enterprise\n\ndevelopment, promoting preferential procurement, and enhancing\n\nthe involvement of women. This year, Kumba directed R9.8 billion\n\ntowards HDSA businesses, of which R3.6 billion was spent on\n\nsuppliers in host communities. We made further progress in\n\nadvancing employment equity during the year under review - at\n\nyear end, HDSAs represented 89% of our total workforce and held\n\n72% of management positions, while women made up 24% of our\n\nfrom 6 July 2020. On behalf of the Board and in my own name,\n\nI sincerely thank Nonkululeko for her contribution to the Board and\n\nwish her the very best going forward.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nOn the Board's behalf, I extend our collective appreciation to our\n\nChief Executive, Mr Themba Mkhwanazi and the executive team\n\nfor the leadership shown in their response to the Covid-19\n\npandemic, as well as thanking all of Kumba's employees whose\n\nhard work provides the foundation for the Company's ability to\n\ndeliver on its strategic agenda. I personally thank my colleagues\n\non the Kumba Board for their continued advice and support\n\nduring the year under review and for the past three and a half\n\nyears I have been the Chairperson of the Board. The recent\n\npassing of our former colleague Dolly Mokgatle, saddens me\n\nas she was a highly respected former Board member of Kumba,\n\ninspirational business leader, and passionate advocate of\n\ntransformation and gender equity.  My sincere condolences\n\nto her family.\n\nKumba has shown this year that it has the strategic and\n\noperational resilience to flourish in a volatile, uncertain, complex\n\nand ambiguous environment.  In the context of the profound social\n\nand economic challenges that we continue to face, I remain\n\nconfident that Kumba is well-placed to meet these challenges\n\nand continue to deliver on its stated purpose, playing a\n\nmeaningful role in contributing to a more prosperous, sustainable\n\nand inclusive economy.\n\nDr Mandla Gantsho\n\nChairperson\n\n26 March 2020\n\nKumba Iron Ore Limited\n\nIntegrated Report 2020\n\n17",

Exploration in South Africa is  focused on the Northern Cape,  close to our existing operations  at Sishen and Kolomela. We are  conducting on and near-mine  exploration and resource-definition  drilling to increase confidence in our  geological models; these models  are updated annually in support of  life-of-mine and long-term planning. | We extract iron ore by mining  the ore bodies within our mining  leases using open pit methods.  We are implementing a technology  roadmap that aims to accelerate  the adoption of technology to  improve safety, quality, efficiency  and resource utilisation, underpinned  by a strong operating model, ESG  practices and a commitment to  FutureSmart Mining TM . | We use DMS and UHDMS processing  and jigging technologies to  regulate the physical properties  of the finished product, removing  impurities and improving product  quality. We also support the South  African government's objectives to  maximise the developmental impact  of the minerals sector. |\n| Key outcomes Implications of our  activities on value  in each stage of

Having shown strong resilience\n\nin the first half of the year, responding quickly,\n\ncollectively and with empathy to the\n\nimmediate impacts of the pandemic, the\n\nsecond half of the year was characterised\n\nby the Company's resurgence, proving that\n\nwe are well on our way to fortifying the\n\nbusiness into the future.\n\nThemba Mkhwanazi\n\nChief Executive\n\nCreating enduring value\n\nWhile our activities this year have clearly been impacted by the pandemic, with lower production and sales volumes due to operational disruptions, these impacts have been less severe than for many other businesses. We operate an essential service, and were in a strong position prior to the crisis, with a resilient balance sheet, positive stakeholder relationships, and a high-quality product, supported this year by a more favourable commodity market.  Kumba achieved particularly strong growth this year in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), up 37% to R45.8 billion, assisted by stronger iron ore prices, a weaker Rand, and R1.3 billion in cost savings. We ended the year with a net cash position of R22.2 billion, generating attributable free cash flow of R20.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Through our activities this year, we supported our investment commitment in South Africa and created around R60 billion in enduring value for our stakeholders.\n\n## Delivering on our purpose through our Tswelelopele strategy\n\nSince the implementation of our Tswelelopele strategy in 2018, we have consistently created enduring value for all our stakeholders. Our four strategic ambitions are as follows (please refer to page 6 for further details on our strategic ambition):\n\n- \u00b7 achieving our goal of zero fatalities\n- \u00b7 margin enhancement\n- \u00b7 sustainably extending the life of our Northern Cape operations to 2040\n- \u00b7 becoming the employer of choice in South Africa\n\n2020 was no different as we delivered on our strategic ambition and our purpose of improving people's lives - harnessing the collective strength of our people, our culture, our balance sheet and our ore body. The underlying ethos that informs our purpose, was evidenced this year in the nature of our collective response to the Covid-19 pandemic and in the decisive action that was taken to protect the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of our employees, contractors and communities. Through our WeCare Covid-19\n\n30\n\nKumba Iron Ore Limited\n\nIntegrated Report 2020\n\nresponse programme, we saw a committed effort from the leadership team and shared responsibility across the workforce to minimise exposure to risks, manage infection rates, and actively support the mental health and physical wellness of employees, dependants and health workers.\n\n## Achieving our goal of zero fatalities\n\nWe had outstanding safety performance this year, remaining fatality-free for the fourth successive year, and achieving a 75% reduction in the number of high potential incidents. Being fatalityfree for four years and seven months is a significant accomplishment that reflects our commitment to instilling a culture of zero harm and to delivering the right safety mindset and leadership, supported by effective safety management systems and processes. Our total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) this year was 1.74, ahead of our target of 2.01 and down from 2.06 in 2019. Pleasingly, there were no new cases of any occupational diseases, and this was our fifth consecutive year of no new cases of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Our commitment to environmental stewardship is also reflected in a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, ahead of our 2020 target of 4%: reduced fresh water usage by 17%: and had a fifth consecutive year with no major environmental incidents.\n\n## Driving margin enhancement\n\nTo improve our cost competitiveness, we have been driving an ambitious margin enhancement strategy.  This year, we delivered cost savings of R1.3 billion (including R613 million of Covid-19related savings), ahead of our R1.1 billion target for this year and exceeding our cumulative target of R2.6 billion ahead of time. Our EBITDA margin increased with 12 percentage points from 2018 to 57% in 2020. Despite Covid-19-related challenges, the activities of our integrated sales and operations team contributed to a 19% increase in the average realised FOB iron ore price of US$115/ tonne.  We maintained our high product quality at an average Fe of 64.3% and a lump-to-fine ratio at 69:31, contributing to an Fe premium of US$4.1/tonne and a lump premium of US$6.5/tonne;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recognising that the non-controllable elements of our business - such as price, currency, freight costs, and geological and cost inflation - have the potential to significantly impact our earnings, and given anticipated further cost pressures, we will be continuing with our drive to operate our assets at their full potential.\n\n## Extending the life of our mines\n\nDespite some pandemic-related challenges, we made encouraging progress this year on our mine-life extension initiatives, achieving a significant milestone by delivering on our ambition, set in 2018, of replenishing our ore reserves by 200 Mt well ahead of the original timeframe of 2022. We have increased the ore reserve by a cumulative 206.4 Mt (before depletion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n54% is represented by black females. We continue to enjoy a stable and productive industrial relations environment, and successfully concluded a multi-year collective bargaining agreement this year with the three representative trade unions. In August, we processed the third and final tranche award in our broad-based employee share ownership plan (ESOP), Karolo, and are currently reviewing a potential extension of the scheme.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nOperationally, production volumes were lower compared to 2019, at both our mines as a result of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, various equipment challenges and weather delays.  At Sishen, production volumes were down 13% year-on-year to 25.4 Mt, slightly below revised market guidance, while unit costs were up R17/tonne to R362/tonne, with lower deferred stripping contributing to the increase that was partially offset by lower mining volumes and maintenance costs. At Kolomela, production was down 12% to 11.7 Mt, and unit costs were up R34/tonne to R304/tonne, due to higher mining and maintenance costs related to the catch-up in our mining fleet maintenance activities. Total sales volumes this year were down 6% to 39.7 Mt; export sales of 39.3 Mt were 0.7 Mt below the prior year, with shipments affected due to Covid-19-\n\nfor all stakeholders\n\nthrough various initiatives, including improved resource-to-reserve\n\nconversion, pit-layout optimisation at Sishen, the Sishen UHDMS\n\nproject, which will add an additional 110 to 130 Mt of reserves, and\n\nthe Kolomela Kapstevel South project, while continuing our\n\nexploration programme in the Northern Cape as we develop our\n\nresource pipeline.\n\nAs a result of these various initiatives, the reserve life at Sishen has\n\nincreased from 2032 to 2035, and with the approval of the UHDMS\n\nproject in February 2021 there is the potential to add a further\n\nthree to four years, at an average 29.2 Mtpa saleable product\n\noutput for the bulk of the reserve life up to 2035 and then dropping\n\nto 15 Mtpa in the last three years. Additional technologies, such as\n\nbulk ore sorting, will enable us to upgrade this material and\n\nachieve higher yields and thus additional volumes. For Kolomela\n\nwe estimate a 12-year remaining reserve life, at an average\n\n12.6 Mtpa saleable product output. In addition to extending\n\nKumba's life-of-mine, we made progress this year in partnering\n\nwith Transnet and other industry players in an industry forum to\n\nidentify and implement various rail and port improvement projects\n\nthat will extend the longevity of the rail and port logistics network\n\nto meet our mine-life extension ambitions.\n\nBecoming the employer of choice\n\nDelivering on our fourth strategic ambition of being the employer\n\nof choice in the South African mining sector is a critical enabler for\n\nour Tswelelopele programme. In addition to driving a collaborative,\n\npeople-centric response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we continued\n\nto work this year on embedding an organisational culture that\n\nfosters safety, diversity, innovation and organisational\n\neffectiveness. Adapting our activities to provide for the shift to\n\nremote working, we implemented various leadership and culture\n\ninitiatives, employee engagements and team development\n\nprocesses, building on the strong foundations of our culture\n\nchange interventions of the previous two years. We made pleasing\n\nprogress in improving female representation across the business,\n\nwith women now accounting for 32% of our talent pool, of which\n\nrelated production losses, while domestic sales of 0.4 Mt were 84%\n\nlower, following lower off-take demand from ArcelorMittal SA.\n\nThis year the volume railed to Saldanha was 4.4 Mt below the prior\n\nyear, as a result of Covid-19 challenges, logistics constraints, and\n\nvarious weather delays. Total shipments were 0.7 Mt lower than\n\n2019 due to a number of interventions that offset logistical\n\nconstraints. Through effective implementation of our Covid-19\n\nmeasures, combined with initiatives to increase workforce\n\ncapacity at Transnet, the iron ore export channel haulage rates\n\nreturned to pre-Covid levels by the third quarter, contributing to a\n\nsignificant improvement in throughput at Saldanha port in the\n\nsecond half. In these challenging times, it was heartening to see\n\nthe strong teamwork between industry and Transnet. By working\n\nclosely together, we could respond more quickly to issues, and\n\noptimise the use of the rail and port infrastructure. We are\n\ncontinuing to work with Transnet to simplify the product portfolio,\n\nrevise the stockyard layout at Saldanha, and blending ore into\n\ntrains at the mines to reduce time lost for blending at Saldanha.\n\nRe-imagining mining to improve people's lives\n\nAs part of Anglo American plc, Kumba shares the group's\n\ncommitment to FutureSmart Mining\u2122, an innovation-led approach\n\nto sustainable mining that looks to harness the power of\n\ntechnologies and digitalisation to fundamentally transform how\n\nwe mine, process, move and market our products in a manner that\n\ntackles our most pressing environmental and social challenges in\n\nline with our core purpose.\n\nFollowing extensive internal and external engagement, the\n\nstrategy has ambitious stretch goals, aligned with the UN SDGs,\n\nthat are challenging us to innovate to deliver on these goals by\n\n2030. To meet these goals, our teams at Kolomela and Sishen\n\nhave been developing tailored five-year sustainable mining plans\n\n(SMPs) that are responsive to the local context, while remaining\n\naligned with the global ambitions. These SMPs are underpinned\n\nby comprehensive baseline assessments that use spatial planning\n\nKumba Iron Ore Limited\n\nIntegrated Report 2020\n\n31",

        "page_content": "## Our operating context and strategy\n\nand analysis to identify and deliver collaborative regional development projects that we believe will leave a positive legacy long after mine closure, contributing directly to at least 12 of the 17 UN SDGs. These initiatives will be further complemented by some of the exciting energy investments and agricultural projects that we have been exploring as part of our Horizon Three (H3) strategic focus areas.\n\nTogether, these SMP and H3 projects will deliver significant value across our various stakeholder groups, in addition to the economic value-add that Kumba is already providing through its core activities.  This year, for example, we directly improved people's lives by creating R60 billion of enduring value, including:\n\n- \u00b7 paying corporate income tax of R10.1 billion (2019: R7.8 billion) and mineral royalties of R3.0 billion (2019: R2.6 billion), thereby making a meaningful contribution to government's development priorities\n- \u00b7 investing R5.7 billion (2019: R5.6 billion) of capital\n- \u00b7 providing jobs and employees with R5 billion in salaries, benefits and share-based payments\n- \u00b7 declaring R19.6 billion in dividends to shareholders (2019: R15.1 billion)\n- \u00b7 continuing to promote broad-based economic transformation, with R9.8 billion of products and services procured from BEE suppliers, of which R3.6 billion was spent directly on businesses within host communities, and R0.1 billion spent by major suppliers subcontracting to host community businesses\n- \u00b7 spending R263.6 million in our host communities through our direct social investment\n\nAlthough there are inevitably some trade-offs in generating this value - which we review in more detail in this report and in our accompanying sustainability report - it is clear that overall Kumba makes a significant net positive contribution, not only by playing an important part in keeping the engine of the South African economy running, but also through the use of our downstream products as part of the transition to a more environmentally sustainable economy.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe longer-term implications of the pandemic are uncertain. Although we have taken significant steps to mitigate the health risks for employees and neighbouring communities, and we have managed to maintain encouraging levels of operational performance, concerns remain regarding the pandemic's longterm impacts on lives and livelihoods, economies and markets, and on the physical and emotional wellbeing of employees and communities. We will continue to work in partnership with relevant stakeholders to mitigate these impacts where we can, and to contribute to building an economy that seeks to deliver value to all stakeholder groups.\n\nHigh iron ore prices on the back of strong demand in China and supply constraints in Brazil and Australia are anticipated to moderate, albeit remaining above US$100/tonne in the medium term. Given the structural factors relating to decarbonisation and strengthening environmental regulation, we are confident that there will be sustained demand for Kumba's quality iron ore products that command a higher premium. The strong V-shaped market recovery saw traditional markets outside of China rebounding to a 47% market share in the last quarter of 2020, giving rise to further optimism.\n\nIn terms of our full year 2021 performance guidance, production is expected to be between 40 and 41 Mt. Based on this, unit cost is projected to be between R395 and R405/tonne for Sishen and\n\nbetween R300 and R310/tonne for Kolomela. With cost pressure from fuel, labour and maintenance expected to continue, we are targeting R1.0 billion of cost savings in each of 2021 and 2022. Total sales guidance, including lower domestic sales, is expected to be between 40 and 41 Mt. It is anticipated that the refurbishment of the ship loading equipment by Transnet will continue into 2021, limiting opportunities to divert domestic sales to export markets.\n\nGiven the volatile external environment that we operate in, Kumba needs to ensure that we accelerate our efforts to remain competitive and sustainable over the longer term. An organisational restructure was announced in March 2021 to ensure that we have the right structure to effectively and efficiently deliver on our strategic ambitions during these challenging times. The process is designed to create a fit for purpose organisational structure to realise efficiencies and improved productivity. We will conclude this process with care and respect and show empathy to all our employees.\n\nThe UHDMS technology project has received Board approval on 19 February 2021. It firmly positions Kumba as a niche producer and provides value uplift. We will be able to increase the product grade and earn an additional US$1/tonne product premium, from 2024. Sishen will have potential life-of-mine of a further three to four years to 2039. This makes our longer-term sustainability initiatives in terms of solar power and hydrogen fuel, more viable. Best of all we are able to create enduring value for all of our stakeholders especially employees and host communities, 54% of whom are either directly or indirectly dependent on the mine for their livelihoods.\n\nWith our value proposition we are well positioned for the longer term. Consistent with our values and way of doing business, safety and sustainability will continue to be our primary focus. Margin performance is the second key value driver. We see upside potential from product premium over time, with high quality products likely to be increasingly important to our customer base. In the short term we'll focus on delivering our P101 programme and continue to meet our cost ambitions. Our third focus will be to continue to unlock the full potential of our resource base. Finally, continued capital discipline, we intend to keep a strong balance sheet while investing in the business and providing shareholders with highly attractive returns.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nKumba's demonstrated resilience during the turbulent first half of the year, laid the foundation for our subsequent resurgence, is testament to the dedication and teamwork of the incredible people across the Company who have had to work under incredibly demanding conditions this year. I would like to thank each of Kumba's employees, contractors and the executive team for this commitment that I believe lays the foundation for the Company's continued success. I also extend my appreciation to the Kumba Board for their support and advice in developing and delivering on Kumba's strategic ambitions. Our Chairperson has indicated that he intends to retire from the Kumba Board, I wish to thank Dr Mandla Gantsho for his impeccable leadership and guidance over the past three years and we wish him every success as he focuses on his personal business interests.\n\n## Themba Mkhwanazi\n\nChief Executive\n\n26 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Covid-19 pandemic\n\nCOVID\n\n19\n\n## Global and national operating context profoundly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe business environment has been profoundly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, globally and nationally. After being identified in Wuhan City in China in January 2020, the virus spread rapidly around the world, with the first reported cases in South Africa in early March 2020. On 26 March, the South African government imposed a \"Level 5\" lockdown for 21 days, which was subsequently extended to 35 days. Kumba was placed into care and maintenance for the first few days; following consultation with government, our mines were permitted to operate with 50 percent of our workforce. In May, all open pit mines were allowed to operate at full capacity and we ramped up to pre-Covid run-rates by June. Although we have taken significant steps to mitigate the health risks for employees and neighbouring communities, and have managed to maintain encouraging levels of operational performance, there remain significant concerns regarding the longer-term impacts of the pandemic on lives and livelihoods, economies and markets, and the physical and emotional wellbeing of employees and communities.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on most businesses and business models: various sectors of the economy have been shut down (some for extended periods), supply chains and conventional working patterns have been disrupted, existing inequalities have been exacerbated, and employee health and wellbeing has been affected. While Kumba's activities have undoubtedly been impacted by the pandemic, with production levels down particularly in the second quarter, the impact has been less severe than for many other businesses. Kumba operates an essential service, and we were in a strong business position prior to the crisis, with a resilient balance sheet, good partnerships with key stakeholders, and a high-quality product, supported by a more favourable iron ore market and weaker currency.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic enablers\n\nFrom the onset of the virus, Kumba reacted quickly and decisively in developing and implementing comprehensive response plans to safeguard and support employees and host communities, and to maintain our operations and support livelihoods without compromising health and safety. Our Covid-19 critical controls and prevention measures ensured effective management of infection rates at our operations, with stringent preventative measures supported by dedicated resources for screening, testing, tracing and treatment, extensive awareness raising activities, and well implemented employee health and wellness interventions. In our communities, our mining operations leveraged our Social Way, collaborating with key stakeholder groups to help communities mitigate and recover from the social and economic effects of the pandemic by continuing to provide essential services, supporting local businesses and entrepreneurs with business opportunities and development initiatives, and providing relief packages to the most vulnerable members of the community. In addition to taking proactive measures to protect production in our own operations, we have collaborated strongly with Transnet to mitigate risks in our export channel. We also proactively amended both the quality and regional sales mix during 2020 to ensure that there were no lost sales as a result of reduction in demand from China in the first half of the year and reduction in demand from Europe and the rest or the market in the second half of 2020. Working in collaboration with Transnet and the rest of the industry to provide support for a rapid recovery on the outbound supply chain when port volumes were impacted by Covid-19 (lower staff availability which resulting in reduced operating hours). While the pandemic has raised risk levels across our value chain, it has also created the possibility to 'reset' our outlook and prospects, including by fast-tracking and highlighting new opportunities and applications for digital technologies.\n\nLeadership and culture (page 57)\n\nProvide leadership through responsible citizenship (page 57)\n\nProactively engaging with key stakeholders (page 57)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our operating context and strategy\n\nOperating context continued\n\n## 2. Continuing volatility in the iron ore price\n\n## Despite a strong recovery in the global iron ore market, some volatility remains\n\nDuring 2020, the Platts 62% IODEX CFR China index averaged US$109/tonne CFR, up 17% on the prior year. This valuable increase was o/ff the back of robust industrial demand from China, particularly in the second half of the year boosted by China's rapid postCovid-19 economic recovery, with Chinese steel production reaching a record high of 1,054 Mt at year end, up 6% year-on-year. Economic stimulus measures in China fuelled a strong recovery within the infrastructure and property sectors. From a steep 20% year-on-year decline in the first quarter, infrastructure investment growth registered a V-shape recovery starting in the second quarter and finished the year stronger with 0.9% year-on-year growth in December. The property investment improved to 7% yearon-year by December 2020, after falling by 16% year-on-year between January and February 2020. Global supply disruption from inclement weather conditions in Brazil and South Africa, combined with Covid-19-related restrictions, that also impacted supply from Canada, Chile and Peru, provided further price support. It is estimated that shipments from Brazil reduced by 3% or ~9 Mt in the period. Australian shipments however ended the year 4% higher, despite the impact of cyclones early in 2020 and temporary closures for maintenance, as Covid-19-related restrictions were not implemented across the mining industry in Australia. Despite buoyant steel production in China, iron ore port inventories at 45 Chinese ports stabilised to 124 Mt by year end compared with 108 Mt in June. Also, higher iron ore prices have kept marginal producers in the market as China's domestic mine utilisation rates averaged at ~68% in the second half of 2020, compared with 63.1% in the first half of 2020 and 64% during 2019.\n\nThe Platts 65-62 differential increased to US$13/tonne (2019: US$11.2/tonne), while the lump premium averaged US$0.15/dmtu, down from US$0.27/dmtu in 2019. In the first half of the year, mill closures due to the Covid-19 lockdown in Europe, Japan, South Korea and India, which tend to have a higher demand for pellet, resulted in pellet cargoes being redirected to the Chinese market. This created pressure on both the pellet and lump premia. Additionally, high coking coal prices lowered the demand for lumps, placing further pressure on the lump premium. In the second half of the year, the iron ore market improved significantly as markets outside of China began to recover following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Demand strengthened further as vaccines were approved and programmes for the rollout of vaccines were announced in multiple countries, while supply concerns relating to the onset of the second wave and the restocking of supplies ahead of the Chinese New Year in 2021 fuelled a significant increase in premia in the last quarter of the year.\n\nOver the long term, the structural factors relating to decarbonisation and the adoption of Scope 3 carbon reduction interventions by steel manufacturers will continue to support demand for Kumba's high quality iron ore products and we will continue to focus on maximising Fe and lump content. The Covid-19 lockdowns and the steel mill closures in the second quarter outside China, resulted in the share of traditional (Europe, Japan and South Korea) markets of total sales for the period decreasing to 35% from 42% at the end of last year, however; the strong market recovery in the last quarter of 2020 saw the share of traditional markets outside of China rebounding to a 47% market share.\n\nThis year Kumba achieved a lump premium of US$6.5/tonne. Combined with an Fe premium of US$4.1/tonne and a US$5.8/tonne premium for marketing effort, we delivered a total price uplift of US$17.2/tonne to US$114.6/tonne FOB Saldanha, an increase of 19% against the US$97.4/tonne achieved for the comparative period.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nAs a price-taker in the global iron ore commodity market, Kumba is impacted by continuing price volatility. We see the growing premium for higher quality iron ore as an important positive differentiator for the Company. This increasing premium is being driven by more stringent environmental regulations in China, both in response to climate change commitments and in an effort to combat smog as part of the country's 'blue skies' policy; other environmental and climate change regulations globally are further contributing to this trend.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic focus areas\n\nGiven the expectation that there will be slight reduction in global iron ore prices in the short to medium term, we will retain a strong focus on enhancing Kumba's competitiveness by further improving margins through our Tswelelopele programme. Regulations pertaining to decarbonisation and the adoption of Scope 3 carbon reduction interventions by steel manufacturers will continue to support demand for Kumba's high quality iron ore products and is a key driver for sales in Europe. We are continuing to identify and realise various opportunities to optimise our product portfolio to secure the price premium associated with our higher quality iron ore. During 2020, through focused implementation of the Tswelelopele programme, our premium products made up 18% of sales (2019: 19%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainably operate mines at lower unit costs (page 54)\n\nUnlock full infrastructure potential (page 55)\n\nUse technology to extract maximum value (page 55)\n\nCompete through premium products (page 54)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Competitive pressure from a flatter producer cost curve globally\n\n## Driving operational efficiencies remains a priority given our position on the global cost curves\n\nIn response to the downward trend in global iron ore prices between 2011 and 2015, there has been a strong efficiency drive across iron ore producers globally. This drive has contributed to a flattening of the production cost curve across the sector that has been achieved by delivering enhanced efficiencies, aided in some instances by mining technology innovations, realising new low-cost supply opportunities, and benefiting from weaker currencies in some producer markets. With key competitors bringing lower-cost production online, Kumba is currently in the third quartile of the global cost curve. This year, both our controllable and non-controllable costs remained flat.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nHeightened cost competition from our global competitors, most of whom have a greater capacity to reduce costs given the nature of their export channels and their proximity to key markers, has obvious implications for Kumba. Together with increasing cash costs and the volatile price environment, this emphasises the critical importance of maintaining a concerted cost efficiency focus.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic focus areas\n\nResponding to this heightened competitive pressure has been a key driver behind our Tswelelopele strategy, which seeks to enhance the performance of our current assets and deliver a substantial margin improvement, through R2.6 billion in cumulative savings over this period. During 2020 we secured R1.3 billion in cost savings, well above our market guidance of R1.1 billion. Given continuing cost pressure from rising geological inflation and higher input costs, as well as higher royalty charges from increased profitability, we are maintaining a strong focus on managing controllable costs to ensure our competitiveness in a lower price environment. Informed by a recent review of operating expenses and identified opportunities for savings in our fixed cost base and further optimisation of outside services, we have reached our R2.6 billion in cumulative savings target ahead of time. Since implementing our strategy in 2018, our EBITDA margin has improved from 45% to 57% and this has provided a strong foundation for further efficiencies.\n\nSustainably operate mines at lower unit costs (page 54)\n\nUnlock full infrastructure potential (page 55)\n\nCompete through premium products (page 54)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investor and stakeholder pressure for enhanced ESG performance\n\n## Increasing uptake of 'stakeholder capitalism' and heightened expectations on companies to deliver a \"social purpose\"\n\nThere has been a marked increase in investor interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in recent years, reflecting increased investor appreciation of the growing materiality of social and environmental issues on company performance, as well as strengthening stakeholder calls for greater corporate accountability of their societal impacts. This forms part of a broader shift towards 'stakeholder capitalism', and heightened expectations on companies and Chief Executives to take the lead in driving positive change and deliver a social purpose, including specifically on issues relating to climate change, the circular economy, inequality and the protection of jobs. The calls for enhanced business leadership on societal issues have been strengthened this year by the impacts of the pandemic, the renewed momentum behind the Black Lives Matter movement, and increased concerns regarding a failure of political leadership. While companies across all business sectors are coming under increasing scrutiny from different stakeholders, the mining sector faces particularly strong expectations given the nature of its social and environmental impacts. In South Africa, continuing challenges in government service delivery and corruption, and the high levels of unemployment and inequality exacerbated by the pandemic, have highlighted the critical importance of the mining sector playing a proactive role in helping host economies to 'build back better'.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nBuilding social capital, by developing and maintaining trusted relationships with our key stakeholders, is the foundation for our ability to create value. Heightened expectations, and sometimes competing stakeholder interests, are testing the quality of some of our relationships. Maintaining a collaborative approach, and finding the right balance between competing expectations, requires proactive engagement and responses.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic enablers\n\nOur core purpose is to 're-imagine mining to improve people's lives'. For us, smart mining means re-imagining how we work at the mine and what we offer to society as our social contract in a changing world. Through our implementation of FutureSmart Mining TM and sustainable mining plan, we are committed to leveraging innovative and sustainable methods to drive safe, responsible production, and high-performance teams. Our plans and collaborative stakeholder approach are a key part in ensuring that we continue to support thriving communities, including through jobs, skills, education and other livelihoods outside our mine gates. With our shipping activities we use only low sulphur diesel and we are introducing LNG vessels into the fleet to further reduce emissions. Providing leadership through responsible citizenship and adopting a partnership approach underpinned by proactive stakeholder engagement, are two key strategic enablers.

        "page_content": "## 5. Sustained sector-based commitment to eliminate employee and contractor fatalities\n\n## Instilling a culture of zero harm remains a key priority across the sector\n\nBetween 1993 and 2020 the South African mining sector saw a dramatic reduction in mining-related fatalities, reflecting the impact of a sustained sector-wide focus on improving safety and health. This enhanced e/ffort between companies, unions and government contributed to the gratifying and overdue reduction in mining fatalities in the country. Despite this progress, safety remains a key challenge for the mining industry. As at 14 December 2020, the industry tragically lost 58 people compared to 49 at the same time in 2019. This represents an overall 18% regression in the number of fatalities year-on-year. Globally, the  tragedy at Vale's operations in Brazil in 2019, in which 270 people died following the collapse of a tailings dam, provided a devastating reminder of the risks associated with mining activities, and heightened the sector's focus on the management of tailings dams. In October 2019, the Minerals Council South Africa launched the 'Khumbul'ekhaya' initiative, a CEO-led health and safety strategy aimed at eliminating mining fatalities within two years, underpinned by the recognition that safety and health in the industry starts with, and ultimately depends on, the industry's leadership.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nProtecting our workforce from harm is a moral imperative, a fundamental human right, and a non-negotiable aspect of doing business. Promoting a culture of zero harm is also a direct investment in the productivity of the business: safe and healthy employees contribute to a more motivated and productive workplace, protect the organisation's reputation and social licence, and minimise the potential for legal liabilities and operational stoppages.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic enabler\n\nEntrenching a culture of zero harm and eliminating fatalities is our first strategic ambition, driven under the personal leadership of our Chief Executive, Themba Mkhwanazi, and implemented through our comprehensive 'elimination of fatalities framework'. Kumba is pleased to report that we have been fatality-free for four years and seven months, and that we have continued to see improvements across most leading and lagging indicators. This year, our total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) was 1.74 against a target of 2.01, and there were two safety-related high potential incidents (HPIs), an 83% improvement on 12 HPIs in 2019.\n\nProvide leadership through responsible citizenship (page 57)\n\nProactively engaging with key stakeholders (page 57)\n\nElimination of fatalities (SR page 41)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6. Group-wide Anglo American drives for operational excellence and sustainable development\n\n## Ambitious group-wide targets in place to drive efficiency and contribute to the UN SDGs\n\nIn the context of some of the key trends referenced above - commodity price volatility, heightened competitive pressure, growing investor and stakeholder expectations on ESG performance, and the sector-wide drive to eliminate fatalities - our parent company, Anglo American, has been driving a radical restructuring process since 2013. Through its FutureSmart Mining TM programme and sustainable mining plan, the group is looking to deliver a step-change across the entire mining value chain, with the aim of driving business efficiencies, resilience and agility, and delivering strong performance on societal issues. Developed through extensive internal and external engagement, and an analysis of critical opportunities and risks, the strategy includes ambitious long-term commitments and targets. These are aligned with relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), relating to three global sustainability pillars: being a trusted corporate leader, building thriving communities, and maintaining a healthy environment. The Anglo American Sustainability Integration Team is supporting Kolomela and Sishen with developing and implementing bespoke five-year plans that are aligned with the global sustainability pillars, stretch goals and targets, but responsive to the local context, priorities and opportunities.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nAnglo American's group-wide focus on operational excellence and sustainable development has been an important additional driver behind our concerted efforts to improve operational efficiencies and enhance our societal contribution. Our operations have continued to benefit from implementing the Anglo Operating Model, which has had a direct positive impact on safety, productivity, and improved efficiencies. Our Tswelelopele programme has delivered material financial benefits and maintained our viability in an increasingly competitive and volatile commodity-price environment, driving change in a coordinated manner, simplifying our governance processes, and building a high-performance culture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Maintaining the quality of iron ore reserves and life of asset, including critical third-party assets such as Transnet\n\n## Extending our iron ore reserves and life of asset remains a top priority\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, Kumba, from a 100% ownership reporting perspective, had access to an estimated haematite ore reserve of 729.9 Mt at an average unbeneficiated or feed grade of 58.8% Fe from our two mining operations: Kolomela (158.0 Mt at 62.1% Fe, against a 50% Fe cut-off grade) and Sishen (571.9 Mt at 57.9% Fe, against a 40% Fe cut-off grade). The net increase this year in saleable product, ore reserves and mineral resources reflects the improved long-term market outlook, especially in terms of the US$ to ZAR exchange rate (critical for Kumba being primarily an exporter), combined with optimised haul road designs and another year of advances made as a result of a geotechnical pit design study at Sishen. As a result of the above, the reserve life of Sishen has increased from 12 to 15 years. Further details are provided in the Ore Reserve (and Saleable Product) and Mineral Resource report, summarised on pages 73 to 79.\n\nFollowing the finalisation of the 2020 resources and reserves, the Kumba Board approved the Sishen UHDMS project which will extend the LoM by an additional three to four years at an average production rate of 10 to 15 Mtpa.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nOur ability to generate revenue and stakeholder value is entirely dependent on having reliable and cost-effective access to quality iron ore reserves. To maintain our capacity to generate value over the long term, it is critical that we identify and realise new opportunities to extend production beyond the current life-of-mines. In addition to maintaining the quality of our iron reserved and extending the life of our own assets, it is essential that we ensure the availability of stable and reliable rail and port infrastructure over the life of these assets.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic focus areas\n\nThrough the Tswelelopele Horizon 1 activities we are working to drive our operations to reach their full potential by achieving benchmark productivities, maximising the resource utilisation (increasing yield and lump:fine ratio), further improving cost control and obtaining the maximum price for our superior iron ore products. In Horizon 2, we are seeking to extend the life-of-mine through incorporating the operational improvements realised in Horizon 1, as well as by implementing low-grade beneficiation technologies and undertaking further exploration in the Northern Cape. To ensure we have an effective logistics chain to move these volumes to market, we are partnering with Transnet and other industry players in an industry forum to ensure a stable and reliable Iron Ore Export Channel (IOEC) that will be able to service its users' needs into the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUse technology to extract maximum value (page 55)\n\nExtend life of current assets (page 55)\n\nFocus on the Northern Cape (page 55)\n\nUnlock full infrastructure potential (page 55)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Governance concerns and a challenging economic outlook in South Africa\n\n## Governance challenges in South Africa underpin concerns regarding the country's economic prospects\n\nPrior to the pandemic, South Africa faced significant challenges associated with the country's depressed economy, high unemployment, ongoing load-shedding and continuing concerns regarding the viability of state-owned enterprises and persistent corruption, all of which had a profoundly negative impact on business, consumer and investor sentiment. These concerns have been exacerbated by the impacts of the pandemic. Hopes that we will see an economic rebound in 2021 remain subdued in the absence of a clear timeline for a vaccine rollout in the country, further lockdowns and load-shedding, the risk of a public sector strike associated with a proposed wage freeze, and the country's very high debt burden. The local government elections scheduled for August, and the ANC leadership contest due in 2022, are likely to heighten the risk of political and social unrest. From a policy and regulatory perspective, although the revised Mining Charter has provided greater clarity on certain provisions and addressed some of the mining sector's concerns on earlier drafts, significant uncertainties remain regarding the application of certain key provisions, as well as on the implications of the government's support for the expropriation of land without compensation.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nStrong governance and effective institutions, supported by regulatory and fiscal certainty, are essential to encourage long-term investment and boost economic growth which is critical to addressing the country's profound socio-economic challenges and contribute to a stable operating environment. Low investor sentiment and poor global credit ratings increase the cost of capital and further undermine efforts to address the structural challenges in education, healthcare, and inequality.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic enablers\n\nKumba has a strong track record of contributing to South Africa's development and transformation objectives, and remains fully committed to delivering in this area, including through the ambitious FutureSmart Mining TM and sustainable mining plan commitments made in partnership with Anglo American. We will continue to engage constructively with government and other stakeholders to identify solutions aimed at optimising the distribution of value inherent in the country's mineral resources and contributing to a more stable policy and governance environment.\n\nProactively engaging with key stakeholders (page 57)\n\nProvide leadership through responsible citizenship (page 57)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9. Wind-down of ArcelorMittal SA's operations at Saldanha steel plant\n\n## Realising opportunities to increase export sales capacity to compensate for lower domestic sales\n\nIn November 2019, ArcelorMittal SA announced its decision to undertake an orderly wind-down of their steel operations at Saldanha Works. As part of this wind-down process ArcelorMittal SA has been reviewing its iron ore off-take footprint in South Africa, which will impact our domestic sales and stock levels. In the current rail constrained environment, we are investigating several options to increase the export sales capacity.\n\n## Implications for value\n\nFollowing the announcement from ArcelorMittal SA to wind down its steel operations at Saldanha, Kumba's total sales for 2020 decreased by 6%, mainly driven by the 84% decline in domestic sales due to the lower off-take by ArcelorMittal SA.\n\nStrategic response\n\nStrategic enablers\n\nKumba will continue to assess the effect of ArcelorMittal SA's strategic asset footprint review on domestic sales and will update the market in due course. Importantly, export sales contribute 99% towards the Company's total sales and Kumba's high-quality iron ore products are well-positioned in global markets with ongoing customer demand and a stable export order book.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnlock full infrastructure potential (page 55)\n\nProactively engaging with key stakeholders (page 57)\n\nProvide leadership through responsible citizenship (page 57)\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are committed to implementing an integrated approach to engaging stakeholders that promotes a shared vision amid dynamically changing stakeholder positions, and that maintains Kumba's reputation as a partner of choice in creating long-term value.\n\nOur improved stakeholder engagement planning allows for structured and constructive engagements at appropriate levels of the organisation and leads to increased levels of trust between Kumba and our stakeholders. We host stakeholder days every two years, in which we bring together the boards of directors and executive teams from Kumba and Sishen Iron Ore Company (SIOC) together with national, provincial and local government representatives, labour unions, host community groups, civil society representatives, suppliers, and business and development partners, to discuss the Company's performance on sustainability and transformation. Feedback received through these events informs our strategic response.\n\n## Identifying our priority stakeholders\n\nWe use the following criteria to prioritise the many individuals and organisations that have a stake in Kumba:\n\nThe degree to which we depend on the stakeholder's support in achieving our strategic goals\n\nThe degree to which the stakeholder can influence organisational performance\n\nThe significance of the issues linking the stakeholder to Kumba\n\nThe risks that we are exposed to should we not deliberately plan our interventions to address stakeholder issues\n\n## Engaging our key stakeholders\n\nInformed by the criteria, we have grouped our stakeholders as outlined in the table on pages 40 to 42. Through our interactions, we identified their priority interests, concerns and expectations. We carefully review the associated impacts on the capitals to identify the most effective trade-offs to ensure that we reach our common goals in a sustainable manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on how Kumba responds to material stakeholders'\n\ninterests, please refer to page 30 in our SR.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board sub-committees regularly assess all risk governance structures and lines of defence to ensure that roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for identifying, managing, mitigating, reporting and escalating risks and opportunities within the Company are appropriately defined and responded to.\n\nThe Board sub-committees and Kumba's management team promote a culture of risk governance and awareness throughout the organisation.\n\n## Kumba's risk management process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Ensure that appropriate controls and responses are in place to mitigate the risks and manage identified opportunities (recorded in risk registers).\n- 2 Regularly analysing and monitoring the effectiveness of current controls (three lines of defence). Regular and timely reporting to Exco, the risk and opportunities committee and the Board.  Risk management is integrated within management's everyday agenda to ensure that mitigation actions for identified risks are implemented.\n- 3 The MRC is a sub-committee of Exco responsible for managing risks.\n\n## Risk appetite and tolerance\n\nKumba defines risk appetite as the nature and extent of the risk the Company is willing to accept in the pursuit of its objectives; risk tolerance refers to the organisation's strategic capacity to accept or absorb risk.\n\nRisk appetite and tolerance are high on the Board's agenda and are a core consideration of our enterprise risk management approach. Risk appetite and tolerance consider the relationship between the potential consequences of key risks and the actual condition of the controls or management actions that mitigate those consequences. The Board reviews and approves the risk tolerance and appetite on a quarterly basis, to ensure effective delivery of the Company's strategy in the context of a continuously changing operating environment.\n\nTo measure risk appetite, we have developed a matrix that combines an assessment of the consequences of our risks with the status of management actions and/or internal controls that prevent or mitigate that risk. Risks that have significant consequences will be within appetite if controls or management actions are in place. Risks can only exceed appetite if a significant consequence is not sufficiently controlled or management actions have not yet been implemented to an extent that the risks can be described as being effectively managed.",

Our Tswelelopele strategy aims to unlock Kumba's full potential and deliver value for all our stakeholders by: enhancing our margins; extending the life of our assets beyond 2040; eliminating all fatal incidents; and becoming the employer of choice in South Africa.\n\nThis year we continued our activities to embed our safety culture, remaining fatality-free for the fourth successive year and achieving an 83% reduction in the number of high potential incidents. Our EBITDA margin improved five percentage points to 57%, assisted by stronger ore prices, a weaker Rand and R1.3 billion in cost savings, offset by lower sales and a higher royalty rate. Operationally, production volumes were lower than 2019 at both our mines as a result of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, various equipment challenges and weather delays. While progress on some of our mine life extension initiatives was hampered by the pandemic, we made encouraging progress in working with Transnet to improve rail performance and to identify options to extend the longevity of the rail and port logistics network. All of these activities have been underpinned by our continuing focus on instilling the right leadership and culture across the Company.\n\n## Strategic focus areas\n\n| Sustainably operate  mines at a lower unit  cost to remain  competitive through a  lean support and core  cost base and a  step-up in productivity   | To strengthen our competitiveness in the context of continuing market volatility and heightened cost  competition, we are driving an ambitious programme to lower the unit cost at our mines. We have been  realising efficiencies across our operations by reducing our core cost base, implementing a lean support  structure, and delivering a step-up in productivity. We continue to implement the Anglo Operating Model  throughout our business (see separate strategic focus area below), and this is the foundation for shifting  the benchmark efficiency closer to P101, a best-in-class industry benchmark, as part of driving  operations to full potential. This year, our focused efficiency drive contributed to overall cost savings of R1.3 billion, above our target   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                      | of R1.1 billion, bringing the total savings from our programme to R2.6 billion (excluding Covid-19-related  costs savings). We contained the break-even price at US$45/tonne for the year, with the gains of a  higher price premium, weaker currency and reduced spot freight rate offset by higher units costs,  increased on-mine SIB capex, lower lump premium and increased royalties. Unit production costs at both  Sishen and Kolomela increased compared to 2019, as a result of production losses and inflation linked  input cost pressures at both mines. At Sishen, the unit cost of production was R362/tonne for the year,  R17/tonne higher than 2019, and at Kolomela the unit cost was R304/tonne, R34/tonne above 2019.                                                |\n| Compete through  premium products and  differentiated  customer relationships                                                                        | cost escalations. Due to the geographical location of our operations and the geological nature of our ore body, Kumba is  not able to compete effectively with large global iron ore producers on a volume basis. We have thus  chosen to compete by maximising the price premium through the provision of premium quality products  and differentiated customer relationships.

In line with this strategy, we have successfully increased the ore reserve by a cumulative  206.4 Mt (before depletion) through various initiatives including pit slope steepening and optimisation of  the pit layout at Sishen, improved resource to reserve conversion and the Sishen UHDMS project. We  completed a feasibility study this year to re-evaluate the value proposition of the UHDMS project, taking  into consideration rail logistical constraints exacerbated by the lower domestic o/ff-take from  ArcelorMittal SA.

We consciously blend between the various products to maximise value and regularly undertake customer segmentation studies to identify which customers value particular physical and/or chemical properties in our products, and we use this information, together with mine planning information, to tailor our product specifications to match customer demands.\n\n## Reinforce product quality and consistency\n\nThis year our total export sales were 0.7 Mt below the prior year, with shipments affected due to Covid-19related production losses; domestic sales were 1.8 Mt below that of 2019, as a result of lower demand from ArcelorMittal SA.\n\nOur approach to producing ore for the export market at our Sishen and Kolomela operations is outlined in the following diagram:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we cannot compete with the large iron ore producers in terms of volume and proximity to China, we recognise the need to reinforce our reputation for product quality as a critical source of competitive differentiation. Since 2012 we have been driving a strong focus on consistently delivering a high-quality product and on increasing the lump ratio; both of these features attract premia against the standard product sold in the market.\n\nOur high average Fe content of 64.3% Fe, and our lump:fine ratio of 69:31, enables us to sell our product in an over-supplied iron ore market and to attract Fe and market premia relative to standard products. This year, Kumba achieved a realised FOB price of US$114.57/tonne. This was US$15.75/t above the Platts 62 FOB index, aided by a lump premium of US$6.5/dmt, an Fe premium of US$4.1/dmt and a US$0.8/dmt premium for marketing effort. With the approval of the Sishen UHDMS project the average product grade from Sishen will increase by 0.4% Fe from 2024. It is estimated that this will attract an additional marketing premium of US$1/tonne on 50% of our total production.\n\nWe are further diversifying our customer portfolio, increasing sales in various regions utilising direct-charge materials and growing the share of premium products to 30% of total sales.  This year China represented 62% of our export sales portfolio (2019: 56%) with sales to Europe/MENA decreasing to 19% (2019: 25%) and sales to Japan and South Korea down slightly to 17% (2019: 18%). Contractual sales comprised 77% (2019: 78%) of export sales; 69% of sales (2019: 68% ) were on a CFR basis with the remainder sold free on board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Focus on margin enhancement\n\n## 2.  Strong financial discipline\n\n## 3.   Delivering sustainable returns\n\nThrough our ongoing commitment to margin enhancement, Kumba successfully delivered an EBITDA margin of 57%, up five percentage points from 52% in the prior period. Our integrated sales and operations team contributed to a 19% increase in the average realised FOB iron ore price of US$115/tonne (2019: US$97/tonne). Further margin benefits came from a 14% weakening in the Rand/US$ exchange rate as well as cost savings of R1.3 billion - above our R1.1 billion target for 2020, realised by improved operational e/fficiency, variable cost optimisation across the value chain and overhead cost reductions. These margin benefits were instrumental in containing the break-even price at US$45/tonne. The break-even price was impacted by production losses and higher stay-in-business (SIB) capex. This was over and above higher royalty charges, and ongoing increases in mining inflation and lower lump premium.\n\nOur product portfolio ranges from standard and premium lump and fines to super-premium lump with an average quality of 64.3% Fe (2019: 64.2% Fe) and a lump:fine ratio of 69:31 (2019: 68:32). We captured a US$4/tonne uplift from the Fe and market premia and a US$2/tonne decrease in the Platts freight rates together with a US$16/tonne increase in the Platts 62 index price, which was partially o/ffset by a US$5/tonne decrease in the lump premium, resulting in a higher average realised price of US$115/tonne for 2020.\n\nWith the benefit of our geographically diverse customer portfolio we quickly regained market share outside of China. By the end of 2020, Kumba's sales to the rest of the world increased to 47% compared to only 34% for the first half of the year. For the full year, China's strong economic recovery resulted in the market share of Europe/Middle East and North Africa/Americas and the rest of the world, decreasing from 25% in 2019 to 19% in 2020. This contributed to the share of premium products decreasing slightly to 18% of total sales.\n\n## Enhanced product portfolio (US$/tonne)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContaining costs and leveraging higher iron ore prices (US$/tonne)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through our cash preservation programme, which delivered cost savings of R1.3 billion for the year and the deferral of R1.0 billion of non-critical capital expenditure. SIB spend was streamlined to the minimum necessary to sustain our business and support our production targets. Both deferred stripping and expansion spend were maintained at similar levels.\n\nKumba's balance sheet remains robust, with continued strong cash generation providing flexibility in a volatile market environment. Through our capital allocation framework, cash generated from operating activities services our tax commitments, SIB capital and dividends to shareholders in line with our dividend policy. Excess discretionary cash flow is deployed in the best long-term interests of shareholders with consideration of further investment in the business and incremental returns to shareholders. Throughout the cycle, we aim to retain a net cash balance to ensure that we remain in a position of strength and maintain flexibility against potential headwinds.\n\nFor 2020 Kumba delivered a ROCE of 109% (2019: 83%) and robust attributable earnings of R22.8 billion (2019: R16.3 billion).\n\nOur dividend policy targets a payout range of between 50% and 75% of headline earnings to shareholders. Shareholder returns are prioritised while maintaining a strong flexible capital structure that protects the balance sheet from market volatility and ensures that an appropriate level of capital is allocated to life extension projects and long-term growth prospects.\n\nWith Kumba's substantial cash flow generation of R40.3 million, demonstrating the success of our Tswelelopele strategy, the headline earnings per share for the year were R71.07 (2019: R50.88). The Board declared a final cash dividend of R41.30 per share (2019: R15.99), resulting in a total cash dividend for the year of R60.90 per share (2019: R46.78). This equates to 86% of headline earnings for 2020.\n\n## Cost savings (US$/tonne)\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was offset by a 6% decrease in total sales volumes compared to 2019.\n\nKumba's higher average achieved FOB price was driven by stronger prices. On average, the Platts 62% index increased by US$16/tonne,\n\nwhile the achieved lump premium decreased by US$5/tonne, partially offset by the US$4/tonne higher Fe and market premia.\n\nTotal sales decreased 6% to 39.7 Mt (2019: 42.2 Mt), driven by local sales decreasing 84% to 0.4 Mt (2019: 2.2 Mt), as a result of lower off-take by ArcelorMittal SA due to the decision to wind down its Saldanha Steel plant. For the year, 69% of sales were on a cost and freight (CFR) basis compared to 68% in the prior period. Contractual sales amounted to 77% of total export sales volumes (2019: 78%). China represented 62% (2019: 56%) of Kumba's total exports, and the share of the European Union/MENA/Americas region decreased to 19% (2019: 25%), and Japan and South Korea decreased slightly to 17% (2019: 18%).\n\n## Revenue (Rm)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating expenditure - impacted by stock movement\n\nOperating expenses (excluding mineral royalties and impairment) increased by 8% to R35.8 billion, compared to R33.1 billion in the prior year, largely due to R2.7 billion higher mining-related costs and a R72 million increase in logistics costs.\n\nThe increase in operational costs were primarily attributable to higher stock movement due to sales from stock and work-inprogress (WIP) movements. Selling and distribution costs increased slightly to R6.6 billion (2019: R6.5 billion) due to increases in Transnet tariffs, offset by lower logistics volumes. Freight costs of R5.6 billion were in line with the prior year as lower freight rates of US$11/tonne (2019: US$14/tonne) and slightly lower CFR shipping volumes of 27.0 Mt (2019: 27.3 Mt) were offset by a weaker currency.\n\nMining operational cost increased by R285 million primarily due to lower fixed cost recovery caused by lower production volumes. Sales from stock and WIP movements added R1.9 billion to cost while escalation, non-cash and forex adjustments increased operating expenses by R631 million. This was partially offset by R132 million lower capitalisation of deferred stripping costs.\n\nGood cost stewardship across the value chain coupled with our cost savings initiatives, aimed at offsetting inflation-related costs and reducing controllable cost, delivered savings of R1.3 billion, ahead of our 2020 target of R1.1 billion.\n\nOperating expenditure (Rm)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Controllable costs included higher C1 unit costs of US$1/tonne and higher SIB costs of US$3/tonne, which were offset by a stronger price premium of US$4/tonne. Non-controllable costs contained lower lump premium of US$5/tonne and higher cost inflation and mineral royalties of US$4/tonne, offset by a weaker currency of US$7/tonne and lower freight rates of US$2/tonne.\n\n## EBITDA reflects strong revenue growth and cost discipline\n\nKumba delivered an EBITDA of R45.8 billion, representing an increase of 37% compared to R33.4 billion in the previous year. Growth was primarily driven by the 19% increase in the average realised FOB\n\nexport iron ore price to US$115/tonne (2019: US$97/tonne), resulting in a price impact of R10.3 billion. Cost savings of R1.3 billion and currency gains from a weaker Rand of R16.47/US$ (2019: R14.45/US$), despite lower sales volumes. This is partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, royalties and the lower lump premium.\n\nKumba's EBITDA margin increased by five percentage points to 57% (2019: 52%), the group's mining operating margin improved to 55% (2019: 49%), excluding the net freight profit incurred on shipping operations. Net profit increased by 40% to R29.8 billion (2019: R21.3 billion).\n\n## EBITDA (Rm)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong cash flow supporting a resilient and efficient balance sheet\n\nCapital allocation (Rbn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKumba ended the year with a net cash position of R22.2 billion (2019: R12.3 billion), after cash flow from operations, tax paid, capex and dividends. Cash flow from operations increased by 16% to R40.3 billion (2019: R34.7 billion), due to higher EBITDA. The increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in trade receivables due to higher prices and weaker Rand/US$ currency, this was partially offset by higher inventories as finished stock increased to 4.7 Mt (2019: 6.4 Mt).\n\nWe created stakeholder value by paying income tax of R10.1 billion (2019: R7.8 billion) and mineral royalties of R3.0 billion (2019: R2.6 billion) to government, providing capex of R5.7 billion\n\n(2019: R5.6 billion), and distributing dividends to shareholders of R15.0 billion (2019: R19.6 billion).\n\nKumba's debt facilities consist of an R8 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2024 and uncommitted facilities of R8.2 billion, all of which were undrawn at 31 December 2020. Financial guarantees issued in favour of the DMRE in respect of environmental closure liabilities were R3.4 billion. The annual revision of closure costs reflected a further shortfall of R691 million in respect of the rehabilitation of Sishen and Kolomela. Guarantees for the shortfall will be issued in due course.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk is managed through iron ore swaps and futures contracts that enable closer alignment between sales prices and reference prices set by the group. For more detailed information on financial risk management refer to AFS pages 70 to 75.\n\n## Currency\n\nFor exposure to foreign currency movements, it is group policy to use only derivatives for hedging purposes and not to engage in speculative transactions.

This agreement has been formalised by amending the relevant environmental, water and mining legislation. The financial provisioning regulations were re-published on 10 November 2017, and further proposed amendments were gazetted on Friday, 7 May 2019. The deadline for compliance has been extended to June 2021. Management is in the process of assessing the full impact of these developments on our rehabilitation and decommissioning financial provisions.\n\nFor more information refer to page 91 of the SR\n\n## Taxation\n\nKumba contributes economic value to the government of South Africa and to the host communities in the Northern Cape with taxes paid through the life-cycle of our operations and across our value chain. Our tax contribution of R14.4 billion for 2020 reflects corporate income tax of R10.1 billion, mineral royalties of R3.0 billion and indirect taxes of R1.3 billion.\n\nIn terms of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Act No 28 of 2008 and the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Administration Act No 29 of 2008, the specified condition for iron ore used to calculate the mineral royalty payable will be deemed to have been extracted at 61.5% Fe. Kumba extracts iron ore below 61.5% Fe and this requires management to make certain judgements and estimates when determining the gross sales value of the ore extracted at the group's mines.\n\nThe Company's tax contribution represents a significant portion of the economic value delivered to the government and our host communities. The following cash payments were made to the jurisdictions in which the group operates:\n\n## Total tax contribution by category\n\n| Rand million                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Corporate income tax        | 10,146 | 7,783  |\n| Mineral royalties           | 3,001  | 2,572  |\n| Payroll tax                 | 1,226  | 1,495  |\n| Skills levy                 | 33     | 48     |\n| Unemployment Insurance Fund | 23     | 22     |\n| Total                       | 14,429 | 11,920 |\n\n## Outlook for  2021\n\nOur financial guidance for 2021 is set out below.\n\nThe delivery of these key metrics is subject to the aforementioned key risk factors affecting our performance as described on page 43.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKumba remains focused on improving its performance in 2021. While the Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increase in risk and uncertainty, it also presents a catalyst for change and the opportunity to build on for the longer term.\n\nIn view of this, we are progressing our margin strategy. From a sales and marketing perspective, we are focusing on simplifying and right-sizing the product portfolio to better align with logistical capacity while retaining the value-in-use required by our customers, this enables a more targeted resource allocation and optimisation along our value chain.\n\nOver the past few months a cross-functional team has worked to identify the right combination of products for our new portfolio. We have simplified our portfolio and are focusing on those products that can be scaled to drive value for the long term, while retaining our quality leadership and helping us to achieve our US$2/tonne marketing premium target.\n\nAdditionally, the next phase of Kumba's cost savings programme is also underway. We initiated the first phase in 2018 as part of our Tswelelopele margin strategy. Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic, we delivered R2.6 billion of savings in the past two years including R1.3 billion this year, of which R613 million is Covid-19-related and unlikely to be sustained. This has given us the confidence to set a new target of R2 billion to deliver by 2022. Our work has validated the opportunity to sustainably reduce our spend by driving efficiencies to P101, continuing to work on reducing our fixed overhead cost base, optimising our contractor procurement and management methodologies, eliminating duplication and pulling other efficiency levers, while maintaining and improving operational effectiveness.\n\n- \u00b7 Unit cash costs: guided for Sishen of between R395 and R405/tonne and Kolomela between R300 and R310/tonne. Cost pressure from fuel, labour and maintenance are expected to continue.\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure: is expected to be in the range of R10.8 billion to R11.3 billion. The increase is driven by:\n- - Higher SIB capex through-the-cycle of R3.8 billion to R4.0 billion, for plant and infrastructure spend to improve equipment reliability, safety and environmental sustainability, as well as capital spares;\n- - Deferred stripping capex will reduce to between R2.2 billion and R2.4 billion, following a lower stripping ratio at certain pushbacks at both of the mines;\n- - Expansion capex increases to between R4.8 billion and R4.9 billion, relating to the cost of developing the Kapstevel South pit at Kolomela, and to a lesser extent the UHDMS project. We will also invest further in our P101 efficiency programme in 2021, as this is a critical investment to ensure that we achieve our targeted equipment efficiencies and drive cost saving in our business.\n\nShareholders are advised that these forecasts have not been reviewed, approved or reported on by our auditors.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge our finance team for their commitment, smart work and integrity, especially during the difficult Covid-19 pandemic, and for supporting the business to unlock further value. As a key business partner across the value chain, our team is adding value by ensuring cost and capital discipline, while maintaining a high standard of governance, compliance and financial reporting.\n\n## Bothwell Mazarura\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n26 March 2021",

Natural resources\n\nThese investments may only be utilised for the purposes of settling decommissioning and rehabilitation obligations.\n\n## 2. Financial capital\n\nKumba ended 2020 with net cash of R22.2 billion.\n\nKumba holds deposits of R277 million which are subject to statutory restrictions and therefore are not available for general use.\n\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents is an amount of R893 million that is restricted and required to cover initial margins under derivative contracts and are held at trading exchanges.\n\nTotal debt facilities at year end amounted to R16.2 billion, all of which was undrawn at 31 December 2020.\n\nKumba's debt facilities consist of an R8.0 billion revolving credit facility that matures in 2024, and uncommitted facilities of R8.2 billion at 31 December 2020.\n\nKumba was not in breach of any of its financial covenants during the year.\n\n## 3. Manufactured assets\n\nThe group's working capital position remained healthy, ensuring sufficient reserve to cover short term positions. Net working capital increased by R4.8 billion from 31 December 2019 to R7.5 billion. This increase is mainly due to an increase in trade receivables due to higher prices and weaker R/US$ currency. This was partially offset by lower inventories as finished stock decreased to 4.7 Mt (2019: 6.4 Mt).\n\nDuring the year, Kumba wrote off R762 million of WIP inventory and also increased the provision for nonrecoverable WIP inventory and plant spares and stores to R650 million (2019: R576 million) and R276 million (2019: R210 million) respectively. The total inventory write-down of R902 million was recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 4. Natural resources\n\nThe total rehabilitation and decommissioning provision of the group was R2.7 billion at the end of 2020 (2019: R2.5 billion). The measurement of this provision is a key area where management's judgement is required. The closure provisions are updated at each balance sheet date for change in future cash flows and the discount rate. The LoM plan on which accounting estimates are based only included proved and probable ore reserves as disclosed in the ORMR.\n\n## 5. Natural resources\n\nThe group has issued financial guarantees in favour of the DMRE in respect of its environmental rehabilitation and decommissioning obligations to the value of R3.4 billion (2020: R3.0 billion).\n\nAs a result of the annual revision of closure costs, a shortfall of R691 million arose. Guarantees in respect of the shortfall will be issued in due course.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Natural resources\n\nThe group's total revenue increased by 25%, mainly as a result of the 19% increase in the average realised iron ore export price to US$115/tonne (2019: US$97/tonne), offset by 6% lower sales.\n\n## 7. Manufactured assets\n\nOperating expenditure (excluding royalties and impairment) of R35.8 billion increased with 8%, principally as a result of R2.7 billion higher operational costs and a R72 million increase in logistics costs. The rise in operational cost is primarily attributable to the utilisation of stock and WIP stock movements. Cost increases were partially offset by cost savings of R1.3 billion from operating efficiency improvements and overhead cost reductions.\n\nSishen's unit cash costs increased by 5% to R362/tonne (2019: R345/tonne). This was mainly as a result of mining cost escalation, that increased unit cost by 2% but below CPI of 3.3% due to lower fuel prices. Production losses increased unit cost by R47/tonne and was partially offset by R31/tonne from cost savings and lower mining volumes.\n\nKolomela's unit costs increased 13% to R304/tonne (2019: R270/tonne), owing to cost inflation of 3% and lower production volumes. Lower mining volumes and cost savings provided only partial relief.\n\n## 8. Manufactured assets and natural resources\n\nOperating profit of R40.8 billion increased by 42% (2019: R28.8 billion), mainly due to the 19% increase in the average realised FOB export iron ore price to US$115/tonne, resulting in contribution of R10.3 billion and currency gains from a weaker Rand of R16.47/US$ (2019: R14.45/US$). Cost savings of R1.3 billion mitigated higher mining and logistics costs, as well as the 6% decline in sales volumes.\n\n## 9. Financial capital\n\nFinance income relates to interest earned on short-term deposits, finance costs were paid on finance leases and commitment fees.\n\n## 10. Taxation\n\nThe group's effective tax rate increased to 28% (2019: 27%)\n\n## Segmental analysis\n\n|                                     | Products 1   | Products 1   | Services    | Services             |         |        |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|---------|--------|\n| Rand million                        | Sishen       | Kolomela     | Logistics 2 | Shipping  operations | Other   | Total  |\n| For the year ended 31 December 2020 |              |              |             |                      |         |        |\n| Revenue from external customers     | 51,971       | 22,553       | -           | 5,580                | -       | 80,104 |\n| EBITDA                              | 37,652       | 16,549       | (6,571)     | (17)                 | (1,805) | 45,808 |\n| Depreciation                        | 3,416        | 1,376        | 9           | -                    | 169     | 4,970  |\n| Sta/ff costs                        | 3,083        | 1,147        | 32          | -                    | 744     | 5,006  |\n| For the year ended 31 December 2019 |              |              |             |                      |         |        |\n| Revenue from external customers     | 40,698       | 17,972       | -           | 5,615                | -       | 64,285 |\n| EBITDA                              | 28,695       | 12,513       | (6,500)     | 1                    | (1,337) | 33,372 |\n| Depreciation                        | 3,174        | 1,241        | 10          | -                    | 113     | 4,538  |\n| Sta/ff costs                        | 2,942        | 1,011        | 40          | -                    | 960     | 4,953  |\n| Impairment reversal                 | 23           | -            | -           | -                    | -       | 23     |\n\n- 1 Derived from extraction, production and selling of iron ore.\n- 2 No revenue is reported for this segment as its performance is viewed with reference to volumes railed and rail tariffs.",

Financial capital\n\nThe group's cash generated from operations increased 16% to R40.3 billion compared to R34.7 billion in 2019. The cash was used to pay income tax of R10.1 billion (2019: R7.8 billion), mineral royalties of R3.0 billion (2019: R2.6 billion). Dividends to shareholders totalled R15.0 billion (R11.5 billion to owners of Kumba and R3.6 billion to non-controlling shareholders) was paid out.\n\nIn 2020 R5.7 billion (2019: R5.6 billion) was spent on capital.\n\n## 13. Financial capital\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAs previously reported, during 2018, the South African Revenue Service (SARS) issued Kumba with additional income tax assessments, covering the 2012 to 2014 years of assessments, relating to a tax audit on the deductibility of certain expenditure incurred. Kumba objected against these assessments after consultation with external tax and legal advisers. SARS disallowed the objection.\n\nOn 21 February 2019, Kumba submitted an appeal against this outcome and was referred to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) proceedings in an attempt to resolve the matter. The ADR proceedings were terminated on 20 February 2020, after which Kumba submitted a notice to SARS wherein we confirmed that it wishes to proceed with the appeal to the Tax Court. On 18 August 2020, SARS filed its statement of grounds of assessment and opposing appeal, after which Kumba filed its statement of grounds of appeal on 21 October 2020.\n\nOn 14 September 2020, SARS informed Kumba it intends to audit the 2015 to 2018 years of assessments. As the 2015 year of assessment has prescribed, it will be excluded from the audit. The appeal and the audit concern the same subject matter and the result of the appeal is likely to be determinative of a substantial number, if not all, of the issues traversed in the audit. SARS has therefore agreed to hold the audit in abeyance until the outcome of the appeal is known.\n\nBased on the external legal and tax advice obtained, the group believes that these matters have been appropriately treated in the results for the year ended 31 December 2020.",

Located close to the town of Kathu in the Northern Cape province, the mine has been in operation since 1953 and is a large open-pit mine. All our mined ore is transported to the beneficiation plant where it is crushed, screened and beneficiated. We are the only haematite ore producer in the world to fully beneficiate its product, made possible through our dense medium separation (DMS) and jig technology. At year end, the mine had 4,360 permanent full-time employees and 3,386 full-time contractors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sishen performance summary\n\nWe continue to implement the Anglo Operating Model throughout the business, and this is the foundation for shifting benchmark efficiencies closer to P101, a best-in-class industry benchmark, as part of driving operations to full potential. Sishen owner fleet efficiency decreased from 68% in 2019 to 63% in 2020, largely due to Covid-19 restrictions, weather-related headwinds and to a lesser extent equipment reliability and availability.\n\nA number of interventions have been implemented to mitigate these impacts. We enhanced our high rainfall readiness and associated recovery plans to manage through such weather impacts in the future. Our focus on improving equipment uptime through the implementation of defect elimination and work management programmes, as well as artisan and supervisor skills development programmes, are also delivering results and improvements in equipment reliability across the fleet.\n\nContinued focus on improving operational efficiency through P101 productivity improvements and various other programmes such as guided spotting, adaptive controls, truck speed digital twin and real-time condition-based monitoring.\n\n- Increase in product quality from 63.9% Fe in 2019 to 64.7% Fe in 2020\n- R77.6 million investment in social and community projects, up from R62.1 million in 2019\n- ISO 14001, ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 certified\n\nAn increase in LTIs of 17% compared to 2019, with zero fatalities (2019: zero)\n\n- Waste removal of 148.5 Mt, down 32.6 Mt compared to 2019, impacted by Covid-19-related challenges\n- Production of 25.4 Mt, a decrease of 13% compared to 2019 levels, and slightly below the revised market guidance\n- Unit costs of R362/tonne: R17/tonne higher than 2019, driven by lower deferred stripping, partly o/ffset by lower mining and maintenance costs\n\n## Sishen waste (Mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-\n\n+\n\n70\n\nKumba Iron Ore Limited\n\nIntegrated Report 2020\n\nNeutral outcome\n\n## Sishen production (Mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Situated near the town of Postmasburg in the Northern Cape province, the mine produces lump ore with excellent physical strength that allows us to meet a niche market demand. The mine produces above the name-plate capacity of 9 Mtpa and with improved efficiencies will deliver ~14 Mtpa over its reserve life. Kolomela was the first mine to successfully introduce automated drilling technology in South Africa. At year end, the mine had 1,488 permanent full-time employees and 1,170 full-time contractors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kolomela performance summary\n\nShovel and truck fleet efficiency reduced by approximately 5% during 2020. After realising gains from 35% in 2015, to 65% on the shovels, and 85% on our trucks, the rate of OEE improvement has slowed down. The last 10 to 20% improvement will be more challenging to realise. The analysis has shown that the optimal level for our shovel efficiency, from a value perspective, is around 80%. This still requires a significant improvement from our current levels.\n\n- A substantial reduction in LTI's of 50%, compared to 2019, with zero fatalities (2019: zero)\n- R58.2 million investment in social and community projects up from R53.5 million in 2019\n- ISO 14001, ISO 9001 certified; OHSAS 18001 compliant\n- Slight increase in product quality to 64.5% Fe in 2020 compared to 64.3% Fe in 2019\n\nWaste volumes of 56.2 Mt, 7.0 Mt lower than 2019 levels, impacted by Covid-19-related challenges\n\n- Production of 11.7 Mt, a 12% reduction from 2019\n- Unit costs of R304/tonne were R34/tonne higher than 2019, due to higher mining and maintenance costs - increase in maintenance costs related to the catch-up in the mining fleet lifecycle maintenance activities during 2020\n\n## Kolomela waste (Mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPositive outcome\n\nNeutral outcome\n\nNegative outcome\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-\n\n+\n\n## Kolomela production (Mt)",

This can only be attributed to impeccable guidance starting right at the top with the Company's Chief Executive, rolled out throughout the organisation with excellent communication and management and participation programmes.\n\nOur safety performance is something we are very proud of and harness and celebrate after each new milestone with the necessary caution.\n\nKumba's Tswelelopele strategy (aims to enhance Kumba's financial margins and sustain it for the future)\n\nAs set out below, a major milestone has been achieved in 2020, whereby Kumba has delivered on its ambition as set out in 2018 (to be achieved on or before 2022) of replenishing its Ore Reserves by 200 Mt (at the time the target was set, it was expressed in terms of conversion of ~385 Mt exclusive Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves as Kumba could not publicly state an Ore Reserve conversion target by not having su/fficient confidence to support the conversion from Resource to Reserve at the time, as required by the SAMREC Code).\n\n## Horizon 1\n\nImprove Kumba Iron Ore's financial margins through achieving benchmark productivities, maximising resource utilisation, cost control and obtaining the maximum price for our superior iron ore products.\n\n## 2020 progress:\n\n- \u00b7 Focused pit optimisation conducted at Sishen mine in 2020 resulted in a 52.0 Mt Ore Reserve increase, considering more favourable long-term forward-looking economic assumptions. In addition, the incorporation of optimised haul road designs as well as steeper pit slope design angles for certain lithologies as proposed by phase 2 of the Sishen geotechnical optimisation study, resulted in a further 25.2 Mt Ore Reserve increase. The average waste stripping ratio associated with the larger pit is 3.8 : 1, compared to 3.4 : 1 in 2019.\n- \u00b7 For Kolomela mine the overall waste stripping ratio as per the 2020 life-of-mine (LoM) plan decreased from 3.8 : 1 in 2019 to 3.6 : 1 in 2020, primarily as a result of the new ramp design in the Klipbankfontein pit, reducing the waste tonnages by 27.1 Mt while impacting only 2.3 Mt of the Ore Reserves.\n\n## Horizon 2\n\nApply new beneficiation technology and conduct exploration to extend the Company's life-of-mine. The programme focuses on converting lower grade material to saleable product by fully utilising the Ultra-High Dense Media Separation (UHDMS) technology and exploration knowledge and expertise we have in the Northern Cape to discover new deposits both on and off-lease.\n\n## 2020 progress:\n\n- \u00b7 The Kapstevel South feasibility study at Kolomela mine was approved.\n- \u00b7 At the time of reserve and resource reporting in 2020, the Sishen Ultra-High Dense Media Separation (UHDMS) project feasibility study has not been finalised and has been extended to Q1 2021 to align with the 2020 Sishen LoM plan as presented in the ORMR report.  If approved by the relevant Investment Committees and the Kumba Board, the associated Ore Reserves will only be reflected in the 2021 Ore Reserve (and Saleable Product) and Mineral Resource Report.\n- \u00b7 Kolomela will launch a study in 2021 to convert the 59.1 Mt Ploegfontein Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. The deposit is located within the mining right area but not considered in the current LoM plan and is characterised by a higher proportion of medium-grade (50% \u2264 Fe < 61%) to high-grade (Fe \u2265 61%) ore by virtue of its ore genesis (group of satellite orebodies formed by karst topography), compared to the more massive continuous orebodies currently considered in the LoM plan.\n- \u00b7 On the exploration front, Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd (SIOC) has commenced with exploration activities in the Northern Cape province, including drilling on near-mine properties in relative proximity to existing operations that have been identified as potential iron ore mineralisation targets through its regional genetic geological model. Access for exploration has been achieved through option agreements with current thirdparty right holders. If the properties are prospective, and meet Kumba's expected criteria, Kumba has the right to take up 70% of the ownership in the assets. Exploration activities were limited as a result of adherence to national governmental lockdown restrictions in response to the global Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Replenishing Ore Reserves (and Saleable Product) without compromising income margins and safety\n\nKumba's ambition, set in 2018, was to extend our life-of-mine through efficiency improvements, resource utilisation and exploration. At that stage ~385 Mt of exclusive Mineral Resources was targeted for conversion in the near term (2018 to 2022) to Ore Reserves, which can be translated to an additional ~200 Mt Ore Reserves, thereby extending the life-of-mines.\n\nIn line with this strategy, we have successfully increased the Ore Reserve by a cumulative 206.4 Mt (before depletion) since 2018 as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 +112.1 Mt in 2018 (before depletion) primarily as a result of pit slope steepening as per phase 1 of the Sishen geotechnical optimisation study;\n- \u00b7 +12.8 Mt in 2019 (before depletion) primarily as a result of improved resource to reserve conversion; and\n- \u00b7 +81.5 Mt in 2020 (before depletion) mainly due to the optimisation of the Sishen pit layout considering more favourable long-term forward-looking economic assumptions as well as incorporating steeper pit slope design angles for certain lithologies based on phase 2 of the Sishen geotechnical study, which could only be incorporated into the design after the mine demonstrated that it can achieve final pit boundaries as planned.\n\nAll of the above was achieved through initiatives in support of Horizon 1 of the Kumba Tswelelopele strategy. The Sishen UHDMS project and the Kolomela Ploegfontein project in support of Horizon 2 of the Tswelelopele strategy are further initiatives on the road to achieve a 20-year mine life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Security of tenure\n\nApart from the fact that security of tenure for the Sishen and Kolomela operations is ensured via notarially executed mining rights which have been registered in full at the Mining Titles Office: Pretoria, South Africa, Kumba can also state that for the first time all of its environmental authorisation and permit applications for Kolomela have been approved, with only three pending applications at Sishen. Kumba has been encouraged by the significantly improved levels of collaboration and support received from the South African Governmental Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.\n\n## Saleable product\n\nThe Kumba (combined Kolomela and Sishen) 2020 LoM plan does not deliver scheduled Saleable Product that conforms to current Client product grade specifications for the complete mine life, specifically in terms of Al 2 O 3 . This is primarily as a result of the inherent grade characteristics of the Mineral Resources from which the Ore Reserves and Saleable Product are derived.\n\nAs mitigation, Kumba is in discussion with the Anglo American Marketing Division to ensure an aligned and optimal way forward where value is maximised while considering the inherent grade characteristics of the Mineral Resources.\n\nAlthough the total Saleable Product remaining after 31 December 2020 increased by an estimated 5% year-on-year, it must be noted that the planned average annual Saleable Product output of the Kumba 2020 LoM plan, reduced by 2.1 Mtpa comparing the 2020 LoM plan with the 2019 LoM plan. The decrease has primarily been brought about by an almost 10-fold decrease in off-take in the domestic market from ArcelorMittal SA.",

Ore Limited - 76.3%; Owned by Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited - 100%\n\n## Kolomela's Saleable Product decreased by 13.0 Mt (-8%) from 2019 to 2020\n\nThe overall decrease in the remaining Saleable Product is primarily due to production, with a smaller contribution as a result of a new ramp design for the Klipbankfontein pit, which excludes a relative small amount of previous declared Ore Reserves that were no longer available for conversion to Saleable Product in the 2020 LoM plan.\n\nOther minor movements are detailed in the Kumba Ore Reserve (and Saleable Product) and Mineral Resource (ORMR) report.\n\n## Sishen's Saleable Product increased by 42.0 Mt (+11%) year-on-year\n\nThe net annual increase is a result of pit optimisation conducted in 2020 at Sishen (Kumba's flagship operation), which considered more favourable long-term forward-looking economic assumptions, resulting in a material larger pit layout. Furthermore the optimisation of the haul road designs and the incorporation of steeper pit slope design angles in certain lithologies based on a continuation of the Sishen geotechnical optimisation study, resulted in a further increase in the size of the pit layout. Both of these outcomes made a material amount of more Ore Reserves available for conversion to Saleable Product.\n\nThe increase as explained above was offset by annual production, but the overall net result is a positive gain of 42.0 Mt.\n\nOther minor movements are detailed in the Kumba 2020 ORMR report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is derived from an average 13.3 Mtpa plant feed, which includes 1% modified Inferred Mineral Resources as run-of-mine ore.\n\nTo define the risk of having low confidence modified Inferred Mineral Resources in the LoM plan, Kolomela valuated a long-term mine plan scheduling scenario excluding the modified Inferred Mineral Resources. The plan remained economically viable, although at a 2% lower net present value (at 8% real discount rate).\n\n## Sishen's Ore Reserves increased materially by 52.6 Mt (+10%) year-on-year\n\nMost of the annual increase is a result of the outcome of pit optimisation conducted in 2020, which considered more favourable long-term forwardlooking economic assumptions, resulting in a material increase in the size of the pit layout. In addition, the 2020 pit optimisation considered steeper pit slope design angles for certain lithologies based on a continuation of the Sishen geotechnical optimisation study as well as optimised haul road designs. The outcome of these updated inputs into the pit designs resulted in a material increase in Ore Reserves. As a result, the overall waste stripping ratio in the 2020 Sishen LoM plan increased from 3.4 : 1 in 2019 to 3.8 : 1 in 2020.\n\nFor Sishen, a 15-year reserve life at an average 29.2 Mtpa Saleable Product output has been quoted in the 2020 LoM plan. It is derived from an average 38.9 Mtpa plant feed, which includes 2% modified Inferred Mineral Resources as run-of-mine ore.\n\nTo define the risk of having low confidence modified Inferred Mineral Resources in the LoM plan, Sishen valuated a long-term mine plan scheduling scenario excluding the modified Inferred Mineral Resources. The plan remained economically viable, although at a 3% lower net present value (at 8% real discount).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, optimised haul road designs and the incorporation of steeper pit slope design angles for certain lithologies in the pit optimisation, the latter based on a continuation of the Sishen geotechnical optimisation study, resulted in a further increase in the resource shell size, with the benefit of additional Mineral Resources.\n\nThe year-on-year movements is detailed in the 2020 ORMR report.\n\nOf the 18.5 Mt Inferred Mineral Resources (outside the LoM plan), 1.1 Mt is extrapolated.",

The Board approved a delegation of authority framework (DAF) to provide for the various authority levels across the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nGovernance at Kumba takes into account that its main operating subsidiary, Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Ltd (SIOC), has a shareholding structure that reflects the B-BBEE requirements of the Mining Charter and the MPRDA. Our governance framework is structured in a manner that ensures that the two entities are legally independent and have fully operational but separate boards, with clearly defined responsibilities and authority. The Company's DAF regulates the approval levels of each board.\n\nThe SIOC Board comprises non-executive directors representing the minority shareholders, executive directors from Kumba, and an independent non-executive director.\n\nThe SIOC Board has full authority over matters pertaining to SIOC. It does, however, take into account recommendations and suggestions from SIOC's shareholders, including its majority shareholder, Kumba. In its governance of SIOC's operations, the SIOC Board is supported by Kumba's Board committees and feedback on deliberations of Board committee meetings are provided at each SIOC Board meeting.\n\n## Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The charter sets out the roles and responsibilities of the Board and individual directors, including its composition and relevant procedures of the Board. The charter is aligned with the provisions of the Companies Act No 71 of 2008, as amended (the Companies Act), the JSE Listings Requirements, King IV TM and the Company's Memorandum of Incorporation (MoI).\n\nWhile retaining overall accountability, the Board has delegated authority to the Chief Executive to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Company. The Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer have monthly performance reviews with all executives to obtain feedback relating to key initiatives and agreed KPIs. The Executive Committee meets bi-monthly to discuss overall performance of the business, progress on strategic initiatives and top risks. Governance matters and approvals in line with the Delegation of Authority Framework are also dealt with.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that it has fulfilled its responsibilities in accordance with its charter for the reporting period.\n\n## Our governance approach\n\n## Role of the Board\n\nIn keeping with the spirit of sound leadership, the Board promotes strong principles of integrity within the Company, which aids in entrenching excellence in every facet of the business. The Board is the overall custodian of good corporate governance and is fully committed to the four governance outcomes (as described in King IV TM ), namely: an ethical culture, good performance, effective control and legitimacy.\n\nThe Board plays a key role in setting the strategic direction of the Company. The Board also provides continuous oversight of material matters, acting as an independent check and balance for the executive management team, whose main responsibility remains the management of the business.\n\nThe directors are diverse in their academic qualifications, industry knowledge, experience, race and gender. This diversity encourages robust debate at Board and committee level to ensure that appropriate and effective judgement and guidance are provided to management in delivering on the Company's strategic objectives.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Power, control, support and appointments\n\nDr Mandla Gantsho, an independent non-executive director, is the Chairperson of the Board. In accordance with King IV TM , the Board appointed Mr Terence Goodlace in 2019 as the lead independent non-executive director. The lead independent non-executive director's role includes acting as a sounding board for the Chairperson, chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chairperson and leading the performance appraisal of the Chairperson.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Chairperson and the Chief Executive are clearly defined and separated, as set out in the Board charter. While the Board may delegate authority to the Chief Executive in terms of the Board charter, the separation of responsibilities is designed to ensure that no single person or group can have unrestricted powers and that appropriate balances of power and authority exist on the Board. The Chairperson is responsible for leading the Board and for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the Board and its committees. In contrast, the Chief Executive is responsible for the effective management and running of the Company's business in terms of the strategies and objectives approved by the Board and is accountable to the Board through regular reports.\n\nThe Board considers whether there is an appropriate balance of knowledge, skills and expertise among the non-executive directors. The non-executive directors are considered to have the required skills and experience to have objective judgement on matters of strategy, resources, transformation, diversity and employment equity, financial and operational performance and policies impacting the business.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy in terms of which any director may take independent professional advice, at the expense of the Company, where there is doubt as to whether a proposed course of action is consistent with his/her statutory and/or fiduciary duties and responsibilities. All directors have access to the Company Secretary for advice and guidance on governance matters and compliance with applicable legislation and procedures. Directors also have direct access to Kumba's external and internal auditors, and members of the executive management team, at all times.\n\nIn compliance with JSE Listings Requirements, independent non-executive directors do not participate in any share incentive schemes of the Company.\n\n## Appointments and diversity\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee recommends the appointment of new directors for approval by the Board according to a strategy and succession plan adopted by the Board. The Board charter details the procedure for appointments to the Board. The Board diversity policy also applies to the appointment of new directors. The Nominations and Governance Committee in applying the diversity policy will make the Board appointment recommendations on merit and will consider candidates against objective criteria with due regard to the benefits of diversity, including gender, and the contribution that the candidate will bring to the Board. There is ongoing commitment from the Board to strengthen female representation.\n\nComprehensive induction programmes over a number of days are conducted for all newly appointed directors and includes site visits to the operations.\n\n## Changes to the Board of directors\n\nMs Nonkululeko Dlamini resigned as non-executive director of the Board with effect from 6 July 2020 and stepped down as a member of the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee and the Strategy and Investment Committee.\n\n## Term of office, rotation and retirement\n\nNon-executive directors are subject to a tenure of nine years, which may be extended by a further period of no more than three years, where after those non-executive directors who have served for a period of 12 years must retire at the following annual general meeting and will not be eligible for re-election. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, a director shall cease to hold office should any event as contemplated in clause 26 of the Company's Memorandum of Incorporation occur.\n\nThe Memorandum of Incorporation (MoI) further stipulates that one-third of the Board members will retire from office at the annual general meeting and will be eligible for re-election. The directors to retire are those who have been in office longest since their last election or who were appointed during the year. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are excluded in determining the rotation of retiring members.\n\nThe Board has robustly tested, through an independent evaluation, the independence of all non-executive directors in the year under review. The following non-executive directors are retiring and being eligible will be recommended for re-appointment at the 2021 AGM: Mrs NB Langa-Royds, Mrs MS Bomela and Ms BP Sonjica.\n\n## Skills and diversity\n\nThe Board approved a Board policy promoting broader diversity at Board level. Diversity at Board level is seen as an essential element in maintaining a competitive advantage. Robust discussions about challenging issues require deep insight, multiple angles and collective experience which is where the value of having a diverse Board lies. The Board diversity profile encompasses variables such as gender, race, culture, age, field of knowledge, skills and experience, ethnicity, competencies, philosophies, accomplishments and religion. A diverse Board will include and make good use of all the diversity attributes between members to the Board to encourage debate and make well rounded decisions. These diversity attributes will be considered in determining the optimum composition of the Board. The Board agreed that no voluntary targets be set for 2020 with the undertaking that the policy will be reviewed annually to assess whether or not to set voluntary targets. The Board currently has HDSA representation of 55%.\n\nThe policy promoting boarder diversity will apply to the appointment of new directors and has been taken into account for purposes of succession planning for the Board.\n\nDetails of all Board members can be found on page 82 and 83. The Board, with the support and guidance of the Nominations and Governance Committee, ensures that the promotion of broader\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independence is determined according to the Companies Act, JSE Listings Requirements and the recommendations of King IV TM , which takes into account, among others, the number of years a director has served on the Board.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy dealing with directors' tenure in excess of nine years. Best practice requires the Board to consider whether that director continues to be independent, in executing his/her fiduciary duties. The Board, upon recommendation from its Nominations and Governance Committee, has adopted the policy of annually reviewing directors' independence if their tenure has reached nine years or more.\n\nBased on the results of the evaluation the Board will consider whether there is any evidence of any circumstance and/or relationship that would impair their judgement, to the extent that their independence is compromised.\n\nThe Chairperson of the Board is also subject to re-appointment by the Board and an annual evaluation of his independence and performance is carried out during the annual Board evaluation process. The lead independent director provides the Chairperson with feedback from the annual evaluation process.\n\nThe Board was satisfied that all its independent non-executive directors met its independence criteria for the 2020 financial year.\n\nDirectors are required to avoid a situation where they may have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts with the Company's interests. Directors disclose conflicts of interest at every meeting in terms of section 75 of the Companies Act. Directors present an\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nupdated list of their directorships and interests to the Company Secretary on a quarterly basis; the comprehensive list is tabled at each quarterly Board meeting.\n\nThe Board has approved policies governing the management of conflicts of interest, the protection of confidential information, and dealing in the Company's shares that provides relevant guidance to Board members.\n\n## Directors' induction and development programme\n\nThe Company's induction programme for new directors and training plan for existing Board members aim to holistically address all aspects of being a director, including an understanding of the JSE Listings Requirements, the legal and regulatory framework of the industry, the Kumba operations, and other matters deemed important in ensuring that the directors are able to adequately exercise their fiduciary duties. Each newly appointed director is inducted through a tailor-made 'induction plan', which plan specifically focuses on their individual needs and areas of interest.\n\nThe training programme is also designed to meet the existing and emerging needs of the Board. For the year under review, training was provided to the Audit Committee on IFRS updates, Covid-19 considerations, new accounting standards, amendments and developments. An external facilitated training session was provided to the Board on the governance framework and managing conflicts of interest.\n\n## Board and Executive Committee succession planning\n\nSuccession planning is important in ensuring continuity and strengthening of the collective skills and experience set of the Board. The Nominations and Governance Committee continually assesses the Board and its sub-committees' composition.\n\nThe Board is satisfied with the current Board and sub-committee compositions.\n\nIn November 2020, the Nominations and Governance Committee reviewed the succession planning for the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer. Similarly, the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee reviewed the succession planning for executive management and senior management in the Company. These succession plans identified emergency successors and development plans are in place for successors where readiness levels of three to five years were indicated. Emphasis was also placed on strengthening the female pipeline. The committees will continue to monitor progress in this regard.\n\n## Board and committee evaluations\n\nIn December 2020, an internal annual Board appraisal process was facilitated under the auspices of the Nominations and Governance Committee. The appraisal process solicited each director's views on the performance of the Board as a whole, the performance of the Chairperson of the Board, Company Secretary, the Board committees and committee chairmen. It is pleasing to report that the Board was assessed as performing very well in most areas, receiving an overall score of 3.84 out of 4. The Board performed exceptionally well in the governance areas relating to roles and responsibilities, and Board committees. The culture of the Board was considered to be very good, characterised by excellent leadership, high levels of mutual respect and frank discussion, underpinned by a deep appreciation of the need for a stakeholder inclusive approach and for the business to be",

Specific mention was made by the Board members of the Chief Executive's deep knowledge of the business, including ESG, the stakeholder aspects and the inclusive and integrated approach required. Suggested areas for improvement include: further strengthening the level of insight of certain Board members through enhanced induction, training and mentoring; improving communication of the group governance requirements and delegation of authority in alignment with King IV TM .\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe Company Secretary's primary role is to ensure that the Board is cognisant of its fiduciary duties and responsibilities. The Company Secretary plays a key role in providing guidance to the Board members on the execution of their duties, keeping the Board aware of relevant changes in legislation and corporate governance best practice. Other key performance areas of the Company Secretary include overseeing the induction of new directors, orientation and ongoing education of directors. The Company Secretary is also secretary to the Board committees and Board members have unfettered access to the services of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is a prescribed officer and the Company's Ethics Officer.\n\nThe role has expanded to include executive oversight over other areas, including insurance, business integrity, management of the Company's intellectual property and regulatory compliance.\n\nAn assessment of the Company Secretary and Secretarial function was carried out by the Nominations and Governance Committee on behalf of the Board. The results confirmed that the Company Secretary had the requisite level of knowledge and experience to discharge her duties and maintains an arm's-length relationship with the Board.\n\nThe Board processes are managed by the Company Secretary with the support of the governance, risk, compliance and ethics functions. The team is adequately resourced and has the necessary skills, experience and attributes to effectively support the Board and its committees in discharging its duties.\n\n## Board committees\n\nThere are five Board committees, namely: the Audit Committee; Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee (Setco); Human Resources and Remuneration Committee (Remco); Strategy and Investment Committee (Stratco) and Nominations and Governance Committee (NomGov). Each committee consists of a minimum of four members, as contained in the terms of reference.\n\nEach committee, including the Board, promotes strong principles of integrity within the Company and the Board remains the overall custodian of good corporate governance. Sound corporate governance provides a critical foundation, both for safeguarding stakeholder value and for achieving the Company's key strategic focus areas. Independent Board oversight and guidance in relation to the operations and activities are key in driving compliance and embedding the highest levels of integrity and transparency throughout the Company. Through the governance structures and committees, decisions are made and responses generated to ensure value is created for the Company and its stakeholders.\n\nThe following applies to Board committees:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairperson and lead independent director attend all Board committee meetings, either as a member or as an invitee\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer has a standing invitation to attend all committee meetings where he is not a member\n- \u00b7 other Company executives attend meetings where appropriate and by invitation\n- \u00b7 at the discretion of the committee chairmen, in-committee discussions are occasionally conducted without invitees\n- \u00b7 all members of Board committees are directors of the Company\n- \u00b7 where committee membership is prescribed by the Companies Act 2008 or the JSE Listings Requirements, or is recommended by King IV TM , Board committees are constituted in accordance with such requirements or recommendations\n- \u00b7 committee chairmen report on proceedings of committee meetings to the Board, and minutes of all Board and committee meetings are included in Board papers\n\n## Kumba Board\n\nThe Board is the custodian of good corporate governance and sets the tone for ethical leadership. Its role and responsibilities include setting the Company's strategic direction, providing continuous oversight of the Company's performance on material matters, and holding the executive management team accountable to provide ethical and effective leadership.\n\nThe Board charter sets out the composition, scope of authority, responsibilities and powers and functioning of the Board. The Board believes that its combined skills and experience are appropriate for the effective execution of its duties.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Actions for implementation in 2021 have been identified and agreed by the Board.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe role of the Audit Committee, in addition to its statutory duties in line with the Companies Act 2008, as amended, is to provide independent oversight of the effectiveness of the Company's financial, operating, compliance and risk management controls. In addition, the Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the internal auditors and the independence and effectiveness of the external auditors. This assists the Board in monitoring the integrity of the Company's annual financial statements (AFS) and related external reports.\n\nThe Committee comprises independent non-executive directors who collectively have the necessary financial literacy, skill and experience to perform the committee role and functions effectively.",

These policies guide employees, contractors, suppliers and all other stakeholders on how the Company conducts itself and the way it does business.\n\nKumba has upheld its principle of 'zero tolerance' to unethical behaviour throughout its activities during the year under review. This has intrinsically been achieved through exercising rigorous ethics management and monitoring through a systematic and structured framework. Kumba has a clear governance structure charged with ethics management to ensure effective and efficient monitoring. The Board, through the Audit and Social, Ethics and Transformation Committees, is the ultimate custodian of ethics management as outlined in the Companies Act and King IV TM . Kumba has a Management Ethics Committee which is responsible for ongoing management of ethics. The Committee meets on a quarterly basis to consider all ethics and integrity-related issues and reports to the Board committees. An Ethics Steering Committee was established, which meets on a monthly basis and reports to the Ethics Committee. Kumba has a dedicated anonymous tip-offs (whistleblowing) hotline, independently run by a third party.\n\nThe Kumba ethics function is led by the Company Secretary as the Ethics Officer who also serves as the Chairperson of the Management Ethics Committee. The Committee made good progress in investigating and closing off reported incidents.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Ethics Officer created awareness through targeted communication on unethical behaviour which was done through various platforms to reach all employees, suppliers, contractors, and communities. All reported incidents are thoroughly investigated either internally or by external forensic investigators and resolved timeously, depending on the complexity of the matter. During the investigation process, fairness and transparency is exercised and the outcome of each investigation is properly considered to ensure that corrective action is taken to address control failures.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nKumba recognises the importance of complying with legislation as well as adhering to non-binding rules, codes and standards impacting its mining operations. The compliance process is an important element in embedding a compliance culture at Kumba and providing the Board and management with the assurance of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe compliance function is aligned to the Company's strategic objectives and works closely with the risk function and Anglo American internal audit department to ensure the alignment of the combined assurance providers approaches to monitoring and reporting. The regulatory compliance controls and monitoring, that were introduced during the previous financial year, were\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinued throughout 2020. The outcome of the risk-based compliance monitoring of controls and mining activities resulted in the Company adopting appropriate remedial and/or mitigating steps, where necessary, to comply with the spirit and letter of the findings.\n\nDuring the year the compliance function provided reports to the Management Risk Committee and the Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee on the level of regulatory compliance by the Company to the applicable mining and related legislation, regulations, standards, best practices and codes that have been identified to be of importance.\n\nThe compliance function reports operationally to the Company Secretary and has regular direct contact with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive and senior management. In addition, the compliance function attends key management and governance meetings.\n\n## Annual compliance certificate\n\nThe annual compliance certificate confirming the Company's compliance with the JSE Listings Requirements for the period was completed and will be submitted to the JSE on 15 April 2021.\n\n## Trading in securities\n\nKumba has a defined trading in securities policy, which is in alignment with the JSE Listings Requirements, and sets out provisions as to how trading is to be conducted by Kumba's directors, directors of Kumba's major subsidiaries, the Company Secretary and relevant employees when dealing in the Company's securities, to prevent the misuse of inside information.\n\nThe Kumba policy and JSE Listings Requirements prohibit directors and relevant employees from trading in any securities relating to Kumba without obtaining prior approval from the Chairperson of the Board or other designated directors.\n\nDirectors are also required to publicly disclose any dealings in the Company's securities by themselves or their associates. The JSE Listings Requirements has defined closed periods that prohibits trading in Kumba securities during the following periods:\n\n- \u00b7 the time period from 1 January every year to the date on which the annual financial results are published (1 January 2020 to 18 February 2020)\n- \u00b7 the time period from 1 July every year to the date on which interim financial results are published (1 July 2020 to 28 July 2020)\n- \u00b7 any period when Kumba is trading under a cautionary announcement; and\n- \u00b7 at any time when an individual is in possession of price sensitive information in relation to Kumba's securities or otherwise where clearance to deal is not given in terms of paragraph 3.66 of the JSE Listings Requirements\n\nThe prohibition applies equally to the directors, executive and designated employees' associates. At the start of a closed period, directors and employees are formally advised of the commencement and duration of the closed period. In addition, ad hoc trading embargoes are imposed on individuals who possess price-sensitive information of a particular nature, at any given time, if it is the opinion of Kumba that there exists a risk of insider trading.\n\n## Sponsor\n\nKumba fully understands the role and responsibilities of the sponsor stipulated in the JSE Listings Requirements and has cultivated a good working relationship with its sponsor, Rand Merchant Bank (RMB). The Company is satisfied that the sponsor has executed its mandate with due care and diligence for the year under review.",

Attracting, motivating and retaining the best people, requires having effective market-related remuneration and incentive policies and practices. In addition to having a material impact on Kumba's value creation, a company's remuneration practices is also of particular interest to many of our stakeholders, including especially our shareholders.\n\n## Delivering our responsibilities as Remco\n\nOne of Kumba's four strategic ambitions is for the Company to be the employer of choice in the South African mining sector. As Remco, it is our responsibility to assist Kumba to deliver on this ambition by ensuring that the Company has the right remuneration practices in place, particularly at the executive level. As Remco, we strive to ensure that Kumba provides competitive remuneration that is seen as fair and appropriate in the context of general market conditions and overall employee remuneration, and that provides the right incentives to ensure delivery of the Company's strategic objectives over the short, medium and long term.\n\nEach year, the performance of the Kumba executive team, and overall workforce, is assessed collectively against the Kumba business unit scorecard, as agreed with Anglo American and sanctioned by this Remco. Members of the executive team are mutually responsible for delivering on the scorecard's operational and strategic objectives, and ultimately are held accountable by the Chief Executive and the Board on their individual contribution to achieving the team goals. The Chief Executive is measured against his personal scorecard, which is aligned to the Kumba scorecard. Remco is also responsible each year for reviewing the Company's remuneration disclosure in this report to ensure that it is accessible, accurate and complete, and that it is aligned with best practice governance requirements. Through this annual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndisclosure, we strive to provide sufficient forward-looking information for shareholders to assess the remuneration policy and to approve a resolution in terms of section 66(9) of the Companies Act, 2008.\n\n## Key decisions and activities this year\n\nReflecting on Remco's activities during 2020, there are five developments that I wish to highlight:\n\n- \u00b7 The most significant development this year, and one that I am particularly proud of, was the nature of Kumba's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Company's remuneration policy finding an appropriate balance in protecting the best interest of employees, local communities, and shareholders. Under the initial level 5 lockdown period, introduced from 27 March 2020, Kumba was allowed to have 50% of its workforce at its operations from April, and 100% from May, as part of a sector lockdown exemption. During this period, employees reporting for normal duty continued to receive their normal monthly remuneration, including all allowances and benefits applicable, while those employees not reporting for duty, received their basic salary or basic employment cost with all allowances forfeited for the period; employer retirement fund contributions and medical subsidy benefits were maintained for all employees during this period. For vulnerable employees, a multi-pronged solution was approved, with various special measures considered on an individual basis, to best accommodate and protect every and all vulnerable employees. In recognition of the increased workload on, and demand for, the Company's occupational health personnel during this period, we approved a discretionary short-term critical skills and circumstantial allowance. In support of public efforts to combat Covid-19, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer committed one-third of their monthly net pay to the Mining Dialogues 360 Degrees Public Benefit Organisation and the Solidarity Fund respectively, for the three-month period May to July 2020.",

Given the Covid-19 restrictions and the Company's drive to work smarter and drive digitisation, we encouraged qualifying employees to view and accept their awards through ENGAGE, an Anglo American mobile application platform. Aided by a comprehensive awareness campaign supported by the unions, beneficiaries were able to accept their awards on the platform within the prescribed 30-day period. A potential extension of the scheme is under consideration.\n- \u00b7 This year, Kumba successfully concluded a multi-year collective bargaining agreement with the three representative trade unions, for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2023. The agreement regulates the annual salary adjustment percentage; for 2020, a total negotiated increase of 4.81% was granted, applicable to basic salaries, housing allowances, thirteenth cheques and fixed allowances for all bargaining unit employees.\n- \u00b7 Aligned with Kumba's longstanding commitment to sustainable development, as well as with recent increased investor interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, we have confirmed the inclusion of five specific ESG-related performance measures within our balanced scorecard measures. These measures - relating to safety, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas intensity, tailings dams and dust - collectively contribute to 10% of the 2020 LTIP conditional share grant to Band 4 and above employees.\n- \u00b7 Following the appointment of PwC as Kumba's external audit service provider, and to address independence requirements relating to advisory services, the Remco appointed Bowmans Gilfillan, to replace PwC in providing specialist, independent remuneration advice on all forms of executive and non-executive pay.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nI would like to thank my colleagues on Remco for their advice and support in ensuring that the Committee delivers on its mandate. On behalf of Remco, I extend our collective thanks to Themba Mkhwanazi and the executive team for their work during this challenging year. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the Company's shareholders and proxies who have given us valuable insights on our remuneration activities; I encourage you all to please give us any further feedback on the Company's remuneration practices.\n\n## Ntombi Langa-Royds\n\nChairperson of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee\n\n26 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

The level 5 lockdown resulted in the immediate demobilisation of our operations, followed shortly thereafter by a mobilisation to 50% of our labour force being allowed at the operations as a DMRE industry lockdown exemption dispensation. A further exemption to 100% of our labour force followed in May 2020. Kumba management had to determine the best course of action in terms of the Company's remuneration policy in the best interest of shareholders, employees and the local communities alike, during this unprecedented time. The following, key remuneration policy decisions were sanctioned and implemented during 2020, related to the Covid-19 pandemic and regulations pertaining:\n\n- \u00b7 Special Dispensation during the National Lockdown Level 5: During the initial National Level 5 lockdown in April 2020, Kumba was allowed 50% of our workforce at the Operations under the DMRE industry lockdown exemption and implemented the following arrangement pertaining to the remuneration of our employees over this period:\n- I. Employees reporting for normal duty during the lockdown period, continued receiving their normal monthly remuneration, including all allowances and benefits applicable.\n- II. Employees not reporting for duty during the lockdown period, still received their basic salary (Bargaining category) or Basic Employment Cost (Non-Bargaining category), but all allowances were forfeited for the period.\n- III.  The employer retirement fund contributions and medical subsidy benefits were maintained for all employees over the lockdown period\n- IV.  The short-term incentive payments for the employees not reporting for duty during the lockdown period, were prorated with reference to the number of days during which the employee did not report for duty over the period of 1 April to 30 April 2020.\n- \u00b7 Treatment of our Vulnerable Employees: The Covid-19 pandemic raised the bar for the occupational fitness levels of our employees. Companies are required to perform risk assessments to ensure that the appropriate workplace measures are put in place to protect vulnerable employees during the pandemic. Kumba adopted special measures to promote the physical distancing of our employees during the pandemic, most specifically so for employees in the following three categories of vulnerability, being:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- I. Employees with known or disclosed health issues or comorbidities, or with any condition which may place such employee at a higher risk of complications or death if they are infected with Covid-19;\n- II. Employees above the age of 60 who are at a higher risk of complications or death if they are infected with Covid-19;\n- III.  Employees who are pregnant, notwithstanding where they are in their term, where both the mother and unborn child may be at risk of complications if they are infected with Covid-19.\n\nManagement had to consider solutions that did not place employees in a worse-off position, while balancing Company affordability and sustainability during the pandemic. Management implemented a multi-pronged solution approach in how the Company accommodated our vulnerable employees as well as the best interests of all stakeholders involved. The following alternative special measures were considered, on an individual basis, as how to best accommodate and protect every one of our vulnerable employees during the pandemic:\n\n- I. Determine whether the employee can perform their work or duties remotely (from home) and enable if possible;\n- II. Determine whether the Vulnerable Worker can fulfil a different role and responsibility which has a lower risk for Covid-19 transmission;\n- III. Determine whether the Vulnerable Worker's environment can be adapted or improved to lower the risk for Covid-19 transmission (e.g. stricter physical distancing protocols or additional hygiene and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) measures);\n- IV. Determine whether the Vulnerable Worker can be provided with additional hygiene enablement tools, such as providing the worker with their own hand sanitiser;\n- V. Determine whether the Vulnerable Worker can be provided with more advanced/alternative PPE such as a face shield;\n- VI.  Determine whether risks can be mitigated further, for example reducing interaction with visitors, the use of public transport or peak clocking hours (alternative working hours);\n- VII.  Pregnant employees can work either remotely, if their position requirements permit, or they are placed on Covid-19 special leave at full remuneration for the duration of their term. Normal maternity benefits apply as of delivery.\n\nKumba also implemented a comprehensive process for our vulnerable employees that could not be accommodated in any of the above mentioned alternative working arrangements. The process is based on a system of voluntary participation by the vulnerable employee, where",

        "page_content": "the employee could not be issued with a fitness to work declaration by the Occupational Medical Practitioner (OMP). This would entail a discussion between the OMP and the vulnerable employee to fully explain the risks, should the vulnerable employee contract Covid-19, and provide an opportunity to (should they agree) discuss available employment and remuneration options with HR. Should the employee agree to the disclosure, HR and the employee could discuss the following options, which may be implemented only by agreement:\n\n- \u00b7 The initiation of an incapacitation process, following a number of chronological escalating steps as follows:\n- \u00b7 The employee being placed on sick leave at full remuneration, until such time that their accrued sick leave quota has been depleted;\n- - The employee being placed on compulsory vacation leave at full remuneration, until such time that their accrued vacation leave quota has been depleted;\n- - Special leave at a downscaled remuneration of 60% of BEC (BEC means basic employment cost and will be equal to cost to company minus the employer retirement contribution for the non-bargaining category employees and basic pay plus 13th cheque plus pensionable housing allowance for the bargaining category employees) and excluding all circumstantial allowances. The full employer retirement benefits will be payable as well as employee medical aid contribution, but the employee pension fund contribution will also be scaled down to a 60% contribution level. This scaled down pay benefit will only be applicable for a period of eight weeks (two months) where after it will expire;\n- - Unpaid leave on furlough with UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund) TERS (Temporary Employee Relief Scheme) benefits claimable; and lastly\n- - Incapacity termination with a severance package offset against the partial pay benefit received for a maximum period of two months.\n- - Application for a voluntary severance package and being reconsidered for applicable vacancies after a period of 12 months, should a vaccine be available, or the pandemic have dissipated at that time.\n- \u00b7 Covid-19 Short Term Critical Skills and Circumstantial Allowance: As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant additional pressure on the national medical healthcare infrastructure, a discretionary short-term critical skills and circumstantial allowance was approved. In recognition of the increased workload on our Occupational Health personnel and to retain these essential skills during the high skills demand period introduced by the Covid-19 pandemic, this limited duration allowance applicable for 12 months was calculated as a percentage of the Cost to Company (CTC) of the Occupational Health personnel and paid monthly. The duration may be reviewed at management discretion as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Executive directors' contributions to Covid-19 relief initiatives: In a commitment to support government, our people and our host communities towards combatting Covid-19, a personal contribution by our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of one-third of their monthly net pay was made to the Mining Dialogues 360 Degrees Public Benefit Organisation and the Solidarity Fund respectively, over the three-month period of May to July 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Progress of Karolo, a broad-based ESOP scheme: Kumba's Envision phase II ESOP was unwound in November 2016 and the replacement scheme, branded as Karolo (meaning 'Part of'), was communicated to employees during mid-2018. The third and last tranche award was made on 3 August 2020. Due to the Covid-19 social distancing restrictions, the previous manual process of operating physical hubs, where employees would receive and accept their awards, had to be reviewed. Aligned to the Company's Tswelelopele programme of Working Smarter and pursuing Digitisation, qualifying employees were encouraged to view and accept their awards through ENGAGE, an Anglo American mobile application platform. Kumba also implemented a new, cloud-based, share administration platform service provider, ShareForce, which was seamlessly integrated with the ENGAGE mobile platform for the purpose of the 2020 award grant acceptance. A comprehensive awareness campaign driven by the Human Resources function and supported by the unions, ensured that beneficiaries were able to accept their awards on the mobile platform, within the prescribed 30-day acceptance period. The second AGM for Karolo was held on 30 June 2020 via a webcast. As the final grant to employees was made under the current Karolo scheme rules on 3 August 2020, a potential extension of the scheme is under consideration.\n- \u00b7 Multi-year wage agreement (2020 to 2023): A multi-year collective bargaining agreement was concluded between Kumba and the representative trade unions, for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2023. Two of the three recognised trade unions entered into an agreement effective 1 July 2020. The remaining trade union accepted the agreement effective on 18 December 2020. The agreement was implemented on a backdated basis from 1 July 2020 for the members of the remaining trade union. The agreement regulates the annual salary adjustment percentage; for 2020, a total negotiated increase of 4.81% was granted, applicable to basic salaries, housing allowances, thirteenth cheques and fixed allowances for all bargaining unit employees.\n- \u00b7 Appointment of new remuneration advisory service provider: Where appropriate, Remco obtains advice from an independent remuneration advisory service provider. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was contracted as the Anglo American group advisory service provider to the Remco on all matters pertaining to reward and remuneration since May 2014. On 2 May 2019, Kumba appointed PwC as its external audit service provider to replace Deloitte in 2020 after a hand-over, transitioning period. The appointment of PwC as external auditor to the Company constitutes an independence requirement situation in terms of advisory services rendered and hence Kumba was requested by the Audit Committee of the Board to terminate all advisory services with PwC after September 2019.\n\nFollowing a request for proposal technical and commercial review of potential advisors through the Kumba Supply Chain governed processes, the Remco appointed a specialist service provider, Bowmans Gilfillan, to provide specialist, independent remuneration advice on all forms of executive and non-executive pay. A retainer contract was subsequently entered with Bowmans Gilfillan until 31 May 2021.",

The Team+ performance management approach is a value delivery pathway for the creation and fostering of a new, purpose-led high-performance culture where everyone is working together as one team to achieve something extraordinary. Underpinning this new, deliberate culture change, is a new approach to performance management and the underlying, supporting performance incentives from 2019 onward.\n\nKumba, through Remco, has aligned with and adopted the new performance management and incentive scheme approach, design and implementation. The changes to the performance management and incentive scheme regime pertain specifically to the middle management and above employees. The on-target\n\nproduction bonus regime, based on collective performance objectives specific to an operation or site, remains unaffected by these changes.\n\n## 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (granted under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) rules)\n\nThe purpose of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is intended to incentivise, attract and retain high performing employees as part of its employee value proposition. Awards are subject to underlying LTIP performance measures which are measured over a three-year period. These conditional vesting performance measures are reviewed and evaluated annually by the Remco. The Remco considers the key business value and ESG drivers in selecting metrics and the alignment of the participants reward with long-term value creation in setting performance targets.\n\nChanges for the 2020 financial year LTIP grant performance conditions breakdown are summarised below, compared to the 2019 grant:\n\n| LTIP performance  key result area  (KRA)   | 2019  performance  weighting   | 2019 performance measure                  | 2019 measure  weighting   | 2020  performance  weighting   | 2020 performance measure            | 2020 measure  weighting   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Relative total  shareholder  return (TSR)  | 70%                            | TSR - Global iron ore peer  group         | 35%                       | 50%                            | TSR - Global iron ore peer  group   | 25%                       |\n| Relative total  shareholder  return (TSR)  | 70%                            | TSR - JSE/FTSE mining index               | 35%                       | 50%                            | TSR - JSE/FTSE mining index         | 25%                       |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | Financial measures - 20%                  | Financial measures - 20%  |                                | Financial measures - 30%            | Financial measures - 30%  |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | Attributable free cash flow               | 10%                       |                                | Attributable free cash flow         | 15%                       |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | ROCE                                      | 10%                       |                                | ROCE                                | 15%                       |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | ESG measures - 10%                        | ESG measures - 10%        |                                | ESG measures - 20%                  | ESG measures - 20%        |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | Rehabilitation and mine closure           | 3%                        |                                | Tailings dams standard              | 4%                        |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | Safety - TRCFR                            | 2%                        | 50%                            | Energy e/fficiency                  | 4%                        |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | Level 3, 4 and 5 environmental  incidents | 3%                        |                                | GHG intensity                       | 4%                        |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            | PM10 dust control                         | 2%                        |                                | PM10 dust control                   | 4%                        |\n| Balanced  scorecard  of metrics            | 30%                            |                                           |                           |                                | Safety critical control  monitoring | 4%                        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, the Band 4 forfeitable share awards were replaced with conditional LTIP share awards. Approval was also granted to award these conditional awards in terms of the new Performance Share Plan (PSP) rules, superseding the original LTIP rules that expired on 20 March 2019.\n\nThe Committee further approved changes to the Executive directors' remuneration policy at its meeting on 25 November 2019, affecting the weighting of the LTIP awards' vesting performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconditions.  The weighting of the relative total shareholder return (TSR) metrics has been reduced from 70% down to 50%, while the balance of the balanced scorecard of metrics' weighting has been increased from 30% up to 50% to enable a lift on the weighting of financial and ESG measures.\n\nAs per the approved changes to the Executive directors' remuneration policy in November 2019, the LTIP award performance conditions comprise 50% total shareholder return (TSR) metrics and the balance of 50% balance scorecard performance metrics, encompassing key financial and ESG strategic deliverables for the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

remuneration policy for 2020\n\nThe current Executive director's remuneration policy continues to be effective. However, some revisions are required to further align with our horizon strategic priorities and investor expectations. Changes are as follows:\n\n## Impact of share price volatility on LTIP award values\n\nFor LTIP awards made in 2020 onwards, the Committee will replace the existing cap on vesting value (200% for the Chief Executive as of 2018) with a reduction to the size of award at grant if Kumba's share price declines by 25% or more between consecutive award dates. The operation of the cap creates potential misalignment with shareholders as it penalises (and disincentives) strong performance post grant rather than addressing the original share price decline. The new mechanism is more appropriate going forward as it brings Kumba into line with market practice and\n\nremoves the risk of misalignment. This new approach better limits the dilutive impact of a share price fall is more motivational and closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.\n\n## Rebalancing the performance measures for LTIP awards\n\nA revision of the policy on LTIP performance measures, will allow greater flexibility around measure selection for future award cycles. This revision is intended to ensure that the LTIP awards made during the life of the policy can be structured to remain closely aligned with Kumba's strategic priorities for the relevant three-year period. For awards to be made in 2020, the Committee is proposing a scorecard comprising the same measures as used for 2019 awards, but reducing the weighting on relative TSR from 70% to 50% and up-weighting our balanced scorecard of strategic KPIs. This allows for a greater focus on ESG metrics and will provide a better balance between internal and external, as well as absolute and relative performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Going forward, a minimum of 50% of the bonus opportunity will be linked to financial performance; a minimum weighting of 15% will be linked to safety, health and environment (SHE) and individual objectives will be weighted no higher than 20%. The balance of the bonus opportunity will be linked to measures based on the Company's strategic priorities.

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Promoting long-term executive share ownership\n\nAligned with the Anglo American Group, and based on investor feedback, the Committee has opted to incorporate an in-post shareholding requirement for the Kumba Chief Executive. Taking a holistic approach to share ownership requirements, the Committee will decrease the annual bonus deferral (deferred bonus arrangement) percentage and time horizon to bring it into\n\nline with market practice. The bonus deferral will be decreased to 50% of the total bonus and this is deferred over two and three years. An in-post shareholding guideline of 200% of salary for the Chief Executive will be introduced. No post-exit shareholding requirements are currently being contemplated. The policy changes are summarised as per the following table.\n\nTable E: Changes to long-term executive share ownership\n\n| Policy element                              | Policy prior to 2020                                                                           | 2020 policy onward                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bonus deferral (deferred bonus arrangement) | 60% of bonus earned Deferred shares vest: \u00b7  40% over three years; and \u00b7  20% over five years. | 50% of bonus earned Deferred shares vest: \u00b7  17% over two years; and \u00b7  33% over three years. |\n| In-post share ownership guideline           | None                                                                                           | Chief Executive: 2 x salary                                                                   |\n| Post-employment share ownership requirement | None                                                                                           | None                                                                                          |\n\n## Changes to the STI and DBA implemented for the 2020 performance year\n\nThe practice in Kumba was to pay 40% of the annual short-term incentive (STI) as a cash payment and to defer the remaining 60% in shares for three years (three and five-year vesting tranches for the Chief Executive) under the deferred bonus arrangement (DBA) for the Executive directors, Prescribed o/fficers and senior management (Band 5 and above employees) before 2020. In line with the policy change implemented for the Executive directors, the bonus deferral arrangements for Band 5 and above employees have also been brought in line. Under the new policy, 50% of the annual short-term incentive is paid in cash and 50% is deferred in shares over a tranched, two and three-year vesting period. A third of the deferred bonus vests after two years, while the remaining two thirds vest after three years.\n\n## Executive directors and Prescribed officers' contracts of employment\n\nExecutive directors and Prescribed officers are not employed on fixed-term contracts but have standard employment contracts with notice periods of up to six months. The Chief Executive's contract has a restraint of trade provision for a period of 12 months after the termination of his employment. There are no additional payments for any of the restraint obligations as the Chief Executive's remuneration is deemed fair and reasonable compensation inclusive of the restraint obligations.\n\nThere is no restraint of trade provisions applicable to the Chief Financial Officer and Prescribed officers. No restraint payments have been made during this year. There are no change of control provisions or any provisions relating to payment on termination of employment.\n\n## Appointments of Executive directors' and Prescribed officers\n\nAppointments are subject to approval by the Board and are governed by the business integrity policy.\n\n## Non-executive directors' fees\n\nNon-executive directors do not have employment contracts with the Company or participate in any of the Company's incentive plans. Non-executive directors are subject to retirement by rotation and re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Memorandum of Incorporation of the Company.\n\nRecommendations on the level of fees payable to Non-executive directors, are made by Remco and are approved by the shareholders. Non-executive directors' remuneration is determined through the benchmarking of market data, based on a survey of a representative comparator group of JSE-listed companies, as conducted by an independent external service provider. Fees are not dependent on meeting attendance. There are no other supplementary fees payable.\n\nAnnual fees payable to Non-executive directors were approved by shareholders at the AGM on 7 August 2020. The fees are as follows:\n\n## 2020 fees per annum (Rand)\n\n| Capacity                                     | Chairperson   | Member   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|\n| Board of directors                           | 1,673,251     | 311,541  |\n| Lead independent director                    | 1,224,300     | n/a      |\n| Audit Committee                              | 365,908       | 181,991  |\n| Strategy and Investment Committee            | 332,644       | 165,446  |\n| Social, Ethics and Transformation  Committee | 332,644       | 165,446  |\n| Human Resources and  Remuneration Committee  | 332,644       | 165,446  |\n| Nominations and Governance  Committee        | n/a*          | 165,446  |\n| Special Board Sub-Committee**                | n/a           | 165,446  |\n\n- * The Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chairperson of the Board and there are no additional fees paid for this responsibility\n- **  Ad hoc Special Board Sub-Committee was constituted in quarter one of 2020\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Section three: Disclosure on implementation of policies for the financial year\n\n## Guaranteed pay adjustments\n\n## Average rate of increase for 2020\n\nAn inflation adjustment mandate of 5.5% on the cost to company (CTC - base salary plus employer retirement fund contribution) was approved by the Remco for the non-bargaining category employees, in line with our mining peers and national benchmarks conducted, supported by an external, third-party service provider.\n\nThe total reward (TR) remuneration of the Executive directors are benchmarked against a comparator peer group of JSE-listed companies of similar size and nature of operations and undertaken by a third-party, external service provider. The criteria utilised in the determination of an appropriate peer group were total assets under control, annual turnover, number of employees, EBITDA and market capitalisation.\n\nIn 2020, a multi-year collective bargaining agreement was concluded between Kumba and the representative trade unions, for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2023. Our three recognised trade unions, being the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Solidarity and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), together with management, concluded the agreement which regulates the annual adjustment percentage. A multi-year wage agreement ranging between a 9.6% increase on the lowest level and 5.0% on the highest level of the bargaining category for the first year of the agreement, effective from 1 July 2020 until 30 June 2023 was agreed and signed by two of the three major trade unions effective 1 July 2020. The remaining trade union accepted the agreement effective on 18 December 2020. The agreement was implemented on a backdated basis from 1 July 2020 for members of the remaining trade union.\n\n## Annual performance incentive performance outcomes linked to underlying performance (business results and critical tasks)\n\nSafety performance\n\nSafety is Kumba's core value and 2020 saw the achievement of four years and seven months of fatality-free production through our relentless focus on critical controls geared towards fatality prevention, coupled with increased safety leadership visibility, high risk work verifications and fatigue management. This demonstrates our commitment to safe, sustainable and responsible mining. To keep our workforce focused on safety amid the stresses of living and working with Covid-19, we implemented a number of safety initiatives. These included prioritising our accountability framework, embedding consistent safety behaviour and discipline through our 'Rhythms and routines' programme, as well as a full review of high and severe risk events. A 99% compliance to our critical control monitoring plan within our elimination of fatalities (EOF) framework, which is central to our safety performance was achieved.\n\nEmpowering our workforce to stop unsafe work practices and working conditions was instrumental in reducing the number of accidents to 90 from 146 last year. Section 23 stoppages reflect our employee safety awareness and accountability, and this was well supported. Our high potential incidents (HPIs), a leading safety indicator, decreased to two from 12 in the comparative period, reflecting the progress made through our high-risk work planning and verification processes, together with increased supervisory and management verification and oversight. Total recordable cases (TRC) improved to 39 from 51 resulting in a historically low total recordable case frequency rate of 1.74.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLost-time injuries (LTIs) increased to 18 in the period from 17 in the comparative period, however, these were low severity injuries.\n\n## Production performance\n\nKumba's mining performance was largely impacted by Covid-19 and weather-related incidences, and to a lesser extent, equipment reliability and availability. In line with this, total tonnes mined decreased by 14% to 256.3 Mt (2019: 297.9 Mt) and total waste stripping by 16% to 204.8 Mt (2019: 244.3 Mt). Owner fleet efficiency (OEE) reduced to 63% of benchmark for the year (2019: 68%). A number of interventions have been implemented to mitigate these impacts. We have enhanced our high rainfall readiness and associated recovery plans to manage through such weather impacts going forward. Our focus on improving equipment uptime through the implementation of defect elimination and work management programmes, as well as artisan and supervisor skills development programmes, is also delivering results and we are seeing improvements in equipment reliability across the fleet. We also continued to focus on improving operational efficiency through P101 productivity improvements and various efficiency programmes at both operations through the implementation of technology such as guided spotting, adaptive controls, truck speed digital twin and real-time condition-based monitoring.\n\n## Environment\n\nOur commitment to protecting the environment for present and future generations is unwavering and we continually work towards avoiding and mitigating any negative environmental impacts where we operate. Our aim is to improve lives through responsible environmental practices inclusive of risk management, compliance and environmental and water management.\n\nA major environmental milestone was recorded as there were no major (level 3 to 5) environmental incidents for over five years. Kumba's environmental management efforts are focused on moving the business towards operating carbon neutral and less water intensive mines in light of one of the biggest environmental challenges, climate change. The transition to a low carbon world, both by becoming carbon neutral at our operations and by providing high-quality iron ore that allows customers to reduce their carbon emissions in the process of steel production is a critical path. Continual monitoring of the performance of our tailings facilities has brought about no significant incidents or events recordable in 2020. In addition, Kumba, through the Anglo American membership of the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM), has adopted the Global Industry Standard on Tailings (2020), which is well-aligned with our existing tailings management standard.\n\nA 10% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, surpassing our 2020 target of 4%, was achieved. Our target is a 30% reduction in GHG emissions and a 30% improvement in energy intensity against our 2016 baseline by 2030. Together with the broader Anglo American Group, we are developing solar renewable energy generation and investigating green hydrogen as a renewable energy source for mining activities.\n\nA sustainable water supply is critically important for the health of our communities. Our water strategy has been revised in recognition of this and we are targeting a 50% reduction in fresh water usage by 2030 through the implementation of water efficiency projects such as the reduction of water usage in dust suppression. In 2020, we supported our communities with over 19 megalitres of water supplied to the local municipality at Sedibeng, as part of the essential services we provide to our local communities.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Cost containment\n\nOur strong cost discipline provided further margin protection and resulted in savings of R1.3 billion (2019: R920 million), including R613 million of Covid-19-related savings. This brings our cumulative and sustainable cost savings to R3.2 billion since the advent of our Tswelelopele strategy of margin enhancement and ambition to extend our life-of-mine to 2040.\n\nKumba has established a strong cost saving culture through our cost saving programme, enabling cost savings of R1.3 billion, ahead of our target of R1.1 billion for the year. Of this, Kumba's ongoing cost optimisation programme contributed R687 million of savings, while Covid-19 and cash conservation initiatives provided a further R613 million. Due to these efforts the unit cost of production at Sishen and Kolomela were contained at R362/tonne and R304/tonne, respectively.\n\n## Business and Operating Model\n\nWe continue to implement the Anglo Operating Model throughout our business. This is the foundation for shifting the benchmark efficiency to best-in-class industry benchmark, as part of driving our operations to full potential. We continue to drive our efficiency improvement projects and we have seen some good results in truck direct operating hours (DOH) and shovel tempo.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nKumba effectively managed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations, capturing the benefit of higher iron ore prices and currency weakness to deliver a record EBITDA of R45.8 billion and free cash flow of R20.7 billion.\n\nOur Tswelelopele value over volume strategy provided a solid base from which to navigate the crisis. Since implementing the strategy in 2018, we have improved our EBITDA margin from 45% to 57% in 2020, underpinned by enhanced product premium achieved, and cumulative cost savings of R2.6 billion. With the key value delivery structures already in place, along with our strong balance sheet, we were well positioned to meet the challenges of 2020.\n\nOur Balance Sheet and liquidity was strengthened through our cash preservation programme, targeting cost saving and the deferral of non-critical capex. Our proactive cash preservation contributed to attributable free cash flow of R20.7 billion. Our net cash position of R22.2 billion (2019: R12.3 billion) reflects our resilient and capital-efficient balance sheet, which allowed us to declare a final cash dividend of R41.30 per share to our shareholders.\n\n## 2020 Performance scorecard for the Executive Committee - performance against targets\n\nAligned with the Anglo American Team+ performance management approach, the Kumba Executive Committee were assessed against the business unit performance scorecard, set forth for Kumba. The Chief Executive was assessed against his personal scorecard, aligned with the Kumba business unit performance scorecard objectives, but also reflecting his committed strategic- (20% of the scorecard) and personal objectives (10% of the scorecard) for the performance year.\n\nThe business unit performance scorecard comprise two key result areas, being:\n\n- \u00b7 business results - key output metrics (financial and operational performance, safety, health and environmental (ESG) objectives for the performance year) which comprises 70% of the shortterm incentive potential;\n- \u00b7 critical tasks - programmes and initiatives that the business unit must deliver during the performance year in order to be successful in the transformation of the business towards the Tswelelopele margin improvement and P101 productivity objectives. The critical tasks segment comprises 30% of the short-term incentive potential.\n\nThe 2020 Team+ performance against scorecard objectives was reviewed and assessed based on the following cascading process:\n\n- \u00b7 business results - The Kumba scorecard was reviewed and assessed by the Anglo American Corporate Committee and ratified by the Anglo American Group Management Committee. The final scoring was communicated to the Kumba Remco for final review, consideration and approval.\n- \u00b7 critical tasks - The adjudication of the critical tasks segment of the Kumba scorecard is comparable to the business results segment, but as the critical tasks key result area objectives are interwoven with the Strategic and Personal objectives of the Chief Executive, this section of the scorecard is assessed independently for the Kumba Chief Executive by the Chairperson of the Kumba Board and the Anglo American Chief Executive of Bulk Commodities and Other Minerals, prior to final review, consideration and ratification by the Kumba Remco as per their mandate from the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Kumba, under the strategic direction and leadership of the Chief Executive, had a noteworthy performance year across its operational key result areas. Kumba delivered an EBITDA of R45.8 billion while maintaining our commitment to health and safety and our communities under extraordinary circumstances. Adaption of our value chain and capitalisation on high quality iron ore products saw the EBITDA margin rose to 57%, up from 52% in 2019. A 19% higher average realised FOB export price was achieved.\n\nStrong cost discipline provided further margin protection and resulted in savings of R1.3 billion, including R613 million of Covid-19related savings. A cumulative cost savings of R3.2 billion since initiating our programme in 2018 has been realised. Close collaboration with our logistical partner, Transnet, contributed to the regain of pre-Covid run-rates, while drawing down on high finished stock levels. Production of 37.0 Mt and sales of 39.7 Mt was achieved. Kumba's strong net cash generation, which delivered R20.7 billion of free cash flow, has supported the Board's decision to declare a final cash dividend of R41.30 per share. Combined with the interim cash dividend of R19.60 per share, the total cash dividend for the year increased by 30% to R60.90 per share, representing a payout ratio of 86% of headline earnings.\n\nBusiness performance continue to be driven by our Tswelelopele strategy and work towards realising our ambition to extend the life-of-mine to 2040. The extension of the Sishen life-of-mine to 2035 has been realised through pit optimisation and the approval of the ultra-high dense media separation (UHDMS) project. The development of the Kapstevel South mine at Kolomela and continuation of exploration programme in the Northern Cape are developing our resource pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness resilience and a strong balance sheet matched by a dedicated workforce and strong external stakeholder base, positioned the organisation to meet Covid-19 challenges. The key highlight of 2020 was achieving four years and seven months of fatality-free operations, demonstrating that the health, safety and wellbeing of employees and contractors is first priority. On a broader scale, Kumba responded quickly and comprehensively to the Covid-19 pandemic by supporting the ecosystem in which we operate, enabling us to rapidly resume safe production. The WeCare programme, covering four pillars has become part of our daily operations and supplements the essential services provided to our local communities. These four pillars are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Physical health\n- \u00b7 Mental health\n- \u00b7 Living with dignity and\n- \u00b7 Assisting our communities\n\n## LTIP vesting outcomes and awards for the Executive directors\n\nDuring 2018, conditional shares were awarded to the Executive directors in terms of the rules of the LTIP. The 2018 LTIP performance measures comprised 70% total shareholder return (TSR) and a 30% balanced scorecard of performance measures (financial, safety and environmental). The breakdown and weighting of the performance measures are depicted in the following diagram:\n\nThe performance conditions have been calculated based on targeted against actual performance during 2020, with reference to the base year (2017) parameters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Total shareholder return performance and vesting conditions\n\nOf the conditional shares that are subject to the relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition that will vest, 35% is determined by assessing the Company's relative performance to a global iron ore comparator group in terms of TSR. The approved peer group of 10 companies for the period was determined as:\n\n- \u00b7 Companhia Siderurgica Nacional\n- \u00b7 EVRAZ PLC\n- \u00b7 Ferrexpo Plc\n- \u00b7 Fortescue Metals Group Ltd\n- \u00b7 Hengshi Mining Investments (Aowei) Limited\n- \u00b7 Honbridge Holdings Limited\n- \u00b7 IRC Limited\n- \u00b7 NMDC Limited\n- \u00b7 Shougang Hierro Peru Saa (delisted 30 March 2020)\n- \u00b7 Vale S.A.\n\nThe TSR performance of all the peer group companies, including Kumba Iron Ore, are calculated over the performance period. The TSR performance of Kumba Iron Ore is then compared against the conditional percentile hurdles set to determine the number of awards that will vest. As Shougang Hierro Peru Saa delisted on 30 March 2020, this peer company was excluded from the peer group. The remaining peer weights were grossed up to equal 100% in the peer group quartile calculation.\n\nThe remaining 35% of the relative TSR performance condition is measured against the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE)/ Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) mining index, being a capitalisation weighted index comprised of 15 JSE-listed mining companies and provides and overall indication of Kumba's correlation against other mining companies in the South African environment.\n\n## TSR and vesting conditions - applicable to 70% of conditional shares:\n\n| TSR measure                | Performance  condition  weighting   | Target    | TSR performance                      | Vesting percentage   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Global iron ore peer group | 50%                                 |           | Below the median                     | 0%                   |\n| Global iron ore peer group | 50%                                 | Threshold | Median TSR of the peer group         | 25%                  |\n| Global iron ore peer group | 50%                                 | Stretch   | Upper quartile TSR of the peer group | 100%                 |\n| JSE/FTSE index             | 50%                                 | Threshold | Performance at the index             | 25%                  |\n| JSE/FTSE index             | 50%                                 | Stretch   | Performance at the index + 9%        | 100%                 |\n\nKumba's TSR performance calculated over the performance period (vesting period) was 32.05%, which places the Company's relative TSR performance above the 50th percentile (threshold 25% vesting) of its global iron ore comparator group, but below the 75th percentile (stretch - 100% vesting). Based on the global iron ore comparator group relative TSR condition (35% of the LTIP award), 84.73% of the awards pertaining to this condition vested.\n\nThe compounded annual growth (CAGR) in Kumba's TSR is used to measure the Company's performance over the performance period (vesting period). The FTSE/JSE mining index arithmetic average TSR performance over the performance period has been 32.10%, while the Kumba CAGR for the same period has been 32.05%. Since the performance does not meet the threshold performance at the index, no awards pertaining to this condition (35% of the LTIP award) vest.\n\n## Balanced scorecard performance measures - applicable to 30% of conditional shares\n\n| Condition                                                | Performance  condition  weighting   | Vesting  percentage   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Total recordable case frequency  rate condition          | 5%                                  | 100%                  |\n| Environmental incident condition                         | 5%                                  | 100%                  |\n| Provision for rehabilitation and mine  closure condition | 5%                                  | 0%                    |\n| Return on capital employed  condition                    | 10%                                 | 100%                  |\n| Production unit cost condition                           | 5%                                  | 0%                    |\n\nAs the threshold hurdles for the provision for rehabilitation and mine closure condition as well as the production unit cost condition have not been achieved on performance testing, no awards pertaining to these conditions will vest. The remaining conditions' stretch objectives (100%) have been achieved and 100% of the awards pertaining to these conditions will therefore vest.\n\n## Overall LTIP vesting based on the balanced scorecard and relative TSR performance conditions\n\nThe overall vesting of the 2018 LTIP conditional share award, based on the performance testing of both the relative TSR (70%) and balanced scorecard (30%) performance conditions for 2020 is 49.66%\n\n| Condition                                                | Performance  condition  weighting   | Vesting  percentage   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| TSR-Comparator group                                     | 35%                                 | 84.73%                |\n| TSR-JSE/FTSE mining index                                | 35%                                 | 0%                    |\n| Total recordable case frequency  rate condition          | 5%                                  | 100%                  |\n| Environmental incident condition                         | 5%                                  | 100%                  |\n| Provision for rehabilitation and mine  closure condition | 5%                                  | 0%                    |\n| Return on capital employed  condition                    | 10%                                 | 100%                  |\n| Production unit cost condition                           | 5%                                  | 0%                    |\n| Total overall vesting percentage                         |                                     | 49.66%                |\n\n<!-- image -->",
