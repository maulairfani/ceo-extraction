At the Daigas Group, we have been working hard to provide the stable supply of energy and maintain safety, as a corporate group responsible for social infrastructure. And we are rediscovering the weight of this responsibility on a daily basis.\n\nOver the past 115 years since beginning to provide gas for lighting gas lamps in 1905, our gas business has expanded its application to heat source for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes to electric power generation, in response to social and environmental changes. The Daigas Group has worked to evolve as a corporate group that can meet the needs of customers and society through providing gas and electricity, as well as various related products, services, and solutions to support lifestyles and businesses.\n\nThe Daigas Group's principles and spirit are re/flected in Our Corporate Motto 'Service First' and in What We Aim to Be, 'a corporate group that powers continuous advancement in customers' lives and businesses,' which each employee takes to heart. We believe that it is the management's mission to apply these unwavering corporate principles and values to the greatest extent possible to the Daigas Group's corporate activities, regardless of changes in the times or the environment.\n\nIn the age of COVID-19 and even afterward, there will never be a change in the Daigas Group's original intention to genuinely engage with and serve customers and society. We are committed to maximizing value for all stakeholders, including customers and shareholders, and working toward realizing sustainable growth. As we work to meet the commitment, we aim to evolve into 'an innovative energy and services company that continues to be the /first choice of customers,' which is our goal set in the Long-Term Management Vision 2030.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced the Daigas Group Medium-Term Management Plan 2023: Creating Value for a Sustainable Future, following the Daigas Group Carbon Neutral Vision released in January. Under the Plan, we will strive to create value for a sustainable future, which consists of achieving a low carbon / carbon neutral society, establishing lifestyles and businesses adjusted to the new normal, and enhancing resilience of customers and society. Creating this value will ful/fill our corporate purpose of contributing to society by solving social issues.\n\nAs we pursue the goals set in the current Medium-Term Management Plan, we deeply appreciate the continued support and encouragement of our stakeholders.\n\nSeptember 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman of the Board Takehiro Honjo\n\nMasataka Fujiwara\n\nRepresentative Director and President",

Under the Vision, we have been working to diversify the Group's business portfolio while creating a foundation for sustainable growth in order to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. Amid this process, we have started to see a global paradigm shift in recent years caused by escalation of business environmental changes, which affect the sustainability of society as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic and large-scale natural disasters due to climate change.\n\nTo this day, we have worked with a strong sense of mission in our business activities to support lifestyles and society through the stable supply of energy in any situation, even in these times of change. Going forward, we must speedily adapt to changing times by enhancing the resilience of customers and society, realizing a low carbon / carbon neutral society, and responding to new lifestyles. We must also take on challenges to resolve social issues both within and outside Japan, and create new social and economic value.\n\nBased on such awareness, in March 2021, we announced the Daigas Group Medium-Term Management Plan 2023: Creating Value for a Sustainable Future as a way to clarify what we aim to be and to indicate what roles we will play in resolving new social issues. Under this Plan, we are committed to realizing a sustainable society by resolving social issues, and evolving into an innovative energy and service company that continues to be the /first choice of customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMasataka Fujiwara\n\nRepresentative Director and President\n\n## Creating Value for a Sustainable Future with Our Stakeholders\n\nIn the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023, we de/fine value for a sustainable future as a set of three types of value that we aim to create, which are achieving a low carbon / carbon neutral society, establishing lifestyles and businesses adjusted to the new normal, and enhancing resilience of customers and society, for solving social issues. We focus our efforts on creating this value for a sustainable future with our stakeholders by leveraging our strengths in solutions and innovation, to share the achievements with our stakeholders. This spirit is described as 'Creating Value for a Sustainable Future,' as the subtitle of the Medium-Term Management Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Achieving a low carbon / carbon neutral society 1.\n- Establishing lifestyles and businesses adjusted to the new normal 2.\n- Enhancing resilience of customers and society 3.\n\nEnhancing Business Portfolio Management 1.\n\n- Promoting business transformation with DX 2.\n\nMaximizing value for each employee 3.\n\n## 1. Achieving a Low Carbon / Carbon Neutral Society\n\nThe /first element of value for a sustainable future is achieving a low carbon / carbon neutral society. Under the Daigas Group Carbon Neutral Vision, we will seek out possibilities for the use of hydrogen while continuing to work on the expanded use and advanced utilization of natural gas, a greener energy source than other fossil fuels. As part of this initiative, we will develop methanation*-related technologies to decarbonize city gas and increase the share of renewables in our power generation portfolio to decarbonize power sources, in order to achieve our carbon neutral goal by 2050.\n\n## Striving to become carbon neutral by 2050\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the meantime, since it will take some time to establish carbon-free technologies, we need to accelerate our efforts to contribute to CO2 emissions reduction. We are striving to reduce as much CO2 emissions as possible to meet the three targets that we set forth as the milestones for 2030: 5 GW of renewables development contribution, nearly 50% of our power portfolio in Japan consisting of renewables, and 10 million tons per year of CO2 emissions reduction contribution.\n\n*Methanation technology\n\nTechnology that uses hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate methane  (CH4).\n\n## 2. Establishing Lifestyles and Businesses Adjusted to the New Normal\n\nThe second element of value for a sustainable future is establishing lifestyles and businesses adjusted to the new normal. The COVID-19 pandemic has been signi/ficantly changing people's lifestyles and ways of work, as well as companies' business models. We expect, as these changes will gradually become commonplace as the new normal, there will be increasing needs for new value that accommodates this new environment. And this can be only achieved by deeply understanding what customers really need for their lives and businesses in facing the unprecedented changes. Through greater co-creation than ever before, we will provide customized solutions that meet the speci/fic needs of customers, while vigorously working to develop new solutions and services utilizing various resources such as digital technologies.\n\nThrough this initiative, we aim to quickly achieve our goal of 10 million customer accounts through new approaches to B to C and B to B customers not only in the Kansai region but other key markets in Japan and overseas.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Enhancing Resilience of Customers and Society\n\nThe third element of value for a sustainable future is enhancing resilience of customers and society. Through our experiences in restoration and rebuilding after disasters such as the Great Hanshin Earthquake, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the North Osaka Earthquake, we have tirelessly pursued efforts to enhance resilience of customers and society. We believe that the energy resilience will further grow in importance not only in Japan but also in other countries from the viewpoint of responding to climate change and providing stable energy. We will further enhance energy resilience by improving the stability and safety of the natural gas supply chain. We will also secure emergency electricity supply for large-scale power outages due to natural disasters and contribute to the power system stability with the combination of renewables and distributed power sources.\n\nIn the meantime, we will work to prevent the failures of appliances and facilities and improve the quality of maintenance services by utilizing the IoT technologies for customers' higher sense of safety and peace of mind. These measures will not be limited to Japan, but are planned to be widely expanded into other countries such as those in Asia.\n\n## Evolve Our Corporate Group\n\nAs we create value for a sustainable future as a higher level of value, we must also keep growing and developing at the same time to evolve our corporate group. We will boost the Daigas Group's earning capabilities while strengthening its management foundation to be able to /flexibly adapt to changes, through the following three key initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Enhancing Business Portfolio Management\n\nFirst is enhancing business portfolio management. In order to evolve our corporate group, each business unit must not only seek to grow pro/fits, but also improve capital ef/ficiency to ultimately strengthen the business portfolio of the overall Daigas Group. From this viewpoint of securing /financial soundness, we have introduced ROIC as a new management indicator to improve the control of each Group business operation with more focus on their balance sheets. Under the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023, we aim to achieve an ROIC of about 5% while raising cash /flows from operating activitites to 1.5 times the average of the most recent three years, and provide shareholder returns when we achieve the pro/fit growth.\n\n## 2. Promoting Business Transformation with DX\n\nSecond is promoting business transformation with DX. We promote digital transformation (DX) to improve productivity by strengthening internal data management and reforming operational processes and to enhance our solutions to create and provide innovative customer services. In particular, we focus on building stronger connections with customers through DX and business reforms in all operations in order to achieve business model transformation and innovations.\n\nTo that end, we have launched a DX Promotion Of/fice in the Corporate Strategy Department and a DX Committee as a companywide committee in April 2021 for implementing effective and swift digital transformation under the leadership of top management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Maximizing Value for Each Employee\n\nThird is maximizing value for each employee. Employees are the source of corporate value creation and the driving force behind growth. We are committed to maximizing the value for each employee, which will raise the comprehensive strength of the Daigas Group. We support safe and /flexible ways of work through policies that allow employees to choose where they work and how they work, and promote diversity and inclusion throughout the Daigas Group as a basis for employees to pursue their individual career opportunities. We also focus on creating an\n\norganizational and corporate culture that encourages employees to take on challenges for resolving social issues with a sense of stability at work. In the meantime, we aim to enhance employee engagement in areas such as corporate loyalty and desire to contribute.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced the Declaration of Health and Productivity Management, which declares that the Daigas Group is committed to securing employees' safety, maintaining and enhancing their physical and mental health as the foundation for all operations. Under this declaration, we encourage all employees to maintain and improve their health, distributing a guideline to promote healthy lifestyles.\n\nThis concludes an overview of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023. We will roll out these measures globally going beyond traditional frameworks and evolve into a corporate group that continues to be the /first choice of customers, while further contributing to realizing a sustainable society.\n\n## Contribution to Achieving SDGs through Creating Value for a Sustainable Future\n\nWe will contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through our business activities to create value for a sustainable future. The activities include contributing to realizing a low carbon / carbon neutral society, buiding stable and highly resilient energy infrastructure, and promoting community development that is both environmentally and economically sound. We will pursue SDGs through alliances with other companies and partnerships with stakeholders.\n\n- \u25a0 Daigas Group's Contribution to SDGs\n\n## Becoming Carbon Neutral by 2050\n\n- \u25cf We pursue an optimal energy mix.\n- \u25cf We raise the proportion of renewables in our energy portfolio.\n- \u25cf We build a high-quality and resilient energy infrastructure for stable energy supply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf We provide a work environment where female employees can perform at their full potential and pursue their careers.\n- \u25cf We promote the ef/ficient utilization of resources.\n- \u25cf We provide people with information and proposals on solutions using sustainable energy.\n- \u25cf We promote urban development for a sustainable society where people can lead safe and comfortable lives.\n- \u25cf We support productivity enhancement and economic growth by providing various services and creating new value through innovation.\n\n## Gaining Confidence of Stakeholders Through ESG Management\n\nFor the Daigas Group's continued sustainable growth, we must steadily promote ESG-conscious management and continue to gain the con/fidence of our stakeholders.\n\nSince its founding, the Daigas Group has been practicing ESGconscious management in various ways while working to provide products and services that accommodate the changes of the times, in order to be a corporate group that provides solutions to customers and society. In 2007, we announced our participation in the United Nations Global Compact, a /first for a Japanese public utility enterprise, and we support the principles to be followed by companies as members of international community. In April 2021, when the new Medium-Term Management Plan was released, we revised the Daigas Group Charter of Business Conduct, which shows our universal corporate attitude, and announced the new Daigas Group Human Rights Policy amid a growing awareness of human rights on a global scale.\n\nWe are committed to strengthening our corporate governance by not only disclosing information in an appropriate manner but also thoroughly implementing fair business operations across the Daigas Group, further promoting diversity, and enhancing information security. Business execution and supervision have already been separated, and at least one-third of the Board of Directors is comprised of outside directors with the intent of further strengthening business execution functions and supervision functions.\n\nThrough implementing these ESG initiatives, we strive to gain the unwavering trust of our stakeholders and demonstrate the comprehensive strength of the Daigas Group, taking on challenges to realize sustainable growth.\n\nSeptember 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf We pioneer a new era in collaboration with various partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf We strive to create employment, provide rewarding jobs, and build a work environment where employees' health and safety are protected.",

As a result, we generally achieved the management indicator outlined in the Plan 2020.\n\nAs for pro/fitability indicators, ROE was 7.8%, ROA 3.6%, and EBITDA 227.5 billion yen. In terms of /financial soundness indicators, shareholders' equity ratio was 50.5% and D/E ratio was 0.60, which met our targets set in the Plan 2020. With respect to shareholder returns, we raised dividend forecasts for the current and next /fiscal years in view of the results of our growth up to this point and projections for future pro/fit levels. Owing to temporary factors that caused pro/fits to rise, the payout ratio was 27.0% for the /fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n## \u25a0 Review of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020\n\n|                                 |                             | FY2021.3 Result   | Plan 2020          |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Financial  soundness indicators | ROE                         | 7.8%              | 7.0%               |\n| Financial  soundness indicators | ROA                         | 3.6%              | 3.5%               |\n| Financial  soundness indicators | EBITDA                      | 227.5 billion yen | 200.0 billion yen  |\n|                                 | Shareholders' equity ratio* | 50.5%             | Around 50%         |\n|                                 | D/E ratio*                  | 0.60              | Approximately 0.70 |\n| Shareholder  returns            | Payout ratio                | 27.0 \uff05           | 30% or higher      |\n\n- * Calculated with 50% of issued hybrid bonds as equity\n\n## \u25a0 Breakdown of EBITDA (billion yen)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25a0 Investment for business growth (billion yen)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDomestic Energy      International Energy      LBS\n\n\u25a0        \u25a0          \u25a0\n\n## Aiming to Achieve Goals Set in the Daigas Group Medium-Term Management Plan 2023\n\nTakeshi Matsui\n\nRepresentative Director and Executive Vice President\n\n## Medium-Term Management Plan 2023\n\nAs /financial policies under the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023 (Plan 2023), we will steadily promote growth by promoting existing business pro/fitability and by investing in new businesses where we can leverage our strengths.

We have been using companywide ROE as a management indicator, but under the Plan 2023, we take one step further and work to improve ROIC. While the Daigas Group is an aggregate of business units with different characteristics, we use ROIC as a common management indicator as well as EBITDA, which measures the scale of cash. We aim for ROIC higher than the capital cost by using an ROIC tree while reviewing resource allocation and asset replacement for each business unit as well as the overall company.\n\nAn indicator of 'how ef/ficiently we earn pro/fits from assets associated with our business'\n\n## ROIC* 1 = NOPAT / Invested capital\n\nIntroduction of common indicators for each business unit and the Daigas Group as a whole\n\nIn the meantime, we intend to increase the speed of our responses to changes, and thereby realize a more /flexible and highly effective business portfolio management by enhancing the business control functions of each business unit and increasing the frequency of reviews on business plans and resource allocation at the headquarters (Please also see 'Enhancing Business Portfolio Management' on page 45).\n\nWe will aim to achieve approximately 5% in ROIC on a group-wide basis for the /fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Over the long term, we will aim to raise the target to about 7% in the /fiscal year ending March 31, 2031 in light of expected changes in incomeand-expense structures associated with future growth.\n\n## Growth through investment\n\nWe will steadily continue making investment for growth under the Plan 2023 in an effort to expand the scale of revenue. In key areas including decarbonization-related /field such as renewable energy, international business, and life and business solutions (LBS), we will make investment for growth in a scale of approximately 500 billion yen during the period covered by the Plan. Of these, we expect that investment in renewable energy will be about 120 billion yen. As for investment in quality improvement, we will enhance investment for DX and resilience. To cover these investments, we will grow our cash /flows from operating activitites to 1.5 times the forecasts for the three most recent /fiscal years.\n\n- \u25a0 Cash flows in this Medium-Term Management Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(billion yen)\n\n## Investment Risk Management\n\nOur investment stance is to maintain a good balance between risk and return, not taking high risks to seek excessively high returns and avoiding unnecessary risk control. To this end, we manage investment risk by ensuring the following four points.\n\nThe /first is the consistency with the investment project's strategy. In addition to pro/fit contributions from the project alone, we evaluate whether or not the project contributes to synergies with the Company's other businesses and the improvement of business execution capabilities.\n\nThe second is the evaluation of the inherent risks of the investment project. We conduct strict project evaluations and deliberations through the Investment Evaluation Committee after establishing uniform group-wide investment standards and taking into account the evaluations of the Investment Risk Management Of/fice and internal organizations in charge of /finance and legal affairs, as well as third-party evaluations of external consultants when necessary.\n\nThe third is maintenance of a good balance with /financial soundness. We quantitatively assess potential losses for each risk in investment and balance risk and return across the entire Group to make it possible to sustainably conduct investments for growth\n\nwhile maintaining a certain level of /financial soundness even when faced with the risks.\n\nThe fourth is follow-up after investment. Based on our investment monitoring standards, we conduct annual follow-ups on each investment project every year. By applying the standards, we evaluate whether or not the project satis/fies the original purpose of our investment, keeps up with the changes in the business environment, and faces any issues with its progress and pro/fitability. Depending on the evaluation, we take necessary actions such as improving project pro/fitability or considering divestiture or withdrawal.\n\n## Maintaining financial soundness\n\nDuring the period of the Plan 2020 (two /fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021), when the investment for growth exceeded cash /flows from operating activitites, we issued a total of 175.0 billion yen in hybrid bonds (subordinated corporate bonds) that contributed to both /financial soundness and the investment for growth. Going forward, we will increase cash /flows from operating activitites by appropriately conducting ROIC management, while also advancing the replacement of assets including securities and restricting borrowing from /financial institutions. Under the Plan 2023, we intend to maintain D/E ratio of approximately 0.7 and shareholders' equity ratio of around 50% as targets of /financial soundness indicators.\n\n## Shareholder returns according to growth\n\nOur shareholder return policy is to provide stable dividends while maintaining a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 30% or higher excluding short-term /fluctuation factors that affect pro/fits, as our basic stance, and to provide higher dividends when we achieve pro/fit growth. We will consider what would be our optimal measures for shareholder returns, taking into account structural risks such as intensifying competition in the fully deregulated energy market and declining population in Japan while comprehensively evaluating future free cash /flow, progress in investments for growth, business performance, and /financial situation.\n\n## \u25a0 Trends in dividends / payout ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2 Calculated with 50% of issued hybrid bonds as equity",

        "page_content": "## Materiality Identi/fication Process\n\nIn formulating the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023 (Plan 2023), the Daigas Group newly identi/fied important aspects (materiality). Regarding the identi/fication of materiality, we held numerous discussions with organizations in the Group and extracted the items of 'impacts on society and the environment' over the medium- to long-term in view of changes in the business environment and social trends related to sustainability, and then identi/fied the items of 'future /financial impacts on the group.'\n\nAfter considering the impacts of each item, we received opinions from external experts regarding 'impacts on society and the environment.' The materiality items identi/fied are approved by the Board of Directors alongside the Plan 2023 after discussions at the ESG Committee and the ESG Council. Each KPI will be reported annually while running a PDCA cycle in the future.\n\n## Materiality Identification Process\n\n## STEP 1\n\nIn terms of global risks, changes in the business environment, and contributions to the SDGs via business activities, we listed the items of 'impacts on society and the environment' and 'future /financial impacts on the group' for the Daigas Group, using the GRI Standards, etc., as a reference.\n\n## STEP 2\n\nFor 'future /financial impacts on the group,' we considered what we aim to be, issues, and risks for the /fiscal year ending March 31, 2031 by each organization and business domain within the Daigas Group.

Throughout this process, the Group refers to the GRI Standards, a set of global guidelines for corporate sustainability reporting. The methods that the Group adopted to identify materiality and tie it to management policies could be described as 'straightforward,' and the Group can be considered to have steadily generated results through this process.\n\nThe Group's new materiality has been identi/fied in the same process as above, but has made considerable progress in the following areas.\n\n## 1. Introduction of double materiality approach\n\nIn addition to the GRI Standards, which the Daigas Group has used for some time, various standards related to the disclosure of sustainability information have been created from different perspectives in recent years. While these circumstances have contributed to a deeper understanding among stakeholders of the relationship between business and sustainability, they have caused signi/ficant confusion for companies actually disclosing information, because the de/finitions of materiality differ between different sets of standards. In such a context, the Daigas Group has become an early adopter of the double materiality approach that is expected to be adopted in European laws and regulations on sustainability reporting. The concept of the double materiality is to consider both the /financial impact that sustainability has on companies (/financial materiality) and the impact that companies have on social and environmental sustainability (social and environmental materiality). Financial materiality is of particular interest to investors, but social and environmental materiality is closely tied to social impact, including contribution to the SDGs. Accordingly, this\n\nperspective is essential for the Daigas Group as a company that manages social infrastructure, and we can thus say that it is the proper way for the Company to think about information disclosure.\n\n## 2. Assessment per business domain\n\nThe Daigas Group operates a wide variety of businesses apart from the gas business, but it is particularly notable that when assessing materiality, each business unit proactively participated in discussions and identi/fied risks and issues after considering changes in the external environment in their respective businesses, with those risks and issues being subsequently re/flected in the determination of materiality from a medium- to long-term perspective. Through this process for identifying materiality, it is likely that each business unit feels a clearer connection to materiality in their respective business activities. Additionally, the Group's materiality identi/fication used to be based only on the GRI Standards for each of its themes, so, for example, there was no clear theme related to the 'stable supply of service,' an extremely important theme for the gas business. With the new process, the Group has overcome this issue, and as such, it can identify issues that are more closely related to its diverse range of businesses.\n\n## 3. Link with Medium-Term Management Plan\n\nFurthermore, I should note that the newly identi/fied materiality will contribute to realizing the Daigas Group Charter of Business Conduct, the Group's basic principles, and the Group has also linked the concept of materiality to its Medium-Term Management Plan and its assessment of business performance for each business unit. As a result, it is clear that the materiality identi/fied by the Daigas Group represents the issues it should prioritize in its businesses. Additionally, the fact that these measures were approved following discussion by the Board of Directors indicates that the process is correct in terms of conforming to Japan's Corporate Governance Code, which was revised this year.\n\nFrom this perspective, the Daigas Group's newly identi/fied materiality can be considered more appropriate for dialogue with stakeholders. In addition, I hope that the Daigas Group as a whole will accelerate its sustainability efforts by taking steady steps toward the KPIs including those set based on identi/fied materiality, which will lead to signi/ficant results, such as contributions to the SDGs and greater recognition from investors.",

Co-create Value for a Sustainable Future\n\n## Achieving a Low Carbon / Carbon Neutral Society\n\nWe will utilize the technical capabilities and business expertise that we have developed as a group over many years to create value together with our various stakeholders, and thereby achieve a low carbon / carbon neutral society.\n\n## Succeeded in Prototyping a New Type of SOEC, a Key Technology to Realize 'Innovative Methanation,' Which Contributes to Decarbonization of City Gas\n\nWe have been conducting basic research on highly ef/ficient and innovative methanation* 1 technology, a promising technology for the decarbonization of city gas, and have succeeded for the /first time in Japan in prototyping a practical-sized cell used for a new type of SOEC* 2 , which is the key to realizing this technology. We believe that this technology will have potential uses not just for the decarbonization of city gas, but also for the ef/ficient manufacturing of carbon neutral fuels such as hydrogen and synthetic liquid fuels, and other substances. Accordingly, we will\n\naccelerate our research and development efforts through industry-government-academia collaboration, and alliances with various business partners, as we aim to establish this technology around 2030.\n\n- *1 Methanation is a technology using hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), instead of natural gas, to generate methane.\n- *2 Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell: An electrolysis element that uses solid oxides. Electrolysis is performed on steam and CO2 at high temperatures.\n\n## Conventional methanation with 'water electrolysis / Sabatier reaction technology'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMethanation reuses CO2 emitted from factories, etc. CO2 is also emitted when customers burn city gas created with methanation, but these CO2 emissions are offset by the equivalent utilized CO2 when producing the gas.\n\n## Innovative Methanation 'SOEC Methanation Technology'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOwing to the nature of the reaction, the heat generated when producing hydrogen and methane with conventional methods of methanation is wasted. As a result, the energy conversion ef/ficiency from electric power to methane is limited to around 55-60%.\n\nSOEC methanation uses a system where the SOEC electrolysis equipment itself performs highly ef/ficient electrolysis, and the heat generated by the methanation reaction equipment is effectively reused. As a result, it is expected to achieve energy conversion ef/ficiency of around 85-90%.\n\n## Daigas \u00d7 Stakeholders\n\n## Working with various stakeholders to contribute to the development of renewables\n\nIn FY2021.3, we endeavored to contribute to the development of renewables by collaborating with various stakeholders. In terms of developing power sources, we acquired a solar power plant by investing in D&D Solar GK, which was established to hold solar power asset, together with Development Bank of Japan Inc. Additionally, we also focused on developing various power sources, including joint\n\ninvestment in an onshore wind power project and participation in a biomass power project.\n\nWith regard to procuring electric power, we entered into a bilateral contract with West Holdings Corporation for the long-term procurement of electricity generated at thousands of small-scale solar power facilities to be developed by West HD in FY2022.3.\n\n- \u25a0 Development of renewables (main projects since 2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25cf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25cf\n\nWind power\n\n\u25cf\n\nFuel procurement and sales",

Since the Paris Agreement came into force in November 2016, initiatives are being undertaken around the world. In Japan as well, tackling climate change is becoming increasingly important as Prime Minister Suga declared Japan's aim to realize a carbon neutral society by the year 2050 in his general policy speech on October 26, 2020.\n\nFor the Daigas Group, which is engaged primarily in the energy business, climate change represents an important management challenge, and initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions are an extremely important mission. In January 2021, the Daigas Group established and announced the 'Daigas Group Carbon Neutral Vision,' indicating its vision of how it strives to become carbon neutral by 2050. In March 2021, the Daigas Group\n\n## Climate Change Governance\n\nThe Daigas Group regards climate change response as a key management issue. The Board of Directors, which decides on and supervises the important business activities of the Group as a whole, is responsible for the decision-making and supervision of projects involving climate change issues. At the 'ESG Council (Executive Board),' which meets three times per year, executives deliberate on plans and reports of activities concerning ESG challenges, including climate change issues, under the supervision of the President.\n\nIn addition, the Daigas Group has also established the 'ESG Committee,' chaired by the 'Head of ESG Promotion' (Vice President), the of/ficer overseeing Daigas Group\n\n## \u25a0 Climate Change Governance Organization Chart\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nannounced the 'Daigas Group Medium-Term Management Plan 2023 'Creating Value for a Sustainable Future'' to further promote activities toward a low carbon / carbon neutral society.\n\nOsaka Gas supports the TCFD recommendations, and utilizes them as indicators to validate its climate change response.\n\nWe also participate in the TCFD Consortium*, where discussions take place on efforts toward information disclosure on responses to climate change based on the TCFD recommendations.\n\n- * Established on May 27, 2019, the consortium holds discussions led by private sectors on how companies can effectively disclose information on tackling climate change and how /financial institutions can use the disclosed information to make appropriate investment decisions. From the government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Financial Services Agency and the Ministry of the Environment also participate as observers in the consortium.\n\nsustainability activities, and composed of the heads of related business units as its members. The 'ESG Committee' is held four times per year to formulate and advance plans for business activities concerning climate change response, and engages in Group-wide deliberation, coordination and supervision of issues such as the achievement of targets, risk management and response. Of these, the 'ESG Committee' proposes or reports important issues to the Board of Directors, such as performance against ESG management targets, and business plans that are anticipated to be signi/ficantly affected /financially by climate change.\n\n- \u25cf Board of Directors\n- 10 Directors (6 Internal Directors and 4 Outside Directors)\n- \u25cf Executive Board (ESG Council)\n- 1 President and Executive Of/ficer, 3 Vice Presidents (Executive Of/ficers), and 6 Managing Executive Of/ficers\n- * In principle, it is held three times per year as 'ESG Council.'\n- \u25cf ESG Committee\n- Vice President and Executive Of/ficer (Head of ESG Promotion) and heads of related business units, etc.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nThe Daigas Group has been working on climate change scenario analysis that is intended to be utilized as reference material in the evaluation and preparation of countermeasures, and to understand the impact of climate change on the Group's business on a medium- and long-term basis.\n\nUsing this analysis method based on scenarios established by an external authority (IEA), we assessed the impacts on the performances of our energy businesses (gas, electricity and related businesses in Japan and overseas) which are expected to experience the greatest impact from climate change among the Group's businesses, for the purpose of acquiring suggestions related to relevant factors and measures for mitigating/tapping into the impact. We\n\nassumed a multi-track scenario that takes into account the progress of energy conservation and changes in the composition of power sources, etc., as follows.\n\nWe will steadily implement initiatives to increase the resilience of the Daigas Group's businesses, while applying the suggestions gained from scenario analysis to our evaluation of medium- and long-term business strategies. Moreover, as the global response to climate change continues to progress, the scenario's preconditions may also change in the future. We will continue to deepen our scenario analysis, renewing our assumptions in line with the latest conditions as necessary, taking into account scenarios established by external authorities.\n\n## \u25a0 Japan's Final Energy Consumption of Gas, Electricity, etc. under Each Scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeasures necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement target of 2\u00b0C are implemented, and a signi/ficant reduction in CO2 emissions is achieved. Electricity demand decreases only slightly, due to a rise in the electri/fication rate, despite a signi/ficant decline in energy demand.\n\nTechnology progresses signi/ficantly, and a signi/ficant reduction in CO2 emissions is achieved with only a moderate decline in energy demand. The current levels of electricity and gas demand are maintained.\n\nCO2 emissions reduction\n\n2017 \u2192 2050\n\n80 %*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Proportional reduction in CO2 emissions achieved in FY2051.3 relative to FY2018.3\n\n## Recognition of Risks and Opportunities\n\nUsing a multi-track scenario analysis, we pinpointed anticipated risks and opportunities based on the environment surrounding the Daigas Group's energy businesses in Japan and abroad, evaluated these risks and opportunities and examined countermeasures, in terms of both the short and medium term prospect until 2030 and the long term prospect until 2050.\n\nThe Group is engaged in gas and electricity businesses, primarily in the Kansai area, which use natural gas as their main raw material and fuel. The external environment is undergoing various changes due to climate change. We have classi/fied the major factors associated with these changes\n\ninto 'transition risks' and 'physical risks,' and identi/fied the major risks and opportunities. Signi/ficant risks for the Group related to climate change include the possibility that rising sea levels and natural disasters such as typhoons and torrential rains due to localized abnormal weather events, etc. may cause damage to our manufacturing equipment. In addition, it is possible that our businesses may be affected by signi/ficant increases in the carbon tax rate in Japan, or an increased desire among our customers to switch to non-fossil fuels. However, promotion of the development of renewables and decarbonization technologies also represents a signi/ficant opportunity for the Group.\n\nReduction in the necessary volume of CO2 emissions is limited, despite the implementation of new energy policies and related plans. Both electricity and gas demand will increase slightly in Japan due to a moderate decline in energy demand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

While steadily proceeding with projects in which our participation is already decided, we aim to create an earnings platform and improve our business promotion by acquiring new projects in production or development. In the USA, there has been increased demand for stable power supply due to factors such as the decommission of aging coal-/fired power plants and the expansion of renewable energy sources. Since participating in North American natural gas thermal power plant projects in 2004, we have acquired projects, mainly in the USA northeast including the PJM Market, one of the largest wholesale power markets in the USA. In addition to expanding pro/fit contributions, we have accumulated expertise on power plant operations, including fuel procurement and sales of electric power to the market. We are taking measures to accelerate the accumulation of business expertise by promoting more independent power plant operations, while making further efforts to achieve sustainable growth in the IPP business in North America.\n\n## Expansion of renewable energy business\n\nIn addition to the investment in solar project developer,\n\nSolAmerica Energy, LLC, we will also consider opportunities to participate in renewable energy businesses, an area that is expected to grow signi/ficantly in the USA.\n\n## Driving business development in North America\n\nWe have designated Osaka Gas USA Corporation as our regional headquarters in North America, which is responsible for the business development of the Freeport LNG Project, Sabine Shale Gas Project, and IPP projects, including renewable energy. With Osaka Gas USA Corporation gaining control over the decision making on asset acquisition and replacement with agility, we expect the acceleration of our earnings growth in North America, aiming for a fourfold increase from FY2021.3 to FY2024.3\n\n## Forecast for profit* in North America\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Operating pro/fit + Share of pro/fit (loss) of entities accounted for using equity method\n\n## International energy business - businesses in Asia, trading, decarbonization\n\n## Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia, where natural gas demand is expected to grow, is a key region for the Daigas Group. We will steadily grow the natural gas sales business in Singapore and Vietnam and the energy services business in Thailand and Indonesia in which we have already participated. We will also consider\n\nexpanding new businesses such as participation in projects for LNG terminals and natural gas-/fired power plants, as well as renewable energy development projects in collaboration with our local partner companies.\n\nScene at onsite survey in Singapore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trading\n\nA natural gas liquefaction project in Texas, USA started from December 2019, which has increased the number of countries with suppliers we source from. We also entered into a new type of procurement where LNG procurement prices are\n\nindexed to Henry Hub prices, one of the price indexes for natural gas in the USA, in addition to traditional procurement in which LNG prices are generally linked to the crude oil price. The diversi/fication of price indexation will help stabilize LNG prices when crude oil prices /fluctuate. In addition, by investing in liquefaction projects, we will contribute to ensuring pricecompetitive LNG procurement by focusing on the low-cost procurement of the raw materials for gas in the USA market.\n\nWe established Osaka Gas Energy Supply and Trading Pte. Ltd., an LNG trading company in Singapore, and aim to reduce costs for energy resource procurement while responding to customer needs through the utilization of the company and our group carrier /fleet, and optimization leveraging our diversi/fied procurement portfolio.\n\n## Decarbonization\n\nWe continue exploring new potential projects and technologies such as CCS/CCUS and hydrogen to capture great opportunities presented by the globally accelerating wave of decarbonization businesses. In addition, we also identifying and responding to the needs for carbon neutral LNG supply.\n\n## Establishing Lifestyles and Businesses Adjusted to the New Normal\n\nWe aim to utilize the Daigas Group's strengths in solutions and innovation and create value together with stakeholders, thereby establishing new lifestyles and businesses adjusted to the new normal.\n\n## Daigas \u00d7 Stakeholders\n\n## Holding 'Internet-based promotion campaign' allowing people to participate online from their own homes\n\nIn anticipation of the age of COVID-19 and even afterward, the Daigas Group has focused on creating opportunities for new contact points with customers. In 1955, we began holding our annual promotion campaign, an exhibition event for customers using the Company's gas. Now, we hold this campaign every year in approximately 100 event spaces in commercial facilities and other venues, with total attendants numbering over 400,000 people. We adopted an online format for the /first time in FY2021.3 as the 66th year holding this campaign. We provided a variety of content, including introductions to products and services by video, etc., as well as a lottery that customers could apply for online.\n\nThis format enabled customers to participate from anywhere at any time that suits them. As a result, a total of over 400,000 customers participated in the lottery.\n\nAdditionally, we also implemented our new social contribution program 'Tsunagaru Project' at the campaign. The project is an initiative in which we donate 10 yen per lottery\n\n## 'D-Solar' - a solar power generation service for private consumption*\n\n## 'D-Aqua,' a one-stop water treatment service*\n\nIn June 2020, we released 'D-Solar,' a solar power generation service for private consumption as part of the Daigas Group's efforts to achieve a decarbonized society. In this service, we install solar power generation systems on the rooves of our customers' facilities and supply the electric power generated to the customers, enabling customers to 'reduce CO2 emissions' and 'strengthen BCP measures' with zero initial investment. The electric power generated by these solar power generation systems has zero CO2 emissions. Additionally, in the event of power outage, the solar power generation systems can secure power source during the daytime, and thereby allow businesses to continue and resume activities early.\n\nIn response to recent growth in demand among customers for solutions that address environmental issues, the Daigas Group entered into a business alliance with Miura Co., Ltd. and Aquas Corporation with the aim of creating a one-stop service by enhancing maintenance services in water treatment services and expanding our range of products. Looking ahead, we have renamed our water treatment services to 'D-Aqua,' and will strive to further improve the service. We will provide our customers with a one-stop service for utilities as a whole, including the use of well water and industrial water, as well as wastewater treatment through our partnership with these two companies in addition to technology for addressing energy and environmental issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1 'Initial investment' here refers to construction-related expenses associated with the introduction of D-Solar (construction fees, equipment fees, design and technical expenses, etc.).

Co-create Value for a Sustainable Future\n\n## Enhancing Resilience of Customers and Society\n\nThe Daigas Group aim to utilize our strengths in solutions and innovation and create value together with stakeholders, thereby enhancing the resilience of our customers and society.\n\n## Development of 'AI radar locator,' which uses AI to locate underground pipes\n\nOsaka Gas has developed and uses an 'AI radar locator' that allows anyone to easily detect underground pipes with a high degree of accuracy, thanks to the adoption of AI image diagnostic technology. The radar locator emits radio waves toward the ground, and generates survey images based on the re/flection of the waves from underground pipes. Operators can then estimate the location of underground pipes by interpreting the shape of the waves in the images. There were cases in which it was dif/ficult to detect locations depending on the status of pipes and the quality of soil, and it required signi/ficant technical skill to identify the location of underground pipes with certainty. In this development, however, the AI system that learns the judgment of\n\nexperienced workers enabled operators to automatically make judgments about the location of underground pipes, without relying on the expertise of them. We will focus on further technical development for enhancing the safety of our gas operations in order to ensure that our customers can continue to use gas safely and with peace of mind.\n\nGas pipes survey using a radar locator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Move to absolute coordinates for pipe mapping systems\n\nThe Company manages location information of gas pipes with a mapping system to implement construction, maintenance, and operations. Previously, this location information was expressed in the form of relative coordinates based on geographical features such as roads and rivers on a topographic map. As such, in order to identify the location of gas pipes at sites, it was necessary to measure the distance from the origin of the relative coordinates. There were cases where the location of the origin needed to be changed because of road construction or other reasons, requiring signi/ficant labor for maintenance. Now, we have replaced the maps used in our pipe mapping system with high-accuracy and high-resolution aerial photographs with absolute coordinates, thereby proceeding with our efforts to allocate absolute coordinates to gas pipes. As a result, we will be able to identify the location of gas pipes with pinpoint accuracy, even when it has become impossible to identify the origin of relative coordinates due to road expansions or sediment deposition caused by natural disasters, and other reasons.\n\nUsing the location information of gas pipes expressed in absolute coordinates, we began a trial operation utilizing AI for gas pipe patrols, jointly with Osaka City Bus Corporation, starting in June 2021. For roads where medium-pressure gas pipes are buried, we have traditionally been taking steps to prevent damage to the gas pipes by operating patrol cars that travel along designated routes every day to detect any construction work in the vicinity of the gas pipes about which the Company are not noti/fied. Now, we have developed a camera that automatically recognizes construction sites by\n\nusing AI systems, and have installed the camera in route buses along with GPS, thereby making efforts to identify construction works taking place in the vicinity of mediumpressure gas pipes on the bus routes. By so doing, we will be able to increase the frequency of patrols and enhance safety quality, while also increasing the productivity of our operations.\n\nIn the future, it will become possible to identify the location of gas pipes even with general-purpose devices such as smartphones, by managing the location information of gas pipes based on absolute coordinates. This also offers the prospect of future transformations in operations, etc. We will continue enhancing the quality of our operations from the perspective of ensuring safety and preventing disasters to improve the resilience of our customers and society.\n\nDetects construction works\n\nby others about which we\n\nhave not been noti/fied and\n\nacquires coordinates\n\nN 34.69\u00b0\n\nE 135.50\u00b0\n\nGas pipeline mapping system\n\nDisplays detected location on the mapping system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Example of judgments made by AI on the location of underground pipes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCross-section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExample of cross-section made by AI\n\nSatellite\n\n## Daigas \u00d7 Stakeholders\n\nLaunch of verification project to establish virtual power plant (VPP) using residential fuel cell 'ENE-FARM' -VPP verification project connecting 3,600 units-\n\nElectricity cannot be stored, so continual adjustments of power generation must be made to ensure a balance between supply and demand. If power generation is not balanced, the frequency of the electricity will /fluctuate, potentially resulting in large-scale power outages, in the worst-case scenario. As a result, general electricity\n\ntransmission and distribution utilities currently maintain frequencies within a certain range, mainly by limiting the output of power stations to match demand.\n\nRenewable energy, which does not generate CO2 when electricity is generated, may become a key energy source in future under Japan's energy policies. Still, solar power generation and wind power generation are affected by weather conditions such as the amount of solar radiation and strength of the wind, causing issues when adjusting the balance of grid\n\nelectricity supply and demand. On the other hand, fuel cells have the characteristic of being able to freely control the output of power, and are attracting attention as a resource that can contribute to the adjustment of grid electricity supply and demand in a society in which a large amount of renewable energy is introduced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Innovation by the Daigas Group\n\nOsaka Gas is conducting a veri/fication project to build a virtual power plant (VPP)* 1 that controls approximately 3,600 units of the residential fuel cell system, 'ENE-FARM,' installed at customers' homes (a total potential supply capacity* 2 of around 1 MW) as energy resources as if it were a single power plant, so as to utilize it for effective adjustment of grid electricity supply and demand and for avoiding imbalance in the grid. While the aggregation coordinator* 3 in this veri/fication project is ENERES Co., Ltd., Osaka Gas participates in the project as a resource aggregator* 4 .\n\nIn the previous /fiscal year, the Company participated in a veri/fication project for a VPP that involved verifying the operation of over 1,500 ENE-FARM units. This /fiscal year, we\n\nintend to conduct a technical veri/fication that aims to provide adjustment capabilities with the use of approximately 3,600 ENE-FARM units, exceeding the previous /fiscal year, while also aiming to enhance the accuracy of controlling ENEFARM units remotely in accordance with the supply-demand balance in the grid. Additionally, it has been required to avoid imbalances of renewable energy ahead of the introduction of the FIP scheme. Therefore, in this veri/fication, the Company will verify the technology used to avoid imbalances by controlling the power generated by ENE-FARM units in accordance with the output of power from our Yura Solar Power Plant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1 Virtual power plant.

We will launch the DX Committee and the DX Promotion Of/fice for implementing effective and swift digital transformation under the leadership of top management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pre-Medium-Term 2023 status\n\nGas business-centric system structure based on a household, month & /fiscal year, /fixed operational process\n\n## Basic Policy\n\nWe will change our business operations to enable them to respond rapidly and /flexibly to any changes to enhance productivity dramatically to create value sustainably for realizing the Medium-Term Management Plan 2023 and the Long-Term Management Vision 2030. In the new age in which both our customers and services rapidly change, we will aim for transformation of the business itself and for innovation as a corporate group that can keep on changing by revising constantly and /flexibly our business model, operations, rules, and systems that used to be taken for granted. In order to make a major transformation to realize our vision, we will work on building a promotion system driven by top management, strengthening human resources development, demonstrating the comprehensive strength of the Daigas Group including OGIS-RI Co., Ltd., and building alliances with our partner companies.\n\n## DX Promotion System\n\nIn addition to DX promotion at each organization for realizing what we aim to be, we established the 'DX Committee' and the 'DX Promotion Of/fice' in April 2021 to increase our top\n\ncommitment and to accelerate DX by demonstrating direction, coordination, and support functions from a group-wide perspective. As a group-wide initiative, we will aim for realizing the vision and business transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key Initiatives\n\n## Practicing Innovative Service Creation\n\nWe will offer various services with higher value by incorporating trends and the diverse needs of customers without delay. This does not only refer to the development of new businesses and new services, but also leads to increasing sophistication in existing businesses, resulting in an increase in customer accounts, business opportunities, and net sales as well as raising business operations to the next level. In rapidly changing times, it is important to 'accelerate the trial and error cycle'. We will acquire skills through practice, innovate the system itself and foster customs and mindsets across the entire Group, which enable the Group to move forward with new initiatives aggressively and quickly.\n\n## Data Management Evolution\n\nThe Group has been leading efforts to utilize data, placing 'Business Analysis Center' at its core. In the future, utilizing valuable assets such as data as our strengths is the key to value creation and growth strengths. For example, if we can catch customer's needs from data, we can offer services optimized for each customer. We will continue to create new value in customer experiences and our supply chain by developing our initiatives in the past and evolving data management further.\n\n## Operational Process Innovation\n\nWe will thoroughly review our internal operations from 'the perspective of customers,' not from an internal point of view. We will also focus on merging and abolishing operations as well as standardizing and aggregating different procedural operations among organizations to broadly redesign the entire operational process. Furthermore, the workload for remaining operations will be reduced with digital technologies such as AI and RPA. Through these transformations, Group employees will be able to generate extra power to work on more nonroutine and discretionary operations as well as operations that require higher expertise and judgment in a pleasant working environment. This will allow employees to devote more energy to providing better value to customers.\n\n## Human Resources Development\n\nWe will enhance programs in sequence by leveraging the knowledge on the development of human resources that can utilize data, an effort that we have been making proactively for years while accumulating expertise on creating innovative services and drastic transformation on operational processes. In addition, we will provide a wide range of experience and practical chances for employees of various ages and positions, including 'TORCH,' a program for new business creation for young employees, training schemes for executives and manager-level employees and new business development collaborated with venture capitals. Furthermore, we will help employees grow by providing them feedback on upskilling through these programs.\n\n## Major Activities\n\n## 'TORCH': A Program for New Business Creation by Young Employees\n\nWe launched a program in which young employees create new businesses in 2017 and named it 'TORCH.' Business ideas are presented to Group employees in a contest format, and ones that gain high evaluation will move to a commercialization process, where internal and external experts work together to launch them in the market. In December 2020, we released 'taknal,' an app that enables users to encounter new books by using the location data of smartphones, and received a positive response.

Therefore, the stability in the balance of supply and demand of electricity is a major challenge. Demand response (DR), which saves electricity by controlling customer facilities, is drawing attention as a method to adjust the supply-demand balance of electric power. By aggregating energy saved by customers as part of the demand response scheme and establishing VPP*, the Group will contribute to a society with a stabilized power system and eventually to the expansion of renewable energy electricity.\n\n* VPP: Virtual Power Plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Status of Wide-area Energy and Services Development (As of June 30, 2021)\n\nHimuka LNG Co., Ltd.

We have proposed demonstrating this technology at the World Expo 2025, as part of our aim to realize a locally produced locally consumed energy supply system suitable for urban areas in a decarbonized society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n## Creating new businesses in growth fields\n\n- \u25a0 Commencement of sale of a 'radiative sky cooling material,' a new material with world-class cooling performance\n\nWe developed the 'radiative sky cooling material,' a new material which lowers the temperature compared to the outside air temperature without using energy under direct sunlight by releasing heat into outer space. A demonstration test conducted by Osaka Gas found that the surface temperature of the material was up to about 6\u00b0C lower than the outside air temperature under direct sunlight, realizing world-class cooling performance. Additionally, in a demonstration experiment using this material for a tent, we con/firmed that the feeling temperature was lower by up to 10\u00b0C less than that of a normal tent, while in a test using this material in a prefabricated house for construction sites, we con/firmed the ability to signi/ficantly reduce electric power usage during the day.\n\nThe material is expected to be deployed as products for implementing measures against global warming, achieving energy conservation and ensuring cooling comfort. Potential applications vary, including canvas-covered structures\n\nand container warehouses. This material was also selected for a demonstration experiment* in Yumeshima, the planned site of the World Expo 2025*.\n\nMarketing, manufacturing, and sales of this radiative sky cooling material is conducted by SPACECOOL Inc., which is jointly operated by Osaka Gas and WiL, LLC. We will aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the environmental performance by means of zero-energy cooling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Demonstration cases were put out to tender and selected by the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition and the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Demonstration experiment at the World Expo 2025 | Verification of the value of SPACECOOL \u00ae radiative sky cooling material\n\nIn a demonstration experiment at Yumeshima, the site of the World Expo 2025, we will collaborate with a diverse range of companies* to evaluate the energy-saving qualities, economic performance, comfort, and safety of this radiative sky cooling material in a variety of expected applications, such as tents and power distribution boards.\n\nFor everyone's future Yumeshima demonstration experiment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Conducted jointly with KANBO PRAS CORPORATION, SPACECOOL Inc., Seiritsu Industries Co., Ltd., and TAKENAKA CORPORATION\n\n## \u25a0 Development of fluorene cellulose as a fiber for strengthening resin\n\n## \u25a0 Successful production of ketone bodies (3HB), known for their use in diets\n\nIn response to the issue that cellulose /fibers are dif/ficult to mix with resin, we have developed /fluorene cellulose, a cellulose /fiber with uniform dispersion, which does not mix easily with water but mixes easily with resin by causing a surface reaction with a proprietary /fluorene derivative developed by the Daigas Group. Fluorene cellulose is a resin /fiber material with low environmental impact and has strong potential for use in home appliances and as a structural material in automobiles.\n\nWe have developed a method for manufacturing ketone bodies, (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (3HB), using bioprocess (fermentation) technology cultivated in collaboration with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. Recent years have seen rising interest in ketone bodies for their effectiveness in dieting and improving athletic performance.

By harmonizing its business activities with the environment, the Group will create a sustainable society.\n\nEnvironmental conservation on a local and a global scale is an extremely important mission for the Daigas Group, whose operations center on the energy business. Greenhouse gases in particular are a leading cause of climate change, which is a global issue with huge impact on society, ecosystems, and the world as a whole. Because emissions of greenhouse gases are a large part of the environmental impact caused by the business activities of the Daigas Group, we actively engage in taking appropriate measures. In accordance with our 'Daigas Group Environmental Policy,' the Daigas Group makes efforts to lessen the environmental impact of its business activities and customers through the expansion of utilization of natural gas and renewable energies, the provision of environmentally friendly products and services. And through our business activities, we contribute to environmental improvement and the development of sustainable societies locally, nationally, and internationally by pursuing harmony with the environment and making ef/ficient use of energy and resources.\n\n## Materiality\n\n## Energy / Emissions\n\n(Contribution to reduction in amount of CO2 emissions)\n\n## FY2021.3 target\n\n## FY2021.3 result\n\nReduction of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7\n\nmillion tons\n\nCumulative reduction of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmillion tons\n\nSeveral initiatives have been taken from FY2018.3 to FY2021.3. The initiatives in Japan include: cryogenic power generation at our city gas production facilities, the introduction of renewable energy sources and high-ef/ficiency thermal power generation, the introduction of fuel cells and gas-powered air conditioning and high-ef/ficiency hot-water heaters at customer sites, and conversion to the use of natural gas as a fuel. The introduction of high-ef/ficiency thermal power generation and fuel conversion to natural gas were also promoted overseas. These efforts have resulted in a total reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 5.60 million tons. In FY2021.3, we did not achieve our target, partly as a result of delayed progress on new projects in previous /fiscal years. We have set new targets for FY2022.3 onward, and will further promote related initiatives.\n\nThe Daigas Group calculated the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from companies that constitute the Daigas Group's value chain network, based on the GHG Protocol, an international emission accounting standards. The methodology of the calculation and its results have been certi/fied by an independent organization to verify their reliability and accuracy.\n\nCombined GHG emissions by the Daigas Group and value chain companies, measured by CO2, totaled about 27.78 million tons in FY2021.3. The sum breaks down into about 5.51 million tons, or about 20%, for GHG emitted through business activities by the Daigas Group (Scope 1 and Scope 2), and about 22.27 million tons, or about 80%, emitted by others in our value chain (Scope 3).\n\nGHG emissions from city gas combustion on the customer side amounted to 16.39 million tons in the reporting year in terms of CO2, accounting for about 59% of the total. To reduce CO2 emissions in society as a whole, it is important for Osaka Gas to promote energy conservation using natural gas, an energy source with low CO2 emissions, and further popularize high-ef/ficiency equipment and systems such as its 'ENE-FARM' and cogeneration systems.\n\nGHG emissions through electricity generation by the Daigas Group, as measured in terms of CO2, came to 5.05 million tons, representing about 18% of the total emissions from the Group's own business activities. With the power generation business expanding, the ratio of CO2 emissions from that business has been increasing. As a way of reducing GHG emissions from power generation, the Group will continue to actively introduce highly advanced energy-ef/ficient power generation facilities and use renewable energy sources.\n\nGHG emissions from material and fuel procurement totaled 5.03 million tons, as measured in terms of CO2 in the year, accounting for about 18% of the total emissions. The procurement of energy sources, especially LNG, accounted for over 70% of that amount. Under these circumstances, we will continue our efforts to improve fuel ef/ficiency regarding the operation of LNG tankers in collaboration with resource suppliers.\n\nActivities that have potential environmental impacts other than GHG emissions include the disposal of waste (general waste and industrial waste), and the disposal of excavated soil and polyethylene pipes associated with gas pipe construction. However, the recycling rates are high for such waste, a situation we will try to maintain in the future. About 97% of water used for our industrial activities is taken from the sea. Such water is mostly used to vaporize LNG at LNG terminals. Seawater is also used as coolant inside the steam turbine condenser at some power plants. Once used, the water is discharged into the sea without being consumed under strict control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompanies subject to the calculation of GHG emissions:\n\nOsaka Gas Co., Ltd. and 56 companies among 154 consolidated subsidiaries are subject to calculation of GHG emissions. Those housed in of/fice buildings as tenants and whose environmental data are dif/ficult to grasp and whose environmental effects are minimal are not subject to such calculation. Also excluded from the calculation are overseas companies, except one company.\n\nDaigas Group's\n\nCo-creation of Value\n\n## Verified by a third party\n\n## \u25a0 Main Materials and Fuels\n\n|

In response to the announcement of 'Japan's National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights (2020-2025)' by the Japanese government in October 2020, we formulated a human rights policy and at the same time separated the section on 'Respect for Human Rights' from the chapter on 'Complying with Laws and Regulations and Respect for Human Rights' in the 'Daigas Group Charter of Business Conduct*' and made revisions to the\n\n## 1   Endorsement of international agreements 1 1\n\nWe support international agreements on human rights, including the International Bill of Human Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO). We commit to respect human rights as set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n## 2   Scope of application 2\n\nThis policy applies to all directors, of/ficers, and employees of the Daigas Group.\n\n## 3    Legal compliance and respect for internationally recognized human rights 3\n\nWe comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the countries and regions where we operate. In case where there is a con/flict between internationally recognized human rights standards and the laws and regulations of each country or region, we will pursue ways to respect international human rights principles.\n\n## 4    Respect for human rights in all process of business activities 4\n\nIn all processes of our business activities, we strive to prevent and reduce negative impacts on the human rights of stakeholders involved in the Daigas Group's businesses.\n\n- 4-1  We respect the human rights of our employees and provide a healthy and comfortable work environment.\n- 4-2  We respect human rights of customers and business partners. In case where negative impacts on human rights by business partners or other related parties are directly linked to the Daigas Group's businesses, products or services, we will demand that such business partners and related parties respect human rights and not infringe upon them.\n- 4-3  We assess and address the impact of our business activities on local communities.\n\n'Daigas Group Code of Business Conduct,' in order to demonstrate the Daigas Group's stance toward respecting human rights. Additionally, we revised the 'Daigas Group Diversity Promotion Policy,' aiming to become a corporate group where a diverse range of personnel respect and accept each other without discrimination, and experience a sense of purpose at work.\n\nAs we look to expand the scope of our business /fields, the Daigas Group will focus on promoting diversity. At the same time, we will also ful/fill our responsibility to respect the human rights of Daigas Group stakeholders in all aspects of our business activities, across the Group as a whole, in accordance with the 'Daigas Group Human Rights Policy.'\n\n- * The 'Daigas Group CSR Charter,' which was a set of guiding principles for the actions of Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and employees, was revised to form the 'Daigas Group Charter of Business Conduct,' which expresses our stance as a company.\n\n## 5   Human rights due diligence 5\n\nWe conduct human rights due diligence, in which we identify and assess the negative human rights impact of our business activities and take steps to prevent or mitigate such risks.\n\n## 6   Remedy 6\n\nIf it becomes clear that the Daigas Group's business activities are causing or contributing to negative impacts on human rights, we will work to correct and remedy the situation through appropriate procedures.\n\n## 7   Stakeholder engagement 7\n\nWe engage in sincere dialogue and consultation with affected stakeholders on how to address actual or potential impacts on human rights.\n\n## 8   Education and awareness 8\n\nWe provide education to ensure that all directors, of/ficers, and employees of the Daigas Group understand this Policy and act in accordance with this Policy in our business activities.\n\n## 9   Reporting 9\n\nWe report the progress on our human rights efforts that we make based on this Policy through our website and other communication channels.\n\n## Efforts Under the Spread of COVID-19 Infections\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Osaka Gas, Osaka Gas Marketing Co., Ltd., Daigas Energy Co., Ltd., and Daigas Gas and Power Solution Co., Ltd. have all implemented the following initiatives since the COVID-19 pandemic was con/firmed in Japan and abroad in late January 2020, until the\n\npresent, based on the 'Act on Special Measures for Pandemic In/fluenza and New Infectious Diseases.' At the same time, we are also working together with local communities on social contribution activities.\n\n## \u25a0 Measures to secure a stable supply of gas and electricity and ensure safety\n\nIn March 2020, we established a task force to secure a stable supply and transitioned to a system tailored to the circumstances. Through these measures, we have been working to secure a stable supply of gas and electricity and ensure safety.\n\nIn order to secure a stable supply of gas and electricity, we have implemented the following initiatives.\n\nMeasures at LNG terminals\n\nMeasures to secure supply and ensure safety\n\n- \u25cf At production sites and power plants, we are limiting entry to central control rooms by persons other than operators, and are also taking measures such as disinfections and measuring temperatures when employees enter central control rooms. Additionally, there is no contact between employees when changing shifts, and instead a video conferencing system is used.\n\n\u25cf When receiving materials from LNG and LPG ships, our employees do not board the ships. Instead they perform loading operations on a non-contact basis from land.\n\nIn order to secure a stable supply of gas and ensure the safety of supply facilities (pipelines, etc.), we have implemented the following initiatives.\n\n- \u25cf We monitor and control the status of the supply of gas in an integrated manner, using a 24-hour system. At the Central Control Of/fice, which issues directions for the prompt dispatch of staff from respective locations in the event of any reports from customers, we have taken measures such as disinfections and measuring temperatures when employees enter the room, and distributing of/fices. In September 2020, we held a company-wide disaster-prevention drill under the assumption of an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we have formulated guidelines for the establishment and operation of general supervisory headquarters at sites and area task forces in the event of emergency.\n\n## \u25a0 New safety-conscious initiatives at showrooms and events\n\n- \u25cf In order to assist customers unable to visit showrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic in their consideration of household furnishings and appliances, we are providing online viewings and 3D virtual viewings utilizing a communication app at the 'hu+gMUSEUM,' a center for providing information about food and living.\n- \u25cf For the 'Gas-ten,' which previously we held at facilities, etc., we held an online 'Tsunagaru Gas-ten' in consideration of customers' safety. (Held from October 1 to December 20, 2020) See P.40 for details.\n\n## \u25a0 Measures to ensure the safety of employees\n\n- \u25cf In of/fices, we are taking measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as providing disinfectants, encouraging handwashing, and setting up partitions in of/fices and other places.\n- \u25cf In order to prevent infection among employees, we have set up an environment for working from home by developing a remote access environment and introducing online conference systems, internal SNS, etc. Additionally, we are promoting the active utilization of working from home and\n\nImage of virtual tour of hu+gMUSEUM (Users can see explanations by pressing the round orange buttons during virtual tours)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstaggered shifts by expanding the range of employees eligible for these programs and increasing the frequency of their use. Looking ahead, we will continue actively utilizing working from home and staggered shifts from the perspective of preventing infection and controlling the /flow of people.\n\n- \u25cf We are cancelling and delaying business trips and group training sessions, seminars, etc., or moving these events online, depending on the status of the spread of infection.",

In addition, when selecting outside of/ficer candidates, the Company takes into consideration the individual's independent-mindedness for making objective judgments, and whether they have wideranging knowledge, wealth of experience, and expertise in their specialized /fields. The Company expects Outside Directors to participate in decision-making as members of the Board of Directors' meetings and monitor and supervise the execution of duties of the Executive Directors from an independent position based on their knowledge and experience, Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members to use their knowledge and experience to conduct strict audits on the execution of duties of the Directors, also from an independent standpoint. Outside Directors and\n\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Members are provided with information at meetings of the Board of Directors, etc., related to matters such as the operational status of internal control systems pursuant to the Companies Act, the evaluation of internal control related to /financial reporting pursuant to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, the status of internal audit, and the status of sustainability measures. In addition, Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members also con/firm the content of accounting audit reports.\n\nIn addition, Outside Directors Hideo Miyahara, Kazutoshi Murao, Tatsuo Kijima, Yumiko Sato, and outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members Yoko Kimura, Eiji Hatta, and Shigemi Sasaki have no special interest relationships with the company affecting decision-making, and as they meet the criteria for the independence of outside of/ficers stipulated by the company, they are judged to have suf/ficient independence. Based on the above, they are reported as independent of/ficers to the /financial instruments exchanges on which the company is listed.\n\n## \u25a0 Training Policy for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members\n\nWhen appointed, the Company provides internal of/ficers an opportunity to acquire knowledge regarding their roles, legal duties to be complied with, and responsibilities expected for a Director or Audit & Supervisory Board Member. Subsequently, the Company regularly provides opportunities internally or externally for of/ficers to receive training regarding legal affairs, risk management, compliance, and other matters to continue to acquire knowledge necessary for comprehension of legal revisions and other latest world trends. Further, as part of the succession plan for top management, human resources to oversee the Company's management are fostered through such means as the systematic\n\nrotation of the areas of responsibility of internal Directors and Executive Of/ficers.\n\nAs for outside of/ficers, the Company provides opportunities for them to deepen their understanding upon appointment, such as by explaining the nature of the Group's businesses, so that they can put to practice their expertise and experience in each of their /fields for supervising and auditing the Company's business. Later, the Company also offers opportunities as necessary in which the business environment and business trends are explained accurately in a timely manner so that outside of/ficers can gain an understanding.",

Decision Policies on Content of Remuneration, etc. for Each Individual Director\n\nThe Company has established a policy on determining the content of remuneration, etc. for each individual Director (hereinafter the 'Policy on Determining Remuneration') as prescribed by the resolution of the Board of Directors after deliberation at a voluntarily appointed advisory committee made up of a majority of the Outside Directors. This policy is summarized as follows.\n\nThe system of paying retirement bene/fits to Directors has been abolished.\n\n## <Policy on Determining Remuneration>\n\n## (a) Basic Approach\n\nRemuneration for Directors shall be provided in a remuneration system designed to raise motivation for Directors to achieve sustainable growth and mid- to long-term increase in corporate value. Remuneration for Directors other than Outside Directors shall consist of basic remuneration as /fixed remuneration, performance-linked remuneration and stock-based remuneration, and remuneration for outside Directors shall only consist of basic remuneration as /fixed remuneration, as they have a standpoint independent of business execution.\n\nRemuneration for Directors shall be determined within the total amount of remuneration approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, after deliberation at a voluntarily appointed advisory committee made up of a majority of the Outside Directors, from the perspective of ensuring objectivity and seeking transparency in the decision-making process.\n\n## (b) Basic Remuneration\n\nBasic remuneration shall be monetary remuneration paid on a monthly basis. The amount shall be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed by the resolution of the Board of Directors, while considering such factors as each Director's position and responsibilities, public standards, and other factors. (c) Performance-linked Remuneration\n\nPerformance-linked remuneration shall be monetary remuneration paid on a monthly basis. The amount shall be determined using the pro/fit attributable to owners of parent for the past three years as the main indicator to encourage contribution to short-term and mid- to long-term increases in corporate value.\n\n## (d) Stock-based Remuneration\n\nRestricted stock shall be granted at a certain time every year for the purpose of strengthening the linkage between remuneration and mid- to long-term increase in corporate value and further promoting sharing of value with the shareholders. The number of shares to be granted shall be determined with consideration for the positions and responsibilities of each Director and stock prices, etc.\n\n## (e) Ratio by Type of Remuneration\n\nFor Directors other than Outside Directors, the standard ratio of basic remuneration, performance-linked remuneration, and stock-based remuneration should be 5:4:1. Remuneration for Outside Directors shall fully consist of basic remuneration.\n\n## (f) Procedures for Determining Remuneration\n\nThe content of remuneration for each individual Director shall be made in accordance with the rules prescribed by the resolution of the Board of Directors, and, after deliberation at the voluntarily appointed advisory committee, shall be determined by the resolution of the Board of Directors. However, the content of monetary remuneration may be determined by the Representative Director and President based on delegation of authority by the resolution of the Board of Directors.\n\n## 2 . Resolution of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Remuneration, etc. of Directors\n\n- The amount of remuneration for Directors was approved at the 203rd Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 25, 2021 to be up to 57 million yen per month for monetary remuneration and up to 72 million yen per year for stock-based remuneration. The number of Directors at the end of said Annual Meeting of Shareholders was ten.\n\n## 3.  Delegation of Decision of Content of Remuneration, etc. for Each Individual Director\n\n- The amount, timing and method of remuneration payment for each Director is determined by Representative Director and President (Takehiro Honjo until December 2020 and Masataka Fujiwara from January 2021) based on delegation of authority by a resolution of the Board of Directors. The Company has delegated the above authority to the Representative Director and President, as the position is considered to be the best suited to determine the contents of remuneration, taking into account the status of the execution of duties by each Executive Director while maintaining a comprehensive view of the Company's performance.\n\nIn addition, to ensure that the authority of the Representative Director and President is exercised appropriately, the delegation of authority is conducted so that the remuneration amount, etc. for each individual Director is determined in accordance with the Policy on Determining Remuneration and the rules prescribed by the resolution of the Board of Directors, while considering such factors as each Director's position and responsibilities, public standards, and the Company's business performance, after deliberation at a voluntarily appointed advisory committee made up of a majority of the Outside Directors. As the amount of remuneration, etc. for each individual Director is determined through such a procedure, the Board of Directors has judged that the content of remuneration, etc. for each individual Director for the /fiscal year under review is in line with the Policy on Determining Remuneration.\n\n## 4.  Resolution of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Decision on Remuneration, etc. for Audit & Supervisory Board Members\n\nThe amount of remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members was approved at the 176th Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 29, 1994 to be up to 14 million yen per month. The number of Audit & Supervisory Board Members at the end of said Annual Meeting of Shareholders was /five.\n\nThe amount of remuneration for each Audit & Supervisory Board Member shall be determined through discussions among Audit & Supervisory Board Members within this amount, and consisting only of /fixed remuneration because they are assigned the role of auditing the execution of duties by Directors from a standpoint independent of the performance of the Company's businesses, and taking into consideration the position, etc. of each Audit & Supervisory Board Member.\n\nThe system of paying retirement bene/fits to Audit & Supervisory Board Members has been abolished.\n\n## 5.  Details of Activities of the Board of Directors and Advisory Committee in the Process for Determining the Amount of Remuneration, etc., for Officers During the Fiscal Year Under Review\n\nWith regard to matters related to the remuneration of of/ficers, at meetings held in May 2020, December 2020, and February 2021, the Advisory Committee deliberated matters such as the appropriateness of performance-linked remuneration calculation methods, the payment coef/ficient, and remuneration levels, which were then decided by the Representative Director and President as mentioned above.\n\n## Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent (Consolidated Profit) for the Last Three Years\n\n|                         | Fiscal year   |             | 200th    | 201st    | 202nd    |\n|-------------------------|---------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Fiscal year             | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year | FY2018.3 | FY2019.3 | FY2020.3 |\n| Pro/fit attributable to | million yen   | Plan        | 42,500   | 46,500   | 55,000   |\n| owners of parent        | million yen   | Results     | 37,724   | 33,601   | 41,788   |\n\n## Total Amount of Remuneration by Officer Classification and by Type of Remuneration, and Number of Eligible Officers\n\n| Classi/fication                                               | Total amount of remuneration   | Total amount of remuneration by type of remuneration (million yen)   | Total amount of remuneration by type of remuneration (million yen)   | Number of payees   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                               | (million yen)                  | Fixed                                                                | Performance-linked                                                   |                    |\n| Directors (excluding Outside Directors)                       | 386                            | 235                                                                  | 150                                                                  | 10                 |\n| Audit & Supervisory Board Members (excluding outside members) | 69                             | 69                                                                   | -                                                                    | 3                  |\n| Outside Directors                                             | 29                             | 29                                                                   | -                                                                    | 3                  |\n| Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members                     | 32                             | 32                                                                   | -                                                                    | 3                  |\n\n\u25a0 The total amount of remuneration for each of/ficer is not stated as there is no of/ficer with a total amount of consolidated remuneration of 100 million yen or more. \u25a0 There are no employees concurrently serving as of/ficers.\n\nOrganizational heads of the Company and Presidents of the af/filiates promote the management of the risk of losses and periodically conduct risk management assessments. Each basic organization or af/filiate identi/fies risk items, checks the status of management concerning the risk items and conducts follow-ups or other measures by using such means as the 'G-RIMS (Gas Group Risk Management System)*,' which systematizes the selfassessment of risk management practices.\n\nIn light of the spread of COVID-19 in Japan and abroad, we set up a task force and con/firm the status of the Group's responses, while taking measures to prevent infections, as necessary.\n\nRegarding the management of risks concerning security and disaster prevention which are common to the Group, the organization in charge is clearly speci/fied, and the organization supports each basic organization and af/filiate to ensure risk management on a Group-wide basis.\n\nTo prepare for emergencies, regulations for disaster countermeasure and business continuity plans are prepared. We\n\ncarried out company-wide disaster-prevention drills, which consist of earthquake drills and BCP exercises. During the /fiscal year under review, in addition to drills assuming disasters occurred amid a pandemic, we carried out collaboration training and exercises on a remote basis to ensure collaboration between gas pipeline operators and gas retailers in case of disaster.\n\nThe Cyber Security Committee is working to further strengthen countermeasures against cyberattacks from outside the Group network.\n\n- * G-RIMS is a system for risk management in routine business operations. The manager of each organization and affiliated company checks if preventive measures have been implemented or an early-detection system is in place as required, using a checklist comprising about 50 risk items. G-RIMS is also designed to evaluate the magnitude of risks and identify risks to be addressed, before PDCA (plan-do-check-act) is operated for improvement.\n\n## \u25a0 Business Risks\n\nThe following are examples of risks that can affect business performance and /financial conditions of the Group. Matters concerning the future as stated are based on the Daigas Group's judgment and assumptions as of the end of FY2021.3.\n\n## (1) Risks Related to All Businesses within the Group\n\n- \u2460 Changes in economic, /financial, and social conditions as well as market contraction\n- \u2461 Occurrence of catastrophic disasters, accidents, or infectious diseases\n- \u2462 Changes in international rules, politics, laws and regulations, and institutional systems\n- \u2463 Changes in foreign exchange rates and borrowing rates\n- \u2464 Uncollected investments\n- \u2465 Climate change and decarbonization\n- \u2466 Intensifying competition\n- \u2467 Breakdown or malfunction of critical IT systems and information leaks\n- \u2468 Quality issues with products or services\n- \u2469 Non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## (2) Risks Related to Major Businesses\n\n- \u2460 Domestic energy business\n- a. Impact of /fluctuations in temperature/water temperature on energy demand\n- b. Changes in raw fuel costs\n- c. Dif/ficulty in procuring raw fuels\n- d. Changes in electricity procurement costs\n- e. Dif/ficulties in gas production/power generation and gas/ power supply\n- f.  Gas equipment and facility issues\n- g. Intensifying competition in the industry and the resulting increase in choices available to consumers\n\n## \u2461 International Energy Business\n\nChanges in the operating environment, such as decreased profitability or project delay or cancellation, resulting from the public policies, implementation of or changes in regulations, deterioration of economic or social conditions, market /fluctuation in areas including crude oil prices and gas prices, technical problems, or damage by natural disasters in the countries in which the Group operates\n\n## \u2462 Life & Business Solutions\n\nChanges in the operating environment, such as soaring material costs and worsening economic conditions\n\nIn addition to the measures preparing for the above risk, the Daigas Group aims to mitigate impact on our business in cases where such risks emerge by appropriately understanding and supervising the situations of business operations, while considering the degree and time period of the potential for risks to materialize.",

In an autonomous system, governance is achieved in the entire network, not by forcefully controlling it as a whole but by having every organization work toward the same objective based on prede/fined principles. At Osaka Gas, I feel that the Company is pursuing the idea of an autonomous organization as I have been supervising the corporate governance of Osaka Gas while participating in active discussions with other Board Members, as an Outside Director since 2013.\n\nAmong the initiatives under the Medium-Term Management Plan, I place particular emphasis on our efforts for carbon neutrality and digital transformation (DX). Regarding carbon neutrality, we recognize the importance of implementing decarbonization initiatives that are based on scienti/fic veri/fication in terms of establishing and achieving numerical targets. As we work toward our carbon neutrality goal, we will continue enhancing our initiatives by reviewing results based on objective data and working on simulations.\n\nDX is also a vital issue for an energy company like us. In implementing DX initiatives, it is crucial to strengthen internal systems through developing human resources with IT skills and hiring external talent. As it will require signi/ficant investment, I will ensure with other Board Members that decisions will be made based on the results of thorough discussions within the Company.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) will make rapid advancements over the coming years with the telecommunications environment expected to continue developing with 5G (/fifth generation mobile telecommunications systems), and 6G. Although technological evolution will bring merits for people's lifestyles and industry, it will also increase security risks and electricity consumption. In light of these points, we will make decisions through careful discussions at meetings of the Board of Directors to implement our initiatives and execute strategies leveraging the strengths of Osaka Gas.\n\n## Becoming a leading company in the energy business, pioneering initiatives to solve social issues for a sustainable future\n\n## Taking on new challenges to solve management issues, deviating from conventional approaches\n\nWhen I consider Osaka Gas' approach to management, my view is that governance is functioning effectively at the Company. Lively discussions take place at meetings of the Board of Directors, and when I observe the actual worksites where operations are executed, I feel strongly that the intentions of management are re/flected in the ways employees work. We will ensure that the Daigas Group will utilize its corporate culture of approaching everything in a genuine and studious manner to further pursue its social mission as a company operating an energy business.\n\nOver many years, I have developed much experience in corporate management through the activities of companies and business associations. I intend to contribute to the Daigas Group's management enhancement by utilizing my expertise and knowledge on energy business strategies, approaches to governance, potential risks and scenarios to respond to those risks such as in investments, collaboration proposals and new businesses.\n\nWe aim to realize that Osaka Gas will become a leading company in the energy business, pioneering initiatives to solve social issues for a sustainable future. It is important that the Company does not just follow national policies and the\n\nactions of other companies, but instead take the lead in solving these issues, looking ahead to the times.\n\nIn this regard, the Daigas Group has devised its strategies for carbon neutrality and digital transformation in the Medium-Term Management Plan. I have great hopes for the future development of the Group, in particular, the Group's commitment announced at the President's inaugural press conference, to the development of methanation, a technology to synthesize methane, one of the main constituents of natural gas, from hydrogen and CO2. With regard to DX, we will not stop at simple digitalization but utilize DX to create solutions to future changes in business models, lifestyles and ways of work.\n\nAchieving success in carbon neutrality and DX requires technical breakthroughs and effective funding plans. To that end, I will support the steady implementation of the Medium-Term Management Plan by providing appropriate advice as an Outside Director. The Daigas Group will strive to create value for a sustainable future while quickly responding to changes in the business environment as the COVID-19 pandemic further affects lifestyles and businesses.\n\nAs a new Outside Director appointed in June this year, I am committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance for Osaka Gas, which is working earnestly to provide social value through its business activities. I feel optimistic about the Company's future business development as the Company is looking not just to protect its existing businesses, but also actively taking on new challenges and working toward breakthroughs.\n\nAs the times change rapidly, companies in any industry cannot simply maintain the status quo as they used to do, if they wish to survive. We must anticipate future trends and de/fine our vision, then work backwards from there to think about what we need to do at this moment. It is also crucial that we focus not just on the ideas of senior management, but also suf/ficiently incorporate the views of employees working close to customers, in order to achieve a breakthrough. I will visit as many worksites as possible and provide senior management with views from an external perspective as an Outside Director. I intend to contribute to decision-making that is not bound by conventional ways of thinking.\n\nFor a company engaged in businesses with regional roots like Osaka Gas, co-creation with local communities is highly important. We will continue engaging in activities that contribute to local communities, and we would like to ensure broader awareness of our activities in this area.\n\nOsaka Gas is a large organization that has been maintaining an earnest and hardworking corporate culture with an enterprising spirit. We will accelerate our efforts to solve management issues, such as promoting more active participation of women, by taking on new challenges with innovative approaches in a timely manner.\n\nWith regard to the Medium-Term Management Plan, we will ensure that the Daigas Group will reach the targets while ful/filling its social mission as an energy company to a greater extent than now. To that end, we will continue encouraging all members to work with a higher sense of responsibility and take the initiative in contributing to solving social issues through the Group's business activities.\n\nThe Daigas Group aims to create the four types of value stated in its Corporate Principles. In order to support the Group's efforts to achieve it, I am committed to strengthening the Group's governance as an Outside Director. At the Board of Directors, we strive to make decisions on initiatives for the Group in light of whether our actions will be understood from the perspective of all stakeholders including those outside the Group. This is especially important when engaging in risk management for the Group's businesses and evaluating the transparency of the decision-making process as well as the consistency of each proposal with the Group's growth strategies and the validity of their content.\n\nOver the past twelve months since I was appointed Outside Director, I have seen the Daigas Group demonstrating its strength in enhancing governance. Going forward, we will continue discussing constructively the Group's major policies, such as management strategies and targets. While I admire the Group's corporate culture that welcomes opinions from all members, I intend to encourage higher participation among all members in exchanging views on these themes regardless of positions and titles.\n\nAt the Board of Directors, I will work closely with other members to enhance corporate value based on a shared understanding among all Directors on the prospects for proposals for future developments and the necessity of implementing major reforms at the Daigas Group from a longterm perspective. I will also /flexibly take an aggressive approach in governance when we take appropriate risks in order to promote growth.\n\nIn implementing the new Medium-Term Management Plan announced in March 2021 (Plan 2023), it is important that we incorporate a mindset rooted in the customer contact points, together with think-and-act approach, in which each employee thinks from the customer's perspective before acting. In order to spread within the Daigas Group the concept of 'value for a sustainable future' under the Plan 2023, we will ensure that the management communicates with employees in an easy-to-understand manner how their day-to-day work will create value for a sustainable future. We will continue building a corporate culture that increases management's engagement with employees and encourages each employee to work with a higher sense of ownership.\n\nOutside Director Tatsuo Kijima\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope of consolidation\n\nNumber of consolidated subsidiaries:\n\n156 (Previous /fiscal year), 154 (Current /fiscal year)\n\nThe names of consolidated subsidiaries are omitted as they are stated in 'Group Companies' on page 115.\n\nThe Company has acquired shares in GlobalBase Corporation, RenoBase Design Corporation, Osaka Gas Three Rivers, LLC, PaletteCloud Inc., Finex Oy, Kiinteisto Oy Kotkan Huumantie 5, and Shikoku Central Energy K.K., making them the new subsidiaries of the Company. As a result, those subsidiaries are included as consolidated\n\n## 2. Application of the equity method\n\nNumber of equity method af/filiates:\n\n23 (Previous /fiscal year), 27 (Current /fiscal year)\n\nThe names of equity method af/filiates are omitted as they are stated in 'Group Companies' on page 115.\n\nThe Company has acquired equity in TOPS Pipeline, LLC and CPV Three Rivers, LLC. As a result, they are included as equity method af/filiates from the current /fiscal year. Fukushima Gas Power Co., Ltd. and Ichihara Biomass Power Co., Ltd. are included as equity method affiliates from the current fiscal year due to their increased importance. The silent partnership where GK Aomori Wind Power is the operator is included as an equity method af/filiate from the current /fiscal year because the Company invested in the silent partnership.\n\n## 3. Fiscal year, etc. of consolidated subsidiaries\n\nConsolidated subsidiaries whose /fiscal year-ends are different from the consolidated /fiscal year-end are Osaka Gas Australia Pty Ltd, Osaka Gas Gorgon Pty Ltd, Osaka Gas Ichthys Pty Ltd, Osaka Gas Ichthys Development Pty Ltd, Osaka Gas UK, Ltd., Osaka Gas USA Corporation and other companies, totaling 85 companies. Of the consolidated subsidiaries whose fiscal year-ends are different from the consolidated fiscal year-end, GlobalBase\n\nCorporation and RenoBase Design Corporation have a /fiscal yearend of February 28, and the other consolidated subsidiaries have a fiscal year-end of December 31. However, since the difference between those dates and the consolidated /fiscal year-end (March 31) does not exceed 3 months, the consolidated financial statements are prepared using their /financial statements as of their /fiscal year-end.\n\n## 4. Accounting policies\n\n## (1) Basis and methodology for the valuation of significant assets\n\n## \u2460 Inventories\n\nPrimarily stated at cost based on the moving-average method Inventories held for trading recorded on the balance sheet are depreciated to write down the carrying amount based on depreciation of pro/fitability.\n\n## \u2461 Investment securities\n\nBonds held to maturity\n\nStated at amortized cost\n\n## Other securities\n\nSecurities for which it is practical to determine fair value Stated at fair value based on the market price, etc. at the /fiscal year-end (unrealized valuation gains and losses are accounted for as a component of net assets; cost of sales is determined primarily using the moving-average method.)\n\nSecurities for which it is not practical to determine fair value Primarily stated at cost based on the moving-average method\n\n## \u2462 Derivatives\n\nStated at fair value\n\n## (2) Depreciation and amortization method of significant depreciable assets\n\n## \u2460 Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets)\n\nPrimarily the declining-balance method However, the straight-line method has been used for buildings (excluding facilities attached to buildings) acquired on or after April 1, 1998 and for facilities attached to buildings and\n\nstructures acquired on or after April 1, 2016.\n\n## \u2461 Intangible assets (excluding leased assets)\n\nPrimarily the straight-line method\n\nFor internal-use software, the straight-line method based on the term available for use within the Company and each subsidiary has been applied.\n\n## \u2462 Leased assets\n\nLeased assets resulting from non-ownership-transfer /finance leases The straight-line method over the useful life equal to the lease terms assuming no residual value\n\n## (3) Basis for recording significant allowances\n\n## \u2460 Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nTo provide for the bad debts loss of accounts receivable, loans receivable, etc., an estimated uncollectible amount is provided by considering the default ratio in the past for general receivables and the individual collectability for certain receivables including receivables with default possibility.\n\n## \u2461 Provision for gas holder repairs\n\nTo provide for the necessary expenditure for periodical repairs of spherical gas holders, an estimated amount for the next scheduled repair is provided based on the actual expenditure for the previous repair, which is proportionally allotted for the period up to such next scheduled repair.\n\n## \u2462 Provision for safety measures\n\nTo provide for the necessary expenditure to ensure the safety of the gas business, an estimated amount of the expenditure necessary for promoting the widespread use of safety-enhanced models, for strengthening inspections and ensuring increased awareness as well as for countermeasure works on aged gas pipelines is provided.\n\n## \u2463 Provision for gas appliance warranties\n\nTo provide for the payment of any service costs under warranty after the sale of appliances, an estimated amount of such costs is provided.\n\nsubsidiaries of the Company from the current /fiscal year. OGCTS CO., LTD. (merged into Daigas Energy Co., Ltd.), Gas and Power Co., Ltd. (merged into Daigas Gas and Power Solution Co., Ltd.), Osaka Gas Engineering Co., Ltd. (merged into Daigas Gas and Power Solution Co., Ltd.), Osaka Gas Resources Canada Ltd. (sold), OG Road Co., Ltd. (liquidated), Osaka Gas Niugini Pty Ltd (sold), Osaka Gas Niugini E&P Pty Ltd (sold), OJV Cayman 4 Limited (liquidated), and OJV Cayman 6 Limited (liquidated) are no longer consolidated subsidiaries of the Company from the current /fiscal year.\n\nAurora Solar Holdings Corporation (sold) is excluded as an equity method af/filiate from the current /fiscal year.\n\nA major af/filiate for which the equity method is not applied is ENNET Corporation.\n\nWith regard to af/filiates for which the equity method is not applied, their impact on profit or loss and retained earnings, etc. for the current fiscal year is not significant and immaterial on the whole. Therefore, investments in those af/filiates are measured at cost.\n\nWhen the /fiscal year-end of equity method af/filiates is different from the consolidated fiscal year-end, the financial statements for the /fiscal year of such af/filiates are used.",

Actuarial gains and losses are amortized on a straight-line basis mainly over a period of 10 years beginning from the next /fiscal year after each occurrence.\n\n## (5) Criteria for translating significant assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into Japanese currency\n\nAssets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the spot exchange rate as of the fiscal year-end. Revenues and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The resulting translation differences are included in foreign currency translation adjustment and non-controlling interests in net assets.\n\n## (6) Significant hedge accounting method\n\n## \u2460 Hedge accounting method\n\nDeferred hedge accounting is adopted. When applicable requirements are met, exceptional accounting for interest rate swaps and allocation accounting for forward exchange contracts, etc. are adopted.\n\n## \u2461 Hedging instruments and hedged items\n\nHedging instruments\n\nHedged items\n\n\u00b7 Interest rate swaps\n\n- \u00b7 Forward exchange contracts or currency options\n- \u00b7 Loans payable denominated in foreign currencies\n- \u00b7 Swaps and options on energy prices, etc.\n\n\u00b7 Bonds, loans payable\n\n- \u00b7 Forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies (purchase prices of raw materials, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Interests in overseas subsidiaries and associates\n- \u00b7 Purchase prices of raw materials, etc.\n\n## Significant Accounting Estimates\n\n## 1 Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investment in entities accounted for using equity method\n\n## (1) Amounts recorded on the consolidated financial statements for this consolidated fiscal year\n\n|                                                           | (million yen)                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                           | Fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 |\n| Property, plant and equipment                             | 1,070,610                        |\n| Intangible assets                                         | 97,912                           |\n| Investment in entities accounted for  using equity method | 210,091                          |\n\n## (2) Information on details of significant accounting estimates for identified items\n\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries assess whether there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. If there is any indication, they conduct an impairment test. For investments in equity method affiliates, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries assess whether there is any indication of impairment, and if there is any indication, they conduct an impairment test. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries estimate future cash flows and discount rates for calculating their present value as the basis for calculating the recoverable amount, etc.\n\nIn the event that the recoverable amount, etc. deteriorates due to a decline in pro/fit/loss or cash /flows from future operating activities or an increase in the discount rate caused by factors such as a decline in energy prices such as crude oil prices, it may be necessary to record impairment losses.\n\nDuring the current /fiscal year, Osaka Gas Australia Pty Ltd ('Osaka Gas Australia') recognized an indication of impairment on LNG Development Project, in which it had invested, due to the low level of crude oil prices and conducted an impairment test. Having found that the recoverable amount was less than the carrying amount, Osaka Gas Australia recorded impairment losses of \u00a514,208 million.

Derivative transactions are not entered into unless they are backed by actual demand.\n\n## \u2463 Method for assessing the hedge effectiveness\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed by identifying the corresponding relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\n## (7) Method and period for amortization of goodwill\n\nGoodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life within 20 years after initial recognition; provided, however, that immaterial goodwill is recognized as income or expense in full upon acquisition.\n\n## (8) Scope of funds in the consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nFunds stated in the consolidated statement of cash /flows (cash and cash equivalents) comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments that are readily convertible and subject to an insigni/ficant risk of changes in value with original maturities of three months or less.\n\n## (9) Other significant matters on the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## \u2460 Accounting for consumption taxes\n\nTransactions subject to consumption taxes are recorded at amounts exclusive of consumption taxes.\n\n- \u2461 Accounting policies and procedures adopted in the absence of requirements in relevant accounting standards, etc. that speci/fically apply to events or transactions that are accounted for Basis for recording signi/ficant revenue and expenses\n\nRevenue from gas and electricity sales is recorded based on the meter reading date, in which gas or electricity usage is measured in a monthly meter reading and the calculated fees are recognized as revenue for that month.\n\n## 2 Collectability of deferred tax assets\n\n## (1) Amounts recorded on the consolidated financial statements for this consolidated fiscal year\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets is the same as the amount stated in 'Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes, Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes (Tax Effect Accounting), 1 Breakdown of major causes for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.'\n\n## (2) Information on details of significant accounting estimates for identified items\n\nFor tax loss carryforwards, tax deductions, and deductible temporary differences, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries recognize deferred tax assets only for those highly likely to reduce future taxable income. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries estimate the amount of taxable income expected to be generated in the future and the timing of such generation based on business plans, etc.\n\nIn the event that the expected future taxable income has not been generated, the deferred tax assets recorded may not be collected and tax expenses may increase.\n\n## 3 Calculation of retirement benefit obligations\n\n## (1) Amounts recorded on the consolidated financial statements for this consolidated fiscal year\n\n|                                         | (million yen)                    |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                         | Fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 |\n| Retirement benefit asset                | 83,494                           |\n| Retirement benefit liability            | 18,758                           |\n| Remeasurements of defined benefit plans | 34,025                           |\n\n## (2) Information on details of significant accounting estimates for identified items\n\nThe Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have adopted funded and unfunded de/fined bene/fit plans and de/fined contribution plans for the purpose of providing retirement bene/fits to employees. The de/fined bene/fit plan obligations and de/fined bene/fit expenses as of the end of the current /fiscal year are recorded based on actuarial assumptions for pensions such as discount rate, retirement rate, mortality rate, and longterm expected rate of return.\n\nIf the actual results differ from these assumptions, or if there is a change in the assumptions, the retirement bene/fit obligations and expenses of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries may be affected.\n\n## Changes in Accounting Policies\n\n## (Accounting standards, etc. not yet applied)\n\n- \u00b7 'Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition' (ASBJ Statement No. 29; March 31, 2020)\n- \u00b7 'Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition'\n\n(ASBJ Guidance No. 30; March 26, 2021)\n\n## (1) Summary\n\nThese are comprehensive accounting standards on revenue recognition.

Matters on the status of financial instruments\n\n## (1) Policies for dealing with financial instruments\n\nIt is the Group's policy to raise its operating funds through loans from financial institutions and the issuance of bonds and to conduct fund management through a conservative financial portfolio which limits exposure to losses. The Group uses derivative transactions to hedge the risks described later and does not engage in speculative transactions.\n\n## (2) Details of financial instruments, risks thereof and risk management structure\n\nNotes and accounts receivable - trade, which are operating receivables, are exposed to customer credit risks. To deal with this risk, the Company and the Group companies manage due dates and balances for each counterparty in accordance with their accounting rules and manuals regarding receivable management, etc. and seek to mitigate collectability concern. Securities and investment securities, which comprise mainly shares of companies with which the Group has business relationships, are exposed to risks including market price /fluctuation risk. The Group continuously reviews its shareholding position by periodically monitoring their market price and the /financial condition of the issuers (customer companies), as well as considering the relationship with such customer companies. Notes and accounts payable - trade, which are operating payables, are mostly settled within one year. Of bonds and loans payable, short-term borrowings are mainly to procure funds for operational transactions, while bonds and long-term borrowings are mainly to procure funds for capital expenditures. Bonds and long-term borrowings procure funds with /fixed interest rates. In derivative transactions, the Group uses interest rate swaps for adjusting the ratio between /fixed and /floating interest rates and fixing the interest level for bonds and loans payable, forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts for reducing the /fluctuation of cash /flows due to change in foreign exchange\n\nrates, swap contracts and option contracts on energy prices, etc. for reducing the /fluctuation of cash /flows due to change in energy prices, etc., and weather derivative contracts, etc. for reducing the fluctuation of cash flows due to change in temperature. Matters on hedge accounting including hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policy and methods for assessing hedge effectiveness are as described in 'Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes, Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes (Significant Matters Forming the Basis of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements), 4 (6) Significant hedge accounting method.'\n\nIn conducting derivative transactions, the Group primarily enters into contracts only with /financial institutions, etc. with high ratings in order to minimize credit risks. Execution and management of derivative transactions are performed by the /finance department of each Group company, and the finance department of the Company controls their activities. Transactions by Group companies are conducted in accordance with the internal rules. Although operating payables, loans and bonds payable are exposed to liquidity risk, the Company maintains high credit ratings and secures stable fund procurement measures. In addition, the Group has implemented a cash management system (CMS) and a global cash management system (GCMS) to facilitate funding for Group companies.\n\n## (3) Supplementary explanation to fair value of financial instruments\n\nPlease note that contract amounts of derivative transactions in '2 Matters on fair value, etc. of financial instruments' do not, in themselves, indicate the market risk pertaining to the derivative transactions.",

trade\n\nAs these items are settled within a short term, the fair value is approximately equal to the carrying amount. Therefore, the fair value is determined by the carrying amount.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n## (1) Notes and accounts payable - trade, and (2) Short-term borrowings\n\nAs these items are settled within a short term, the fair value is approximately equal to the carrying amount. Therefore, the fair value is determined by the carrying amount.\n\n## (3) Bonds payable\n\nThe fair value of bonds payable issued by the Company is based on their market prices.\n\n## Derivative transactions\n\n## (3) Securities and investment securities\n\nThe fair value of shares is based on the market prices at the exchange. The fair value of bonds is based on the market prices at the exchange or the prices provided by counterparty /financial institutions. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, please refer to 'Notes to Securities.'\n\n## (4) Long-term borrowings\n\nThe fair value of long-term borrowings with fixed interest is measured by discounting the sum of the principal and interest at the rate assumed for new similar loans.\n\nThe fair value of long-term borrowings with floating interest is determined by the carrying amount, as the fair value is deemed approximately equal to the carrying amount. Interest rate swap contracts which determine the interest rate level of long-term borrowings with /floating interest qualify for exceptional accounting. Long-term borrowings with /floating interest accompanied by such interest swaps are accounted for as a whole, and the fair value is determined by discounting the sum of their principals and interests at a reasonably estimated rate applied for similar loans.\n\nNote 2: Carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet of /financial instruments whose fair value is extremely dif/ficult to determine\n\n(million yen)\n\n| Category              | March 31, 2020   | March 31, 2021   |    |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|----|\n| Shares of affiliates  | 229,227          | 229,618          |    |\n| Unlisted stocks, etc. | 16,643           | 19,835           |    |\n\nAs the above /financial instruments do not have market prices and their future cash /flows cannot be estimated, their fair value is extremely dif/ficult to determine.

As for de/fined bene/fit plans, the Company and most consolidated subsidiaries provide lump sum retirement payment plans, and the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries provide defined benefit corporate pension plans or corporate pension fund plans.\n\nThe Company has adopted a defined benefit corporate pension\n\nplan since August 1, 2006 and a de/fined contribution pension plan to which part of the de/fined bene/fit plan transitioned since January 1, 2005.\n\nAs certain consolidated subsidiaries participate in the corporate pension fund of the multi-employer pension plans, they cannot determine the amount of pension assets corresponding to their contribution. Therefore, such plans are accounted for in the same manner as de/fined contribution plans.\n\n## 2 Defined benefit plans\n\n## (1) Reconciliations of the opening and closing balances of retirement benefit obligations\n\n|                                                                    | Previous Year (April 1, 2019 -

The Daigas Group classifies its products and services into business segments on the basis of two business domains: the Domestic and International Energy Business, and the Life & Business Solutions Business. It then divides those business segments into the following four reportable segments by considering the similarities of products and services: the Domestic Energy/Gas Business, the Domestic Energy/Electricity Business, the International Energy Business, and the Life & Business Solutions Business.\n\nThe Domestic Energy/Gas Business manufactures, supplies, and sells city gas, sells gas appliances, conducts gas pipeline\n\ninstallation, and sells LNG, LPG and industrial gas. The Domestic Energy/Electricity Business produces and sells electricity. The International Energy Business conducts development and investment related to petroleum and natural gas, supplies energy, and transports LNG. The Life & Business Solutions Business conducts development and leasing of real estate, information processing services, and sales of fine materials and carbon material products.\n\nIn addition, due to the reorganization of af/filiated companies in the energy field on April 1, 2020, certain consolidated subsidiaries that were previously included in the Domestic Energy/Electricity segment are included in the Domestic Energy/Gas segment from the current /fiscal year. The segment information presented for the previous fiscal year is based on the reportable segment classi/fication after the reorganization.",

(hereinafter referred to as 'Osaka Gas Network' or the 'succeeding company'). On the same date, we executed an absorption-type split agreement with the succeeding company (this company split shall be hereinafter referred to as the 'Split'). The Split is subject to the approval for the absorption-type split agreement at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on June 25, 2021, and the relevant authorities' approvals necessary for the Split.\n\n## (1) Background and purpose of the Split\n\nPursuant to the June 2015 amendment of the Gas Business Act, the Company, a general gas pipeline service business operator, will be prohibited from engaging also in the retail gas business or the gas production business from April 2022. The purpose of this amendment is to further secure neutrality of the gas pipeline service business. In order to comply with the regulatory requirement and to establish an organizational structure to increase the value of our Group, we established Osaka Gas Network, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, on April 1 of this year and executed an absorption-type split agreement with the subsidiary to transfer our general gas pipeline service business to the subsidiary which will become effective on April 1, 2022. After the absorption-type split, our Group, including Osaka Gas Network, will continue to be a group of companies taking responsibility for the infrastructure sector, including the energy business, and to increase the value of our Group by fulfilling the obligation of the companies in our Group and maximizing the value we provide in our businesses.\n\n## (2) Outline of the Split\n\n## \u2460 Schedule of the Split\n\n| Board of Directors' meeting to approve the  absorption-type split agreement (the Company)                       | April 23, 2021           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Determination by directors to approve the absorption- type split agreement (succeeding company)                 | April 23, 2021           |\n| Execution of the absorption-type split agreement                                                                | April 23, 2021           |\n| General shareholders meeting to approve the  absorption-type split agreement (the Company)                      | June 25, 2021            |\n| Extraordinary general shareholders meeting to approve the  absorption-type split agreement (succeeding company) | June 25, 2021            |\n| Effective date of the absorption-type split                                                                     | April 1, 2022(tentative) |\n\n## (3) Outline of parties to the Split\n\n## \u2461 Type of Split\n\nThis is an absorption-type split in which the Company is a splitting company, and Osaka Gas Network, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is a succeeding company.\n\n## \u2462 Particulars of allotment due to the Split\n\nAs part of the Split, Osaka Gas Network, the succeeding company, will issue 6,700,000 common shares and allot all of them to the Company.\n\n- \u2463 Treatment of the Company's share options and corporate bonds with share options\n\nThe Company has not issued any share options or corporate bonds with share options.\n\n- There will be no change in share capital due to the Split. \u2464 Increase or decrease in share capital due to the Split\n- In accordance with the absorption-type split agreement, which was executed between the Company and the succeeding company on April 23, 2021, the rights and obligations of the Company in relation to the general gas pipeline service business and its incidental businesses will be transferred to Osaka Gas Network on the effective date of the agreement. With respect to the assumption of obligations by Osaka Gas Network through the Split, Osaka Gas Network will assume the obligations on a non-cumulative basis. In addition, the succeeding company will not assume the obligations associated with the existing bonds we have offered publicly. \u2465 Rights and obligations transferred to the succeeding company\n\n## \u2466 Expectation of performance of obligations\n\nIt is expected that the Company and the succeeding company will continue to have assets in excess of liabilities after the Split, and presently, we do not expect the occurrence of any events that would cause an impediment to the performance of obligations arising after the Split.

        "page_content": "## 1. Basic framework of internal control over financial reporting\n\nMasataka Fujiwara, Representative Director and President, is responsible for the maintenance and operation of a system for internal control over financial reporting of OSAKA GAS CO., LTD. (the 'Company'), and maintains and operates the system for internal control over /financial reporting in accordance with the basic framework for internal control set forth in the 'Revisions to the Standards and Practice Standards for Management Assessment and Audit concerning Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Council Opinions)' published by the Business Accounting Council.\n\nInternal control is intended to achieve its objectives to a reasonable extent by organically linking basic elements of internal control and having them function in a uni/fied manner. For this reason, there are possibilities that internal control over /financial reporting will fail to completely prevent or detect misstatements in /financial reporting.\n\n## 2. Assessment scope, base date, and assessment procedures\n\nThe assessment of internal control over /financial reporting was conducted as of March 31, 2021, the base date or the last day of the /fiscal year under review. In making the assessment, we complied with the assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting that are generally accepted as fair and appropriate.\n\nIn this assessment, we assessed internal control with a signi/ficant impact on overall /financial reporting on a consolidated basis (company-wide internal control). Based on the results of such assessment, we selected business processes that we should assess. In assessing such business processes, we analyzed the selected business processes, identi/fied key points in control with a signi/ficant impact on the reliability of /financial reporting, and assessed the effectiveness of the internal control by assessing the maintenance and operation status of the said key points in control.\n\nAs for the scope of the assessment of internal control over /financial reporting, we determined the necessary scope for the Company, its consolidated subsidiaries, and equity method associates, based on the materiality of the effect on the reliability of /financial reporting. We determined the materiality of the effect on the reliability of /financial reporting, while considering the materiality of the monetary and qualitative effects, and reasonably determined the scope of the assessment of internal control over business processes based on the result of the assessment of the company-wide internal control over the Company, 3 2 consolidated subsidiaries, and 7 equity method associates. 122 consolidated subsidiaries and 20 equity method associates were not included in the scope of the assessment of company-wide internal control, as they were judged to be insigni/ficant in terms of monetary and qualitative importance.\n\nWith regard to the scope of assessment of internal control over business processes, one business location that generated approximately two-thirds of the consolidated net sales in the previous consolidated /fiscal year (after transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated) was designated as a 'signi/ficant business location.' For the selected signi/ficant business location, we included the business processes leading to net sales, accounts receivable trade, and inventories in the scope of assessment, as they are accounts that are signi/ficantly related to the company's business objectives. Moreover, at business locations other than the selected signi/ficant business location, we included business processes related to signi/ficant accounts that have a high possibility of material misstatement and involve estimates and forecasts and business processes related to businesses or operations that involve transactions with high risk in the scope of assessment as we regarded them as business processes with high materiality, considering their impact on /financial reporting.\n\n## 3. Results of assessment\n\nAs a result of the above assessment, we concluded that the Company's internal control over /financial reporting was effective as of the end of the /fiscal year under review.\n\n## 4. Supplementary information\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 5. Other\n\n## Basis of Presenting Internal Control Report\n\nThe report on internal control over /financial reporting of Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. ('Internal Control Report') is prepared on the basis of generally accepted assessment standards of internal control over /financial reporting in Japan and is translated from the Internal Control Report prepared by Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.\n\nThis English integrated report is not subject to an audit by an independent auditor.\n\nThe following Independent Auditor's Report and Internal Control Audit Report is translated by Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. based on the original one attached in the original Annual Securities Report.\n\n## Independent Auditor's Report on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nKPMG AZSA LLC Osaka Office, Japan\n\nDaisuke Harada (Seal) Designated Limited Liability Partner Engagement Partner Certified Public Accountant\n\nKenta Tsujii (Seal) Designated Limited Liability Partner Engagement Partner Certified Public Accountant\n\nShoichiro Shigeta (Seal) Designated Limited Liability Partner Engagement Partner Certified Public Accountant\n\nTo the Board of Directors of Osaka Gas Co., Ltd.\n\n## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. ('the Company') and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'the Group') provided in the 'Financial Information' section in the company's Annual Report, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2021 and the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies, other explanatory information and supplementary schedules, in accordance with Article 193-2(1) of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2021, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAppropriateness of the valuation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recorded by Osaka Gas Australia Pty Ltd\n\n| The key audit matter

equipment and intangible assets of \u00a5106,474 million (see 'Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements (Significant Accounting Estimates)') owned by Osaka Gas  Australia Pty Ltd ('Osaka Gas Australia'), a consolidated subsidiary in the  International Energy segment, are recorded. They represented 4.6% of total assets. Osaka Gas Australia applies International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and  conducts an impairment test for any property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets of a cash-generating unit for which there are indications of impairment, and if  the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is  reduced to the recoverable amount, and the reduction in the carrying amount is  recognized as impairment losses. The recoverable amount is the higher of either the  value in use or fair value less cost of disposal. Osaka Gas Australia has equity stakes in LNG development projects, and the  profitability of those projects is affected by current and future crude oil price  fluctuations, etc. As crude oil prices remained low during the current fiscal year,  Osaka Gas Australia recognized indications of impairment for a portion of the cash- generating unit and conducted an impairment test. Having found that the recoverable | equipment and intangible assets recorded by Osaka Gas Australia, we  requested the component auditors of Osaka Gas Australia to perform an audit.  Then we evaluated the report of the component auditors as to whether  sufficient and appropriate audit evidence was obtained from the following  procedures among others: (1) Internal control testing Test of the design effectiveness of internal controls relevant to measuring  the value in use used for the impairment test.

        "page_content": "## Accuracy of gas sales and electricity sales excluding wholesale\n\n## The key audit matter\n\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nNet sales were \u00a5903,488 million in the Domestic Energy/Gas segment In order to assess the accuracy of gas and electricity sales, we primarily performed the following audit procedures: (1) Internal control testing\n\n- We tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the internal controls relevant to the revenue recognition process for Gas and Electricity Sales. In the assessment, we focused on the following internal controls, based on our understanding of the revenue recognition process. In addition, our IT specialists were involved in the assessment.\n- \u25cf Approval procedures for entering into contracts\n- \u25cf Automated internal control over the output of error reports that indicate abnormal meter reading data that deviate from a certain range in comparison with the previous meter readings\n- \u25cf Verification procedures for error reports that indicate abnormal meter reading data\n- \u25cf Automated internal control over fee calculations based on contract details data, sales volume data, etc.\n- \u25cf Approval procedures for manually correcting the results of automated calculations\n- \u25cf Automated internal control over the accuracy and completeness of data linkage from the business processing system to the accounting system\n\nIn understanding the revenue recognition process, we prepare a process flow chart in order to clarify which areas have risk of material misstatement and whether the corresponding internal controls are designed.\n\n## (2) Substantive testing\n\n- \u25cf For Gas and Electricity Sales other than gas sales to large customers, we divided the population by categories of major rate plan options, developed independent estimates of sales for each category, and compared it with actual amounts.\n- \u25cf For gas sales to large customers, we developed independent estimates of sales for the entire amount and compared it with actual amounts.\n- \u25cf For gas sales to large customers, we identified customers who showed statistical outliers in the relationship between sales volume and sales unit prices, interviewed persons in charge, and inspected their contracts.\n- \u25cf We directly obtained response to the balance confirmation letters sent to the customers selected based on their monetary importance, using the balance of accounts receivable related to Gas and Electricity Sales as the population, and checked whether they matched book balances.\n\nResponsibilities of Management and Corporate Auditors and the Board of Corporate Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.\n\nCorporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors are responsible for overseeing the directors' performance of their duties including the design, implementation and maintenance of the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nand \u00a5246,162 million in the Domestic Energy/Electricity segment. They represented 84.3% of consolidated net sales. Of these, gas sales in the Domestic Energy/Gas segment and electricity sales excluding wholesale in the Domestic Energy/Electricity segment (hereinafter collectively referred to as 'Gas and Electricity Sales') are particularly important in terms of the number of transactions and the amount recorded.\n\nGas and Electricity Sales are calculated using contract details data based on contracts with customers, sales volume data based on meter reading data, etc. There is a risk of material misstatement regarding the accuracy of the recorded amounts in recording Gas and Electricity Sales, mainly due to the following reasons:\n\n- \u25cf The amount of each transaction is small, but the number of customers and contracts is very large, and the number of transactions processed is extremely large.\n- \u25cf The recorded amount is automatically calculated and aggregated by the business processing system and linked to the accounting system. Therefore, the recording process is highly dependent on automated internal controls of the business processing system.\n- \u25cf In the event that the contract details data, sales volume data, etc. are incorrect or the automatic calculation logic is incorrect, the impact could be far-reaching and have a significant impact on financial reporting due to the high degree of dependence on automated internal controls.\n\nWe, therefore, determined that our assessment of the accuracy of gas sales and electricity sales excluding wholesale was one of the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.\n\nWe communicate with corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on the Audit of the Internal Control Report\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe also have audited the accompanying internal control report of Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. as at March 31, 2021, in accordance with Article 193-2(2) of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying internal control report, which states that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as at March 31, 2021, presents fairly, in all material respects, the results of the assessments of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in Japan.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit of the internal control report in accordance with auditing standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Internal Control Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the internal control report in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Corporate Auditors and the Board of Corporate Auditors for the Internal Control Report\n\nManagement is responsible for the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of the internal control report in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in Japan.\n\nCorporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors are responsible for overseeing and examining the design and operation of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting may not completely prevent or detect financial statement misstatements.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Internal Control Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the internal control report is free from material misstatement based on our audit of the internal control report and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.\n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Perform procedures to obtain audit evidence about the results of the assessments of internal control over financial reporting in the internal control report. The procedures for the audit of the internal control report are selected and performed, depending on the auditor's judgment, based on significance of effect on the reliability of financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation of the internal control report, including the appropriateness of the scope, procedures and results of the assessments that management presents.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about the results of the assessments of internal control over financial reporting in the internal control report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the internal control report. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of our audit of the internal control report, the results thereof, material weaknesses in internal control identified during our audit of internal control report, and those that were remediated.\n\nWe also provide corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\n## Interest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan\n\nOur firm and its designated engagement partners do not have any interest in the Company and its subsidiaries which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan\n\n## Notes to the Reader of Audit Report:\n\nThe Independent Auditor's Report herein is the English translation of the Independent Auditor's Report as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.",
