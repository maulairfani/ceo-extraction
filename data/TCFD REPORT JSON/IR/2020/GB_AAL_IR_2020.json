to better connect precious resources in the ground to all of us who need and value them.\n\nAnd we are working together to develop better jobs, better education and better businesses, building brighter and healthier futures around our operations in our host countries and ultimately for billions of people around the world who depend on our products every day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Revenue                                     | Revenue                                     | Underlying EBITDA \u25ca   | Underlying EBITDA \u25ca   | Operating profit                               | Operating profit                               | Underlying earnings per share \u25ca    | Underlying earnings per share \u25ca    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| $30.9 bn                                    |                                             | $9.8 bn               |                       | $5.6 bn                                        |                                                | $2.53                              | $2.53                              |\n| 2020                                        | $30.9 bn                                    | 2020                  | $9.8 bn               | 2020                                           | $5.6 bn                                        | 2020                               | $2.53                              |\n| 2019                                        | $29.9 bn                                    | 2019                  | $10.0 bn              | 2019                                           | $6.2 bn                                        | 2019                               | $2.75                              |\n| Profit attributable to equity  shareholders | Profit attributable to equity  shareholders | Net debt \u25ca            | Net debt \u25ca            | Total dividends per share                      | Total dividends per share                      | Attributable free cash flow \u25ca      | Attributable free cash flow \u25ca      |\n| $2.1 bn                                     | $2.1 bn                                     | $5.6 bn               | $5.6 bn               | $1.00                                          | $1.00                                          | $1.2 bn                            | $1.2 bn                            |\n| 2020 $2.1 bn                                |                                             | 2020                  | $5.6 bn               | 2020                                           | $1.00 $1.09                                    | 2020                               | $1.2 bn                            |\n| 2019                                        | $3.5 bn                                     | 2019 $4.6 bn          | 2019 $4.6 bn          | 2019                                           |                                                | 2019                               | $2.3 bn                            |\n| Group attributable ROCE \u25ca                   | Group attributable ROCE \u25ca                   | Number of fatalities  | Number of fatalities  | Total recordable case   frequency rate (TRCFR) | Total recordable case   frequency rate (TRCFR) | Level 4-5 environmental  incidents | Level 4-5 environmental  incidents |\n| 17%                                         | 17%                                         | 2                     | 2                     | 2.14                                           | 2.14                                           | 0                                  | 0                                  |\n| 2020                                        | 17%                                         | 2020                  | 2                     | 2                                              | 2020 2.14                                      | 2020                               | 0                                  |\n| 2019                                        | 19%                                         | 2019                  | 4                     | 2019                                           | 2.21                                           | 2019                               | 0                                  |\n\nAlternative Performance Measures",

Additionally, we have compiled this report using the Guiding Principles and Content Elements set out in the International Integrated Reporting Council's <IR> Framework.\n\nIntegrated Reporting aims to demonstrate how companies create value sustainably over time, for a range of stakeholders - consistent with Anglo American's Purpose, business approach and strategy. This report, therefore, includes a comprehensive overview of our material matters, in the eyes of our stakeholders, and the impact these matters have on the value we create.\n\n## Measuring performance\n\nThroughout the Strategic Report we use a range of financial and non-financial measures to assess our performance. A number of the financial measures are not defined under IFRS so they are termed 'Alternative Performance Measures' (APMs). We have defined and explained the purpose of each of these measures on pages 246 to 250, where we provide more detail, including reconciliations to the closest equivalent measure under IFRS. These APMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with IFRS.\n\n## Units\n\n'Tonnes' are metric tons, 'Mt' denotes million tonnes, 'kt' denotes thousand tonnes, 'Mct' denotes million carats and 'koz' denotes thousand ounces; '$' and 'dollars' denote US dollars and 'cents' denotes US cents.\n\n## Forward-looking statements and third-party information\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements and third-party information. For information regarding forward-looking statements please refer to the IBC of this document.\n\n## Non-Financial Information Statement\n\nWe aim to comply with the Non-Financial Reporting requirements contained in sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006. The table on page 96 is intended to guide stakeholders to where the relevant non-financial information is included within our Strategic Report. Further information on the basis of preparation of our non-financial information can be found in our Sustainability Report 2020. Non-financial information in this report includes subsidiaries and joint operations over which the Anglo American Group has management or acts as operator. It does not include independently managed operations, such as Cerrej\u00f3n, Collahuasi and Samancor unless specifically stipulated where there have been significant incidents. It also excludes De Beers' non-managed joint operations in Namibia and Botswana.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n@angloamerican\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contents\n\n## Strategic Report\n\n02 Our business at a glance\n\n- 04  Chairman's statement\n- 06  Chief Executive's statement\n- 08  Purpose to Value\n- 10 Our Business Model\n- 12 How we make decisions\n\n13 Understanding our stakeholders\n\n- 14 Our material matters\n- 16 Looking at global trends\n- 18 Reflecting stakeholder views in our Board decision-making\n- 19 Key decisions made in 2020\n- 20 Portfolio\n- 28 Innovation\n- 42 People\n- 50  Capital allocation\n- 52 Managing risk e/ffectively\n- 58 Key performance indicators\n- 60  Marketplace review\n- 62 Group financial review\n\n66\n\nDe Beers\n\n70 Copper\n\n74 Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)\n\n78\n\nIron Ore\n\n82\n\nCoal\n\n- 89 Nickel and Manganese\n- 93 Crop Nutrients\n- 95 Corporate and other\n- 96 Non-financial information table and footnotes\n\n## Governance\n\n98\n\nChairman's introduction\n\n100  Directors\n\n104  Executive management\n\n106  Board roles and responsibilities\n\n108  Board operations\n\n110  Board activity\n\n112\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\n114\n\nSustainability Committee report\n\n115 Nomination Committee report\n\n116\n\nAudit Committee report\n\n123  Directors' remuneration report\n\n123  Remuneration Committee\n\n129  Directors' remuneration policy\n\n133  Annual report on directors' remuneration\n\n148  Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\n148  Responsibility statement\n\n## Financial statements\n\n150  Independent\n\nauditors' report\n\n158  Primary statements\n\n162  Notes to the financial statements\n\n232  Financial statements of the Parent Company\n\n235  Summary by operation\n\n- 237  Key financial data\n- 238  Exchange rates and commodity prices\n\n## Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources\n\n240 Estimated Ore Reserves\n\n242  Estimated Mineral\n\nResources\n\n## Other information\n\n244  Glossary of terms\n\n246  Alternative performance measures\n\n251  Production statistics\n\n254  Quarterly production statistics\n\n255  Non-financial data\n\n257  Disclosures related to the recommendations of the TCFD\n\n258  Directors' report\n\n262  Shareholder information\n\nIBC  Other Anglo American publications and legal disclaimers",

Across Anglo American, our employees made an exemplary e/ffort in 2020 to not only safeguard each other and those in our local communities, but to ensure our presence continues to benefit society.'\n\nStuart Chambers Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Re-imagining mining to\n\nIn an extraordinarily challenging year, Anglo American demonstrated its resilience and agility, protecting our employees and communities, sustaining operations and progressing our major capital projects. At the same time, we set ourselves demanding carbon neutrality targets, the pathway to which is enabled through innovative technologies that are playing a vital role in helping the company live up to its Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives .\n\n## WeCare - our response to Covid-19\n\nAs the global health emergency became clear, Anglo American acted quickly to help protect our workforce from the spread of Covid-19. Across the business, we implemented all the appropriate health, hygiene and distancing measures to keep our people safe and well, while maintaining the security and integrity of our operations to ensure unimpeded economic activity for our supply chain and flow of essential products to our customers.\n\nWe provided extensive support for our more than 95,000 employees and contractors throughout the various lockdown periods, ensuring that everyone was able to focus on their health and safety, and those of their families. We also rolled out a global health awareness and support programme called WeCare, specifically to protect the physical and mental health, well-being, and livelihoods of our employees and host communities.\n\nRecognising the vital role we play in so many, often remote, communities close to our operations, we engaged with those communities, as well as government agencies, to make sure we could continue to provide and extend a wide range of essential services and equipment, both during the pandemic and into the vital economic recovery phase. From the provision of water, electricity, housing and food, to support for teachers, students and small business, as well as additional hospital facilities, beds, medical equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE),\n\nAnglo American has stepped up and will continue to do the right thing.\n\n## Safety\n\nLockdowns in certain countries put additional pressure on our mining operations as they went through the phases of temporary shut-downs and the subsequent re-opening and ramp-up of operations. Such changes pose particular safety risks, and it is testimony to our safety systems and processes that Anglo American achieved its best ever levels of safety performance in 2020. I am, however, very saddened to report that two people died in work-related incidents at our operations during the year, in South Africa. Additionally, three people also died in operations that we do not manage. In spite of recording the lowest number of fatal incidents, a single fatality is always too many.\n\nSafety is always uppermost on the Board's agenda and I am encouraged that our Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce is making headway in raising our safety performance. The Taskforce's learnings are informing a more complete understanding of the causes of serious incidents and are helping us to prioritise actions to eliminate risk at, and in travelling to and from, the workplace.\n\n## Sustainable mining\n\nWhen a phenomenon such as Covid-19 takes over our lives, it is easy to relegate other matters to a background role. Climate change is unquestionably the enduring issue of our age and Anglo American has a clear role to play, both in how we conduct our business and the many metals and minerals we produce that themselves enable a low carbon economy.\n\nAnglo American set itself ambitious sustainability targets in 2018, embedded in our Sustainable Mining Plan. Aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the plan's three pillars of a Healthy Environment, Thriving Communities , and Trusted Corporate Leader map to the much-used 'ESG' acronym.

Certain of the physical processes of mining are giving way to automated equipment that keeps people safely away from the rockface; dry stacking can replace conventional wet tailings facilities; renewables are replacing carbon-generated energy; and we are embracing circular economy principles. We are also playing our part in developing the hydrogen economy, including through investments to use platinum group metals as the catalyst for new generations of hydrogen electric transport.\n\n## Portfolio and performance\n\nAnglo American performed well in 2020, particularly in the less disrupted second half of the year. The commendable resurgence in performance led by Mark Cutifani since he became chief executive continued. Based on the more normalised second half of 2020, a significantly improved portfolio of half the number of assets is today producing 6% more product on a copper-equivalent basis, with production per employee more than doubling.\n\nAnglo American today has one of the most compelling growth profiles in the industry, with considerable optionality, across a truly\n\nof countries. What remains clear, however, is that the products of mining continue to benefit from strong supply and demand fundamentals, enhanced in many cases by the necessary drive towards global decarbonisation and broad-based consumer demand. While prices for many asset classes will likely continue to fluctuate, I am confident that the trajectory for our business is positive.\n\n## Governance\n\nMining companies often operate in remote areas where our presence can significantly impact the socio-economic environment. We are committed to ensure that what we do is beneficial both during the life of a mine, and that we leave a positive and enduring legacy for our workforce and host communities long after the mine gates close.\n\nIt is not surprising - and indeed we welcome the fact - that expectations of mining companies are being raised. This has long been the case on the ground, of course, and is also now reflected in the capital being invested in funds that are increasingly applying stringent ESG performance criteria. We engage extensively with our current and potential investors on such matters, including in the important work to determine a transparent and consistent approach to measuring such performance.\n\nOur employees also provide the Board with their perspectives. Our Global Workplace Advisory Panel, comprising 12 employees drawn from across our business, and chaired by our senior independent director Byron Grote, held two virtual meetings during the year. Set up in 2019, the panel is proving valuable in promoting understanding of the concerns of employees and directors alike.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndiversified mix of metals and minerals for which we see attractive market dynamics. Many of those products are the essential raw materials needed for a cleaner, greener world, as well as to cater to the consumer demands of the world's fast-growing population.\n\nCentral to that volume growth, our new Quellaveco copper mine in Peru will boost our supply of one of the modern world's most needed energy transition metals, while the Woodsmith crop nutrients project in the UK, which we acquired in March, diversifies our portfolio further with a large multi-nutrient fertiliser orebody that will o/ffer a low carbon alternative to many other fertilisers. Both of these projects are progressing well. The business is also progressing its exit from its remaining thermal coal operations in South Africa, likely via a demerger.\n\nAnglo American continues to generate healthy cash flows that we are using to re-invest in our business and deliver sustainable cash returns to shareholders. In 2020, the benefits of strong prices for certain products and operational performance in the latter months were o/ffset by Covid-related and other operational disruptions in the first half. For the year, revenue increased by 3% to $31 billion, and underlying EBITDA decreased by 2% to $9.8 billion. Profit attributable to equity shareholders was lower at $2.1 billion.\n\nThe Board has recommended a final dividend of 72 cents per share, bringing our total dividends for the year to $1.00 per share, in line with our 40% of underlying earnings payout policy. This payment will bring our total cash return to shareholders to $6.1 billion since mid-2017. I am pleased to see that Anglo American's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for the year was 16.2%, second among the UK-listed majors, against the FTSE 100 at (11.4)% and the FTSE 350 mining index at 19.6%.\n\n## A volatile global economy\n\n2020 saw volatility across world markets, in part due to fear and uncertainty and also driven by protectionist behaviour in a number\n\n## Our Board\n\nBoards must reflect an appropriate mix of skills, experience and diversity - and we continue to refresh the Board as a whole as tenures come to an end and to suit the business that we govern. Succession planning for both the non-executive and executive directors is a critical and ongoing cycle of work.\n\nAs part of that continuous renewal, there were several nonexecutive director changes in 2020 and into 2021: on 1 January 2020, Nonkululeko Nyembezi joined the Board. Following the conclusion of the AGM on 5 May, Dr Mphu Ramatlapeng stepped down after almost seven years. Jim Rutherford also stepped down on 31 December, after seven years. Elisabeth Brinton will join the Board on 1 March 2021 and Hilary Maxson will join the Board on 1 June 2021.\n\nIn 2020, great care was taken to assure continuity in the Board's proceedings. A full schedule of meetings, including those of the Board's committees, was held as planned, albeit in a virtual environment. More information on the Board's discussions and decision-making can be found on pages 110 and 111.\n\n## Thanks\n\nI would like to thank all our employees, the senior management team and our Board for their adaptability and resilience and their unremitting e/fforts in helping drive our business forward in accordance with our Purpose and Values.\n\n## Our Strategic Report\n\nOur 2020 Strategic Report, from pages 2 to 96, was reviewed and approved by the Board on 24 February 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStuart Chambers\n\nChairman",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's statement\n\nIn 2020, we saw much of the world tested to its limits. In dealing with the pandemic, I am immensely proud of how our team of more than 95,000 people across Anglo American pulled together to do what's right for each other, for our many stakeholders across society and for the business.\n\nWe showed considerable speed, agility and resilience in helping to keep people and communities safe while supporting business continuity. Our global WeCare response programme is centred around our employees and our host communities - working to protect both physical health and mental health; and to support many aspects of lives and livelihoods in our host communities.\n\nWe worked with host governments and communities to build on our already extensive role in the often remote rural areas where we operate. From the supply of energy and water, to schools, healthcare, and the basic economic engine that supports many local businesses, we have stood in partnership and done the right thing with those who need us most. Looking at the full year, never have we felt more committed to our Values, or guided by our Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives .\n\n## Safety\n\nThe safety of every individual is always front of mind. While our safety performance has been completely transformed over the last seven years, we are not yet where we need to be.\n\nOur determination to achieve zero harm is our most pressing challenge. Making sure every employee returns home safely at the end of each day drives our thinking and behaviours across the business. It is with this mindset that we have reduced fatal incidents by 87% since 2013. However, we still experience serious safety incidents - such as the gas ignition at Grosvenor in May in which five colleagues were seriously injured - as well as fatal incidents. In 2020, and after eight fatality-free months at our managed operations, two people lost their lives at work, one in each of our PGMs and thermal coal businesses in South Africa.\n\nWe are unconditional about safety and every loss of life is tragic. We will not rest until zero harm is achieved and sustained across our business. We have shown it can be done for long stretches of time and now we must make it permanent. Our focus on elimination of fatal incidents also extends to our non-managed operations, where three losses of life in PGMs joint operations were reported.\n\nIn recognising material progress, the Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce that we launched in 2018 has been central to our improvement and is being stepped up in our quest for zero harm. In 2020, we recorded another important step with an all-time-low total recordable safety rate, being a 60% improvement since 2013.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for the year of $9.8 billion, a 2% decrease, recognised the e/ffects of the early months of the pandemic and operational disruptions at our Grosvenor mine and in our PGMs business, mitigated by second half production recovery and the increasingly strong price environment for iron ore, copper and PGMs in the last few months of the year.\n\nDespite 10% lower total production volumes, we increased our mining EBITDA margin \u25ca to 43%, supported by solid cost control, a strong contribution from Marketing and price strength in many of our products. Operating profit decreased by 9% to $5.6 billion, with profit attributable to equity shareholders amounting to $2.1 billion, a 41% decrease.\n\nWe generated attributable free cash flow of $1.2 billion, a 47% decrease, due largely to a temporary increase of working capital and our investments in the business. Our return on capital employed of 17% was above our targeted 15% through-the-cycle return.\n\nWe are resolutely committed to capital allocation discipline and to maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. At the end of 2020, net debt of $5.6 billion, or 0.6 x underlying EBITDA, reflects the growth investments we are making, largely o/ffset by strong cash flow in the second half of the year.\n\nCombined with the proposed final dividend payment of 72 cents per share, total dividends paid to shareholders in respect of 2020 will amount to $1.00 per share, in line with our policy of paying out 40% of underlying earnings. Anglo American will, by May 2021, have returned $6.1 billion to shareholders since mid-2017. On a relative basis, our strong TSR for 2020 of 16.2% significantly outperformed the FTSE 100 index which saw a negative return of (11.4)%.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nWe continue to deliver material business improvements, building upon the stable platform provided by our Operating Model - raising e/fficiency and productivity - our invigorated marketing approach, and through the deployment of FutureSmart Mining \u2122 .\n\nWe have increased our mining EBITDA margin from 30% in 2012 to 43%, despite a lower commodity price basket, and we are heading towards our longer term target of 45-50% through our balanced investments in business improvement, technology and quality growth. Since 2013, we have delivered and embedded substantial underlying improvement and we are on track to deliver our targeted $3-4 billion annual run-rate of improvement over the five-year period to 2022. Combined with growth project delivery, we are also benefiting from a suite of technologies and digital approaches, integrated with our Sustainable Mining Plan, that are providing the step-changes to how we mine, process and market our products, while also minimising our environmental footprint.\n\n## Strategy: Portfolio\n\nOur diversified portfolio provides us with a well sequenced range of high-return growth options. During the year, we have continued to shape our portfolio around products that support a low carbon economy and consumer demand - from everyday essentials to luxury.\n\nWe are still on track to deliver first copper production from the new Quellaveco mine in Peru during 2022. Our addition of the Woodsmith crop nutrients project in the UK, as we progress towards exiting our remaining thermal coal operations in South Africa, exemplifies our approach towards upgrading the overall quality and long term resilience of the business.\n\nOur commitment to the responsible production of premium quality metals and minerals tailored to customers' requirements is well aligned with the rapidly evolving needs of a consumer-driven world and its growing population. And the transition to a greener, decarbonised world is focusing e/fforts to deliver the full promise of renewable energy and zero emission transport - again supported by our suite of base and precious metals and our pioneering work to help realise the potential of hydrogen for transport and integrated clean energy systems.\n\n## Strategy: Innovation\n\nIn tune with our Purpose, we have set out a very di/fferent future for mining. Broad innovative thinking, enabling technologies, and collaborative partnerships are coming together to shape an industry that is safer, more sustainable and e/fficient, and",

FutureSmart Mining \u2122 is key to achieving this milestone. We are applying technologies that more precisely target the desired metals or minerals, requiring less water, energy and capital intensity, and producing less waste in the process. In parallel, we are digitising at pace, transforming data into predictive intelligence, leading towards safer, systemised and self-learning operations.\n\nThe tools and processes we have today will not take us all the way to carbon neutrality - which is why new energy technologies, including hydrogen, will play a crucial role. In a first for our industry, we will trial a hydrogen fuel cell haul truck at our Mogalakwena PGMs mine in South Africa later this year, proving up a technology that can drastically reduce diesel emissions from mines all over the world.\n\nAlthough many of our Scope 1 and 2 environmental targets rely on the technologies we are deploying, we are also evaluating partnerships with our customers, particularly in the steelmaking industry, to help address our Scope 3 emissions, identifying shared ambitions to reduce emissions by making best use of our respective capabilities.\n\nPartnerships built on trust are key to so many aspects of our industry. Our work with development experts to help create diversified and sustainable economic activity - such as the Impact Catalyst initiative in Limpopo Province in South Africa - is a tangible example of our approach in action.\n\n## Strategy: People\n\nWe say 'people are the business'. Our people are a major di/fferentiator of our business and they are the engine behind everything we do. We strive to create safe, inclusive and diverse working environments that encourage high performance and\n\ninnovative thinking. Engaging with our people and building a team-based culture is a priority for every leader, making sure that every person has what they need to give their very best and feel safe and supported. In addition to traditional surveys to identify areas where, for example, we need to do more to ensure that colleagues feel cared for and respected, we have now deployed an app for all employees, which will be invaluable for both outbound communication and inbound feedback.\n\nAs part of our e/fforts to both listen to employees and for their insights to be heard and considered by the Board, our Global Workforce Advisory Panel met remotely twice during 2020. The panel is made up of employee representatives from across our business, is chaired by our senior independent director, Byron Grote, and has provided invaluable perspectives to the Board's deliberations on culture and the e/ffectiveness of the management team in building an engaging workplace and motivated workforce.\n\nIt is our people who are responsible for delivering our performance, who engage with our stakeholders across the board, and who are unlocking our full potential. I thank them all.\n\n## Mining with purpose\n\nReflecting on Anglo American today, I see a continuously improving business, building resilience and delivering competitive results, and well positioned to meet the high expectations of our full breadth of business and societal stakeholders.\n\nThis is also a purposeful business, with strong values. Looking ahead, we all have a responsibility to work together to help rebuild economies and protect our natural world. To those ends, many of the products of mining play an ever more essential role in improving people's lives, integral to which is making our planet a healthier place. Mining has a safer, smarter future, supporting modern life, and doing so sustainably. That is the future we are all working towards.\n\nMark Cutifani Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 96 for footnotes.",

The consultation process in 2020 included an integrated materiality analysis that took place in tandem with\n\nthe comprehensive sustainability materiality process that is carried out every three years. The process was led by a third party and incorporated in-depth interviews with a range of internal and external stakeholders, in addition to extensive desktop research. Following the stakeholder interviews, a third-party-led validation workshop took place where subject matter experts from across the Group were asked to validate and prioritise the matters identified as most material to Anglo American. The final list was then approved by the Group's leadership and the Board.\n\nDesktop review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLong list of potential material topics validated with internal subject matter experts\n\n## Prioritised internal stakeholder selection\n\nMarket areas Geographic zones Internal business functions Senior leaders\n\n## External stakeholder selection\n\nCustomers\n\nPartners\n\nEmployees\n\nLocal community representatives\n\nSuppliers\n\nNGOs\n\nGovernment and policymakers\n\nDevelopment banks and advocacy organisations\n\nInvestors\n\nInterviews with internal and external stakeholders to prioritise list of material matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValidation workshop with senior leadership to finalise the prioritised list of material matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaterial matters reviewed and approved by executive management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaterial matters reviewed and approved by Board\n\n## Material matters in 2020\n\nThe matters identified through our materiality process were naturally numerous and wide-ranging. In order for us to report against these material matters e/ffectively and demonstrate how they a/ffect the delivery of our strategy, we have set them out under the headings listed in the table opposite. The global pandemic that emerged in early 2020 featured throughout the stakeholder discussions and the desktop research, and we have therefore not sought to categorise it in the table, but instead recognise its impact across many aspects of our business throughout this report.\n\nEach material matter covers a number of topics and issues, and some also intersect with specific principal risks facing the Group, as identified in the Group Risk Register. Principal risks are those risks, or combination of risks, that would threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity of Anglo American and are shown with the following symbol (\u2021). An analysis of the Group's principal risks, including mitigation strategies, can be found on pages 54-57 of this report. All topics shown in the table opposite are considered important by our stakeholders and by the Group, with those topics considered of the highest importance and most material highlighted in bold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther analysis of our materiality process can be found on the\n\nAnglo American plc website\n\nwww.angloamerican.com/sustainability/approach-and-policies",

We recognise that  the end of a mine's operational life is far from being the end of its social  and environmental impact and we work to ensure we close mines in  a way that leaves a positive, healthy and sustainable legacy. The  monitoring and management of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) and of  water consumption and discharge are not only a major factor in legal  compliance and permitting, but also play a significant role in improving                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Occupational safety and health\u2021 ;  responsible mine closure and  divestment; and  mineral residue  management (tailings)\u2021                                                                                                                                               | Strategic elements  Pillars of value 1 2 3                    |\n| Tackling climate  change                     | Climate change has become the great defining issue of our time, and  understanding its e/ffects on our business and how they may impact our  value chain is vital if we are to optimise the opportunities associated  with the transition to a low carbon future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | GHG emissions\u2021; energy\u2021; and   the impact of climate change on   Anglo American\u2021                                                                                                                                                                                        | Strategic elements Pillars of value 1 2                       |\n| Protecting our natural  environment          | We are stewards of the land and ecosystems around our operations.

Our high quality portfolio of assets, relentless approach to innovation, and talented people - combined with our business decisions aligned to our Purpose - set us up to take advantage of commercial and other opportunities, thereby unlocking our full potential for sustainable value creation.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\n## Looking at global trends\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Moving towards a cleaner world\n\n## What is it?\n\nGiven concerns over the e/ffects of climate change and air quality, many countries are working to curb greenhouse gases and other harmful emissions.\n\nThe global response includes a transition towards lower emissions from transport and energy generation, two of the largest carbon-emitting sectors. Additionally, many countries are tightening air quality standards for other harmful emissions.\n\n## What does it mean for our industry?\n\nAn accelerating trend towards the adoption of renewable energy generation. This will likely generate additional demand for copper and the steelmaking ingredients of iron ore and metallurgical coal to build such generation and transmission infrastructure.\n\nIn transport, there is an ongoing shift towards the use of electric vehicles (EVs). Batteries and fuel cells are the likely powertrains for EVs and both have the potential to create additional demand for a range of metals, including PGMs, copper, nickel and manganese.\n\nIn parallel, tightening air quality standards for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles require more PGMs in catalytic converters to remove noxious gases.\n\n## Delivering value through our strategy\n\nWe mine many of the metals and minerals that are essential to enabling the transition to a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world. In addition to the use of PGMs in ICE vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells, copper is used in EVs and renewable energy generation, and nickel in EV batteries.\n\nIn South America in particular, we are investing in renewable energy facilities and committing to source more of our energy from renewables, helping to lower our emissions. We are also developing a hydrogen powered fuel cell haul truck fleet at our Mogalakwena PGMs mine in South Africa.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to provide the niche steelmaking products they require to achieve their environmental goals, including lump and high quality iron ore from Kumba; low impurity iron ore pellet feed from Minas-Rio; and high quality hard coking coal from our metallurgical coal mines in Australia.\n\nSeveral of the technologies we are implementing through our FutureSmart Mining\u2122 programme play a part in helping us achieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040, as well as our nearer term GHG emissions reduction target of 30% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more on our Portfolio\n\nSee pages 20-27\n\n- For more on Innovation\n- See pages 28-41\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Emerging wealth - changing demographics\n\n## What is it?\n\nA number of developing countries, particularly China, have experienced a period of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation over the past two decades, resulting in an unprecedented number of households entering the wealthier middle class.\n\nSeveral countries and regions are expected to experience greater economic maturity in the decades ahead, particularly India, south east Asia and South America, as well as Africa.\n\n## What does it mean for our industry?\n\nAs economies develop, so the need for greater infrastructure (e.g. housing and transport) grows, resulting in increased demand for steel and many base metals. Likewise, as disposable incomes increase, so the demand for metals that are used in consumer goods (e.g. copper, nickel and manganese) will increase.\n\nAnd as purchasing power increases, so too does the appetite for luxury goods and services. Demand for consumer-facing luxury products, such as those that use diamonds and PGMs, is expected to increase.\n\n## Delivering value through our strategy\n\nAnglo American has a diversified product portfolio, increasingly tilted towards products that enable economic development and serve the needs of the expanding global consumer class.\n\nWe have exposure to some of the largest resource bases in both PGMs and diamonds. We also have world class copper resources in Los Bronces and Collahuasi, as well as the Quellaveco copper project in Peru. We have exposure to nickel through Barro Alto and Codemin, and as a by-product of our PGMs mines. And our premium quality iron ore and metallurgical coal resources are well placed to support demand for cleaner steelmaking.\n\nOur innovative market development and investment programmes aim to stimulate demand for our products, including, in particular, PGMs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more on our Portfolio\n\nSee pages 20-27\n\n- For more on Innovation See pages 28-41",

Evolving societal and regulatory expectations\n\n## What are they?\n\nGovernments in countries where mining is a material source of national revenue are under pressure to increase their share of the benefits from mining, while not deterring much-needed private sector investment.\n\nMining companies are also facing greater demands and expectations from diverse stakeholder groups, with often competing interests.\n\n## What does it mean for our industry?\n\nThere is a greater required responsibility for mining companies to support local communities and regions as part of their social licence to operate.\n\nThere is also an increased emphasis on sustainable mining practices in order to minimise the environmental impact of mining on local areas, as well as the wider region.\n\nThe uncertain regulatory environment in some countries, along with pressure from those countries to tighten regulatory legislation, can lead to delays in licensing and permitting and higher taxes and royalties, all of which can deter investment in those countries.\n\n## Delivering value through our strategy\n\nAs a trusted corporate leader, striving to create a healthy environment, and helping to sustain thriving communities, we help alleviate and solve some of these challenges facing the industry.\n\nOur innovation-led pathway to sustainable mining - FutureSmart Mining\u2122 - and within it our Sustainable Mining Plan - is designed to help meet society's expectations about the physical nature of mining, as well as to work with governments to advocate for progressive regulatory frameworks that encourage and support investment in modern mining.\n\nOur Operating Model and P101 programme are designed to put us at the forefront of best-inclass performance - o/ffering insulation from price and other volatility by placing us at the low end of the industry cost curves.\n\n- For more on Innovation\n\nSee pages 28-41\n\n- For more on Capital allocation See pages 50-51\n\n## 5. The circular economy\n\n## What is it?\n\nOn some projections, more than 2 billion consumers could join the global middle class by 2030. One of the great challenges society faces is ensuring su/fficient resources to meet their rising demands while maintaining a sustainable environmental footprint.\n\nAs a result, there is a growing urgency and opportunity to increase the e/fficiency and use of resources.\n\n## What does it mean for our industry?\n\nThe mining industry has the opportunity to play a role in redefining the economy towards a more sustainable path. This includes an industry drive to balance activity between resource extraction and resource management to ensure that appropriate raw materials are available, either through production or recycling.\n\n## Delivering value through our strategy\n\nWe have long embraced circular economy principles across our business. Many of our technologies are designed specifically to reduce water and energy usage, and waste, and to promote a more e/fficient uptake of resources at our mine sites.\n\nOur participation across the value chain allows us to apply our innovations in technology and sustainability more widely, for example looking beyond only upstream production to examine other opportunities elsewhere in the value chains in which we participate, including downstream. Our approach to circular economic principles is being augmented by our marketing initiatives which are maximising the value from our mineral resources, for example by customer-specific blending and smart logistics planning.\n\n- For more on Innovation See pages 28-41\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. A more challenging physical environment for mining\n\n## What is it?\n\nMaintaining long term supply for some metals and minerals is becoming ever more di/fficult for a number of reasons, including:\n\n- -  Availability of both water and energy\n- -  Declining ore grades\n- -  Increasing infrastructure costs as mines are built in more remote locations\n- -  The shift to underground mining as easy to access near-surface orebodies become depleted.\n\n## What does it mean for our industry?\n\nThe factors described above are contributing to increasing resource scarcity. While increasing demand in a time of resource scarcity provides an opportunity, this scarcity also contributes to structural upward cost pressure across the mining industry.\n\nConsequently, mining companies need to reduce costs and improve productivity. Technological innovation and operational improvements are likely to be critical to achieving sustainable cost and productivity improvements and the ability to meet demand over the long term.\n\n## Delivering value through our strategy\n\nThe technologies we are deploying and our holistic approach to sustainability will begin to address society's rightful expectations about water and energy consumption.\n\nIn recent years, Anglo American has upgraded the quality of its portfolio and is now operating a suite of high quality, long life, high margin assets across structurally attractive markets.\n\nFutureSmart Mining\u2122 uses innovative mining methods and technologies to overcome challenges of water, lower grades and energy constraints and reduce capital intensity and operating costs. Mining is also becoming a less hazardous activity as we deploy new technologies to keep our people out of harm's way.\n\nOur Discovery strategy enables us to discover superior-value deposits that have the potential to enhance the production profile and competitive position of the Group over time, and which play a vital part in delivering a sustainable future.\n\n- For more on Innovation See pages 28-41",

We work together to provide our people with better jobs, a better education and better businesses, and we are building brighter and healthier futures around our operations, in our host countries and ultimately for billions of people around the world who depend on our products every day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Values\n\nSafety; Care and Respect; Integrity; Accountability; Collaboration; and Innovation guide our behaviour and shape our culture, and are fundamental to creating enduring benefit for all our employees, shareholders, and stakeholders in a way that demonstrably improves people's lives.\n\n## Understanding our employees\n\nOur people are critical to everything we do. We create safe, inclusive and diverse working environments that encourage and support high performance and innovative thinking. We are acutely aware that to get the best from our people, we need to understand their viewpoints and address any concerns they may raise about working for us.\n\nWe consider workforce engagement to be a priority for every leader at Anglo American and run regular surveys to identify areas where, for example, we need to do more to ensure that colleagues feel cared for and respected. In 2019, we established a Global Workforce Advisory Panel, with the intention of giving employees more of a voice in the boardroom so their views can be better understood and considered when decisions are being made about the future of the business. In 2020, the panel managed to meet twice, albeit remotely, and the panel chair, our senior independent director, Byron Grote, shared the key messages from those meetings with the Board. The People and Governance sections of this report provide more detail on these engagements and explain the resultant outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nSee page 112\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Section 172 statement\n\nThe Anglo American plc Board is cognisant of its legal duty to act in good faith and to promote the success of the Group for the benefit of its shareholders and with regard to the interests of a broad range of stakeholders. These include the likely consequences of any decisions we make over di/fferent time horizons; the need to foster the relationships we have with all our stakeholders; the interests of our employees; the impact our operations have on the environment and local communities; and the desire to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct. New directors appointed to the Board in 2020 received tailored, individual briefings on these duties, and the Board received updates in 2020.\n\nAs a major global mining company, the Board understands that our wide range of stakeholders (identified on page 13) is integral to the sustainability of our business, underpinning our licence to operate. In addition, the Board is conscious that expectations around our performance and contribution to society - from local to global - are both diverse and continuously evolving.\n\nBy listening to, understanding and engaging with our stakeholders, the Board endeavours to live up to their expectations, by staying true to our Purpose, acting in accordance with our Values, and delivering our strategy.\n\nStakeholder considerations are integral to the discussions at Board meetings and the decisions we make take into account any potential impacts on them and the environment. Like any business, we are aware that some of the decisions we make may have an adverse impact on certain stakeholders.\n\nIn 2018, the Board approved, and is holding management to account for, our Sustainable Mining Plan - a key component of our FutureSmart Mining \u2122 programme. We are committed to a series of ambitious medium and longer term goals that are aligned to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. These goals are designed to make a comprehensive and lasting contribution that we expect will positively transform how our stakeholders experience our business.\n\nThe Board and its committees took a broad range of factors and stakeholder considerations into account when making decisions in the year. Decisions are made within the context of the long term factors that may impact the Group, including key competitive trends and disruptions; technology capability; and climate change considerations. For more detail on Board activity in the year, see pages 110-111. For more on the global trends that influence the mining industry and our business, see pages 16-17, and for more on our approach to climate change, see page 37. A summary of some of the key decisions made by the Board during the year is to be found on page 19.\n\nThe Board (through its Sustainability Committee) monitors progress towards our Sustainable Mining Plan targets and how these may a/ffect future decision-making.",

The Board considered the company's strategic response to the Covid-19 crisis, recognising its duty to its shareholders, employees and broader stakeholders to protect the continuity of the business, and ensure the business played its part in supporting economic recovery. The Board's Sustainability Committee considered the Group's WeCare response, created specifically to protect the physical and mental health, well-being and livelihoods of our employees and host communities, in detail at each of the Committee meetings held in the year.\n\n- For more information on our WeCare programme See pages 44-45\n- For more on the Sustainability Committee See page 114\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our pathway to carbon neutrality\n\nAnglo American's Purpose, re-imagining mining to improve people's lives , is at the heart of everything we do. Guided by our Values and our business strategy, we are committed to playing our part in tackling climate change. Why? Because it is the right thing for the long term sustainability of our business, and for society. The Board's Sustainability Committee has been actively involved in reviewing and approving Anglo American's energy e/fficiency targets, as well as our target to achieve carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040, with eight sites reaching carbon neutrality by 2030. The Board is aware of, and is committed to, the investment in technological innovations and the ongoing improvement of our portfolio that will be required to achieve our demanding carbon neutrality targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our approach to climate change See page 37\n- For more information on the structure of our portfolio See pages 20-27\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc\n\nIn January 2020, the Board approved the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc and the Group is making good progress in developing the Woodsmith project in the north east of England. The project will access the world's largest known deposit of polyhalite, a natural mineral fertiliser product containing four of the six nutrients that every plant needs to grow. Once Woodsmith is operational, the introduction of polyhalite, with a low carbon footprint and certified for organic use, aligns well with our portfolio trajectory towards those products that enable a low carbon economy and support global consumer demand - in this case, for food. The Board considered the strategic rationale and investment case, valuation and funding considerations, and stakeholder considerations, and believed the acquisition to be in the best interests of all Anglo American's stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the\n\nWoodsmith project\n\nSee pages 22-23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Payment of the dividend\n\nOur commitment to a sustainable base dividend stands firm as a critical part of Anglo American's overall approach to capital allocation. Our dividend policy is for a 40% payout of underlying earnings, paid each half year. Despite the disruption and volatile macro-economic environment caused by Covid-19, the resilience of our business - built upon the stability of our Operating Model and through the deployment of FutureSmart Mining \u2122 , coupled with our strong balance sheet, gave the Board confidence to approve the payment of an interim dividend and recommend a final dividend payment of 72 cents per share in respect of the 2020 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on our approach to capital allocation See pages 50-51",

The ore will be granulated to produce POLY4, a premium quality organic fertiliser which will be exported to global markets to help meet the world's ever growing demand for food.\n\n## Meeting the world's\n\nA fast growing global population requires increasing amounts of food from decreasing available land. More e/fficient, e/ffective and sustainable farming methods and fertilisers must be found.\n\nThrough the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc, Anglo American's Crop Nutrients business can play an important role, as well as accelerating the Group's transition towards products that support the world's burgeoning population and a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world - very much aligned with the company's Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives .\n\nThe Woodsmith project will produce polyhalite, a naturally occurring mineral containing potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium, four of the six key nutrients required for plant growth. It will be sold as POLY4 - a premium quality, low carbon, multi-nutrient fertiliser certified for organic use. POLY4 - which has a 90% lower carbon footprint than traditional fertilisers - can be used as a low-chloride alternative to (and for blending with) traditional fertiliser products and is particularly valuable for high value crops, such as tea, co/ffee, beans, potatoes, and many fruits and vegetables.\n\n## 'Over the next 35 years, more food will need to be produced than has been to date in human history.'\n\nProfessor Tim Benton University of Leeds\n\n## Woodsmith project\n\nWoodsmith o/ffers all the qualities of a Tier 1 mining asset in terms of scale, potential mine life and operating cost profile, as well as product quality. It will mine the world's currently largest-known high grade polyhalite deposit, with reported Ore Reserves of 290 million tonnes at a grade of 88.8% polyhalite and substantial Mineral Resources (see Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020 for full details).\n\nDespite the impacts of Covid-19, the planned works for 2020 were delivered safely and on schedule.

Within its portfolio, De Beers (Anglo American: 85% interest), in partnership with the Government of the Republic of Botswana, has one of the richest diamond mines in the world at Jwaneng, and one of the largest resources, in terms of total carats, at Orapa.\n\nDe Beers' major diamond mining assets have large, long life and scalable resources and we are continuing to invest in the existing operations to extend mining activities. The Cut-9 expansion of Jwaneng will extend the life of the mine by increasing its depth to 800 metres; in Namibia an additional custom-built diamond mining vessel is under construction; and, in South Africa, Venetia is transitioning to an underground operation, extending the life of mine to 2045.\n\nThe lack of significant kimberlite discoveries globally over recent years, combined with the ongoing trend of growth in consumer demand for diamond jewellery in both mature and developing markets, points to good prospects for the diamond business. The addition of the Chidliak Diamond Resource in Canada, and the continued investment in diamond mining support technologies, will enhance De Beers' portfolio of high quality and high margin assets and the ability of the business to flex production to prevailing demand.\n\nThrough its di/fferentiated rough diamond distribution model, which includes Sightholders, De Beers has a range of insights into its customers' demand patterns. The company seeks to stimulate consumer demand for diamonds through its Forevermark \u2122 and De Beers Jewellers brands and through its participation in the Natural Diamond Council.\n\n## Copper\n\nAnglo American has a world class asset position in copper, built around its interests in two of the world's largest copper mines Los Bronces (a 50.1% owned and managed operation) and Collahuasi (44% interest in the independently managed joint operation), with Reserve Lives of 37 years and 68 years, respectively. The resource base of these assets underpins our future near-asset growth opportunities, in addition to the tier one Quellaveco project we are developing in Peru - one of the world's largest untapped copper orebodies - and the polymetallic Sakatti deposit in Finland.",

It is used in nearly all construction projects, from new buildings to power transmission and all forms of transport, as well as today's array of white goods and electronics.\n\nAs the world seeks to decarbonise, copper is coming into its own as one of the biggest beneficiaries of green-focused infrastructure plans in the US, China and Europe, and is playing a growing part in the global energy mix, both in helping reduce emissions and in the push to develop and deploy green, renewable energy.\n\nCopper is key to the global e/ffort in scaling up to meet the Paris Agreement's sub-2\u00b0C-increase target. Its 'newer' uses include its deployment in wind turbines, which are highly copper-intensive, with the metal being used in the extensive cabling needed to transfer power, as well as in generators and transformers. In the motor industry, battery electric vehicles contain 3-4 times more copper than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Furthermore, the electric grid sector remains a major demand area for the metal, and its copper intensity continues to rise.\n\nThe metal is central to Anglo American's growth. Our copper interests in Chile and Peru are in mining jurisdictions that have historically had stable legal and fiscal frameworks, longestablished mining sectors, and a skilled workforce. In Peru, we are developing Quellaveco (60% shareholding), which is scheduled to start producing in 2022, and is expected to add an estimated 300,000 tonnes per annum of copper (100% basis) to our current annual output of more than 640,000 tonnes.\n\nAs the copper industry faces many challenges, including declining average grades, restrictions on fresh water use, challenges around the industry's environmental footprint and lack of infrastructure, supply will likely struggle to keep pace with global demand for greener and cleaner energy and transport. Anglo American is therefore well placed to benefit from structural tightness in the copper market, given our copper growth profile.\n\nThe copper industry is expected to struggle to meet longer term demand growth, including from hybrid and electric vehicles and renewable energy, as declining grades and more challenging physical and environmental conditions, along with tougher licensing and permitting requirements, are expected to limit the industry's ability to deliver new copper supply.\n\n## Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)\n\nOur PGMs business (held through an e/ffective 80.8% interest in Anglo American Platinum Limited) is a leading producer of PGMs - platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and osmium. It mines, processes and refines the PGM basket of metals from its high quality resource base, located in the biggest known PGM deposit - the Bushveld Complex in South Africa. It also has a significant stake in Unki - one of the world's largest PGM deposits outside of South Africa, on the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe. Our flagship mine, Mogalakwena, is one of the highest margin PGM producers in the industry and, as the only large open pit PGM mine globally, is at the centre of a more flexible, competitive and lower risk business.\n\nWe are continuing to reposition the business around a leaner, bestin-class operating footprint at our Mogalakwena, Amandelbult and Mototolo mines in South Africa, and Unki mine in Zimbabwe, alongside our joint operation interests in the Kroondal and Modikwa mines in South Africa.\n\nDemand for PGMs is forecast to remain robust, helped by the ongoing trend towards cleaner-emission vehicles, driven by more stringent global emissions legislation. Strong demand from the automotive industry is likely to be augmented by growing opportunities for emerging new applications, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell electric transport, while emerging countries such as India o/ffer the potential of developing, from a relatively low base, into significant platinum jewellery markets.\n\nWe are well positioned to proactively stimulate demand for PGMs, including through targeted campaigns in emerging jewellery markets; through direct investment in a number of companies developing new technologies that are expected to drive industrial demand for PGMs; and creating new investment demand for these precious metals as a store of value.\n\n## Iron ore\n\nAnglo American's iron ore operations provide customers with high iron content ore, a large percentage of which is direct-charge product for steelmaking blast furnaces. In South Africa, we have a 69.7% shareholding in Kumba Iron Ore, whose Sishen and Kolomela mines produce high grade and high quality lump ore and also a premium fine ore.\n\nIn Brazil, we have developed the Minas-Rio operation (100% ownership), consisting of an open pit mine and beneficiation plant, which produces a high grade pellet feed product, with low levels of contaminants. The iron ore is transported through a 529 km pipeline to the iron ore handling and shipping facilities at the port of A\u00e7u.\n\nAs steel producers in China and elsewhere face ever-tighter emissions legislation and are seeking ways to make their furnaces cleaner and more e/fficient, so the demand for higher quality iron ore products increases. The lump iron ore produced from Kumba's operations commands a premium price, owing to its excellent physical strength and high iron content (64-65% average Fe content). Minas-Rio's pellet feed product also commands a premium price, as its ultra-low contaminant levels and high iron content (c. 67% Fe content) are sought after by steel producers who are seeking to minimise emissions while boosting productivity.",

Anglo American is continuing its pathway out of thermal coal production, having more than halved our production footprint since 2015, with the planned exit from our remaining thermal coal operations in South Africa. We also plan to exit our one-third shareholding in the independently managed Cerrej\u00f3n operation in Colombia at the appropriate time.\n\n## Metallurgical coal - Australia\n\nWe are the world's third largest exporter of metallurgical coal for steelmaking and our operations serve customers throughout Asia, Europe and South America.\n\nOur tier one metallurgical coal assets include the Moranbah North and Grosvenor metallurgical coal mines (both 88% ownership), located in Queensland. The mines are underground longwall operations and produce premium quality hard coking coal. More stringent environmental and safety regulations have led to a requirement for many steel producers to run cleaner, larger and more e/fficient blast furnaces which, combined with a number of mine closures in recent years, results in increased global structural demand for high quality coking coal, such as that produced by our Australian mines.\n\n## Export thermal coal - South Africa\n\nOur remaining South African coal portfolio is concentrated on export markets, having sold the majority of our domestic coal mines in 2015. Our export product is derived from three 100% owned and wholly operated mines - Goedehoop, Greenside and Khwezela; Zibulo (73% owned); and Mafube colliery, a 50:50 joint operation. Our operations route all export coal through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal, in which we hold a 23.2% stake.\n\n## Export thermal coal - Colombia\n\nIn Colombia, Anglo American, BHP and Glencore each have a onethird shareholding in Cerrej\u00f3n, one of the country's largest thermal coal exporters.\n\n## Nickel and manganese\n\n## Nickel\n\nOur Nickel business has the capacity to produce around 45,000 tonnes per year of nickel, whose primary end use is in the global stainless steel industry. Our assets (both 100% owned) are in Brazil, with two ferronickel production sites: Barro Alto and Codemin. Our PGMs business also produces nickel as a by-product, amounting to 13,800 tonnes in 2020.\n\n## Manganese\n\nWe have a 40% shareholding in Samancor joint venture (managed by South32, which holds 60%), with operations based in South Africa and Australia.\n\n## Portfolio update\n\nWe continue to refine and upgrade the quality of our asset portfolio to ensure that our capital is deployed e/ffectively to generate enhanced and sustainable returns for our shareholders.\n\nAnglo American has transformed the quality and performance of its portfolio since 2013, halving the number of assets while producing more physical product. This transformation has been achieved through extensive operational self-help and other e/fficiency work, together with the sale, placing onto care and maintenance, or closure of less attractive assets, resulting in a step-change in our operational performance, profitability and cash flow generation.\n\nDuring 2020, our focus was on continuing to improve our competitive position, progressing the construction of the Quellaveco copper project in Peru, and completing the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc, while also re-phasing certain of our capital projects in light of Covid-19-related disruption.\n\nWe completed the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc, following regulatory and shareholder approval, in March 2020. Anglo American is continuing to develop what is now known as the Woodsmith project in the north east of England to access the world's largest known deposit of polyhalite, a natural mineral fertiliser product containing potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium. The fertiliser product - known as POLY4 - will be exported to a network of customers in overseas markets from our dedicated port. The Woodsmith project, part of our Crop Nutrients business, which also incorporates the further development of global demand for POLY4, will be a world class supplier of premium quality fertiliser certified for organic use and with a low carbon footprint, expected to help meet ever growing demand for food.\n\nThe project fits well with our established strategy of securing and developing world class assets, particularly in the context of Anglo American's trajectory towards products that support a fast growing global population and enable a cleaner, greener, more sustainable world. The integration of the project into Anglo American is ongoing, with a technical review on track to be completed by mid-2021.\n\n- For more on the Woodsmith project See pages 22-23\n\nIn December, we completed a transaction to provide for the equalisation of ownership across our integrated metallurgical coal operations at Moranbah North and Grosvenor in Australia through the sale of a 12% interest in Grosvenor mine to the minority joint operation participants in Moranbah North. The Grosvenor mine uses Moranbah North's coal processing infrastructure, where numerous debottlenecking, expansion and product blending options o/ffer considerable cost, productivity and margin benefits for the integrated operation.\n\n## Projects\n\nStrict value criteria are applied to the assessment of Anglo American's portfolio of future growth options. For major greenfield projects, we will sequence their development and we will consider including partners where appropriate. The Group will continue to maintain optionality to progress with valueaccretive projects.\n\nStrong progress continues at Quellaveco, with the project currently tracking against its original schedule, despite the impact of Covid19-related disruptions, as execution was well ahead of schedule prior to the pandemic, with all applicable milestones achieved.\n\nThe project is expected to deliver first production in 2022, with ramp-up to full production in 2023. Quellaveco expects to deliver around 300,000 tpa of copper equivalent production (on a 100% basis) on average in the first 10 years of operation.\n\nLonger term, the Group has a number of organic growth options under consideration, including expansions at the Mogalakwena PGMs complex in South Africa, the Collahuasi copper joint operation in Chile, and the Moranbah-Grosvenor metallurgical coal mines in Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more on the progress of our Quellaveco project See page 73",

Here, at our Sakatti polymetallic deposit in Finland, geologist Fabian Frohlich (left) and technician Jouni Raninen have been using drone technologies in hydrogeological studies, including mapping springs in boggy areas as well as other field operations such as route planning.\n\n## Innovation - taking discovery under cover\n\nA short history: It is only in the past 200 years or so that the science of geology has developed to assist in exploration endeavours. Many of these have turned out to be successful, with the discovery of mineral deposits of a quality and scale that have indisputably played an important part in the development of modern life. To take just one example, global production of copper, an essential metal in an array of applications from electrical and electronic applications to hybrid vehicles and the harnessing of renewable energy, has increased twentyfold in the past century, and has more than doubled in the past 25 years.\n\nChallenge and opportunity: A consequence of this successful discovery history is the increasing maturity of well-explored regions, including many areas where the rocks hosting mineral deposits are exposed at surface. However, most prospective rock formations are not exposed, but are rather concealed beneath younger rocks and sediments deposited after the mineral deposits formed in the geological past. These undiscovered deposits are said to be 'under cover'. While some explorers limit their search to traditional and now well-explored search areas, our Discovery team recognises the discovery potential in the vast, still poorly explored, covered search space. The challenge, however, lies in developing increasingly e/ffective means of discovering superior-value under cover ore deposits, with often complex geology, and then turning them into highly prospective resources.\n\n## Discovery\n\nDiscovery and Geosciences, including our exploration activities, is consolidated across the Group, covering near-asset and greenfield discovery, projects and operations. The integrated function is supporting a greater technical understanding of our world class assets, a strategic advantage that is being applied to maximise realisation of value from them, and to gain significant benefit in both near-asset and greenfield discovery work.\n\nAnglo American was founded on world class mineral discoveries. Building on the Group's strategy and long track record of discovery success, we are implementing a fundamentally revitalised discovery strategy that is shaping a global, diversified, risk-balanced portfolio focused on new discovery search spaces. This e/ffort is enhancing our position as a discoverer of superior-value deposits that have the potential to improve our production profile, over time.\n\n## Quality discovery portfolio\n\nWe are concentrating on the discovery of mineral deposits in existing and new districts that are capable of delivering sustainable returns on a material scale, and which provide greater diversification and optionality for the business, delivering metals and minerals to enable a cleaner, greener, more electrified world. We maintain a robust and diverse discovery portfolio, including:\n\nUnlocking covered search space: By applying leading scientific understanding of how world class mineral systems are formed, our geoscientists try to predict Earth's most prospective areas, both exposed and under cover. Innovative discovery technologies, both developed through Anglo American-driven partnerships, include the SPECTREMPLUS airborne geophysical system, and the Low-Temperature Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (LT-SQUID) ground-based geophysical system. SPECTREMPLUS collects high resolution electromagnetic, magnetic, radiometric and gravity information about the subsurface in a single airborne platform. The LT-SQUID is a highly sensitive magnetometer that is particularly useful for sensing metallic sulphide deposits in complex geological environments that otherwise lack expression at surface. This integrated approach is key to Anglo American's track record of mineral discoveries in new settings and beneath cover.\n\nLooking ahead: Deeply buried mineral deposits are commonly not accessible using traditional open pit mining methods. The tilt towards new covered search spaces brings with it the opportunity to turn under cover discoveries into safe, highly e/fficient underground operations with a minimal surface footprint. We are pursuing such opportunities at our nearasset Los Bronces Underground copper project in Chile, and at our Sakatti polymetallic project in northern Finland - both Anglo American discoveries.\n\n- - Near-asset discovery projects: focused on the extensive mineral tenure around Anglo American's existing operations.\n- - These have yielded, for example, several discoveries in the Los Bronces district in Chile. Notably, at Los Bronces Underground, discovered in 2006, ongoing drilling over the past five years has yielded an increase in reported Mineral Resources by more than 240% to c. 4.1 billion tonnes grading 1.13% TCu (see Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020 for full details). In other districts such as Quellaveco (Peru) and Mogalakwena (South Africa), new copper and PGM prospects respectively have been identified and are currently being explored and evaluated.\n- - Greenfield discovery projects: identifying and securing districtscale mineral tenure covering strategic, highly prospective search space in established and frontier settings. The greenfield discovery focus includes copper, diamonds, nickel and PGMs. The Group has active greenfield programmes in Australia, Canada, Greenland, Finland, South America (Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru), and sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia).",

On a far bigger scale, in 2021 we expect to pilot the first hydrogen fuel cell electric truck of a planned haul truck fleet at our Mogalakwena PGMs mine in South Africa.\n\n## Decarbonising our business\n\nTackling climate change is the defining challenge of our time. Our underlying principle is to reduce carbon going into the atmosphere and we have set out a number of pathways to achieve this, guided by our Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives . These include the ongoing transition of our portfolio towards those metals and minerals which support a greener, cleaner, more sustainable world; reducing our energy consumption and intensity; and increased use of renewable energy.\n\n## Realising hydrogen's potential\n\nIn 2020, we committed to an ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality (Scope 1 and 2) across our operations by 2040, with eight of our operations reaching that goal by 2030, supported by a clear set of intermediate targets. We are also rapidly increasing our sourcing of renewable energy - using 100% renewables in Chile from 2021 and Brazil from 2022 - and low carbon operational solutions, which include the production and use of hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen, the most abundant element, is a versatile, zero-emission energy carrier with a high energy density. It can also be stored in large quantities and for long periods. The Hydrogen Council currently estimates that hydrogen could represent 18% of global energy demand by 2050.\n\nPlatinum group metals (PGMs), essential in cleaning up the noxious gases from the internal combustion engine (ICE), also play a critical role in the emerging hydrogen economy - in both hydrogen powered fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), as well as in the production of green hydrogen via electrolysis.\n\nHydrogen in numbers\n\n## 18%\n\nthe Hydrogen Council currently estimates that hydrogen could represent 18% of global energy demand by 2050\n\n## Zero emissions\n\nHydrogen is a zero-emission energy carrier with a high energy density\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on hydrogen fuel, see\n\nwww.angloamerican.com/futuresmart/stories/our-industry/technology/ how-hydrogen-fuel-cells-work",

Mine vehicles are also therefore ideal candidates. As part of an integrated mine-decarbonisation system that we envisage, we have partnered with several companies to develop and fuel the world's largest hydrogen powered mine haul truck. We plan to generate hydrogen from electrolysis on our mine sites, using renewable energy sources. At our Mogalakwena PGMs mine in South Africa, where the truck is expected to be piloted in 2021, we are building a 3.5 MW electrolyser to produce hydrogen on site for use in fuelling the hydrogen powered fuel cell electric haul truck. We subsequently expect to roll out this technology across the Mogalakwena fleet and those at our other operations around the world in the years to come.\n\nThe prospects for the adoption of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies for clean energy and transport have increased markedly in the last year across many major economies and among key relevant stakeholder groups. In terms of broader transport adoption, some obstacles do still need to be resolved, but it is likely that FCEVs and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) will provide complementary, emissions-free, solutions for di/fferent transport applications, with FCEVs continuing to benefit from their quick refuelling times and greater range.\n\n'Hydrogen technologies can provide zero-emission energy and transport solutions, enable deep industrial decarbonisation and help renewables maximise their potential through storage.'\n\n## Takeshi Uchiyamada\n\nChairman of the Board of Toyota Motor Corporation and Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council\n\n## Developing the market for hydrogen\n\nThrough our longstanding PGM market development activities, including our $100 million investment in AP Ventures, an independent venture capital fund with a mandate to invest in the development of new applications for the full suite of PGMs, we have been investing in a wide range of promising new technologies and in companies in the fuel cell, hydrogen and energy-storage value chain. We also support the development of the hydrogen economy through several partnerships. We are a founding and board member of the global Hydrogen Council (now numbering nearly 100 members), as well as a founding member of the International Hydrogen Fuel Cell Association in China and the Green Hydrogen in Heavy Industry Consortium in Australia, which was formed in early 2020 and places a strong emphasis on green hydrogen and fuel cell technology for mobility and power generation in mining.\n\n## - and our planet\n\nTackling emissions: Currently, our Ultra Class truck fleets consume 70% to 80% of the diesel on our sites. By displacing diesel with green hydrogen, we are removing one of the hardest to abate emission sources in mining.\n\nPower: Our proprietary zero emission Power Plant Module, which consists of 800 kW of fuel cells and a 1.2 MWh battery, can deliver more power than conventional diesel engines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHydrogen storage: Due to the high energy density of hydrogen and the ability to perform fast refuelling, the availability of the haul fleet is maximised as fewer refuelling stops are required.\n\nAnglo American is committed to achieving carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040",

In 2020, together with our partners, we focused on accelerating the development and adoption of new PGM alloys; spearheaded the creation of hydrogen freight corridors - designed to accelerate the uptake of heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles by aggregating end-user demand and aligning the development of refuelling infrastructure; and formed a joint venture with Japan's Furuya Metal, to commercialise a platinum-based product that extends food shelf life.\n\nThe Platinum Guild International and the World Platinum Investment Council, both partners with us in market development, continued to successfully stimulate platinum demand in the jewellery and investment sectors, respectively. We have also expanded our e/fforts in China, forging new partnerships with the likes of Eastern China University of Science and Technology to work on the development of a platinum photocatalyst used to reduce pollution from industrial waste-gas streams. AP Ventures, established as an independent venture capital fund in 2018, welcomed two new strategic investment partners, Sumitomo Corporation and Impala Platinum, cementing its position as a leading fund investing in technologies that enable the use of PGMs, particularly in the hydrogen and fuel cell sectors.\n\n## Operating Model\n\nWe believe we can build a long term sustainable competitive advantage by securing access to the best resources and through operating assets more e/ffectively (productive) and more e/fficiently (cost competitive) than our competitors.\n\nOur Operating Model is the foundation to support us by providing structure, stability and predictability in the way that we plan and execute every task. Unplanned work is inherently more costly, and less safe, than planned work.\n\n## P101\n\nP101 is our transformational asset productivity programme that builds on the stability provided by our Operating Model.\n\nIt is about improving the performance of our most value-accretive mining and other processes to best-in-class benchmarks, then pushing the capability boundary further, establishing new benchmarks for the industry in terms of e/fficiency and the way we work. P101 is systematically targeting opportunities across the value chain, for example delivering a 15% increase in truck utilisation at Orapa, increased haul truck payloads at Los Bronces, an 8% throughput increase at the Minas-Rio beneficiation plant, and world class shovel performance across multiple operations. P101 sets the context for our progress and is critical to enabling the delivery of FutureSmart Mining \u2122 .\n\nWhile we have delivered a material operational turnaround in recent years, we believe there is still significant value to be delivered from the continued implementation of our Operating Model, P101, and the benefits from technology roll-out and our digital platform (known as Voxel), as well as the delivery of growth projects. By 2022, we expect to deliver an additional $3-4 billion annual underlying improvement, before inflation, relative to 2017.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- A Minera Tres Valles (MTV) employee washing cathode sheets at the company's site in Salamanca, Chile.\n\n## Independent copper producer's cathode marketed by Anglo American\n\nMany of the products we market have an important role to play in the energy transition. From automotive to construction to energy production, the ability to supply metals such as copper, PGMs and nickel in a responsible way will be a di/fferentiator in shaping a sustainable future for our industry. By forging relationships with independent partners or smaller-scale miners, long term origination deals allow us to expand the volume and breadth of products we can o/ffer to customers.\n\nThis represents a natural extension of our third-party sourcing activities, whereby Anglo American increasingly handles products that originate from outside the Group's managed operations in order to provide a reliable and timely supply of products to meet industry demand.\n\nThe agreement with Minera Tres Valles (MTV) and its Canadian parent company, SRHI, highlights our approach. The terms of the deal include Anglo American, together with the Kimura Commodity Trade Finance Fund, providing more than $50 million in loan financing to support production growth plans at MTV's operations in Chile. A key feature is an o/fftake agreement for 100% of MTV's extremely high-purity copper cathode output that Anglo American will market. Anglo American and Kimura were key creditors who supported MTV through in-court reorganisation proceedings in Chile during the course of 2020, and the terms of the deal reflect the court-approved restructuring plan.\n\nPartnerships such as this bring benefits to smaller and midsize operators who, through these agreements, have access to Anglo American's marketing platform and route to market. Partners benefit from our product and industry expertise and are able to take advantage of our infrastructure, technical and production risk-assessment skills, as well as our financing and logistics capabilities.\n\nOrigination agreements can also be an opportunity to have a positive impact on mining communities. For example, in addition to the ore produced from its own mines, MTV purchases product directly from small third-party producers, and also from ENAMI, Chile's National Mining Enterprise, to be processed at its facilities, as well as leasing properties to local miners. This helps local players in the community of Salamanca, where MTV is located, as it secures an outlet for production coming from smaller producers, including familyowned ventures.\n\nThe project is an important source of income for the local area. Around 65% of MTV's 210-strong workforce, and more than 80% of its 382 contractors, come from the local community in Salamanca.",

The intrinsic links between technology, digitalisation and many of our sustainability outcomes are driving the innovations that will transform the nature of mining and how our stakeholders experience our business. A future in which broad, innovative thinking, enabling technologies, and collaborative partnerships will shape an industry that is safer, more sustainable and e/fficient, and better harmonised with the needs of our host communities and society. This is about transforming our physical and societal footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Concentrating the Mine\u2122\n\nWe are optimising mining processes through technologies that target the required metals and minerals more precisely, with reduced water, energy and capital intensity, and producing less waste. These technologies include bulk ore sorting, coarse particle recovery, fines flotation, dry processing and novel classification, with their implementation integrated into resource development planning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Modern Mine\n\nSafety is our number one priority and we are committed to achieving zero harm, so that all of our colleagues return home safely, every day. We are developing a new generation of engineered controls to reduce exposure to risk in work processes. We are using existing modernisation technologies, introducing remotely operated machinery - such as automated drilling - and continuous hard rock cutting, to remove people from harm's way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Intelligent Mine\n\nWe are transforming how we make best use of data, through integrated digital tools for planning, simulation, execution, and monitoring, from resource definition to the output of processing plants. Our digital platform (known as Voxel) is bringing the full mining value chain together in a digital form to help our people make data-driven decisions in the most e/fficient manner, predicting outcomes and driving safety, environmental and productivity improvements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water-less Mine\n\nWith 75% of our assets located in water-constrained areas, we must reduce our dependence on water and associated tailings facilities. We will always need water, but we can get closer to full recovery recycling. Through an integrated system of technologies including coarse particle recovery and hydraulic dry stack, we are reducing freshwater usage, moving to closed loop and ultimately dry-processing in our operations, thereby eliminating the need for wet tailings and instead creating stable, dry, economically viable land. The construction of the first such facility is under way at El Soldado, in Chile, to validate the engineering at scale.\n\nBy integrating data intelligence and technology with our Sustainable Mining Plan commitments, we are creating new systems that optimise value for our stakeholders. We expect this integrated and holistic approach to deliver increasingly significant safety, environmental and social benefits, while reinforcing the ethical credentials of our products.\n\nThe framework for our approach to technology and digitalisation is set out as follows:",

The BOS system unlocks production capacity through early rejection of waste, reducing the volume of material sent to the processing plant.\n\n## Bulk ore sorting and coarse particle recovery - leading the way in mineral processing innovation\n\nFutureSmart Mining \u2122 is central to how Anglo American lives up to its Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives . We are working to transform many of the physical processes of mining and to reduce our environmental footprint, helping us to better meet society's expectations of our industry, while continuing to provide many of the essential metals and minerals our modern society needs.\n\nThrough embracing step-change technologies, our mining operations are becoming safer and more water- and energye/fficient. Through digitalisation, and the application of big data and artificial intelligence, FutureSmart Mining \u2122 is enhancing our performance across the entire mining value chain, from the discovery of new mineral deposits, to mining equipment and processing techniques, to tailoring products for our customers.\n\nAnglo American is at the forefront of applying innovative technologies that are fundamentally changing the way minerals are processed - two of which are bulk ore sorting (BOS) and coarse particle recovery (CPR). Both technologies are helping us to significantly reduce our energy and water consumption in line with our ambitious Sustainable Mining Plan targets of a 30% improvement in energy e/fficiency and a 50% reduction in fresh water abstraction by 2030.\n\nThe primary benefit of the BOS system is in unlocking production capacity through early rejection of waste or unwanted material, thereby increasing the grade of the ore and reducing the volume\n\n## Sustainable Mining Plan\n\nAs societal expectations continue to evolve, so mining must play its part to address the environmental challenges of a carbonconstrained world and society's wider expectations of us as enablers of change, while we continue to meet the ever growing demand for our products.\n\nOur far-reaching and ambitious Sustainable Mining Plan is designed to tackle many of these challenges, both environmental and social, and we are making encouraging progress in changing how our employees and stakeholders experience Anglo American, in line with our Purpose.\n\nOur Sustainable Mining Plan, launched in 2018 as part of FutureSmart Mining \u2122 , is built around three major areas or Global Sustainability Pillars, which are aligned to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals:\n\n- - Maintaining a healthy environment that uses less water and delivers net-positive biodiversity outcomes, ultimately moving us closer to our vision of a carbon-neutral mine\n\nthat is transported to the processing plant or concentrator. BOS uses composition-sensing technology to detect the concentration of elements of interest, as well as the amount of waste in the material being transported for processing. This has led to a reduction in overall costs per tonne produced, along with a decrease in wet tailings volumes, and in water and energy use.\n\nBOS pilot plants are already up and running or in the process of being commissioned at El Soldado, Barro Alto, Los Bronces and Mogalakwena. Work is most advanced at El Soldado, where trials indicate that, potentially, BOS alone can deliver a c.10% reduction in energy and water intensity for an operation.\n\nCPR makes use of a new technology that may in time replace conventional flotation technology, which frequently requires large infrastructure and high power consumption. At our El Soldado copper mine in Chile, our new demonstration plant uses CPR technology in a novel way using the Hydrofloat \u2122 , which combines flotation with gravity concentration, allowing the flotation process to be changed to treat larger-diameter material and permit coarser grinding. Through delivering a waste stream that is easier to handle, capacity in the mill is freed up to increase throughput by 15-20%, while e/ffecting savings of around 20% in energy.\n\nBy being able to treat larger size material as opposed to dust size particles, the process also means that water can be more easily separated afterwards, which then enables the dry stacking and storage of that waste, with far fewer wet tailings, reducing water consumption by around 10%, as well as making the whole operation safer.\n\n- - Building thriving communities with better health, education and levels of employment\n- - Developing trust as a corporate leader, providing ethical value chains, policy advocacy and improved accountability.\n\nUnder each of the Global Sustainability Pillars we have a set of stretch goals. We are putting all our e/fforts into delivering them between now and 2030. These Global Stretch Goals are deliberately ambitious and designed to challenge us to lead and innovate.\n\nAt the heart of our Sustainable Mining Plan is Collaborative Regional Development (CRD), our innovative approach to bringing sustainable economic opportunities to the regions around our operations. For our mines to be safe, responsible and productive, they should operate in areas that are thriving. In many places, addressing the challenges to achieve this is too large and complex to be solved by one institution alone, and instead is better tackled through collaboration and partnership.",

We are forming partnerships with other stakeholders, to jointly identify and then deliver long term social and economic development beyond our operations' immediate zones of influence. We use spatial analysis to look at factors such as demographic data, available infrastructure and climate projections to explore challenges and opportunities in the region and combine these with market studies. Spatial planning involves aggregating multiple data sources in a particular region, helping partners explore challenges and opportunities by visualising them in one location.\n\nIn 2019, we piloted the approach in Limpopo province in South Africa, where our CRD initiative, the Impact Catalyst, now has four main partners. We have also started implementing the CRD approach in the country's Northern Cape province, as well as in Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the UK.\n\nBy working in partnership with a broad range of stakeholders, we are delivering on our commitment to building the foundations for long term, sustainable development in our host regions, far beyond the life of the mine.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of our time and at Anglo American, we are committed to being part of the global response to climate change. Our strategy takes into account a range of risks and opportunities for the business. We will work with others across geographies, industries and throughout the value chain to achieve our goal. We are also investing in game-changing technological solutions through FutureSmart Mining \u2122 to deliver sustainable reductions in energy usage and emissions.\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nClimate change is the lens through which we view all of our strategic planning and business decision-making, including capital allocation and the industry associations to which we belong, ensuring that we are able to position ourselves proactively to address the impacts of climate change and capitalise on potential opportunities, as well as moving our business in line with the global transition that is needed.\n\nWe are exploring growth opportunities, including in copper, nickel and PGMs - the metals required for the transition to a low carbon economy - and we have reduced our thermal coal production footprint by more than half since 2015.\n\nOur commitment to helping address climate change is underpinned by our work to reduce our operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Having already introduced a target in 2018 to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 30% and improve our energy e/fficiency by 30% by 2030 against a 2016 baseline, in 2020 we raised the bar. We are now targeting carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040, with eight sites targeted to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nOur approach aligns with the vision set out by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we have supported since 2018. In line with the TCFD's recommendations, in 2019, we published the report Climate Change: Our Plans, Policies and Progress , which explored the impact of climate change across our portfolio through quantitative scenario analysis. The analysis helped us understand that our business is fundamentally resilient. Guidance on where to find information relating to each of the TCFD's recommendations is found in the disclosure table on page 257.\n\nThe remuneration of our chief executive and all senior management include metrics directly related to climate change. A GHG emissions target was first introduced to the LTIP in 2017. We achieved the 2020 GHG target a year ahead of schedule, in 2019. For 2022, the LTIP awarded in 2020 includes a target of a further 10% reduction on the 2019 emissions level (with a 15% stretch target). The GHG metric has been retained for the new LTIP being awarded in 2021, reflecting our continued focus on climate change and our 2030 SMP commitments. See page 130 of the Directors' remuneration report for more detail.\n\nIn addition to our work with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), we engage in policy processes through other local and international forums. We also have consistent and constructive engagement with investors with an interest in climate change, including with the Climate Action 100+ initiative.\n\n## Targets and performance\n\nIn 2020, our operations were responsible for 16.1 million tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent emissions (Mt CO 2 e). This represents a 9% decrease compared with 2019, driven in part by the impact of Covid-19related restrictions at many of our operations in the second quarter of 2020. Our total energy consumption decreased to 81 million GJ (2019: 87 million GJ). In 2020, our Group emission intensity was 7.63 (Mt CO 2 e/tonnes CuEq).\n\nIn 2019, we undertook a Group-wide Scope 3 emissions assessment, covering the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. The emissions from this period were 225 Mt CO 2 e. We plan to carry out this detailed assessment every two years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our Scope 3 emissions, see\n\nwww.angloamerican.com/sustainability-data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Environmental co-ordinator Rog\u00e9rio Vasconcellos in Minas-Rio's nursery, where native tree seedlings are cultivated prior to planting in areas set aside for reforestation.\n\n## Biodiversity leadership at Minas-Rio\n\n## Conserving Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest\n\nA major area of focus in our Sustainable Mining Plan is to be recognised as a leader in biodiversity in the mining sector. We aim to achieve this through being responsible and transparent biodiversity custodians so that our presence has a net positive impact (NPI) on biodiversity. We appreciate only too well that failing to do so will create risks for us from an operational perspective, and from loss of reputation, trust and social acceptability.\n\nOur Minas-Rio iron ore mine is located in one of Brazil's priority conservation areas (the Bu/ffer and Transition Zone of the Espinha\u00e7o Range Biosphere Reserve). This is a transition area between the Atlantic Rainforest and Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) biomes and is characterised by the presence of many caves. The Atlantic Rainforest originally covered around 60 million hectares and extended over several, very di/fferent, environmental zones. Today, the forest cover is now around 12% of its original extent. This includes places where the rainforest is being regenerated, as well as degraded forest land, and comprises mainly small areas of under 100 hectares.\n\nWe are investing in biodiversity o/ffsets at several sites in the region of the Minas-Rio operation by way of combating ongoing deforestation. These o/ffset sites cover more than 15,000 hectares, of which around 12,000 hectares are legally constituted forest and are managed directly by Anglo American. The remaining hectares will be donated to the Minas Gerais state government in order to help conserve protected land by creating a 'green ribbon' that connects these areas. Between 2014 and 2020, Anglo American made a number of major biodiversity investments, including $3.5 million dedicated to conservation of the 12,000 hectares of legally constituted forest in the Minas-Rio region, while $6.4 million was invested in the restoration of a further 1,300 hectares. In addition to these amounts, we also invested $2.4 million on the monitoring of fauna in the region, while $2.8 million was donated to the production of seedlings of native trees for reforestation of degraded areas.\n\nWe are implementing several additional conservation initiatives in Brazil, including partnerships with NGOs for the restoration of wetlands, and with universities for scientific research, environmental education, and assessment of livelihood alternatives - which, together, will make a positive contribution to the region's biodiversity conservation and its overall sustainable development. Such initiatives are essential to reduce the human pressure on remaining habitats and to tip the balance away from deforestation towards encouraging the restoration of forest land and to ensure we deliver positive conservation outcomes.",

We have a responsibility to look after the natural environment with care and ingenuity. We direct our e/fforts to making sure that not only do we minimise impact, but that we seek to deliver positive and lasting environmental outcomes.\n\nWe do this through ecosystem-thinking and by using naturebased solutions, managing a range of interconnected issues - from climate and biodiversity to social impact and health, including using our digital platform, known as Voxel, to predict environmental impacts and help us adjust operational planning accordingly. Our environmental work involves protecting the biodiversity of areas in which we operate, accounting for and optimising our water use, supporting the circular economy throughout the value chain and across our business, and addressing quality of the air around our operations.\n\nAs part of our Sustainable Mining Plan, we have set the following targets for water and biodiversity:\n\n- - Biodiversity 2030: Deliver net positive impact on biodiversity across Anglo American\n- - Water 2030: Reduce the abstraction of fresh water by 50% against the 2015 baseline.\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nIn 2020, we updated and published our Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) Policy. Aligned with our Purpose, Values, and internationally recognised safety, health and environmental standards (ISO 45001 and 14001), the SHE policy embodies three guiding principles: zero mindset; no repeats; and non-negotiable minimum standards.\n\nThe SHE Way is the management framework we use to implement the SHE Policy. It helps us to achieve our Sustainable Mining Plan goals and to live out our commitments to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, a sustainable environment, and to build and maintain thriving communities everywhere we work. This dynamic tool sets out what is expected of all employees, managers, and our organisation as a whole. The updated SHE Way is being rolled out to support the updated SHE Policy in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information on the SHE Policy, see\n\nwww.angloamerican.com/sustainability/approach-and-policies\n\nIn spite of the challenges posed by Covid-19, in 2020 we made significant progress:\n\n- - PGMs achieved a 92% reduction in waste to landfill compared with the 2013 baseline\n- - We launched our first Global Biodiversity day, including a global grant programme\n- - Our Predictive Monitoring System, of which the foundational part of Phase 1 was completed, brings together software, hardware (sensors) and data science from multiple operational data sources into a single platform to give us future-looking information about how weather incidents will a/ffect our operations. It enables us to make adjustments in real time to optimise our controls\n- - In November 2020, we announced a collaboration with Accenture and other global industry leaders to support The Circulars Accelerator. This initiative will help accelerate the global circular transition.\n\n## Learning from environmental incidents\n\nWe classify incidents on five levels, according to their impact. Our chief executive reports all Level 3-5 incidents (from moderate to significant) to the Board, which addresses them through its Sustainability Committee.\n\nIn 2020, we saw no Level 5 environmental incidents at our managed operations, for the fifth consecutive year, and no Level 4 incidents.\n\nThere was one Level 3 incident at PGMs Rustenburg Base Metals Refinery in South Africa, which related to water overflow. We carried out remediation activities and are taking action towards a long term solution for this repeat incident. The existence of repeat incidents prompted us to launch our 'Environment 365 No Repeats' initiative - a proactive approach to managing incidents, with the goal of ensuring that, by 2021, there will be no Level 2 or above repeats at the same site, with the ultimate goal of no events.\n\n## Water\n\nWater is fundamental for our operations and the communities around them. We embrace our role as water stewards and, as our approach continues to evolve, we incorporate learnings and develop or implement new technologies.\n\nIn 2020, our focus was on reviewing and updating our wateraccounting methodology to ensure that all data is validated against water balances, and that consistent definitions are applied in accordance with the International Council on Metals and Mining (ICMM) guidelines. This supports our continuing commitment to water stewardship, working towards meeting the Sustainable Mining Plan's water goals and reaching for the FutureSmart Mining \u2122 vision of a water-less mine.\n\nOur Sustainable Mining Plan includes Water as a global stretch goal, with the following milestones and targets:\n\n- - 2020: Reduce the withdrawal of fresh water by 20%. Increase water-recycling and re-use levels to 75% against the 2015 baseline. No Level 3 or greater water incidents\n- - 2030: Reduce the withdrawal of fresh water by 50%.\n\nIn 2020, we reached a 10% reduction in freshwater abstraction compared with the 2015 base year, which was short of the 2020 milestone. However, we exceeded the recycling and re-use milestone, achieving 80%. We experienced one Level 3 incident and, accordingly, we are taking action in order to meet the 2030 targets. Total water withdrawals amounted to 209 million m 3 .\n\n## Mineral residue management\n\nThe management and storage of waste rock and processed mineral residue - known as 'tailings' - is a critical issue across our industry. We are determined to meet the social, safety and environmental challenges of mineral residue management, both by developing practical technological solutions, and encouraging industry-wide conversation on the subject, while implementing leading practice across our Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information and disclosure, see\n\nwww.angloamerican.com/tailings\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nWe are an industry leader in our approach to managing tailings safely and in being transparent about our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) around the world. Our Group Technical Standard addresses the risks of both tailings dams and water-retaining dams, as well as waste rock dumps. The Standard sets out requirements for design, monitoring, inspection and surveillance, which we follow as a minimum practice in each jurisdiction where we operate. While the Standard is recognised as industry-leading, it will continue to evolve.\n\nTechnology is increasingly playing a role in how we make tailings dams safer. In 2020, we completed installation of fibre-optic sensors at our TSFs at our Mototolo PGMs mine in South Africa, our MinasRio iron ore operation in Brazil, and our Los Bronces and El Soldado copper mines in Chile. Fibre optic cables cover a large area and are extremely sensitive to either strain or temperature di/fferentials over very long distribution lengths. This technology helps us to monitor tailings dams, enabling near-real-time measurement and analysis of data to understand structural movements, long term deformation or 'creep' into the dam foundation.",

        "page_content": "## Playing our role in society\n\nAs a global business, we see it as our role to make a positive contribution to society. Leading by example, we have a renewed social performance management system, the Social Way 3.0, that aligns with international best practice. We hope the Social Way 3.0 will be instrumental in improving people's lives in and around the areas where we operate.\n\nThrough our Collaborative Regional Development (CRD) programme, we work to actively support local and regional economies. We respect human rights, as well as the cultural heritage of people and communities. We also transparently and continuously engage stakeholders to collaboratively find solutions to the most pressing issues of our time.\n\nWe set our standards high, embedding them into our Code of Conduct. We also have high expectations of our suppliers, and provide guidance and support to emerging companies to meet those expectations, ensuring we address sustainability issues throughout the entire value chain.\n\n## Social performance\n\nSocial performance encompasses our interactions, activities and outcomes with respect to local communities and other local stakeholders in those areas a/ffected by our activities.\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nThe Social Way 3.0 provides a governing policy, implementation toolkit and assurance framework for social performance for all Anglo American-managed sites, at all phases of development.\n\nAligned with our Purpose and core planning and business management processes, as well as international standards and best practice, it sets out clear minimum requirements to:\n\n- - Engage with a/ffected and interested stakeholders\n- - Avoid, prevent, and, where appropriate, mitigate and remediate adverse social impacts\n- - Maximise development opportunities.\n\nLike earlier versions, we have made this publicly available for other companies to use, and, more importantly, so stakeholders know what our standards are and what they can expect of us.\n\n## Assessing performance\n\nExternal, independent assessors carry out annual compliance assessments across all our managed operational sites. As the requirements to comply with the Social Way 3.0 are more comprehensive and integrated than the previous version, all our site teams are working through a transition process to align to the Social Way 3.0 by the end of 2022. During the process of transitioning to our new standard we will report progress against the transition plan.\n\nThe launch of the Social Way 3.0 required us to embark on the most ambitious social performance training programme that we have ever undertaken. More than 1,000 people at our sites, across multiple functions and levels of leadership, took part in training sessions in 2020. This training continued throughout the year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and will be built on and expanded in 2021 to support the transition journey.\n\n## Engaging our local communities\n\nAs part of our transition to the Social Way 3.0, our Sustainable Mining Plan site-level local accountability goal has been incorporated into our stakeholder engagement requirements.\n\nBy 2022, we will have established community engagement forums at every mine site to deliver our Social Way 3.0 commitments to consult with stakeholders, carry out monitoring and evaluation, discuss future plans and more. This will serve to build and deepen trust and mutual understanding with our communities.\n\nAs part of the Social Way 3.0 update in 2020, we have strengthened our standards for cultural heritage management, demonstrating the importance we place on cultural heritage.\n\n## Grievances and incidents\n\nIn 2020, we recorded and reviewed approximately 2,059 grievances. Following review, 510 were Level 4 and none at Level 5. During the same period, 505 incidents with social consequences were recorded, of which 12 were Level 4 incidents, and none at Level 5.\n\nOur priority is to continue to put in place all the necessary measures to complete our transition to the Social Way 3.0 by the end of 2022.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe are committed to upholding human rights across our operations. Having reinforced human rights due diligence in 2020, we ended the year with much achieved and a clear picture of where we can further improve.\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nOur Group Human Rights Policy is aligned with the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and our commitment to the UN Global Compact Principles. Our Human Rights Framework underpins the Policy, describes how it links to our Standards, such as the Social Way 3.0, and outlines our main human rights risks. We are also a signatory of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.\n\nOur approach to human rights, and what we expect from suppliers, is also embedded in our Responsible Sourcing Standard for suppliers. We updated this in 2020, in recognition of the potential for increased human rights risk and increasing vulnerability as a result of Covid-19. In compliance with legislation in Australia, we are on track to meet the statutory modern slavery reporting requirement of the Modern Slavery Act 2018. We have also communicated with our higher risk suppliers on the new requirements of the UK's Modern Slavery Act 2015 to manage Covid-19-related risks.\n\nWith great respect for the close connection of Indigenous Peoples to the land, we remain committed to obtaining free, prior and informed consent for all new projects, in line with the 2013 ICMM Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining. This commitment is incorporated into the Social Way 3.0.\n\n## Governance and performance\n\nIn 2020, we carried out a review across our business and value chain of corporate policies and processes that collectively support human rights due diligence, aligned with the requirements of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nDuring 2020, grievances that involved human rights aspects accounted for approximately 2% of the total number of grievances received.\n\n## Socio-economic contribution\n\nWe are committed to working with other businesses and organisations that support local economies. This includes, but is not restricted to, helping those businesses and organisations to strengthen the skills and capabilities needed to enable an area to diversify its economic activities beyond mining and become more resilient. Partnering with governments, communities, other private sector companies, academia, financial development institutions and NGOs through our CRD work, we jointly identify opportunities for long term social and economic development, which we then collectively deliver.\n\n## Social investment\n\nIn 2020, our Corporate Social Investment (CSI) reached $125 million (2019: $114 million), which represents 2% of underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), less underlying EBIT of associates and joint ventures.\n\nWe focus our CSI on health, education and community development, in line with our Sustainable Mining Plan. In 2020, we readjusted our funding priorities due to Covid-19, investing $23 million on education and training initiatives and $35 million on health and welfare projects. This work also made use of our Voxel data platform to deliver data and digital literacy training to enhance skills and improve employability.",

In Moquegua, where our Quellaveco copper mine is under construction, we worked together with farmers and businesses, health authorities and municipal government in designing and developing the 'Quellaveco platform for the economic reactivation of Moquegua to address the Covid-19 pandemic'. Its main goals were:\n\n- - to contribute to the economic recovery of the most a/ffected sectors of society\n- - to boost the economic recovery of Moqueguan farmers, companies and workers who lacked access to financing\n- - to strengthen our position as a strategic ally, working both independently and in partnership with the state, initially on how best to respond to the crisis and, more generally, in assisting Moquegua's sustainable development.\n\nAmong the measures we put in place to safeguard the health of the Moquegua community were support for its La vacuna eres t\u00fa ('You are the vaccine') programme, in alliance with regional and local government authorities and health institutions, which has reached more than 23,000 families; and rolling out medical and Covid-19 awareness-raising campaigns, which included Covid-19 detection tests, screening, and medicines. We also worked with local authorities from day one to provide support and assistance to the most vulnerable. This included delivering medical equipment and supplies to health organisations; food, farming and educational tools and shelter for those most in need; oxygen plants and related equipment; 40 hospital and ICU beds; ventilators and ICU apparatus; and nearly 10,000 items of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nAt the same time, we put in place financing arrangements and generated development opportunities for small local farmers, through the AgroQuellaveco Fund; assisted the recruitment of local skilled and non-skilled labour through a customdesigned mobile phone app; established a Moqueguan business website; and helped Moqueguan entrepreneurs gain access to state-financing benefits. Enabled by these initiatives, purchases amounting to approximately $56 million were made from Moqueguan businesses in 2020, with 130 businesses accessing loans and 180 farming families directly benefiting from AgroQuellaveco.\n\nOur actions are driven by our commitment to our communities and Peru in both good times and bad. We stand side by side with our neighbours and are committed to the long term prosperity of the region.",

        "page_content": "## Supply chain\n\nOur approach to responsible sourcing is aligned to our Purpose. We expect all suppliers to meet applicable laws - while sharing our commitment to improve people's lives, society and our environment. Our programme defines minimum sustainability requirements and decent work principles required by our 18,000+ suppliers. This allows us to prioritise ethical decision-making when selecting and managing the suppliers we work with, and to support and uphold fundamental human rights through our supply chain.\n\n## Our approach and policies\n\nAs a condition of working with us, suppliers must comply at a minimum with all relevant laws, industry regulations, and we expect them to meet the Anglo American policies, site requirements and other supply conditions, including our Responsible Sourcing Standard.\n\nIn 2020, we launched an updated version of the Standard to reflect possible consequences of Covid-19 on human rights, calling for increased visibility of value chains and improved management of infectious diseases. We also built on the role that suppliers can play in the circular economy. Published in three languages, the Standard is available via our website, along with a six-minute introduction video. We also updated our Frequently Asked Questions document and our supplier 'self-assessment questionnaire' tool.\n\nIn parallel, we are updating the requirements of our internal responsible sourcing processes, to strengthen, embed and further integrate responsible sourcing across the Group. This will apply to all suppliers from 2021 and will drive consistent application, incident management and weighting of responsible sourcing through the sourcing process.\n\n## Managing sustainability risk\n\nGlobal supply chains can generate economic growth and contribute significantly to social development. But, as businesses seek to diversify sources of supply or further integrate into new markets or local economies, there is an increased risk of fewer decent work opportunities, which may lead to human rights violations, including the use of child labour, modern slavery, forced labour and human tra/fficking.\n\nOur responsible sourcing programme enables us to identify some of these risks and help our suppliers make ethical decisions when purchasing goods and services.\n\nIn 2020, our operations spent approximately $11.5 billion with suppliers, of which $10.0 billion was with local suppliers. Our expenditure with designated suppliers was $2.6 billion, representing 23% of total supplier expenditure, including $0.5 billion with host communities in the direct vicinity of our South African operations. In addition, as a result of our focused inclusive procurement ambition to increase procurement spend with suppliers in the host communities close to our operations, other regions measured a further $0.2 billion of procurement spend with communities in the direct vicinity of our operations.\n\n## Engaging with suppliers\n\nIn 2020, we continued engaging with suppliers who demonstrated potential for risk. However, with the onset of Covid-19 and mindful of the disruptions caused to supplier businesses due to lockdown and social distancing measures, we reduced the target number of suppliers for assessments to 50. By the end of 2020, over 430 supplier self-assessments and four on-site assessments had been conducted. Furthermore, 548 supplier representatives attended human rights, modern slavery and responsible sourcing capacity building programmes.\n\n## Global CSI expenditure by type (1)\n\n$'000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Community development                    | 41,971   | 34%   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Health and welfare                       | 35,061   | 28%   |\n| Education and training                   | 23,302   | 19%   |\n| Disaster and energency relief            | 6,815    | 5%    |\n| Water and sanitation                     | 6,688    | 5%    |\n| Other                                    | 6,658    | 5%    |\n| Institutional capacity development       | 2,766    | 5%    |\n| Sports, art, culture and heritage        | 1,103    | 1%    |\n| Environment, energy   and climate change | 901      | 1%    |\n| Total                                    | 125,265  |       |\n\n- (1) Discrepancies may occur due to rounding.\n\n## Global CSI expenditure by region (1)\n\n$'000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Africa         | 65,544   | 52%   |\n|----------------|----------|-------|\n| Americas       | 51,800   | 41%   |\n| United Kingdom | 3,469    | 3%    |\n| Australia      | 2,419    | 2%    |\n| Rest of World  | 2,033    | 2%    |\n| Total          | 125,265  |       |",

Owing to social-distancing requirements brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, this annual global event was held online.\n\n## WeCare: Our global\n\nDuring 2020, society experienced the greatest threat to global health in a century. The Covid-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to all companies, both commercially and as employers and drivers of broader economic activity, and was felt most acutely in those communities that play host to our operations.\n\n## Building resilience in our own ecosystem\n\nOur mines and host communities, which are also often home to much of our workforce, operate as an ecosystem and both must be healthy to prosper. By thinking holistically across those ecosystems, and recognising that speed was of the essence, Anglo American developed a response that was true to our Values and firmly aligned with our Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives .\n\n## Supporting lives and livelihoods\n\nWe acted quickly at the onset of the pandemic to support the lives and livelihoods of our workforce and host communities through the health, social and economic e/ffects caused by Covid-19. We developed and rolled out an extensive health awareness and broader support programme, called WeCare, designed specifically to help protect the health and well-being of our more than 95,000 people and our host communities. WeCare is helping colleagues and communities better understand how to protect themselves and others from catching the virus, monitor their health to pick up early symptoms, and to manage their well-being.\n\n'In the years to come, when we look back on this uncertain and frightening period in our lives and in our history, we hope to see a positive legacy left by our response to it.'\n\n## Mark Cutifani\n\nChief Executive of Anglo American\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- In Chile (featured), as elsewhere in the Group, an active screening strategy was established early on in the pandemic to identify people with Covid-19 cases so that they could be isolated, thereby reducing transmission of the virus and allowing operational continuity.",

We developed employee support programmes to assist with mental health management, including via our employee app and online events and other digital materials.\n\nLiving with dignity - our partnerships with health authorities and charities are helping us to identify abuse cases and people at risk of gender-based and other forms of domestic violence, and direct them to the support they need. There are three key areas of focus: raising awareness of support; case identification and referral; and supporting safe spaces.\n\nFor more information\n\nSee page 49\n\nCommunity response - We designed a wide-ranging community response plan to support communities through the social and economic e/ffects of the pandemic, including: public information campaigns aimed at health and hygiene; health screening and Covid-19 testing; support for health service provision; continuation and expansion of essential services (e.g. water, energy, accommodation); food package distribution; support for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs; support for teachers and students; job training; and regional development planning. The plan was developed by engaging with communities, traditional and faith leaders, and government agencies, and is tailored to each community's specific needs. The guidance to our operations on how best to respond to the needs of their local communities has also been made publicly available for other companies to use (1) .\n\nWhat is more, many of our sites have a significant number of contractors. We continue to work closely with them and third-party suppliers to manage risks, ensure alignment with Anglo American protocols, and protect their health, well-being and livelihoods.\n\n## Living out our Values\n\nCovid-19 has drawn renewed attention to the role of business in society. Anglo American constructed a broad-based response that has been warmly welcomed by our employees and stakeholders alike, based primarily on our Value of Care and Respect. WeCare prioritises the health and safety of our workforce, and our host communities - while ensuring the continuity of our business, in the interests of all stakeholders. Going into 2021, we continue to provide appropriate support as we transition from preventing and responding to the pandemic into the all-important phase of sustained recovery.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic Report\n\nSafety comes foremost in everything we do; we train, equip and empower our people to work safely every day. We believe, too, that creating an inclusive and diverse working environment and culture that supports high performance and innovative thinking gives our business a competitive advantage.\n\n## Adopting a zero mindset\n\nOur main priority is to protect the health and safety of our people, the communities around our operations and the environment. And we have shown consistent improvement across the business - with an 87% reduction in fatal incidents, an 85% reduction in health incidents and a 97% reduction in environment incidents all achieved since 2013.\n\nTo further accelerate progress, in 2020, we updated our safety, health and environment (SHE) policy. A key element of this update is focusing on achieving a 'zero mindset', meaning that we aim for zero accidents and zero incidents and, importantly, zero repeats. If something does happen, we investigate the causes, act to remedy these, and share the lessons learned across the Group with the aim of preventing repeat or similar incidents.\n\n## Approach and policies\n\nWhile we have seen an improvement in our overall safety record, sadly fatal incidents continue to occur. Our Elimination of Fatalities programme is designed to address systemic safety risk areas across the Group. The multi-disciplinary programme is aligned with our Operating Model 'mantra' of doing the right work, at the right time, in the right way, to safely and responsibly deliver our work.\n\nThe programme covers a wide range of topics from culture and operational leadership, to specific safety risks, such as the use of explosives, emergency response and light vehicles, with our business units implementing the actions or minimum requirements set out by each site review, standard or procedures. In 2020, where Covid-19 a/ffected our ability to conduct some site reviews in person, these were conducted virtually.\n\nWe have also invested in technology and equipment to keep our people out of harm's way. Technology - such as video analytics, collision avoidance systems, and advanced driver assistance systems - play a critical role in advancing safety, and we are exploring multiple options. Our Technology for Safety Forum is tasked with finding support for, and scaling up of, technology interventions that have the potential to change our safety performance.\n\nAnglo American's safety, health and environment results a/ffect the performance-based remuneration of all employees in the business, and health and safety targets are included within the annual performance incentives for executive directors and senior management.\n\n## Group safety performance\n\nIn 2020, we delivered our safest year yet, recording the fewest injuries and lowest injury frequency rates on record. In the first eight months of the year, we experienced zero work-related loss of life incidents at our managed operations, the longest fatal-free period in our 100+ year history. This was a significant achievement, particularly in light of the unforeseen challenges and disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, which included temporary operational shutdowns followed by rapid restarts at almost every one of our operations.\n\nDespite our best-ever safety performance, it is with deep sadness that we report the loss of two colleagues in work-related incidents at our managed operations. During September, Jabulane Nkambule and Lindile Manzingi, from Zibulo colliery and Dishaba mine respectively, sustained fatal injuries in separate fall of ground incidents. Our deepest condolences are extended to the family, friends, and colleagues of those we have lost.\n\n## Total number of fatal injuries and fatal injury frequency rate 2013-2020\n\nLost-time injuries, medical treatment cases and total recordable case frequency rate 2013-2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThree people were also fatally injured in separate incidents at our independently managed joint operations. We mourn the loss of Joao Abilio Silindane at Kroondal, a business managed by SibanyeStillwater, and Dennis Hlengani Mdaka and Johannes Mahlelela at Modikwa mine, managed by African Rainbow Minerals.\n\nEach of these tragic incidents reminds us of the path ahead and the need to redouble our e/fforts to eliminate fatalities. A thorough investigation has taken place at each of our managed operations to identify the causes of the incidents and to share lessons learned across the Group, with the aim of preventing repeat or similar incidents.\n\nIn 2020, we recorded 444 occupational injuries requiring medical treatment, 15% fewer than in 2019 (2019: 529), improving our total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) by 3% to 2.14 (2019: 2.21). The improvement in our lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) was a nominal 1%, largely due to reduced working hours as a result of Covid-19.\n\nWe have achieved this overall reduction in TRCFR and LTIFR through driving leadership accountability, strengthening our culture, and by implementing various operationally targeted safety interventions. These included CEO safety summits with senior leaders from across the business units; instituting minimum mandatory critical controls for common fatal risks; sharing of lessons learned and actions taken from incidents across the organisation; safety stand-downs (voluntary events to pause production and talk with employees about safety) and enhanced reporting and progress tracking of safety improvement initiatives.",

        "page_content": "## Health\n\nIn 2020, we had to quickly pivot our robust health work plan to meet the challenges of the pandemic. Around the world, our teams leveraged our resources, skills and expertise to support our employees, their families and communities in safeguarding their health. Our response to Covid-19 is covered below, and in depth on pages 44-45.\n\n## Approach and policies\n\nOur overarching approach to health is covered by the SHE Policy and SHE Way, our Safety, Health and Environment management framework. See page 38 for more on this.\n\n## Our total health approach\n\nOur total health approach to managing health and wellness is aligned with World Health Organization principles. It covers employee health, the physical work environment, community health, social context and workplace culture. This approach also recognises our responsibility to support the mental health of our people.\n\n## Our Workplace Health Standard\n\nIn 2020, we published the Workplace Health Standard, expanding the scope of our 2019 Occupational Health Standard. This defines the minimum that needs to be done to e/ffectively manage occupational exposure risk, occupational diseases, occupational injuries, and overall well-being and mental health.\n\n## Performance\n\n## Responding to Covid-19\n\nOur focus through the pandemic has been to support the lives and livelihoods of our workforce and host communities targeting the health, social and economic e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic through our global WeCare response programme. We have continued to pay colleagues who were unable or not required to work during lockdowns and have supported those with personal health circumstances, who cannot return to work while the risk of a Covid-19 contamination persists, and who cannot perform their duties remotely.\n\nWe introduced several initiatives through WeCare in 2020. Perhaps the most ambitious of these undertakings was putting in place dedicated Covid-19 testing facilities at our operations, for both our sta/ff and communities. We also introduced or repurposed various technologies to support our employees throughout the crisis. Examples of this include a new self-monitoring feature for our Engage app; tracking Covid-19 cases via our laboratory information management system, TrakCare; contact tracing to identify high risk contacts; and pre-screening visitors to assess their Covid-19 health status before they visit our operations.\n\n## Occupational exposure\n\nIn 2020, there were 30 reported new cases of occupational disease (2019: 39). We continue to strive to reduce the number of employees exposed to noise and hazards harmful to health; however, we realise that increased e/fforts must be made and are embarking on a number of initiatives to address this.\n\n## Managing HIV and TB\n\nWe have been a corporate leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS for more than 20 years. From providing free testing and treatment to all our employees, to making a Group-level policy commitment against stigma and HIV/AIDS discrimination, we have made a significant contribution towards the elimination of HIV and AIDS. In 2016, we aligned our HIV/AIDS targets to UNAIDS 90/90/90 strategy which means that: 90% of our people living with HIV know their HIV status; 90% of those diagnosed with HIV are receiving sustained anti-retroviral therapy; and 90% of those receiving anti-retroviral therapy have viral suppression, meaning the viral load is so low as to be undetectable.\n\nWhile we have made significant progress since the first two targets were included in our ambitions, Covid-19 continues to have a severe impact on people's ability and willingness to access preventative healthcare. As a result, while 89% of our employees in southern Africa\n\nknew their status at year end, this was lower than in the previous year (2019: 94%), and 1% short of our target of 90%. We did, however, meet our second target. In 2020, 233 new cases of HIV were reported, and zero HIV/AIDS-related deaths. This translates into an incidence rate of 0.89%.\n\nFor 2020, the TB incidence was 138 per 100,000 compared with 230 per 100,000 in 2019. Although the reasons for the reduction in incidence remain unclear, it may be partly a result of the Covid-19 prevention interventions and good compliance levels on disease management.\n\n## Helping our people thrive\n\nWe aim to attract the best people in the industry, putting them into the right roles to suit their talents, and serve our business needs - now and into the future. Empowering our employees through professional and personal development opportunities, we give them the support they need to thrive and, by continuously engaging with our employees, we are able to build relationships based on trust. Living our Values, we aim to become an inclusive workplace where everyone - without exception - can bring their full selves to work.\n\n## Organisation Model\n\nOur Organisation Model ensures we have the right people in the right roles doing the right value-adding work at the right time, with clear accountabilities minimising work duplication and increasing organisation capability and e/ffectiveness. Along with our Values and our Operating Model, the Organisation Model supports the delivery of positive outcomes through a set of structures, systems and processes. The model creates consistency in how we approach organisational issues, by providing a common language about organisations and management.\n\nA key component of the Organisation Model is leadership and team e/ffectiveness, which touches on all employees. Our structured process streamlines the way work is aligned to business outcomes, assigned and monitored, as well as how feedback is given to teams and individuals. This process, and our TEAM+ tool, promotes active collaboration and collective responsibility through delivering against shared targets and commitments. This approach directly a/ffects approximately 11,000 senior employees.\n\n## Our Future of Work programme\n\nOur Future of Work programme involves taking a long term approach to planning for the roles and skills that we will need to fill to operate the mines of the future.\n\nAs the pace of change in our industry continues to increase, this organisational capability will enable us to be proactive, giving us a competitive advantage. Our objective is to provide our people with the tools they will need to step up to roles that have evolved, and completely new ones.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the need for new work models, along with many aspects of our Future of Work programme, including remote working and digital learning. We responded by bringing forward changes that we had planned for a threeto five-year timeframe, making them happen over the course of months rather than years. Prioritising the health and safety of our employees, we put in place the infrastructure required to quickly transition to remote/home working in a number of cases, as we reduced activities as needed to comply with regional and local legislation.\n\n## Performance management and continuous learning\n\nIn today's talent-driven business environment, learning and development are more important than ever. We are meeting these needs through a range of learning experiences that increasingly includes online, virtual and immersive learning, to renew and update the skills and behaviours of our people on an ongoing basis.\n\nLaunched in 2019, LEARN+ is our main learning platform. Through a single, user-friendly interface, it makes it easy for our employees and people in our communities to access our growing range of online learning resources.",

We still have much to do, and it will take time. But our actions to date demonstrate our commitment to these ideals. We have a robust policy framework and activities ranging from colleague networks, apprenticeships, a Global mentoring programme and a zero-tolerance approach to bullying, harassment and victimisation.\n\n## Diversity performance\n\nWe report on our gender pay gap in our UK operations, in line with legislative requirements. As of 4 April 2020, our UK average (mean) gender pay gap for Anglo American Services (UK) Ltd was 47% and our median pay gap was 36%. This was primarily due to the high representation of men in the most senior management roles in our UK head o/ffice - an issue mirrored across our sector, and one that we are committed to addressing.\n\nWe continue to make progress against our gender representation goal of 33% female representation by 2023 at all management levels, in every business unit and Group function. In 2020, we began monitoring our talent pools by gender to ensure we are identifying talented women in our pipeline.\n\nWe have set a similar target for 33% of our Group Management Committee and those reporting to the committee to be women by 2023. The proportion of women at this level grew to 27% (2019: 24%). The percentage of female employees across our organisation has also grown from 21% in 2019 to 23% in 2020.\n\nAt year end, the proportion of our permanent employees aged under 30 was 10%, 70% aged between 30 and 50, and the remaining 20% over 50 years of age.\n\nIn South Africa, historically disadvantaged South Africans held 68% of our management positions.\n\n## Employee engagement and workplace relations\n\nWe recognise that there are many di/fferent aspects to employee engagement. These include our success in building a diverse and inclusive working environment, and the steps we take to engage employees directly.\n\nEstablished in 2019, our Global Workforce Advisory Panel helps the Board to better understand the views of our workforce, in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Panel is made up of employee representatives from each country where we have a significant presence, and is chaired by our senior independent director, Byron Grote.\n\nIn 2020, we shared the results and Groupwide actions from the global employee engagement survey undertaken in 2019 with all colleagues and the Board. Almost 39,000 employees answered questions in the survey, which covered culture and values, safety, strategy and purpose, leadership, inclusion and diversity. The survey suggested an employee engagement score of 83%.\n\nOur employee voluntary turnover rate for the year was 1.5% (2019: 2.3%). New hires represented 11% of our permanent employees in 2020, in line with the prior year.\n\n## Supporting labour rights\n\nWe have signed the United Nations Global Compact, and our Human Rights Policy commits us to the labour rights principles set out in the core conventions of the International Labour Organization. These include the right to freedom of association and\n\ncollective bargaining, non-discrimination, and the eradication of child and forced labour.\n\nOur Responsible Sourcing Standard stipulates that all suppliers shall respect all labour and human rights throughout their own value chain.\n\nIn 2020, approximately 70% of our permanent workforce was represented by worker organisations and covered by collective bargaining agreements. There were no recorded incidents of industrial action lasting more than one week in 2020 at our managed operations.\n\nThere were no reported incidents of under-age or forced labour at our operations during 2020.\n\n## Building a purpose-led culture\n\nWe expect our employees and business partners to behave ethically, always. We expect them to consistently show care and respect for colleagues, communities and the environment in which we operate. These expectations are at the heart of our culture and are embedded in our Code of Conduct and Business Integrity Policy.\n\nOur Code of Conduct is a single point of reference for everyone associated with us, providing a comprehensive understanding of our policies and procedures. It sets out how we behave in line with our Values, and how we live our Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives . In 2020, we carried out a review of our Code of Conduct, resulting in a small number of minor refinements.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nOur Business Integrity Policy sets out the standards of conduct we require at every level within our business - including our subsidiaries and managed joint operations - in combating all types of corrupt behaviour. As of 2020, industry associations of which we are a member are also required to adhere to the Policy requirements, or have comparable standards.\n\nWe conducted face-to-face business integrity training for more than 300 of our higher-risk sta/ff, on topics such as interacting with public o/fficials and the use of intermediaries. A further 8,000 employees underwent Code of Conduct training online.\n\nWe engage with our industry on business ethics in order to both share and learn from best practices. We are also a member of the board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).\n\n## Benchmarking anti-corruption initiatives\n\nWe have increased our collaboration with Transparency International's Corporate Anti-Corruption Benchmark, and played a more active role in transparency programmes. The recommendations from the resulting report confirmed that our current initiatives and resources are being applied in the right areas to drive improvement.\n\nIn 2020, we embarked on a number of new initiatives, correlating with Transparency International's benchmarking exercises for 2019 and 2020. We developed and implemented mechanisms to bolster our responsibilities regarding the implementation of our Group policies and monitoring and reporting of compliance. Such initiatives included enhancing our Group compliance management system and our intermediary risk management process.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nYourVoice is our confidential reporting service for employees, contractors, suppliers and other stakeholders, using a reporting platform provided by an independent multilingual whistleblowing service provider. It enables stakeholders to raise concerns about potentially unethical, unlawful or unsafe conduct or practices that conflict with our Values and Code of Conduct.\n\nDuring 2020, we received 614 reports through YourVoice, a 22% increase from 2019. Of the 614 reports received, 78% were closedout in 2020, with a 31% substantiation rate. Appropriate actions were taken against allegations substantiated in accordance with our policies.",

In consequence, we have extended our e/fforts to end all types of violence beyond the mine gate and to playing our part in providing support to employees' family members in our host communities.\n\n## Tackling gender-based violence\n\nIn November 2019 - well before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic - we announced measures to address gender-based violence (GBV) at work, homes, schools and mining communities.\n\nIn early 2020, as the e/ffects of the pandemic on domestic violence globally were becoming clearer, we started working on a plan to address Covid-19-related risks and impacts. It became increasingly obvious to us that we needed to rapidly scale up our response, particularly in South Africa which already had a high GBV incident rate and where the lockdowns were among the most stringent in the world.\n\nGetting the project up and running in South Africa demanded a multi-pronged approach, including:\n\n- - We immediately used every channel at our disposal to communicate how those who found themselves in harm's way could access support such as police, legal, medical, and counselling help.\n- - The clinical associates we deployed to conduct Covid-19 screening became our eyes and ears to identify and refer cases of domestic abuse.\n- - Through the Anglo American Foundation, we secured R3.6 million to support shelters in our mining communities with basic and Covid-19-related needs, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), in partnership with the National Shelter Movement. De Beers donated an additional $200,000 to support shelters in southern Africa and Canada. Our business units went even further by helping with infrastructure improvements and capacity building.\n- - Our PGMs business revised its sexual harassment investigation process and employee assistance programme and enhanced its support to victims of GBV. A buddy system, in which no woman will ever work without another woman, is being strictly enforced. Coal South Africa now includes a module on GBV and harassment in its induction programmes, and has ramped up bullying, harassment and victimisation training, along with making physical changes in the workplace.\n- - We have completed an update of our policies and procedures relating to GBV and sexual harassment. This aligns our processes with the Group Bullying, Harassment and Victimisation Policy, as well as with International Labour Organization Convention 190, which represents one of the most progressive approaches to addressing workplace violence and harassment.\n\nDomestic violence is recognised globally as a significant human rights violation and public health concern. It was imperative, therefore, to extend our e/fforts to end violence beyond the mine gate and play our part in providing support to employees' family members and others in our host communities - and, in turn, strengthening our capacity within our own business to help realise the UN's vision of safe spaces for all.\n\nAlready, we are seeing significant emotional shifts in behaviour. Leaders have opened up about their own experiences, while employees are openly talking about the issue, demonstrating that we are moving beyond gender-based violence being a taboo subject. There has also been an increase in cases reported, which we believe is because people now feel safe to speak up.",

        "page_content": "## Capital allocation\n\n## A strong focus on capital discipline\n\nUnderpinning our strategy, we have a value-focused approach to capital allocation, with clear prioritisation: sustaining capital to maintain asset integrity (including Reserve Life); then the base dividend to our shareholders, determined on a 40% underlying earnings-based payout ratio; while ensuring a strong balance sheet. Based on a balanced approach, and considering carefully our Sustainable Mining Plan, particularly in relation to addressing the challenges of climate change as a key lens, discretionary capital is then either allocated to growth investments or upgrades to our portfolio. Discretionary investments are subject to a demanding risk framework and must meet our stringent value criteria, after which excess capital is considered for additional returns to shareholders.\n\nDisciplined capital allocation throughout the cycle is critical to protecting and enhancing returns for our shareholders' invested capital, given the long term and capital-intensive nature of our business. Our aim is to provide a balanced o/ffering of a strong balance sheet, which reduces risk and creates opportunity for counter-cyclical investment, attractive shareholder returns and value-adding disciplined growth.\n\nDuring 2020, our focus was on continuing to improve our competitive position, progressing the construction of our Quellaveco copper project in Peru, and completing the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc, while also re-phasing certain capital projects in light of Covid-19-related disruption. We will continue to allocate the appropriate capital across our portfolio of assets, to both sustain our business and to protect and enhance value.\n\n## Balance sheet flexibility\n\nOur capital allocation framework is underpinned by our strong balance sheet, which allows us to deliver on our commitment to base dividends and enables value-accretive discretionary capital allocation through the cycle. Our near term objective is to ensure the Group's net debt/underlying EBITDA ratio does not exceed 1.5x, at the bottom of the cycle, without there being a clear plan to recover.\n\nNet debt at 31 December 2020 was $5.6 billion (2019: $4.6 billion), resulting in a net debt/underlying EBITDA ratio of 0.6x, lower than our target ratio. The $0.9 billion increase in net debt was driven by inventory increases at PGMs and De Beers, expected to be released during 2021 and 2022. Sustaining attributable free cash inflows of $2.7 billion were used towards growth capital expenditure of $1.4 billion, dividends paid to Anglo American plc shareholders of $0.9 billion, the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc (including debt acquired) of $0.7 billion and completion of the share buyback programme announced in July 2019, of $0.2 billion.\n\nGroup liquidity levels remained conservative, with $7.5 billion of cash (2019: $6.3 billion) and $10.0 billion of undrawn committed facilities (2019: $8.7 billion). The weighted average maturity on outstanding bonds increased to 6.3 years (2019: 4.5 years). During the first half of 2020, S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service both rea/ffirmed the Group rating of BBB and Baa2 respectively; however, Moody's Investors Service placed the Group on negative outlook, primarily due to perceived potential impacts of Covid-19 on the sector and multiple downgrades to the South African sovereign credit rating.\n\nDiscretionary capital options\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPortfolio upgrade\n\nFuture project options\n\nAdditional shareholder returns\n\n## Sustaining capital\n\nWe continue to focus on capital discipline and sustaining capital e/fficiency, while maintaining the operational integrity of all our assets. Sustaining capital comprises stay-in-business, capitalised development and stripping, and life-extension expenditure, less the proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment. For 2021-2023, we expect sustaining capital expenditure to be within a range of $3.7-4.2 billion per annum, consisting of $3.0 billion of baseline sustaining capital and $0.7-0.9 billion in attractive life-extension projects, primarily at our iron ore, diamonds and PGMs assets, and pre-investing for future growth at the Collahuasi copper joint operation through the construction of a desalination plant ($0.3 billion (Anglo American 44% share) in each of 2022 and 2023). Our longer term guidance on stay-in-business and stripping expenditure is $3.0 billion per annum, plus additional life-extension investments as approved.\n\nIn July 2020, the Board approved the development at Kumba Iron Ore of a new pit, Kapstevel South, and associated infrastructure at Kolomela to help sustain a higher output of c.13 Mtpa and extend the remaining life of mine to 2032. Pit establishment and waste stripping are commencing in 2021, with first ore expected in 2024.\n\n## Commitment to base dividends\n\nOur clear commitment to a sustainable base dividend remains a critical part of the overall capital allocation approach and is demonstrated through our dividend policy of a 40% payout ratio based on underlying earnings, paid each half year.\n\nOur dividend policy provides shareholders with increased cash returns upon improvement in product prices, while retaining balance sheet flexibility during periods of weaker pricing. The Group paid dividends of $0.6 billion in May 2020 (in relation to second half 2019 underlying earnings), and $0.3 billion in September 2020 (in relation to first half 2020 underlying earnings). In line with the policy, the Board proposes a final dividend of 40% of second half underlying earnings, equal to $0.72 per share, bringing the total dividends paid and proposed in respect of 2020 to $1.00 per share.",

        "page_content": "## Discretionary capital options\n\nStrict value criteria are applied to the assessment of Anglo American's portfolio of future growth options. For major greenfield projects, we will sequence their development and we will consider including partners where appropriate. The Group will continue to maintain optionality to progress with valueaccretive projects.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Group returned $0.2 billion to shareholders via an on-market share buyback programme, completing the $1 billion share buyback programme which commenced in July 2019. The programme was executed at a weighted average price of \u00a318.96.\n\nStrong progress continues at Quellaveco, with the project currently tracking on schedule, despite the impact of Covid-19-related disruptions, with execution having been well ahead of schedule prior to the pandemic, and all applicable milestones achieved. The Group's share of capital expenditure in 2020 was $0.8 billion. We expect our share to increase to $0.8-1.0 billion in 2021. The Group has further approved, in February 2021, the construction of a coarse particle recovery plant at Quellaveco. This technology will initially allow retreatment of coarse particles from flotation tailings to improve recoveries by c. 3% on average over the life of the mine. Commissioning of the new plant is expected in 2022.\n\nWe continue to progress studies on organic growth opportunities to improve the existing business. For example, expansion options are currently under way for the Mogalakwena PGMs complex and the Collahuasi copper joint operation, as well as a pre-feasibility study for the expansion of the Moranbah-Grosvenor coal handling and preparation plant to increase capacity by 4-6 Mtpa.\n\nIn line with our FutureSmart Mining \u2122 programme, the Group is also investing $0.2-0.5 billion per annum of discretionary capital in technology and innovation-related initiatives to drive improvements across our existing portfolio of assets.\n\nIn 2020, our portfolio management strategy stayed focused on continuously improving asset quality and our competitive position to ensure we have a business that delivers sustainable free cash flows and returns to our shareholders. In this regard, in 2020, the Group commenced, or completed, a number of transactions.\n\nIn the first half of 2020, we completed the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc, which has been developing a major new polyhalite project in the UK. Anglo American is continuing to develop the Woodsmith project in the north east of England to access the world's largest known deposit of polyhalite, a natural mineral fertiliser product containing potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium. The polyhalite ore will be granulated at a materials handling facility to produce a fertiliser product - known as POLY4 that will be exported to a network of customers in overseas markets from our dedicated port. The integration of the Woodsmith project into Anglo American is ongoing, with a technical review on track to be completed by mid-2021.\n\nIn May 2020, we confirmed our plans to work towards an exit from our remaining thermal coal operations in South Africa, with a demerger being our likely preferred exit option, with a primary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange for the demerged business. We are making good progress to prepare the operations as a stand-alone business. We will continue to consider other exit options as we engage with stakeholders as part of our commitment to a responsible transition.\n\nIn December 2020, we completed the transaction to provide for the equalisation of ownership across our integrated metallurgical coal operations at Moranbah North and Grosvenor in Australia, through the sale of a 12% interest in Grosvenor mine to the minority joint operation participants in Moranbah North.\n\nThe Group also received $0.2 billion of deferred consideration in respect of previous divestments by PGMs.\n\n## Group capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure increased to $4.1 billion for the year (2019: $3.8 billion), with rigorous capital discipline continuing to underpin the planning and execution of all projects.\n\nSustaining capital expenditure decreased to $2.6 billion (2019: $3.0 billion), driven by reduced stripping and development expenditure, principally at De Beers and Metallurgical Coal, completion of the life-extension investment at the Khwezela thermal coal mine in South Africa, favourable foreign exchange rates, and deferrals as a result of Covid-19-related restrictions.\n\nGrowth capital expenditure increased to $1.4 billion (2019: $0.8 billion), owing to increased expenditure at Quellaveco of $0.8 billion, net of Mitsubishi funding (capital expenditure on a 100% basis at Quellaveco was $1.3 billion), and at the Woodsmith project of $0.3 billion.\n\nWe expect total capital expenditure to increase to between $5.7-6.2 billion per annum in 2021 and 2022.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\n| $ million                                                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Stay-in-business                                         | 1,566  | 1,656  |\n| Development and stripping                                | 769    | 976    |\n| Life-extension projects                                  | 296    | 358    |\n| Proceeds from disposal of property,  plant and equipment | (7)    | (8)    |\n| Sustaining capital                                       | 2,624  | 2,982  |\n| Growth projects                                          | 1,438  | 847    |\n| Total                                                    | 4,062  | 3,829  |\n| Capitalised operating cash flows                         | 63     | 11     |\n| Total capital expenditure                                | 4,125  | 3,840  |",

        "page_content": "## Managing risk e/ffectively\n\nThe e/ffective management of risk is integral to good management practice and fundamental to living up to our Purpose and delivering our strategy. By understanding, prioritising and managing risk, Anglo American safeguards our people, our assets, our legal position, our Values and reputation and the environment, and identifies opportunities to best serve the long term interest of all our stakeholders. As understanding our risks and developing appropriate responses are critical to our future success, we are committed to an e/ffective, robust system of risk identification, and an e/ffective response to such risks, in order to support the achievement of our objectives.\n\n## How does risk relate to our strategy?\n\nRisks can arise from events outside of our control or from operational matters. Each of the risks described on the following pages can have an impact on our ability to deliver our strategy.\n\n## Viability statement\n\n## Context\n\nAn understanding of our business model and strategy is key to the assessment of our prospects. Our strategy is to:\n\n- - Secure, develop and operate a portfolio of high quality and long life assets that deliver sustainable shareholder returns\n- - Implement an innovation-led approach to sustainable mining from discovery to delivering products to customers\n- - Create an inclusive and diverse working environment to encourage and support a high performance culture and innovative thinking.\n\nDetails of our business model are found on pages 10-11 and more on our strategy is provided on page 8.\n\nRestrictions on the Group's operations from Covid-19 peaked during the first half of 2020, significantly easing thereafter following e/ffective adoption of Covid-19-safe working practices by the Group, which were strengthened by our working with host governments. Although price performance and volatility showed significant variation across our diversified product portfolio in 2020, the Group's realised basket price across all commodities exceeded the prior year's, though ongoing geopolitical and macro-economic uncertainties are expected to cause continued commodity price volatility. Against that background, the Board maintains a cautious appetite for major new projects and investments - and with the proviso that they should be world class orebodies and can demonstrate clear potential to benefit from competitive cost positions and long reserve lives. Large greenfield projects are likely to be considered for syndication with other investors at the appropriate stage of a project's development, and for value, as a means of reducing our risk profile and capital requirements.\n\n## The assessment process and key assumptions\n\nAssessment of the Group's prospects is based upon the Group's strategy, its financial plan and principal risks. During 2020, the focus was on taking steps to ensure Covid-19-safe working environments, driving e/fficiencies through the operations and upgrading the quality of our portfolio in order to improve cash flow generation, strengthening the balance sheet and creating sustainable value through disciplined allocation of capital.\n\nA financial forecast covering the next three years is prepared based on the context of the strategic plan and is reviewed on a regular basis to reflect changes in circumstances. The financial forecast is based on a number of key assumptions, the most important of which include product prices, exchange rates, estimates of production, production costs and future capital expenditure. In addition, the forecast does not assume the renewal of existing debt or the raising of new debt. A key component of the financial forecast and strategic plan is the life of mine plans created for each operation, providing expected annual production volumes over the anticipated economic life of mine.\n\nThe principal risks are those that we believe could prevent the Group from delivering its strategic objectives. A number of these risks are deemed catastrophic to the Group's prospects, including the impacts of a tailings dam failure, fire and slope wall failure risks, and have been considered as part of the Group's viability.\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nThe assessment of viability has been made with reference to the Group's current position and expected performance over a threeyear period, using budgeted product prices and expected foreign exchange rates. Financial performance and cash flows have then been subjected to stress and sensitivity analysis over the three-year period using a range of severe, but plausible scenarios. Scenarios were selected for stress testing based upon an assessment of the Group's principal risks, and each includes a risk deemed catastrophic to the Group. The scenarios tested include:\n\n- - Product price reductions of up to 20% from budget prices over three years, with no o/ffsetting foreign exchange rate improvement\n- - Operational incidents that have a significant impact on production at key sites in the Group\n- - The impact of a cyber attack upon the Group's key information technology systems\n- - Technology developments a/ffecting demand for diamonds\n- - Technology developments in the automobile industry a/ffecting demand for PGMs\n- - The impact of a reduction in water supply in Chile, being a physical risk associated with climate change\n- - The impact of Covid-19 upon the Group's operations.\n\nThe Group's liquidity (defined as cash and undrawn committed facilities) was $17.5 billion at 31 December 2020. This is su/fficient to absorb the financial impact of each of the risks modelled in the stress and sensitivity analysis. However, if these scenarios were to materialise, the Group also has a range of additional options that enable us to maintain our financial strength, including reducing capital expenditure, the sale of assets, raising debt or reducing the dividend.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nThe directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the next three years. This period has been selected for the following reasons:\n\n- - The Group's strategy and budgeting process is aligned with a three-year view\n- - The volatility in commodity markets makes confidence in a longer assessment of prospects highly challenging.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nWe define an emerging risk as a risk that may become a principal risk in time but is not expected to materialise in the next five years.\n\nEmerging risks that are currently being monitored are:\n\n- - Failure to replace Ore Reserve depletion in key business units through exploration, projects or acquisitions\n- - Liabilities incurred as a result of environmental impairments\n- - Failure to deliver certain elements of the Sustainable Mining Plan could cause reputational damage, threaten the organisation's licence to operate, a/ffect future growth, and may also result in increased costs and a negative e/ffect on the Group's financial results\n- - Unexpected mine-closure liabilities that have the potential to increase costs.\n\nThe above risks are closely monitored and actively managed to minimise their threat.\n\n## Principal risks\n\nWe define a principal risk as a risk or combination of risks that would threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity of Anglo American. In addition to these principal risks, we continue to be exposed to other risks related to currency, inflation, community relations, environment, litigation and regulatory proceedings, changing social expectations, infrastructure and human resources. These risks are subject to our normal procedures to identify, implement and oversee appropriate mitigation actions, supported by internal audit work to provide assurance over the status of controls or mitigating actions. These principal risks are considered over the next three years as a minimum, but we recognise that many of them will be relevant for a longer period.\n\n- For more on principal risks See pages 54-57\n\n## Catastrophic risks\n\nWe also face certain risks that we deem catastrophic risks. These are very high severity, very low likelihood events that could result in multiple fatalities or injuries, an unplanned fundamental change to strategy or the way we operate, and have significant financial consequences. We do not consider likelihood when assessing these risks, as the potential impacts mean these risks must be treated as a priority. Catastrophic risks are included as principal risks.\n\n- For more on catastrophic risks See page 54\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nWe define risk appetite as 'the nature and extent of risk Anglo American is willing to accept in relation to the pursuit of its objectives'. We look at risk appetite from the context of severity of the consequences should the risk materialise, any relevant internal or external factors influencing the risk, and the status of management actions to mitigate or control the risk. A scale is used to help determine the limit of appetite for each risk, recognising that risk appetite will change over time.\n\nIf a risk exceeds appetite, it will threaten the achievement of objectives and may require a change to strategy. Risks that are approaching the limit of the Group's risk appetite may require management actions to be accelerated or enhanced to ensure the risks remain within appetite levels.\n\nFor catastrophic and operational risks, our risk appetite for exceptions or deficiencies in the status of our controls that have safety implications is very low. Our internal audit programme evaluates these controls with technical experts at operations and the results of that audit work will determine the risk appetite evaluation, along with the management response to any issues identified.\n\n- For more on the risk management and internal control systems and the review of their e/ffectiveness See pages 121-122\n\n## Summary\n\nOur risk profile evolved in 2020, largely as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which continues to have a significant impact on global society. No new significant risks were identified as a result of the pandemic; however, the likelihood and/or severity of a number of existing unwanted events that could impact Anglo American was reassessed. We elevated pandemic health risk to a principal risk in early 2020 as a result of the emerging Covid-19 threat.\n\nOur catastrophic risks are the highest priority risks, given the potential consequences.",

Catastrophic risks\n\nWe are exposed to the following risks we deem as potentially catastrophic: tailings dam failure; slope wall failure; mineshaft failure; and fire and explosion.\n\nRoot cause: Any of these risks may result from inadequate design or construction, adverse geological conditions, shortcomings in operational performance, natural events such as seismic activity or flooding, and failure of structures or machinery and equipment.\n\n## 2. Product prices\n\nGlobal macro-economic conditions leading to sustained low product prices and/or volatility.\n\nRoot cause: The most significant factors contributing to this risk at present are the impacts of government imposed lockdowns to manage the Covid-19 pandemic and associated increased levels of public debt; a future global pandemic or major health crisis; a fiscal crisis in a key economy or economic bloc; and armed conflict or terrorist event.\n\n## 3. Cyber security\n\nLoss or harm to our technical infrastructure and the use of technology within the organisation from malicious or unintentional sources.\n\nRoot cause: The frequency and sophistication of attempted criminally motivated cyber attacks is increasing.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\nImpact: Multiple fatalities and injuries, damage to assets, environmental damage, production loss, reputational damage and loss of licence to operate. Financial costs associated with recovery and liability claims may be significant.

Additional assurance work is conducted to assess the adequacy of controls associated with these risks.\n\nImpact: Low product prices can result in lower levels of cash flow, profitability and valuation. Debt costs may rise owing to ratings agency downgrades and the possibility of restricted access to funding. The Group may be unable to complete any divestment programme within the desired timescales or achieve expected values. The capacity to invest in growth projects is constrained during periods of low product prices - which may, in turn, a/ffect future performance.\n\nMitigation: Maintaining a conservative balance sheet and proactive management of debt facilities and the delivery of cash improvement and operational performance targets are the key mitigation strategies for this risk. Regular updates of economic analysis and product price assumptions are discussed with executive management and the Board.\n\nImpact: Theft or loss of intellectual property, financial losses, increased costs, reputational damage and operational disruption.\n\nMitigation: We have a dedicated Global Information Management Security team with appropriate specialist third-party support to oversee our network security. We have achieved UK Cyber Essentials Certification and an ongoing cyber awareness programme is in place across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk movement: No change.\n\nRisk appetite: Operating within the limits of our appetite.\n\nCommentary: These very high impact but very low frequency risks are treated with the highest priority.\n\nPillars of value:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk movement: Increased since 2019.

Safety\n\nFailure to eliminate fatalities.\n\nRoot cause: Fatalities may result from operational leaders, employees and contractors failing to apply safety rules and hazard identification, including non-compliance with critical controls.\n\n## 5. Climate change\n\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of our era and our commitment to being part of the global response presents both risks and opportunities.\n\nRoot cause: We are committed to the ongoing realignment of our portfolio in a responsible manner; however, di/fferent stakeholder expectations continue to evolve and are not always aligned. Long term demand for the metals and minerals produced and marketed by Anglo American may deviate from current assumptions. Changing weather patterns and an increase in extreme weather events may impact operational stability and our local communities. Our carbon emission reduction targets are partly reliant on new technologies that are at various stages of development.\n\n## 6. Operational stability\n\nUnplanned operational stoppages impacting production and profitability.\n\nRoot cause: Failure to implement and embed our Operating Model, maintain critical plant, machinery and infrastructure and operate in compliance with Anglo American's Technical Standards will a/ffect our performance levels. We are also exposed to risks of interruptions of power supply and the failure of third-party owned and operated infrastructure, e.g. rail networks and ports. Our operations may also be exposed to natural catastrophes and extreme weather events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact: A fatal incident is devastating for the bereaved family, friends and colleagues. Over the longer term, failure to provide a safe working environment will threaten our licence to operate.\n\nMitigation: All operations continue to implement safety improvement plans, with a focus on: e/ffective management of critical controls required to manage significant safety risks; learning from high potential incidents and hazards; embedding a safety culture; and leadership engagement and accountability. Our Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce oversees targeted improvement initiatives to further improve safety performance.\n\nImpact: Potential loss of stakeholder confidence leading to negative impact on value, cash flow and profitability. Operational disruption in the event of extreme weather events. Long term demand for metals and minerals mined and marketed by Anglo American may deviate from assumptions based on societal demands for climate change abatement. We may fail to achieve carbon reduction targets in the event that new technologies are not e/ffective or embedded in our operations.\n\nMitigation: We have articulated our climate change plans, policies and progress and engage with key stakeholders to ensure they understand them. Our Sustainable Mining Plan includes operation-specific and Group targets for reductions in carbon emissions, power and water usage.\n\nImpact: Inability to achieve production, cash flow or profitability targets. There are potential safety-related matters associated with unplanned operational stoppages, along with a loss of investor confidence.\n\nMitigation: Implementation of our Operating Model and compliance with Technical Standards, supported by operational risk management and assurance processes, is the key mitigation against this risk. Regular tracking and monitoring of progress against the underlying EBITDA targets is undertaken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk movement: No change.\n\nRisk appetite: Operating within the limits of our appetite.\n\nCommentary: While we continue to see an overall improvement in our safety performance, during 2020 there were two work-related fatalities in our managed operations, compared with four in 2019. This is still an unacceptable level and management remains fully committed to the elimination of fatalities.\n\nPillars of value:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk movement: Increased since 2019.

Pandemic\n\nLarge scale outbreak of infectious disease increasing morbidity and mortality over a wide geographic area.\n\nRoot cause: Human population growth, urbanisation, changes in land use, loss of biodiversity, exploitation of the natural environment, viral disease from animals and increased global travel and integration are all contributory causes of health pandemics.\n\n## 8. Political and regulatory\n\nUncertainty and adverse changes to mining industry regulation, legislation or tax regimes can occur in any country in which we operate.\n\nRoot cause: The Group has no control over political acts, actions of regulators, or changes in local tax regimes. Our licence to operate through mining rights is dependent on a number of factors, including compliance with regulations.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\nImpact: As has been witnessed by the Covid-19 pandemic, widespread consequences include the physical and mental health and well-being of our people and local communities; economic shocks and disruption; social unrest; an increase in political stresses and tensions, a rise in criminal acts that could impact Anglo American and the potential for increased resource nationalism.\n\nMitigation: Anglo American actively monitors global pandemic-potential diseases. In the event of a pandemic, our Group Crisis Management Team is activated at an early stage to direct the Group's response, prioritising the well-being of our people, their families and host communities, and ensuring the continuity of the operations.\n\nImpact: Uncertainty over future business conditions leads to a lack of confidence in making investment decisions, which can influence future financial performance. Increased costs can be incurred through additional regulations or resource taxes, while the ability to execute strategic initiatives that reduce costs or divest assets may also be restricted, all of which may reduce profitability and a/ffect future performance. Political instability can also result in civil unrest and nullification or non-renewal of existing agreements, mining permits, sales agreements or leases. These may adversely a/ffect the Group's operations or performance of those operations.\n\nMitigation: Anglo American has an active engagement strategy with governments, regulators and other stakeholders within the countries in which we operate, or plan to operate, as well as at an international level. We assess portfolio capital investments against political risks and avoid or minimise exposure to jurisdictions with unacceptable risk levels. We actively monitor regulatory and political developments at a national level, as well as global themes and international policy trends, on a continuous basis. See page 13 for more detail on how we engage with our key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk movement: Increased since 2019.

These factors could increase the political risks faced by the Group.\n\nPillars of value:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Corruption\n\nBribery or other forms of corruption committed by an employee or agent of Anglo American.\n\nRoot cause: Anglo American has operations in some countries where there is a relatively high risk of corruption.\n\n## 10. Water\n\nInability to obtain or sustain the level of water security needed to support operations over the current life of mine plan or future growth options.\n\nRoot cause: Poor water resource management or inadequate onsite storage, combined with reduced water supply at some operations as weather patterns change, can a/ffect production. Water is a shared resource with local communities and permits to use water in our operations are at risk if we do not manage the resource in a sustainable manner.\n\n## 11. Future demand\n\nDemand for metals and minerals produced and marketed by Anglo American may deviate from our assumptions.\n\nRoot cause: Technological developments and/or product substitution leading to reduced demand, growth in the circular economy and shifts in consumer preferences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact: Potential criminal investigations, adverse media attention and reputational damage. A possible negative impact on licensing processes and valuation.\n\nMitigation: A comprehensive anti-bribery and corruption policy and programme, including risk assessment, training and awareness, with active monitoring, are in place.\n\nImpact: Loss of production and inability to achieve cash flow or volume improvement targets. Damage to stakeholder relationships or reputational damage can result from failure to manage this critical resource.\n\nMitigation: Various projects have been implemented at operations most exposed to this risk, focused on: water e/fficiency; water security; water treatment; and discharge management; as well as alternative supplies. New technologies are being developed that will reduce water demand.\n\nImpact: Potential for negative impact on revenue, cash flow, profitability and value.\n\nMitigation: Regular reviews of production and financial plans, as well as longer term portfolio decisions, are based on extensive research. We monitor new business opportunities in line with our strategy to secure, develop and operate a portfolio of high quality and long life resource assets, from which we will deliver leading shareholder returns.

        "page_content": "## Marketplace review\n\n## Review of 2020\n\n## Markets review\n\n## Covid-19 pandemic hits global economic growth\n\nThe spread of Covid-19 and related societal restrictions had a significant negative impact on the global economy in 2020. The IMF estimates a 3.5% decline in global GDP for the year (2019: 2.8% growth). Transport, hospitality, catering and entertainment industries su/ffered the most in the pandemic. While less impacted by social distancing, manufacturing and logistics sectors were a/ffected by supply chain disruptions, as well as reductions in demand.\n\nIn China, commodity demand remained resilient owing to their early containment of the spread of the virus and it was the only major country - and one of only a few countries anywhere - to have delivered positive GDP growth in 2020, estimated by the IMF at 2.3%. Chinese growth was further supported by a strong recovery in exports to the US and other traditional trading partners, as Chinese producers filled the supply gaps left by other Covid-19-hit exporters.\n\nOther regions experienced significant contractions in economic activity, with continued high levels of virus transmission hampering key sectors, and unemployment remaining elevated. In the US, GDP contracted by an estimated 3.4% in 2020; the Eurozone by 7.2%; Latin America by 7.4%; and India by 8.0%. In the countries where we have our major operations, South Africa contracted by 7.5%; Botswana by 9.6%; Chile by 6.0%; Brazil by 4.5%; and Australia by 2.9%. Along with reductions in economic activity, emerging countries also saw weakening currencies against the US dollar. Rising commodity prices helped the South African rand and Chilean peso strengthen against the US dollar over the second half of the year.\n\nDespite the severe e/ffect on demand, prices for a number of Anglo American's products performed better than in 2019. The Covid-19-related disruptions in South Africa, where there is a high concentration of PGMs supply, coupled with the strengthening of emissions regulations in the automotive sector, resulted in a strong PGMs basket price performance, notably for palladium and rhodium. Iron ore also outperformed compared with 2019, supported by strong China steel production and disruptions in Brazilian supply.\n\nGlobal trade experienced significant challenges in 2020, with tendencies towards regionalisation. US-China trade tensions intensified and trade barriers and sanctions were maintained, weighing on economic growth.\n\n## Diamonds\n\nThe diamond industry started the year on a positive note as a result of improved consumer demand and retailer stocking at the end of 2019, but as Covid-19-related business and movement restriction led to store and factory closures, the diamond value chain came to a halt in the second quarter. In response, De Beers o/ffered customers flexibility on their pre-agreed allocations which, in turn, led to a decrease in purchases and manufacturing levels at cutting centres. As the year progressed, this action helped to balance inventory levels, as polished diamond manufacturing resumed, cutting and polishing recommenced gradually and the trade prepared for the end of year holiday selling season. These developments supported an improvement in midstream sentiment and rough diamond purchases in the final quarter, as well as firmer polished and rough diamond prices. Overall, these developments contributed to the average rough price index for De Beers diamonds decreasing by 10% in 2020.\n\nThe outlook for diamonds continues to be linked to economic growth, consumer sentiment/habits and the evolving public health situation in the main diamond consumer geographies.\n\n## Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)\n\nPGM prices performed particularly well in 2020, with palladium and rhodium both reaching record levels. Both metals benefited from tightening vehicle emissions legislation, which led to increased catalytic converter loadings, against a backdrop of low supply availability owing to Covid-19-related mine closures, particularly in South Africa.\n\nVehicle production, the key end-use sector for PGMs, was severely a/ffected by the pandemic initially but recovered swiftly to pre-pandemic levels in the important Chinese market, while other regions were slower to recover. Platinum demand, which has less exposure to the Chinese auto sector, where the majority of new vehicles are petrol-driven and therefore require palladium and rhodium loaded catalytic converters, recovered less well in the second half of the year. China's relative importance to industrial consumption resulted in a reduced negative impact on this sector globally.\n\n## Indexed 2020 prices\n\nAnglo American\n\n7%\n\nPGMs basket ($)\n\n51%\n\nIron ore\n\n17%\n\nCopper\n\n3%\n\nNickel\n\n(1)%\n\nDe Beers price index\n\n(10)%\n\nThermal coal\n\n(10)%\n\nHard coking coal\n\n(30)%\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although subsequently moderating, prices remained high at the end of the year by historical standards, with 2020 averaging $2,197/oz (2019: $1,539/oz).\n\nRhodium also had a strong start to the year, rising to above $13,000/oz in February, with renewed momentum in the second half resulting in the metal breaching a new record of $16,000/oz in November, and averaging $11,220/oz for the year as a whole (2019: $3,914/oz).\n\nThe platinum price was broadly in line with the prior year, averaging $885/oz compared with $864/oz in 2019.\n\nTotal platinum demand, including automotive, industrial, jewellery and investment, declined to 5.4 million ounces (2019: 6.4 million ounces), excluding recycling. Palladium demand reduced to 6.8 million ounces (2019: 8.0 million ounces). Primary supply of platinum decreased by 21% to 4.8 million ounces (2019: 6.1 million ounces), and palladium supply declined by 14% to 6.1 million ounces (2019: 7.1 million ounces).\n\n## Base metals\n\nCopper experienced a very di/fferent first six months compared to the second half of the year. In the earlier period, refined consumption decreased by around 7%, while supply contracted by 2.5%, leading to a large surplus and the average price falling by 11% to 249 c/lb, compared with the same period in the prior year. In contrast, the second half saw a strong recovery in demand, led by China, while supply remained constrained owing to the continued disruption caused by Covid-19 shutdowns. The copper price was further supported by positive sentiment in the US following Biden's election victory and firmer global decarbonisation commitments both considered positive for copper demand - and ended the year at 351 c/lb.\n\nRefined copper consumption decreased by 1.3% in 2020, while refined production increased by 1.5%, resulting in a rise in stock levels to 74 weeks of consumption by the end of the year (2019: 64 weeks). Despite this, the average price was slightly higher at 280 c/lb (2019: 272 c/lb).\n\nGlobal nickel consumption fell by around 4%, primarily driven by a 14% decline in demand from non-stainless steel applications. Stainless steel output decreased by 1.6%, though nickel consumption in stainless steel increased by a marginal 1%. The decrease in demand for the metal resulted in a 16% increase in nickel inventories to 1,537 kt (2019: 1,323 kt). The 1% decrease in the nickel price to 625 c/lb (2019: 632 c/lb) was less marked than expected, mainly due to improved market sentiment on the back of Covid-19 vaccine developments and optimism around growing global governmental support for the decarbonisation agenda.\n\n## Bulk commodities\n\nGlobal crude steel production took a significant hit in the first half of the year in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Key steelmaking regions such as Europe, the US and Japan all saw greater than 30% year-on-year declines in steel output, while in April, Indian steelmaking output fell by more than 60%. The steel industry outside of China subsequently began to recover, though significant capacity remained idled late into the year. Meanwhile, China, the world's biggest steel producer, increased output significantly on the back of government stimulus e/fforts. Overall, global crude steel production is estimated to have fallen by approximately 1% in 2020.\n\nIron ore showed resilience throughout the pandemic, with the average benchmark CFR China 62% Fe price increasing by 17% to $109/tonne (2019: $93/tonne) and reaching $150/tonne in December. Throughout the year, supply-side factors also contributed to higher prices, including congestion at Chinese ports, maintenance at export facilities and mines in Australia, and significant supply disruptions, primarily due to heavy rainfall in Brazil.\n\nHard coking coal (HCC) prices averaged $124/tonne on an FOB Australia basis, 30% lower than the prior year (2019: $177/tonne), primarily due to the impact of Covid-19 on demand from steel mills. Lower gas prices and import restrictions in China also impacted thermal coal, with the average FOB South Africa price decreasing by 10% to $65/tonne (2019: $72/tonne).\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe development of several successful vaccines towards the end of 2020 has given hope that restrictions in many countries can be reduced in 2021, with a consequent recovery in economic activity. Activity may be further boosted by a release of pent-up demand in a number of sectors. The IMF expects a 5.5% expansion in global GDP in 2021.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis has heightened numerous economic challenges, including greater levels of personal and government debt, increased unemployment, disruptions to supply chains and increased inequality. These factors may have a long-lasting impact on global economic output.\n\nNevertheless, commodity demand is expected to remain supported by urbanisation and industrialisation of emerging economies, population growth, including larger middle classes, and continued upgrading of infrastructure in advanced economies. The increasing momentum behind the decarbonisation agenda is likely to further benefit certain commodities exposed to electrification and technology trends, including copper, nickel and PGMs.",

Underlying earnings were $3.1 billion (2019: $3.5 billion), while operating profit was $5.6 billion (2019: $6.2 billion).\n\nContinued strong performances from our Minas-Rio iron ore operation in Brazil and the Collahuasi copper joint operation in Chile helped partly o/ffset the impacts of Covid-19, leading to an overall decrease in production of 10%, on a copper equivalent basis. Covid-19 lockdowns across southern Africa in the first half of the year impacted production at PGMs, Kumba, De Beers and Thermal Coal. In response to the pandemic, comprehensive safeguarding measures were put in place at operations and in partnership with local communities across the business, enabling a return to more normal operating levels in the second half of the year. Production was also a/ffected by operational issues at Metallurgical Coal and strike action at the Cerrej\u00f3n thermal coal operation. Refined production of PGMs was impacted by an outage at the converter plant in the first half. Consequently, in the second half of the year, copper equivalent production improved by 13% compared with the first half, as lockdowns and restrictions eased and operations were able to sustain around 95% of normal capacity while maintaining Covid-19-related safeguarding measures.\n\nDe Beers' rough diamond production decreased by 18% to 25.1 million carats (2019: 30.8 million carats), in response to lower demand due to the pandemic and Covid-19 restrictions in southern Africa during the first half of the year. Diamond demand from the midstream (cutters and polishers of rough diamonds) was a/ffected throughout the year by Covid-19 lockdowns, travel restrictions and retail store closures.\n\nCopper production increased by 1% to 647,400 tonnes (2019: 638,000 tonnes), driven by an 11% increase in attributable production from Collahuasi to a record 276,900 tonnes (2019: 248,800 tonnes) on the back of strong plant performance, reflecting improvement projects implemented in 2019. At Los Bronces, production decreased by 3% to 324,700 tonnes (2019: 335,000 tonnes) due to planned lower grades.\n\nPGMs' production (metal in concentrate) decreased by 14% to 3,808,900 ounces (2019: 4,440,900 ounces), due to Covid-19 restrictions, which reduced operating capacity for most of the second quarter, particularly at underground operations. PGM production was 35% higher in the second half of the year compared with the first, as the operations recovered well from the initial\n\n## Underlying EBITDA \u25ca reconciliation 2019-2020\n\n$ billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndisruption caused by the pandemic. Refining performance had also returned to normal levels by the end of the year with the restart of the rebuilt converter plant (ACP).\n\nAt Kumba, iron ore production decreased by 13% to 37.0 Mt (2019: 42.4 Mt), owing to lower workforce levels and logistics constraints due to Covid-19 restrictions, as well as above average rainfall and operational issues at the Sishen crusher and Kolomela plant.\n\nMinas-Rio production increased by 4% to 24.1 Mt (2019: 23.1 Mt), despite a planned one-month suspension for a pipeline inspection. This reflects a strong operational performance as the asset builds towards full capacity, with productivity initiatives supported by robust operational stability.\n\nMetallurgical coal production decreased by 26% to 16.8 Mt (2019: 22.9 Mt), principally owing to the suspension of operations at Grosvenor following a gas ignition incident in May, and challenges at Moranbah North, where a fall of ground in the first quarter and geotechnical challenges towards the end of the year limited longwall progress. Open cut operations were scaled back at Dawson and Capcoal in response to reduced demand for lower quality metallurgical coal.\n\nThermal coal export production decreased by 22% to 20.6 Mt (2019: 26.4 Mt), primarily due to Covid-19 operational restrictions and a three-month industrial action at Cerrej\u00f3n, which ended in the first week of December.\n\nNickel's production increased by 2% to 43,500 tonnes (2019: 42,600 tonnes) owing to improved operational stability, while manganese ore production was in line with the prior year at 3.5 Mt.\n\nGroup copper equivalent unit costs decreased by 2% in US dollar terms, despite lower production, due to weaker producer currencies and cost saving measures.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n|                                                                         | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Underlying EBITDA \u25ca  ($ billion)                                        | 9. 8   | 10.0   |\n| Operating profit ($ billion)                                            | 5.6    | 6.2    |\n| Underlying earnings \u25ca  ($ billion)                                      | 3.1    | 3.5    |\n| Profit attributable to equity shareholders   of the Company ($ billion) | 2.1    | 3.5    |\n| Basic underlying earnings per share \u25ca  ($)                              | 2.53   | 2.75   |\n| Basic earnings per share ($)                                            | 1.69   | 2.81   |\n| Dividend per share ($)                                                  | 1.00   | 1.09   |\n| Group attributable ROCE \u25ca                                               | 17%    | 19%    |\n\n## Underlying EBITDA \u25ca\n\nDespite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as operational challenges, Group underlying EBITDA decreased by just 2% to $9.8 billion (2019: $10.0 billion). The Group mining EBITDA margin \u25ca was higher than the prior year at 43% (2019: 42%), due to the increase in the price for the Group's basket of products, favourable exchange rates and cost saving initiatives. A reconciliation of 'Profit before net finance costs and tax', the closest equivalent IFRS measure to underlying EBITDA, is provided within note 2 to the Consolidated financial statements.",

The price achieved for the PGMs basket increased by 51%, largely due to rhodium and palladium, which increased by 179% and 46% respectively, while the realised price for iron ore and copper increased by 23% and 10%, respectively. These were partly o/ffset by a 34% reduction in the weighted average realised price for metallurgical coal.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe favourable foreign exchange impact on underlying EBITDA of $0.9 billion was due to weaker local currencies in our countries of operation, principally the South African rand, Brazilian real and Chilean peso.\n\n## Inflation\n\nThe Group's weighted average CPI for 2020 was 2.9%, compared with 3.3% in 2019. This was principally influenced by a decrease in inflation in South Africa. The impact of inflation on costs reduced underlying EBITDA by $0.4 billion.\n\n## Covid-19 volume impact\n\nThe volume impact of Covid-19-related disruption to production, the supply chain and the impact of reduced diamond demand throughout the year decreased underlying EBITDA by $1.1 billion.\n\nOperational disruptions as a result of the pandemic due to national lockdowns in South Africa and Botswana in the first half of the year, resulted in production levels decreasing to 60% of total capacity in April. The Group's operating assets recovered strongly, however, reaching approximately 90% of capacity by the end of June, and sustaining a consistent level of 95% of normal capacity throughout the second half of the year, while maintaining comprehensive safety measures to help safeguard the lives and livelihoods of our workforce and host communities.\n\nThe pandemic also had a major impact on the diamond industry, driving a 45% decrease in rough diamond sales volumes at De Beers in the first half of the year. This was followed by significant improvement in the second half as lockdown restrictions eased in many countries, resulting in an overall 27% decrease in rough diamond sales volumes for the year.\n\n## Net cost and volume\n\nThe net impact of cost and volume was a $1.3 billion reduction in underlying EBITDA, as the benefit of cost saving initiatives at De Beers, Copper and Thermal Coal and higher volumes at Minas-Rio and Collahuasi were more than o/ffset by operational issues at PGMs and Metallurgical Coal.\n\nRefined production at PGMs was impacted by an outage at the ACP, which reduced refined production by 42% in the year. The rebuilt converter plant was put back into operation ahead of schedule on 24 November 2020.\n\nMetallurgical coal operations were a/ffected by an underground incident at Moranbah North, as well as at Grosvenor, where operations have been suspended since the beginning of May, with the mine currently expected to return to operation in the second half of 2021.\n\n## Other\n\nThe $0.5 billion decrease in underlying EBITDA was driven by lower earnings at Cerrej\u00f3n due to lower prices and a three month strike, as well as Victor mine (De Beers) reaching the end of mine life in 2019. Also included are costs of $0.2 billion related to increased rehabilitation provisions across the Group due to lower discount rates, reflecting lower interest rates, principally at Copper.\n\n## Underlying earnings \u25ca\n\nGroup underlying earnings decreased to $3.1 billion (2019: $3.5 billion), driven by an increase in net finance costs, as well as a 2% decrease in underlying EBITDA and a higher proportion of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\n## Reconciliation from underlying EBITDA \u25ca to underlying earnings \u25ca\n\n|                                           | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Underlying EBITDA \u25ca                       | 9,802   | 10,006  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | (2,752) | (2,996) |\n| Net finance costs and  income tax expense | (2,745) | (2,469) |\n| Non-controlling interests                 | (1,170) | (1,073) |\n| Underlying earnings \u25ca                     | 3,135   | 3,468   |\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nDepreciation and amortisation decreased by 8% to $2.8 billion (2019: $3.0 billion), reflecting the e/ffect of weaker local currencies and lower production at Metallurgical Coal as a result of the operational issues at Moranbah North and Grosvenor.\n\n## Net finance costs and income tax expense\n\nNet finance costs, before special items and remeasurements, were $0.8 billion (2019: $0.4 billion). The increase was principally driven by fair value losses on the revaluation of deferred consideration balances at PGMs relating to the Mototolo acquisition, which was completed in November 2018.\n\nThe underlying e/ffective tax rate was 31.2% (2019: 30.8%). The underlying e/ffective tax rate in 2020 was impacted by the relative levels of profits arising in the Group's operating jurisdictions. In future periods, the underlying e/ffective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 33%. The tax charge for the year, before special items and remeasurements, was $1.8 billion (2019: $1.8 billion).\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe share of underlying earnings attributable to non-controlling interests of $1.2 billion (2019: $1.1 billion) principally relates to minority shareholdings in Kumba, PGMs and Copper.\n\n## Special items and remeasurements\n\nSpecial items and remeasurements are a net charge of $1.0 billion (2019: net gain of $0.1 billion) and include impairment charges of $0.6 billion at Nickel following a revision of the Group's medium and long term nickel price forecast and $0.1 billion at Coal, as well as deferred tax remeasurements of $0.4 billion, driven by the weaker Brazilian real.\n\nFull details of the special items and remeasurements recorded are included in note 8 to the Consolidated financial statements.",

Receivables increased by $1.0 billion, mainly owing to increased iron ore, base metals and PGMs prices, o/ffset by payables increases of $1.1 billion driven by an increase in a customer pre-payment and purchase of concentrate payables within PGMs, both reflecting increased metal prices.\n\n## Attributable free cash flow \u25ca\n\nThe Group's attributable free cash flow decreased to an inflow of $1.2 billion (2019: inflow of $2.3 billion) due to lower cash flows from operations of $8.0 billion (2019: $9.3 billion) and increased capital expenditure of $4.1 billion (2019: $3.8 billion), partially o/ffset by lower tax payments of $1.6 billion (2019: $2.1 billion), principally at Metallurgical Coal.\n\n## Dividends\n\nIn line with the Group's established dividend policy to pay out 40% of underlying earnings, the Board has proposed a dividend of $0.72 per share (2019: $0.47 per share), bringing the total dividends paid and proposed in respect of 2020 to $1.00 per share (2019: $1.09 per share).\n\n## Acquisition of Sirius Minerals\n\nOn 17 March 2020, the Group completed the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc for a cash consideration of $0.5 billion. As part of the acquisition, the Group also acquired borrowing and lease liabilities, taking the total impact on net debt to $0.7 billion on the date of acquisition.\n\n## Disposals\n\nOn 18 December 2020, the Group completed the sale of a 12% interest in the Grosvenor mine (Metallurgical Coal) for $0.2 billion, equalising the ownership across its integrated operations at Moranbah North and Grosvenor. During 2020, the Group received $0.2 billion of deferred consideration in respect of previous divestments by PGMs.",

This additional return recognised the resilience of our balance sheet, and our confidence in funding our portfolio of highly attractive near and medium term growth opportunities. Following the return of $0.8 billion to shareholders in 2019, the remaining $0.2 billion of the buyback programme was completed by March 2020.

These inventory increases are expected to be released during 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe Group generated strong sustaining attributable free cash inflows of $2.7 billion, principally used towards growth capital expenditure of $1.4 billion, dividends paid to Anglo American plc shareholders of $0.9 billion, the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc (including debt acquired) of $0.7 billion and completion of the share buyback programme announced in July 2019 of $0.2 billion. Net debt at 31 December 2020 represented gearing of 15% (2019: 13%), comprising cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 billion (2019: $6.3 billion) and gross debt (including related derivatives) of $13.1 billion (2019: $11.0 billion).\n\nOn 26 February 2020, South Africa's Minister of Finance announced in his Budget Speech that the country would shift from a policy of exchange controls to a risk-based capital flow management system, in line with international best practice and in order to facilitate cross-border financial transactions in support of trade and investment. This change aligns South Africa with the foreign direct investment criteria implemented by other OECD nations and removes the previous restrictions on the Group's ability to permanently remit cash earned from operating activities in South Africa, aligning the Group with other global companies that operate in South Africa.\n\nSubsequently, on 24 February 2021, South Africa's Minister of Finance announced that from 1 March 2021, specific rules for companies with a primary listing o/ffshore will be automatically aligned to current foreign direct investment rules. Separate disclosure of the Group's South African cash and debt balances will therefore no longer be relevant.\n\nDuring 2021, the South African National Treasury and the Reserve Bank will continue to develop the legislative framework for the new capital flow management system announced in the 2020 Budget. This framework is expected to be substantially completed in 2021.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nNet assets increased by $1.4 billion to $32.8 billion (2019: $31.4 billion), reflecting the profit for the year, o/ffset by dividend payments to Company shareholders and non-controlling interests.\n\n## Attributable ROCE \u25ca\n\nAttributable ROCE decreased to 17% (2019: 19%). Attributable underlying EBIT was marginally lower at $5.3 billion (2019: $5.5 billion), reflecting the impact of Covid-19-related disruptions and operational issues at PGMs and Metallurgical Coal, largely o/ffset by higher realised prices for many of the Group's products and favourable exchange rate movements. Average attributable capital employed increased to $30.5 billion (2019: $28.4 billion), primarily due to increased growth capital expenditure, largely at Quellaveco (Copper), working capital build and the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc.\n\n## Bond maturity profile (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Bond maturity profile based on contractual repayments at hedge rates\n\n## Liquidity and funding\n\nGroup liquidity remains conservative at $17.5 billion (2019: $15.0 billion), comprising $7.5 billion of cash (2019: $6.3 billion) and $10.0 billion of undrawn committed facilities (2019: $8.7 billion).\n\nIn April 2020, the Group signed a new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with an initial maturity date of April 2021. The Group has, at its sole discretion, two options to extend the facility for a further six months to October 2021 and April 2022.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group issued $3.0 billion of bond debt. In April 2020, the Group issued $750 million of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025 and $750 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2030. In September 2020, the Group issued $1.0 billion of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2030 and $500 million 3.950% Senior Notes due 2050, which were used to fund a liability management exercise to redeem $0.5 billion of bonds maturing in 2021 and $1.0 billion of bonds maturing in 2022. In March 2020, as part of the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc, the Group recognised borrowings and lease liabilities of Sirius Minerals Plc with a fair value of $0.3 billion. In July 2020, the Sirius Minerals Finance Limited 8.5% 2023 convertible bond was fully redeemed at a cash cost of $138 million. The bond issuance and the liability management exercises increased the weighted average maturity on the Group's bonds to 6.3 years (2019: 4.5 years).\n\nOn 24 April 2020, Moody's Investors Service a/ffirmed the Group's Baa2 rating and updated the outlook from stable to negative. Moody's Investors Service re-a/ffirmed this rating on 24 November 2020. During 2020, Standard and Poor's rea/ffirmed the Group's BBB rating with a stable outlook.",

It licenses its diamond brand Forevermark \u2122 and markets and sells polished diamonds and diamond jewellery via its Forevermark \u2122 and De Beers Jewellers businesses.\n\nDe Beers recovers diamonds from four countries: Botswana, Canada, Namibia and South Africa.\n\nIn Botswana, via a 50:50 joint operation with the GRB - known as Debswana - the company recovers diamonds from four mines (3) , including Jwaneng, one of the world's richest diamond mines by value. This mine's high grade ore contributes 60-70% of Debswana's revenue. The $2 billion Cut-9 expansion of Jwaneng will extend the life of the mine to 2036 and is expected to yield an estimated 51 million carats (4) of rough diamonds from approximately 42 million tonnes of treated material.\n\nIn Namibia, De Beers operates in 50:50 partnership with the Namibian government, recovering both land-based diamonds (Namdeb) and o/ffshore diamonds (Debmarine Namibia). Namibia has the richest known marine diamond deposits in the world, with Diamond Resources estimated at more than 80 million carats (4) in approximately 1.2 million k (m 2 ) of seabed. Marine diamond deposits represent around 75% of the partnership's total diamond production and 94% of its Diamond Resources.\n\n## Botswana and Namibia\n\nCanada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Open pit mining at Venetia is likely to run until 2023 and the transition is already well under way to convert to underground mining, which is expected to extend the life of the mine to 2045. Through the $2.1 billion Venetia Underground project, De Beers expect to treat approximately 131 million tonnes of material, containing an estimated 95 million carats (4) .\n\nIn Canada, De Beers has a 51% interest in, and is the operator of, Gahcho Ku\u00e9 open-pit mine in the Northwest Territories. It began commercial production in 2017 and has a 10-year life, producing an average of 4.5 million carats a year, yielding an estimated total of 47 million carats (4) (100% basis) from approximately 30 million tonnes of material.\n\nDe Beers also develops industrial super materials through Element Six, which includes the production of laboratory grown diamonds for Lightbox Jewelry. De Beers o/ffers diamond grading and testing services through De Beers Institute of Diamonds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2191 De Beers is has set a goal to engage 10,000 women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects by 2030. Here, in Canada, electrical engineering student Celia Zhang has been sponsored by the company through her studies at the University of Calgary.\n\n## Developing talent by bringing young women into STEM\n\nTo re-imagine mining, we need to not only develop new skills among our employees but bring fresh talent into our business. We believe that continued male dominance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines is a big inhibitor to progress and we have set a target for one-third female representation within all management levels Groupwide by 2023.\n\nIn seeking to address the severe shortage of women in engineering in particular, De Beers has set itself a bold new goal: to engage 10,000 women in STEM. An important aspect of this is our partnership with WomEng, a global organisation with a mission to develop the next generation of highly skilled women for the engineering and technology industries.\n\nIn 2019, De Beers joined forces with WomEng in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia to provide opportunities for young women and girls to study STEM subjects and pursue engineering careers. Through workshops, exhibitions and being set challenges around innovation, high potential girls are supported from school age, through university and into their early careers, with access to application support, mentoring and networks.\n\nTo date, as a result of the partnership, 800 female students from southern Africa have been engaged through three WomEng programmes, which are being adapted to address the impact of Covid-19 through a combination of virtual and socially distanced face-to-face events.\n\nIn Canada, De Beers is partnering with UN Women, the University of Waterloo, the University of Calgary and Scholarships Canada to support female students with scholarships in science and engineering, with a particular focus on supporting First Nation women in the Northwest Territories and northern Ontario.\n\nSince the start of the company's three-year partnership with UN Women in 2018, 55 scholarships have been awarded to Canadian women. In addition to the scholarships, De Beers provided funding to sponsor 30 girls from indigenous communities to attend the University of Waterloo's summer IMPACT Camps in Canada.",

The Total Recordable Case Frequency Rate (TRCFR) for managed operations decreased by 29% to 2.18 (2019: 3.07).\n\nIn 2020, De Beers focused on the pro-active identification of high potential hazards, the implementation of Elimination of Fatalities workstreams and the ongoing roll-out of advanced driver assist systems and fatigue management safety technology.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nEnergy use decreased by 16% to 3.8 million GJ (2019: 4.5 million GJ) and GHG emissions by 13% to 0.42 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 0.48 Mt CO 2 e), principally due to the impact of Covid-19-related disruptions on production across De Beers' operations in southern Africa and the progress made in implementing energy-e/fficiency projects at Venetia and Gahcho Ku\u00e9.\n\n## Financial and operational review\n\nAs a result of the di/fficult market conditions, lockdowns in India and associated flexibility o/ffered to customers, total revenue decreased by 27% to $3.4 billion (2019: $4.6 billion) with rough diamond sales falling by 30% to $2.8 billion (2019: $4.0 billion). Rough diamond sales volumes decreased by 27% to 21.4 million carats (2019: 29.2 million carats). The average realised price decreased by 3% to $133/ct (2019: $137/ct), with a 10% decline in the average rough index largely o/ffset by an increased proportion of higher value rough sold in 2020, driven by midstream demand and inventory mix.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA decreased by 25% to $417 million (2019: $558 million), owing to the impact of the lower sales volumes and the lower rough price index reducing margins in both the mining and trading business, particularly in the first half of the year. Despite the reduction in production volumes, unit costs decreased by 10% to $57/ct (2019: $63/ct) owing to cost saving measures and favourable exchange rates that have resulted in a higher mining margin of 54% (2019: 43%).\n\nDe Beers' capital expenditure decreased by 33% to $381 million (2019: $567 million) due to the deferral of stay-in-business projects into future years without compromising safety or operational integrity. This decrease was also driven by favourable exchange rates. Although there were Covid-19-related disruptions at De Beers' expansion projects, execution of Venetia Underground and Jwaneng Cut-9 continued to progress, and the new AMV3 vessel for Namibia (the largest diamond recovery vessel ever built) remains on track for commissioning in 2022. The construction of the laboratory-grown diamond facility in Oregon for Lightbox Jewelry was completed in 2020 and will ramp up during 2021.\n\n|                                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Production volume ('000 cts) (1)            | 25,102 | 30,776 |\n| Sales volume ('000 cts) (1)(2)              | 21,380 | 29,186 |\n| Price ($/ct) (1)(3)(4)                      | 133    | 137    |\n| Unit cost ($/ct) (1)(4)(5)                  | 57     | 63     |\n| Revenue - $m (1)(6)                         | 3,378  | 4,605  |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (1)(4)               | 417    | 558    |\n| Mining EBITDA margin (1)(7)                 | 54%    | 43%    |\n| Trading margin                              | 3%     | 3%     |\n| Underlying EBIT - $m (1)(4)                 | 0      | 168    |\n| Capex - $m (1)(4)                           | 381    | 567    |\n| Attributable ROCE (1)                       | 0%     | 2%     |\n| Fatalities (8)                              | 0      | 0      |\n| TRCFR (8)                                   | 2.18   | 3.07   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ (8)         | 3.8    | 4.5    |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent (8)       | 0.42   | 0.48   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(8)(9) | 8.7    | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers (10)                       | 8,700  | 9,000  |\n\n- (2) Total sales volumes on a 100% basis were 22.7 million carats (2019: 30.9 million carats).

        "page_content": "## Markets\n\nThe diamond industry started 2020 positively after a strong US holiday season at the end of 2019, with robust demand for rough diamonds. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, and measures taken by governments in response, had a profound impact on global diamond supply and demand. Much of the industry was temporarily unable to operate, with up to 90% of jewellery stores closed at the peak of lockdowns, first in China, then in Europe and the US.\n\nReduced demand from jewellery retailers due to store closures, combined with the closure of diamond cutting and polishing factories in India from April to June, led to a substantial reduction in rough diamond purchases in the first six months. In response, De Beers reduced production and o/ffered significantly increased flexibility to customers.\n\nThe gradual easing of restrictions across the globe led to improved trading conditions and an increase in demand throughout the supply chain in the second half of the year. Consumer demand for diamond jewellery improved in key markets, particularly in China, which continued its strong recovery, while demand in the US has also been encouraging. The recovery in consumer demand supported polished price growth in the second half and a rebuild in inventory levels in advance of the year end holiday season.\n\n## Operational performance\n\n## Mining and manufacturing\n\nRough diamond production decreased by 18% to 25.1 million carats (2019: 30.8 million carats) in response to lower demand due to the pandemic and the Covid-19-related shutdowns in southern Africa during the first half of the year.\n\nIn Botswana, production decreased by 29% to 16.6 million carats (2019: 23.3 million carats), with volumes at Jwaneng reduced by 40% to 7.5 million carats (2019: 12.5 million carats), while production at Orapa decreased by 16% to 9.0 million carats (2019: 10.8 million carats). This was largely due to a nationwide lockdown from 2 April to 18 May, and the planned treatment of lower grade material at both Jwaneng and Orapa, following their restart, as a production response to lower demand. Both mines substantially reconfigured their mining operations to preserve costs in light of the lower levels of production, thereby preserving the mining margin.\n\nIn Namibia, production decreased by 15% to 1.4 million carats (2019: 1.7 million carats), primarily due to the suspension of marine mining during part of the third quarter in response to lower demand. Production at the land operation decreased by 21%, principally as a result of the Covid-19-related shutdown.\n\nIn South Africa, production increased to 3.8 million carats (2019: 1.9 million carats) as the reductions experienced in the first half due to the national shutdown were more than o/ffset by an expected increase in grade as the ore from the last cut of the open pit is processed while the mine transitions to underground operations.\n\nIn Canada, production decreased by 15% to 3.3 million carats (2019: 3.9 million carats) principally reflecting Victor reaching the end of its life in the first half of 2019. Gahcho Ku\u00e9 production decreased by 4% to 3.3 million carats (2019: 3.5 million carats) as a result of the implementation of Covid-19 workforce protection measures.\n\n## Brands and consumer markets\n\nCovid-19 significantly impacted De Beers' brand sales in 2020, with large-scale store closures in Asia in the first quarter, followed by western markets in the second quarter and beyond. However, both De Beers Jewellers and Forevermark \u2122 saw a strong recovery in sales as restrictions eased and stores reopened.\n\nOnline sales continued to show strong growth, reflecting De Beers' investments in e-commerce and increasing consumer willingness to purchase diamond jewellery through these channels.\n\nAs part of the longer term strategy, De Beers announced 12 goals that are part of the company's 'Building Forever' framework, a sustainability approach, aligned with the Anglo American Sustainable Mining Plan, that is focused on maximising the positive impact of diamonds on their journey from discovery to retail. The aim is to achieve a shared vision for a better future, focusing on De Beers' pillars of leading ethical practices across the industry: partnering for thriving communities; protecting the natural world; and accelerating equal opportunity.\n\n## Operational and market outlook\n\nRecent consumer demand trends have been positive in key markets and industry inventories are in a healthier position, providing the potential for a continued recovery in rough diamond demand during 2021, subject to the ongoing impact of Covid-19. Consumer desirability for natural diamonds is set to remain high over the medium to long term despite the economic impact of the pandemic and increasing supply of lab-grown diamonds.\n\nIn the longer term, the impact of Covid-19 has accelerated the transformation that was already underway across the industry and which is expected to continue at pace. This includes more e/fficient inventory management, increased online purchasing, and a growing consumer desire for products with demonstrable ethical and sustainability credentials, including an enhanced appreciation for the natural world. The long term outlook for the sector remains positive as De Beers continues to focus on its business transformation to support the continued growth of its own business and the wider diamond value chain.\n\nFor 2021, production guidance is 32-34 million carats, subject to trading conditions, the extent of further Covid-19-related disruptions and ongoing operational challenges. The higher production is driven by an expected increase in ore and improved grade performance at both Jwaneng and Venetia. Unit cost guidance is c.$55/ct, reflecting the increase in production volumes and the benefits of the restructuring undertaken in 2020.",

Its visual qualities account for many other applications - in buildings and everyday objects.\n\nIn the future, a growing volume of copper will likely be used in low-emission vehicles; battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid electric vehicles all contain substantially more copper than conventional vehicles.\n\nCopper is set to continue to be one of the essential industrial metals as society addresses the challenges of climate change, energy e/fficiency and the raising of living standards for the world's growing population. The e/ffects of ore reserve depletion across the industry, and lengthy permitting processes, are likely to result in future supply constraints.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2191 In El Soldado's neighbouring town of Collag\u00fce, Anglo American, in a partnership with the Municipality of Nogales, has invested nearly $650,000 in bringing potable water to a community that has not had a regular supply of drinking water for the past 20 years.\n\n## Improving water supply to Chile's rural communities\n\nChile is the world's biggest copper producer and is a key mining country for Anglo American. For more than a decade, the severe droughts that have pervaded the country have placed great challenges on existing copper operations, while restricting the capacity to bring new sources of metal on stream.\n\nGetting enough water for human consumption, agriculture, mining and industry has become a significant national challenge for Chile; one that Anglo American fully recognises and has publicly pledged that human consumption of water has priority. The situation is particularly acute in Chile's rural areas, where nearly two million people are reliant on the country's rural drinking water systems, many of which do not have the necessary infrastructure or technology to achieve e/fficient water management.\n\nAs a result, along with Anglo American's own technological interventions to make its mining and processing operations in the country more water e/fficient, we have developed our Programa Agua Rural (Rural Water Programme), in partnership with remote monitoring technology firm, WeTechs.\n\nThe technology being developed to improve water supply is especially suited to Chile's vast regions far from its cities. In a typical rural region, there is a control room, where data analysis is centralised and automation of the entire watersupply system is controlled - but, in a major departure from traditional controls, much of the monitoring and management are now able to be done remotely via mobile devices, including the overseeing of conditions in waterstorage facilities. The innovative data system has resulted in significant improvement of the water operations for around 100,000 people around our Los Bronces, El Soldado and Chagres sites. By the end of 2020, in these areas, there was an overall 20% increase in water availability, a 50% decrease in water pipe ruptures and a 20% energy saving, as well as a reduction in public spending.\n\nCrucially, Programa Agua Rural is strengthening our host communities through training programmes that are making its water-management knowledge available to local inhabitants. In this way, we are assisting in the transfer of technology, and in capacity-building, in order to deliver a water solution that can be implemented by the people themselves.\n\nIn doing so, we are bringing to life the key pillars of the Programa Agua Rural: integration with other partners and technologies; putting technology at the service of the people; and seeking and capitalising on opportunities to enhance infrastructure capacity.",

The TRCFR increased by 37% to 1.58 (2019: 1.15), though no recordable incidents were classified as high potential incidents. Several initiatives continued to be implemented across the business, including advanced driver assistance Systems (ADAS) and our Elimination of Fatalities and Learning from Incidents improvement programmes, as well as the continued integration of the Group's Operating Risk Management (ORM) processes into the business.\n\n## Quellaveco\n\nQuellaveco recorded no fatalities in 2020. The TRCFR increased to 2.20 (2019: 0.91) following the remobilisation of the 10,000 strong workforce in the second half of the year, and measures have been introduced to improve safety vigilance. The risk and control identification procedure required by Peruvian law was updated and standardised using the Group's risk matrix to prepare the operation for ORM implementation. Quellaveco's surface tra/ffic management plan was reviewed, with new access and bypass roads constructed, active vehicle speed radar monitoring implemented, and improved awareness training for all vehicle drivers; the operation is also planning to implement the ADAS system in 2021. In 2020, several action plans arising from self-assessments on the Anglo American global technical standards were completed and, in 2021, Quellaveco will progressively implement these standards as project construction progresses.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\n## Copper Chile\n\nAt Copper's Chilean operations, energy use decreased by 8% to 11.3 million GJ (2019: 12.3 million GJ) and GHG emissions decreased by 9% to 1.07 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 1.17 Mt CO 2 e). This reduction was partly driven by the impact of Covid-19-related disruptions to operations, as well as through performance improvements and optimisation linked to our P101 programme and transformation initiatives.\n\nIn central and northern Chile, 2020 was one of the driest years of the century. At Los Bronces, through a collaborative e/ffort with Codelco's Andina mine, more than 7.5 million m 3 of excess water from the tailings storage facility was released and made available. A project aimed at securing a long term supply of non-fresh water for our operations is ongoing.\n\n## Quellaveco\n\nAt Quellaveco, energy use decreased by 70% to 0.6 million GJ (2019: 2.0 million GJ) and GHG emissions decreased by 67% to 0.05 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 0.15 MtCO 2 e), reflecting the impact of Covid-19-related restrictions on the work undertaken at the project.\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Production volume (kt)                   | 647    | 638    |\n| Sales volume (kt) (1)(2)                 | 648    | 644    |\n| Unit cost (c/lb) (1)(3)                  | 113    | 126    |\n| Group revenue - $m (1)(4)                | 7,176  | 5,840  |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (1)               | 1,921  | 1,638  |\n| Mining EBITDA margin (5)                 | 45%    | 44%    |\n| Underlying EBIT - $m (1)                 | 1,285  | 981    |\n| Capex - $m (1)                           | 645    | 574    |\n| Attributable ROCE                        | 36%    | 24%    |\n| Fatalities                               | 0      | 1      |\n| TRCFR                                    | 1.58   | 1.15   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ          | 11.3   | 12.3   |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent        | 1.07   | 1.17   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(6) | 35.8   | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers                         | 3,800  | 4,000  |\n\n- (3) C1 unit cost includes by-product credits.\n- (4) Group revenue is shown after deduction of treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs).\n\n## 2020 results - Quellaveco\n\n|                                          |   2020 | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Capex - $m (1)                           | 788    | 494    |\n| Fatalities                               |   0    | 1      |\n| TRCFR                                    |   2.2  | 0.91   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ          |   0.6  | 2.0    |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent        |   0.05 | 0.15   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(2) |   1.5  | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers                         | 400    | 300    |",

        "page_content": "## Financial and operational review\n\nUnderlying EBITDA increased by 15% to $1,864 million (2019: $1,618 million) driven by a 10% increase in the average realised copper price and record low unit costs of 113 c/lb (2019: 126 c/lb).\n\nProduction increased to 647,400 tonnes (2019: 638,000 tonnes), with record production at Collahuasi and a strong operational performance at Los Bronces o/ffsetting the headwinds related to Covid-19 restrictions and expected lower water availability. Unit costs decreased by 10%, reflecting the weaker Chilean peso, higher by-product credits, cost savings and increased production, partly o/ffset by actions taken to mitigate the impact of Covid-19-related restrictions on production and inflation.\n\nCapital expenditure (excluding Quellaveco) increased by 12% to $655 million (2019: $584 million), reflecting an increase in deferred stripping and the routine replacement of, and higher spend on, key infrastructure and technology projects, including the construction of a coarse particle recovery demonstration plant at El Soldado. This was partly o/ffset by the deferral of non-critical projects into 2021 as a result of Covid-19-related constraints, and favourable movements in the Chilean peso.\n\n## Markets\n\n|                               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average market price (c/lb)   |    280 |    272 |\n| Average realised price (c/lb) |    299 |    273 |\n\nThe di/fferences between the market price and realised price are largely a function of the timing of sales across the year and provisional pricing adjustments, with 140,599 tonnes of copper provisionally priced at 352 c/lb (2019: 111,213 tonnes provisionally priced at 273 c/lb).\n\nThe average LME copper price in 2020 increased by 3% compared with 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on global demand, temporarily depressing consumption as restrictions hampered economic activity in the first half of the year. A sharp recovery took place in China and, elsewhere, measures to restart activity took place to mitigate the e/ffects of the pandemic. Despite trade tensions between the US and China, optimism over vaccine programmes further bolstered sentiment. Constraints in mine supply have also contributed to a positive outlook on fundamentals, as has copper's role in the push to achieve carbon neutrality, greater energy e/fficiency and improved living standards, allowing the metal to reach price highs last seen in 2013.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nProduction increased marginally to 647,400 tonnes (2019: 638,000 tonnes).\n\nAt Los Bronces, production decreased by 3% to 324,700 tonnes (2019: 335,000 tonnes) due to expected lower water availability and planned lower grades (0.81% vs. 0.83%), partly o/ffset by strong operational performance. C1 unit costs increased by 10% to 149 c/lb (2019: 135 c/lb), reflecting the lower production volumes and the drawdown on stockpiles due to Covid-19-related restrictions and inflation, partly mitigated by cost saving initiatives and the impact of the weaker Chilean peso.\n\nAt Collahuasi, Anglo American's attributable share of copper production increased by 11% to 276,900 tonnes (2019: 248,800 tonnes). This was a record production performance for the operation, driven by strong plant performance, reflecting the plant improvement projects implemented during 2019, as well as planned higher grades (1.24% vs.1.19%). C1 unit costs decreased by 38% to 62 c/lb (2019: 100 c/lb), another record, reflecting the solid production performance, higher by-product credits and the weaker Chilean peso, partly o/ffset by inflation.\n\nProduction at El Soldado decreased by 15% to 45,800 tonnes (2019: 54,200 tonnes) due to planned lower grades (0.84% vs. 0.93%) and water restrictions. C1 unit costs were flat at 204 c/lb (2019: 205 c/lb), with the lower production volumes fully o/ffset by the weaker Chilean peso and cost saving initiatives.\n\n## Operational outlook\n\nProduction guidance for 2021 is 640,000-680,000 tonnes, subject to water availability and the extent of further Covid-19-related disruption.\n\nC1 unit cost guidance for 2021 is c.120 c/lb, reflecting an expected strengthening of the Chilean peso, inflation and ongoing impacts from Covid-19 mitigation activities.\n\n## Quellaveco update\n\nStrong progress continues, with the project currently tracking against its original schedule, despite the impact of Covid-19, with execution having been well ahead of schedule prior to the pandemic, and all applicable milestones achieved.\n\nFollowing the onset of the pandemic, on 17 March, Quellaveco withdrew the majority of the project's 10,000-strong workforce from site after the Peruvian government announced the start of a national lockdown. Following subsequent extensions of the lockdown, non-critical works were suspended for three months in support of continuing e/fforts to control the spread of Covid-19.\n\nRemobilisation of the construction workforce began in July following approval by the Peruvian authorities and is largely complete, with construction activities gradually restarted across all project sites. Significant progress has been made at the processing plant, where the shells for the first SAG and ball mills are installed, installation of the electric motors is under way, and all 46 flotation cells have been assembled. The majority of materials and equipment are now in-country and the first of three rope shovels has been assembled, along with eight mining trucks.\n\nDespite the Covid-19-related slowdown, first production is still expected in 2022, in part due to the excellent progress achieved prior to the national lockdown, and based on optimised construction and commissioning plans. Key activities in 2021 include the start of pre-stripping, which will see the first greenfield use of automated hauling technology in Peru; progressing construction of the primary crusher and ore transport conveyor tunnel to the plant; completion of the 95 km freshwater pipeline that will deliver water from the water source area to the Quellaveco site; completing installation of the shells and motors for both milling lines; and completion of the tailings starter dam.\n\nTotal project capital expenditure is expected to be $5.3-5.5 billion (100% basis), subject to the extent of any further Covid-19-related disruption, of which the Group's 60% share is approximately $2.7-2.8 billion. Capital expenditure guidance (100% basis) for 2021 is approximately $1.3-1.6 billion, of which the Group's 60% share is approximately $0.8-1.0 billion. Quellaveco expects to deliver around 300,000 tonnes per annum of copper equivalent production (100% basis) on average in the first 10 years of operation.\n\nIn February 2021, the Group approved the construction of a coarse particle recovery (CPR) plant at Quellaveco. This breakthrough technology will initially allow retreatment of coarse particles from flotation tailings to improve recoveries by c.3% on average over the life of the mine. This investment will also enable future throughput expansion which will bring a reduction in energy and water consumption per unit of production. The CPR project will incur additional capital expenditure on a 100% basis of approximately $130 million, of which the Group will fund its 60% share. Commissioning of the new plant is expected in 2022.",

In the automotive industry, they are in demand through both their use in catalytic converters and in fuel cell vehicle technology. Platinum, palladium and rhodium enable catalytic converters to reduce pollutants from car exhaust gases, and demand for PGMs from the car industry is expected to continue to grow, supported by stricter emissions regulations. Fuel cell electric vehicles provide a zeroemissions powertrain technology, particularly well suited to heavy duty, long range and fleet vehicles.\n\nWith rising concerns about the environment and energy costs, there is also growing interest in platinum fuel cells as an alternative energy source. In some cases, platinum-based fuel cells are proving to be more cost-e/ffective, cleaner and more reliable than alternatives such as diesel generators. Fuel cell mini-grid electrification technology is an attractive, cost-competitive alternative to grid electrification in remote rural areas and could accelerate access to electricity.\n\nPlatinum is also widely used in jewellery owing to its purity, strength, resistance to fading and ability to hold precious stones securely.\n\nPlatinum, palladium and rhodium each have a wide range of other uses in the chemical, electrical, medical, glass and petroleum industries. PGMs enable e/fficient production of goods, ranging from glass to fertilisers, as well as a diverse range of other products, such as cancer-treatment drugs. Ruthenium is used as a catalyst in many chemical and electrochemical processes, with electrical and chemical properties that make it widely used in semiconductors and hard disks. Iridium is also widely used as a chemical and electrochemical catalyst, for instance in chloralkali electrodes. Being highly corrosion-resistant, it is also used to make crucibles, in which crystals for the electronics industry are grown.\n\nWe are committed to developing demand for PGMs and invest both directly and through AP Ventures, an independent venture capital fund with a mandate to invest in the development of new applications for the full suite of PGMs. We are also a major participant in the Platinum Guild International (PGI), which plays a key role in supporting and growing platinum jewellery demand. Meanwhile, new technology and legislation continue to drive demand for PGMs in the vehicle manufacturing industry - through their application in both catalytic converters and fuel cells.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2191 Our Unki PGMs mine in Zimbabwe continues to make a vital contribution in the fight against Covid-19. Here, at the nearby Gweru Provincial Hospital, Unki made a particularly important intervention through comprehensively re-equipping the hospital's intensive care unit.\n\n## Making a di/fference in healthcare - Unki learns to live with Covid-19\n\nFrom an operational excellence perspective, Unki is regarded to be amongst the very best operations across Anglo American - as well as being an important employer and a significant export earner for Zimbabwe.\n\nBut our contribution to Zimbabwe goes beyond our mining and smelting operations. This has been evidenced in Unki's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As it became clear that Covid-19 was going to have a serious impact on the country, our PGMs business responded swiftly.\n\nAs part of Unki's community response plan, we were quickly able to provide personal protective equipment (PPE), along with Covid-19-related training, to healthcare workers on the frontline of the pandemic. But, importantly, we had the resources to be able to scale up things quickly as the number of Covid-19 cases rose, both in the workplace and in the local communities close to our Unki mine site.\n\nAs a matter of urgency, Unki provided food support to vulnerable groups in the area, while also drilling and equipping 17 boreholes to improve access to water in the Shurugwi district.\n\nA key milestone in our e/fforts to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and our host communities was our donation, in August 2020, of a newly equipped 10-bed intensive care unit (ICU) to Gweru Provincial Hospital, which is located close to Unki and where we had previously constructed and equipped a casualty ward and a children's ward. The donation included ventilators, ICU beds, oxygen equipment and installation, PPE, multi-parameter monitors and other medical equipment.\n\nThe establishment of the ICU forms part of Unki's $2 million investment to date in combating Covid-19 and complements the work being undertaken at the mine's polymerise chain reaction (PCR) testing laboratory. The laboratory was recently licensed to carry out Covid-19 tests, and is now being used to test samples from employees, contractors, and from patients and healthcare workers at the Shurugwi District Hospital.",

Projects in support of the Group's carbon neutrality targets include the development of a hydrogen fuel cell powered heavy haul truck at the Mogalakwena mine, the continued development of a large scale solar photovoltaic facility (with project approval planned for 2021), as well as several other smaller scale projects to increase PGMs' renewable energy supply.\n\n## Financial and operational review\n\nUnderlying EBITDA increased by 28% to $2,555 million (2019: $2,000 million), as a result of a 51% increase in the dollar basket price, driven primarily by stronger prices for palladium and rhodium, which more than o/ffset the impact on sales volumes of outages at the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) and Covid-19-related restrictions. Unit costs were broadly flat at $713/PGM ounce (2019: $703/PGM ounce), as the benefits of the weaker South African rand and underlying operational improvements were o/ffset by the lower volumes.\n\nCapital expenditure was in line with the prior year at $571 million (2019: $569 million) as additional expenditure incurred on the ACP Phase A rebuild o/ffset the benefit of the weaker South African rand.\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average platinum market price ($/oz)     | 885    | 864    |\n| Average palladium market price ($/oz)    | 2,197  | 1,539  |\n| Average rhodium market price ($/oz)      | 11,220 | 3,914  |\n| US$ realised basket price ($/PGM oz) (1) | 2,035  | 1,347  |\n\nPGM prices started the year strongly before Covid-19 impacted demand; however, prices soon recovered as PGM supply also faltered. Further gains came in the second half when the global automotive sector experienced a rapid recovery as Covid-19-related restrictions were eased. The average realised basket price increased by 51% in dollar terms compared with 2019. The average dollar platinum market price increased by 2%, supported by robust industrial demand, despite continuing declines in diesel automotive demand. Palladium and rhodium were significantly stronger, increasing by 43% and 187%, respectively, driven by the trend of increased loadings in autocatalysts due to tighter emissions standards, particularly in Europe and China.\n\n## 2020 Results\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| PGM production volume (koz) (1)(2)       | 3,809  | 4,441  |\n| PGM sales volume (koz) (2)(3)            | 2,869  | 4,634  |\n| Unit cost ($/PGM oz) (2)(4)              | 713    | 703    |\n| Group revenue - $m (2)                   | 8,465  | 6,866  |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (2)               | 2,555  | 2,000  |\n| Mining EBITDA margin (5)                 | 51%    | 40%    |\n| Processing and trading margin            | 11%    | 12%    |\n| Underlying EBIT - $m (2)                 | 2,270  | 1,672  |\n| Capex - $m (2)                           | 571    | 569    |\n| Attributable ROCE                        | 48%    | 38%    |\n| Fatalities                               | 1      | 0      |\n| TRCFR                                    | 2.40   | 2.50   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ          | 18.1   | 20.1   |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent        | 3.94   | 4.44   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(6) | 56.9   | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers                         | 31,500 | 31,000 |",

        "page_content": "## Operational performance\n\nTotal PGM production decreased by 14% to 3,808,900 ounces (2019: 4,440,900 ounces), mainly due to the shutdown of operations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic during the second quarter and their subsequent ramp-up, as well as the closure of some mining areas at Amandelbult mine that had reached the end of their life. By the end of December, production levels at all assets had returned to normal.\n\n## Own-mined production\n\nPGM production from own-managed mines (Mogalakwena, Amandelbult, Unki and Mototolo and equity share of joint operations) decreased by 15% to 2,549,000 ounces (2019: 3,011,300 ounces) due to lower production at all operations as a result of the Covid-19 shutdowns, as well as the end of life of some mining areas at Amandelbult.\n\nMogalakwena PGM production decreased by 3% to 1,181,600 ounces (2019: 1,215,000 ounces), largely driven by reduced operating capacity in the second quarter due to the impact of Covid-19.\n\nAmandelbult PGM production decreased by 32% to 608,100 ounces (2019: 893,300 ounces), largely due to the impact of Covid-19 which reduced capacity during the second and third quarter in particular, as well as the infrastructure closures in December 2019 at Tumela Upper section and surface production reaching its end of life.\n\nProduction from other operations decreased by 16% to 759,300 ounces (2019: 903,000 ounces), driven by lower production at joint operations.\n\n## Purchase of concentrate\n\nPurchase of concentrate, excluding tolling, decreased by 12% to 1,259,900 ounces of PGMs (2019: 1,429,600 ounces), reflecting the lower production from joint operations.\n\n## Refined production and sales volumes\n\nRefined PGM production (excluding toll-treated metal from SibanyeStillwater) decreased by 42% to 2,713,000 ounces (2019: 4,650,000 ounces) following shutdowns of the ACP during the year. The ACP Phase A unit was closed for a rebuild following an explosion within the converter in February, with the ACP Phase B unit being returned to operation from maintenance during May. The ACP Phase B unit was subject to additional inspections and controls, which led to intermittent stoppages during the remainder of the year until it was pre-emptively closed on 5 November to ensure a continued safe operating environment. The rebuild of the ACP Phase A unit was successfully completed ahead of schedule on 24 November, with first converter matte dispatched to the Base Metal Refinery for further processing on 7 December. The ACP Phase B unit is now undergoing its planned full rebuild, scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2021.\n\nThe ACP stoppages during 2020 resulted in an increase of workin-progress inventory of 1.0 million ounces, which is expected to be drawn down over 2021 and 2022.\n\nPGM sales volumes decreased by 38% to 2,868,500 ounces (2019: 4,633,700 ounces), due to the lower refined production, although refined inventory from minor metals was drawn down to supplement sales.\n\n## Operational outlook\n\nPGM metal in concentrate production guidance for 2021 is 4.2-4.6 million ounces, with own-mined output accounting for c.65%. Refined PGM production guidance for 2021 is 4.6-5.0 million ounces, supported by a drawdown in work-in-progress inventory levels in the year. Both are subject to the extent of further Covid-19-related disruption. Unit costs in 2021 are expected to be c.$700/PGM ounce, reflecting the recovery in volumes.",

Over half of the world's steel is consumed by the construction industry, which includes buildings and infrastructure, such as railways and roads. Steel is also used to manufacture vehicles, machinery, household appliances and many other items associated with everyday life.\n\nThe world's largest steel-producing country is China, making it easily the biggest importer of iron ore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2191 Kolomela's autonomous drilling programme continues to yield significant operational e/fficiencies, while greatly improving the working conditions of employees. Here, drill operator Lizinda Members is now able to operate drill rigs from a central control room rather than being in the open pit.\n\n## Continuing to lead the way in autonomous drilling\n\nKumba's focus on improving occupational health and safety and operational e/fficiency through innovative technology has seen the company transition from manual drilling to a fully automated drill fleet which removes operators from harm's way while simultaneously realising greater e/fficiencies.\n\nFollowing several years in the planning, in 2016, Kumba gave the green light to the autonomous drilling project at its Kolomela mine. However, as a pioneering project autonomous drilling had not been tried anywhere in Africa in iron ore mining - a great deal of creative thinking was required, particularly in the early days. Kumba, therefore, assembled a team of renowned service providers to work alongside its mining team and experts from Anglo American's technical team, with each service provider being tasked with producing a world class mining application in their own area, while many products had to be custom-built.\n\nThis made for an intricate process, managing a diverse team of experts to introduce groundbreaking technologies and equipment.\n\nThe project has been a success. Since Kolomela converted all six of its drills to autonomous drilling, drill performance has improved by 20-30%, and the impact of time lost during shift change-overs has been mitigated. The working conditions of drill operators have also changed immeasurably since the implementation of automation, which has encouraged more women to join the drilling profession. A single operator can now remotely operate multiple drills from the safety and comfort of a control room, with state-of-the art computers, rather than from the dusty and noisy conditions of the open pit.\n\nAutonomous drilling has brought greater accuracy; its precision has also allowed Kolomela to better identify ore quality, blast more e/fficiently, and has facilitated better loading capacity on the back of enhanced shovel performance. Quality has also improved significantly, as autonomous drilling has led to better fragmentation, which has increased the ore grade of the material sent for processing.\n\nOperators have the benefit of camera-based visual monitoring, in real time, which enables automated process optimisation and early problem detection. Furthermore, no jobs are being lost as a result of the drilling automation project and a new group of drill operators is undergoing training and being upskilled.\n\nKolomela's implementation of automated drilling is a great example of technology enhancing the safety of our people, promoting greater gender diversity and improving e/fficiencies in our processes. Based on Kolomela's success, Kumba intends to convert a further 10 of the drilling rigs in its giant Sishen open pit to autonomous working by the end of 2022.",

In 2020, the TRCFR decreased by 16% to 1.74 (2019: 2.06), the lowest on record. This commitment to safe, sustainable and responsible mining has been achieved through increased safety leadership visibility, highrisk work verifications and fatigue management.\n\nIn 2020, Kumba achieved a 99% compliance to the critical control monitoring plan, a key element of the Elimination of Fatalities programme which is central to safety performance.\n\nTechnology is playing an increasingly important role in monitoring and managing safety behaviour. During the year, Kumba introduced pit-wall monitoring; behaviour monitoring to manage driving speed and capability; and Passport 360, enabling onboarding with single induction, real-time contractor management.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nEnergy use decreased by 8% to 8.1 million GJ (2019: 8.8 million GJ) and GHG emissions decreased by 9% to 0.91 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 1.00 Mt CO 2 e), partly due to the decrease in production resulting from the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the first half, as well as the benefits realised from energy-e/fficiency projects on haul trucks.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA increased by 20% to $2,702 million (2019: $2,243 million), driven by a higher average realised iron ore price of $115/tonne (2019: $97/tonne) and a 6% decrease in unit costs to $31/tonne (2019: $33/tonne), largely reflecting the weaker South African rand, partly o/ffset by lower sales volumes.\n\nSales volumes decreased by 5% to 39.8 Mt (2019: 42.0 Mt), principally reflecting an 84% decrease in domestic sales, lower production volumes that were impacted by Covid-19-related disruptions, and extended annual maintenance on a ship loader.\n\nCapital expenditure decreased by 9% to $354 million (2019: $389 million), reflecting the weaker South African rand.\n\n## Markets\n\n|                                                                   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average market price  (IODEX 62% Fe CFR China -$/tonne)           |    109 |     93 |\n| Average realised price  (Kumba export - $/tonne)   (FOB Saldanha) |    115 |     97 |\n\nKumba's FOB realised price of $115/dry metric tonne was 18% higher than the equivalent IODEX 62% Fe FOB Saldanha market price, principally reflecting the higher iron content at 64.3% and relatively high proportion (approximately 69%) of lump in the product portfolio (which helps steel mills reduce emissions). There was also a $6/tonne timing benefit (2019: $1/tonne), principally related to the pricing of our products on the date of delivery.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nProduction decreased by 13% to 37.0 Mt (2019: 42.4 Mt), largely due to the impact of Covid-19 and logistical capacity constraints. Sishen's production decreased by 13% to 25.4 Mt (2019: 29.2 Mt) and Kolomela's decreased by 12% to 11.7 Mt (2019: 13.2 Mt).\n\n## Operational outlook\n\nKumba's production guidance for 2021 is 40-41 Mt, subject to the extent of further Covid-19-related disruption.\n\nUnit costs for 2021 are expected to increase to c.$34/tonne, with the benefit of higher volumes more than o/ffset by the stronger South African rand and cost inflation.",

In 2020, the TRFCR increased by 26% to 1.87 (2019: 1.48). The successful measures put in place to safeguard the workforce from Covid-19 a/ffected scheduling of operations and shutdowns which, in turn, increased the complexity of managing the safety controls in place. A safety leadership programme was initiated in 2020, while the continued integration of the Group's Operating Model and Operational Risk Management processes will be key to ensuring that all tasks, even those not properly scheduled, are well planned and fully resourced.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nMinas-Rio's energy use and GHG emissions remained relatively flat year-on-year; energy use increased marginally to 5.2 million GJ (2019: 5.1 million GJ) and GHG emissions remained level at 0.20 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 0.20 Mt CO 2 e). Solar and wind energy contracts have been signed to supply electricity to Brazil operations from 2022, demonstrating our commitment to minimising GHG emissions through the purchase of 686.2 GWh/year of clean, renewable energy.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA increased by 60% to $1,863 million (2019: $1,164 million), reflecting higher average realised prices, the impact of the weaker Brazilian real, higher volumes and the continued focus on cost control. Unit costs of $21/tonne were in line with the prior year, as additional pipeline inspection costs were o/ffset by the impact of the weaker Brazilian real and higher volumes.\n\nCapital expenditure was lower than the prior year at $163 million (2019: $205 million), driven primarily by the weaker Brazilian real, partly o/ffset by spend on P101 initiatives and a routine tailings dam raise.\n\n## Markets\n\n|                                                               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average market price  (MB 66% Fe Concentrate CFR   - $/tonne) |    120 |    104 |\n| Average realised price  (Minas-Rio - $/tonne) (FOB wet basis) |    107 |     79 |\n\nMinas-Rio's pellet feed product is also higher grade (higher iron content of 67% and lower impurities) than the reference product used for the IODEX 62% Fe CFR China index. The Metal Bulletin (MB) 66 index, therefore, is used when referring to Minas-Rio product. Adjusting for moisture, the Minas-Rio realised price of $107/wet metric tonne (2019: $79/wet metric tonne) was 14% higher than the average MB 66 FOB A\u00e7u index, reflecting the higher iron content as well as a $9/tonne timing benefit (2019: $1/tonne) related to the pricing of our products on the date of delivery.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nProduction increased by 4% to 24.1 Mt (2019: 23.1 Mt), driven by a strong operational performance and the impact of P101 productivity initiatives, despite a one-month planned stoppage to carry out routine internal scanning of the pipeline. Production was not a/ffected by the Covid-19 pandemic, owing to the successful measures put in place to safeguard the workforce and our host communities.\n\n## Operational outlook\n\nProduction guidance for 2021 is 24-26 Mt, supported by P101 productivity initiatives, subject to the extent of further Covid-19-related disruptions.\n\nUnit cost guidance is c.$22/tonne, as the benefit of higher volumes is largely o/ffset by routine maintenance and infrastructure improvements.",

These mines operate in the first half of the seaborne cost curve and produce high quality thermal coal. We also produce around 10 Mt each year of thermal coal for sale to the domestic market. It is our intention to divest our thermal coal operations in South Africa, most likely via a demerger, continuing our responsible approach to our transition away from thermal coal production.\n\nIn Colombia, Anglo American, BHP and Glencore each have a one-third shareholding in Cerrej\u00f3n, an independently managed associate and one of the country's largest thermal coal exporters.\n\n## Uses of coal\n\nMetallurgical coal is used principally in blast-furnace steelmaking production; around 70% of global steel output is produced using this method and, currently, there are no viable at scale substitutes for metallurgical coal in the steelmaking process.\n\nEmerging markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, continue to drive demand for metallurgical coal - helping to generate the steel needed for infrastructure, housing, transport and machinery.\n\nThermal coal is the heat source for around 40% of all electricity generated globally today.

The total recordable case frequency rate decreased by 24% to 4.72 (2019: 6.20) due to a continued high level of focus on safety and health that was reflected in an overall improvement across our operations. Metallurgical Coal's business safety improvement plan is focused on the elimination of fatalities. In 2020, this work concentrated on standardising and embedding key critical controls across site processes and procedures as related to high-risk hazards.\n\nThe focus on risk management and critical controls will continue through 2021, including on real-time frontline activity assurance.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nEnergy use and GHG emissions decreased year-on-year, primarily due to implementation of priority projects to meet the Group's 2030 Sustainable Mining Plan targets, and the cessation of operations at the Grosvenor mine following the gas ignition incident in May 2020. Energy use decreased by 16% to 8.5 million GJ (2019: 10.1 million GJ) and GHG emissions by 9% to 7.40 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 8.17 Mt CO 2 e).\n\n## Financial and operational review\n\nUnderlying EBITDA decreased by 97% to $50 million (2019: $1,707 million), driven by a 34% reduction in the weighted average realised price for metallurgical coal, a 25% decrease in sales volumes and the associated 37% increase in unit costs to $86/tonne (2019: $63/tonne). The volume and cost performances were principally impacted by two underground operational incidents at Moranbah North and Grosvenor, as well as a longwall move at Grosvenor.\n\nCapital expenditure was marginally higher due to increased activity at the Aquila life-extension project, largely o/ffset by a decrease in development work at Grosvenor owing to the suspension of all underground activities since the gas ignition incident in early May.\n\n## Markets\n\n|                                                            |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average benchmark price - hard   coking coal ($/tonne) (1) |    124 |    177 |\n| Average benchmark price -   PCI ($/tonne) (1)              |     78 |    110 |\n| Average realised price - hard coking  coal ($/tonne) (2)   |    112 |    171 |\n| Average realised price - PCI ($/tonne) (2)                 |     84 |    110 |\n\n- (1) Represents average spot prices.\n- (2) Realised price is the sales price achieved at managed operations.\n\nAverage realised prices di/ffer from the average market price owing to di/fferences in material grade and timing of contracts. Hard coking coal price realisation decreased to 90% of benchmark in 2020 (2019: 97%), as sales consisted of a lower proportion of premium quality hard coking coal from Moranbah North and Grosvenor.\n\nMarket prices decreased in the first half of 2020 as Covid-19-related lockdowns impacted demand. Despite a brief recovery in the third quarter, prices decreased again towards the end of the year due to China's uno/fficial import restrictions on Australian coal.\n\nProduction decreased by 26% to 16.8 Mt (2019: 22.9 Mt), principally due to the suspension of operations at Grosvenor, the fall of ground during the first quarter at Moranbah North and subsequent geotechnical challenges, and the impact of a longwall move at Grosvenor. Open cut operations were scaled back at Dawson and Capcoal in response to reduced demand for lower quality metallurgical coal.\n\nAt Grosvenor, operations have been suspended since the beginning of May following the gas ignition incident underground. Anglo American is continuing to respond to the incident, including through investing in the acceleration of technology and sealing o/ff part of the a/ffected longwall panel to prepare the mine for restart. The incident resulted in a $100 million write down relating to lost equipment and longwall assets in that area. Grosvenor is currently expected to return to operation in the second half of 2021.\n\n## 2020 Results - Metallurgical coal\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Production volume (Mt) (1)               | 16.8   | 22.9   |\n| Sales volume (Mt) (2)                    | 16.9   | 22.4   |\n| Price ($/t) (3)                          | 109    | 165    |\n| Unit cost ($/t) (4)                      | 86     | 63     |\n| Group revenue - $m                       | 1,909  | 3,756  |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (5)               | 50     | 1,707  |\n| Mining EBITDA margin                     | 3%     | 45%    |\n| Underlying EBIT - $m (5)                 | (468)  | 1,079  |\n| Capex - $m                               | 683    | 670    |\n| Attributable ROCE                        | (15)%  | 39%    |\n| Fatalities                               | 0      | 1      |\n| TRCFR                                    | 4.72   | 6.20   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ          | 8.5    | 10.1   |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent        | 7.40   | 8.17   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(6) | 20.8   | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers                         | 2,000  | 2,000  |\n\n- (1) Production volumes are saleable tonnes and exclude thermal coal production of 2.0 Mt (2019: 1.4 Mt).\n- (2) Sales volumes exclude thermal coal sales of 2.3 Mt (2019: 1.8 Mt).\n- (3) Realised price is the weighted average hard coking coal and PCI sales price achieved at managed operations.\n- (4) FOB cost per saleable tonne, excluding royalties and study costs.\n- (5) Metallurgical Coal segment includes $74 million projects and corporate costs (2019: $69 million).\n- (6) Reporting in 2020 is aligned with the Group's water definitions; however, 2019 data is not available on the same basis.

Through e/ffective and responsible closure planning and rehabilitation, our aim is that we leave a positive, healthy and sustainable legacy long after our mine gates shut for the last time.\n\nGlobally, Anglo American manages 650,200 hectares of land, of which 86,900 hectares have been disturbed by our operations. To date, 15,100 hectares have been rehabilitated, while a further 10,300 hectares require rehabilitation.\n\nOur approach to mine closure and rehabilitation puts emphasis on rigorously managing our financial responsibilities, working with stakeholders to address social impacts, and starting to restore the land around our operations while they are still active. This 'cradle-to-cradle' approach means that we start to plan for closure in the discovery phase and continue until an enduring post-mining legacy has been achieved.\n\nOur recently updated Mine Closure Toolbox is a structured, risk-based framework for planning and managing any closures. During 2020, we made significant progress regarding compliance with the Toolbox. The majority of operations are compliant with the Group Technical Standard and we will continue to work towards getting all sites fully compliant. And in the 2018 LTIP award, rehabilitation targets were included as a performance measure for senior executives.\n\n## Operational outlook\n\nExport metallurgical coal production guidance for 2021 is 18-20 Mt, but is expected to be at the lower end of the range following a suspension of operations at Moranbah North in response to elevated gas levels on 20 February 2021, subject to the timing of a safe restart at Moranbah North, as well as the extent of further Covid-19-related disruption. Unit cost guidance is c.$75/tonne; a reduction of 13% from 2020, reflecting increased volumes following\n\nAs we move forward on our rehabilitation agenda, partnerships with outside organisations are taking on increasing importance. In Queensland in Australia, Metallurgical Coal's Dawson mine has teamed up with leading provider of heavy equipment, technology and services for the mining, construction and forestry industries, Komatsu. The partnership, Growing Together, aims to return mined land to agricultural use, and support the re-establishment of native plant species using the latest reclamation methods.\n\nGrowing Together started with employees from both companies working together to plant more than 4,000 trees at Dawson mine in March 2020, with plans for a second planting in 2021. They were joined by around 40 students from three local schools and Traditional Owners from the Gangulu Nation. Together, they planted various native eucalyptus species across a 90-hectare site where mining activities have ceased.\n\nThe planting included a pilot of biodegradable COCOON \u00ae planting technology. The COCOON \u00ae system, which uses tree incubators made from wax-reinforced recycled carton, reduces the need for irrigation, requires 100 times less water than traditional methods, and has the potential to raise tree survival rates to at least 90%.\n\nThis new partnership with Komatsu builds on our existing commitment to rehabilitation, which saw more than 400 hectares of land rehabilitated at our two open cut metallurgical coal mines in central Queensland in 2020.\n\nthe restart of the Grosvenor longwall, expected in the second half of 2021. The guidance reflects the sale of a 12% interest in the Grosvenor mine, which was completed on 18 December 2020, equalising the ownership across its integrated operations at Moranbah North and Grosvenor.",

The total recordable case frequency rate was in line with the prior year at 1.55.\n\n## Environmental performance - South Africa\n\nTotal energy use was in line with the prior year at 3.5 million GJ and GHG emissions decreased by 7% to 0.84 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 0.90 Mt CO 2 e). This improved performance can be attributed to the continued implementation of initiatives identified through the ECO 2 MAN programme, a decrease in production as some mine sections reached their end of life at Goedehoop, and the impact of Covid-19-related restrictions on production. The implementation of the Group's Advanced Process Control project has delivered energy-e/fficiency benefits at the Greenside, Goedehoop, Phola, Mafube and Navigation plants.\n\n## Financial and operational review - South Africa\n\nUnderlying EBITDA was a $15 million loss (2019: $5 million loss), driven by a 7% decrease in the realised export thermal coal price and lower export sales volumes of 16.6 Mt (2019: 18.1 Mt) owing to the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions on operations and logistics infrastructure. Unit costs benefited from the weaker South African rand at $38/tonne (2019: $45/tonne), with productivity improvements and cost savings also contributing to o/ffset the e/ffects of inflation and lower production volumes.\n\nCapital expenditure decreased by 30% to $184 million (2019: $264 million), principally driven by the weaker South African rand and the completion of the Navigation life-extension at Khwezela, and the rescheduling of other projects into 2021 due to the impact of Covid-19.\n\nRevenue for thermal coal includes amounts realised from the sale of volumes purchased from third parties (non-equity traded sales) that were not mined by the Group. Excluding these volumes, revenue from the mining of thermal coal (including Thermal coal business volumes from South Africa, Colombia and the Metallurgical Coal business) for the year was $1,384 million, or 4% of the Group's revenue (2019: $1,783 million, 6%).\n\n## Markets\n\n|                                                         |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average market price  ($/tonne, FOB South Africa)       |     65 |     72 |\n| Average market price  ($/tonne, FOB Colombia)           |     48 |     54 |\n| Average realised price  ($/tonne, FOB South Africa) (1) |     57 |     61 |\n| Average realised price   ($/tonne, FOB Colombia)        |     46 |     56 |\n\nThe average realised price for export thermal coal di/ffers from the average market price owing principally to quality discounts relative to the industry benchmark and timing di/fferences.\n\nSouth Africa export thermal coal average realised prices were 7% lower as the Covid-19 demand-driven declines during the first half were only partly o/ffset by a strong recovery in the second half as Covid-19 restrictions eased in India and China. In the second half of 2020, imports to India, a key market for South African coal, returned to the levels experienced in the same period in 2019. A shortage of thermal coal in China led to accelerated customs clearance at Chinese ports in December 2020, providing a boost to seaborne demand.\n\nThe Colombia realised price di/fference decreased year-on-year, broadly in line with the lower market price.\n\n## Operational performance - South Africa\n\nExport production decreased by 7% to 16.5 Mt (2019: 17.8 Mt), mainly due to the impact of Covid-19 operational restrictions and mine sections reaching their end of life at Goedehoop.\n\n## 2020 Results - Thermal coal South Africa\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Export production volume (Mt) (1)        | 16.5   | 17.8   |\n| Export sales volume (Mt) (2)             | 16.6   | 18.1   |\n| Unit cost ($/t) (3)                      | 38     | 45     |\n| Group revenue - $m                       | 1,680  | 1,887  |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (4)               | (15)   | (5)    |\n| Mining EBITDA margin (5)                 | (6)%   | (3)%   |\n| Underlying EBIT - $m (4)                 | (81)   | (94)   |\n| Capex - $m                               | 184    | 264    |\n| Attributable ROCE                        | (21)%  | (19)%  |\n| Fatalities                               | 1      | 1      |\n| TRCFR                                    | 1.55   | 1.56   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ          | 3.5    | 3.5    |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent        | 0.84   | 0.90   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(6) | 31.4   | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers                         | 4,600  | 5,000  |\n\n- (2) South African sales volumes include export primary production, secondary production sold into export markets and production sold domestically at export parity pricing and exclude domestic sales of 12.4 Mt (2019: 9.8 Mt) and non-equity traded sales of 9.4 Mt (2019: 10.9 Mt).\n- (3) FOB cost per saleable tonne, excluding royalties and study costs for the trade operations.\n- (4) Thermal Coal - South Africa segment includes $42 million projects and corporate costs (2019: $59 million).\n- (5) Excludes impact of third-party sales.\n- (6) Reporting in 2020 is aligned with the Group's water definitions; however, 2019 data is not available on the same basis.

Here, in South Africa's Mpumalanga province, our Greenside and Khwezela collieries fast-tracked the development of a medical unit, which was then handed over to Witbank's Specialised Tuberculosis Hospital in the continuing fight against Covid-19, TB, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n\n## Improving people's lives in Mpumalanga\n\nIn line with our Purpose, we continue to play an active role in improving the lives not only of our workforce, but of the local communities around our operations. As South Africa's largest mining company, we have a special responsibility for their health and well-being.\n\nOver the past year, South Africa has had to face up to the challenge of managing a pandemic against the background of a fragile economy. Covid-19 has had a particularly harsh impact in the country's poor, rural areas such as Mpumalanga where our Thermal Coal business operates a number of mines.\n\nWhen an occurrence such as the Covid-19 outbreak takes hold of countries, there is a real danger that so many resources are directed towards tackling the outbreak that society's other pressing needs are pushed aside. Despite the challenges posed by Covid-19, we were able to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthcare at the local level by funding new facilities that o/ffer a range of health and medical services, close to three of our thermal coal mines.\n\n## A new clinic at Mafube\n\nIn some parts of rural South Africa, it is not uncommon for medical facilities to be located many kilometres away from residential areas. And with private transport often di/fficult to access, many people find themselves using buses or taxis to travel to the nearest hospital or medical clinic.\n\nAt Mafube (50% owned by Anglo American), we co-funded a R14.3 million clinic which opened in December 2019. The clinic serves more than 5,000 people from the nearby Sikhululiwe village and 64 outlying farms, and is proving to be a real game-changer. Its fully sta/ffed, 24/7 facilities include a pharmacy, consulting and counselling rooms, a dental wing, emergency rooms, labour wards, mother and baby rooms, and also a comprehensively equipped ambulance. The day clinic is open for nine hours daily during the working week and provides emergency care, treatment for chronic illnesses, integrated childhood illness management, immunisations, ante- and post-natal care, sexual and reproductive health services, HIV/TB management, and mental-health care.\n\n## Greenside and Khwezela fast-track world class health infrastructure project\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic began to hit hard, our Greenside and Khwezela collieries fast-tracked their handover of a world class health infrastructure project that will be used to provide 24-hour care for patients. The development, built and equipped in just 10 months, is an extension of Witbank's Specialised Tuberculosis Hospital. It involved the construction of a separate medical unit that includes multiple isolation wards; a modern radiology wing incorporating radiography wing facilities, including a general X-ray room; as well as a dispensary and pharmacy. The new building also incorporates an anti-retroviral therapy clinic, with several procedure and general consulting rooms, including rooms for a social worker, physiotherapist, and dietician.",

The balance is used mainly in the manufacture of alloy steel and other non-ferrous alloys.\n\nStainless steel is a key input in high-tech construction, and most stainless steels contain about 8-10% nickel. As an alloying element, nickel enhances important properties of stainless steel such as formability, weldability and ductility, while increasing corrosion resistance in certain applications.\n\nThe most significant of all the industrial uses of manganese is also steel production, which consumes more than 85% of all manganese mined. The ore is particularly useful in increasing steel's resistance to oxidation; it can also improve the overall strength, durability and workability of the material.\n\nSince the rebuilding of its two furnaces was completed in 2015, Barro Alto's plant has operated well, maintaining nameplate capacity of 36,000 tonnes of nickel contained in ferronickel per year. The longer term outlook for nickel appears to be supported by electric vehicle demand, as well as ongoing demand for later-cycle stainless and specialist steels.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\n## Nickel and Manganese continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u2191 The bulk ore sorting (BOS) facility at our Barro Alto nickel operation in Brazil. The primary benefit of the BOS system, which has wide potential applicability across our business, is in unlocking capacity in the mining value chain through the early rejection of waste material.\n\n## Bulk ore sorting - an innovative technology being rolled out at Barro Alto\n\nThrough FutureSmart Mining \u2122 we are introducing the step-change innovations that will change the nature of mining - how we source, mine, process, move and market our products. And how we do so in a safe and sustainable way that saves energy and water, reduces our greenhouse gas emissions, and the amount of material we discard as 'waste'.\n\nBulk ore sorting (BOS) is an innovative technology which has wide potential applicability wherever ore heterogeneity is present. We are implementing it at Barro Alto, and elsewhere in our PGMs and Copper businesses. Its primary benefit is in unlocking capacity through early rejection of waste, thereby increasing the ore grade of material sent for processing.\n\nBOS is based on real-time ore classification. Sensors determine ore content prior to processing, providing instantaneous results in respect of an ore's properties, such as its chemical and mineralogical make-up, density and colour.\n\nOwing to its mineralogical heterogeneity, the Barro Alto deposit meets the main requirements for the BOS technology. In the nickel industry, however, BOS is still a pioneering technology and the sensors are still undergoing development in pursuit of enhanced repeatability, precision and productivity.\n\nIn this context, a two-phase trial to evaluate and demonstrate a BOS system for Barro Alto was undertaken from February to September 2020.\n\n## Phase 1\n\nAimed to validate and calibrate the Geoscan-M sensor. This sensor uses Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) technology to generate one chemical composition every 30 seconds. The accuracy and precision evaluation for the data indicated promising results, though additional data was recommended to improve calibration.\n\n## Phase 2\n\nAimed to demonstrate potential classification and enrichment of the BOS system. This comprises: a feeder that receives the mined ore via trucks or front-end loaders; a mineral sizer; an intermediate conveyor belt where the Geoscan-M sensor is installed; a diverter to split the ore flow; and two radial conveyor belts to stack the ore. Trial results obtained from Phase 2 indicated an average of 15% of nickel enrichment with variable results in mass recoveries according to the ore type.\n\nThe trial results are being incorporated by our long term planning team to validate the application of BOS technology to Barro Alto and the modifications needed to accommodate the new process. In parallel, the engineering project to increase the new system's capacity is under way.",

E/fforts during the year focused on closing the main gaps related to Operational Risk Assurance and Elimination of Fatalities audits. Advanced driver assistance systems were implemented in 315 of our own and contractors' vehicles and the integration of the Group's Operating Model and Operational Risk Management process continued to progress well.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nEnergy use increased by 5% to 21.3 million GJ (2019: 20.2 million GJ) and GHG emissions were marginally higher at 1.24 Mt CO 2 e (2019: 1.23 Mt CO 2 e). Solar and wind energy contracts were signed to supply electricity to the Group's Brazilian operations between 2022 and 2036, demonstrating our commitment to minimise GHG emissions through the purchase of 686.2 GWh/year of clean energy.\n\n## Financial and operational review\n\nUnderlying EBITDA increased by 8% to $206 million (2019: $191 million), benefiting from improved operational stability and favourable foreign exchange movements, partly o/ffset by the lower realised nickel price. Capital expenditure decreased by 21% to $33 million (2019: $42 million), driven mainly by favourable foreign exchange movements.\n\nWithin special items and remeasurements an impairment of $589 million was recognised at Barro Alto reflecting a revision of the Group's medium and long term price forecasts.\n\n## Markets\n\n|                               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average market price (c/lb)   |    625 |    632 |\n| Average realised price (c/lb) |    563 |    624 |\n\nFerronickel is traded based on discounts or premiums to the LME nickel price, depending on market conditions, supplier products and consumer preferences. Di/fferences between market prices and realised prices are largely due to variances between the LME and the ferronickel price.\n\nThe average LME nickel price of 625 c/lb was 1% lower than the prior year as the impact of Covid-19 on demand in the first half was o/ffset by the subsequent easing of restrictions, notably in China. Nickel consumption in batteries (electric vehicles and energy storage) was particularly robust, reflecting demand for metals supporting the transition to a lower carbon economy. However, the realised price decreased by 10%, principally owing to the increased ferronickel discount, driven by the higher LME nickel price at the end of 2019.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nNickel output increased by 2% to 43,500 tonnes (2019: 42,600 tonnes), reflecting continuing operating stability and the e/ffect of a 40-day planned stoppage at Barro Alto in 2019.\n\n## Operational outlook\n\nProduction guidance for 2021 is 42,000-44,000 tonnes, subject to the extent of further Covid-19-related disruption.\n\nC1 unit cost guidance for 2021 is 360 c/lb, driven mainly by higher input prices.\n\n|                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Production volume (t)                    | 43,500 | 42,600 |\n| Sales volume (t)                         | 43,000 | 41,700 |\n| Unit cost (c/lb) (1)                     | 334    | 380    |\n| Group revenue - $m                       | 572    | 572    |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (2)               | 206    | 191    |\n| Mining EBITDA margin                     | 36%    | 33%    |\n| Underlying EBIT - $m (2)                 | 79     | 89     |\n| Capex - $m                               | 33     | 42     |\n| Attributable ROCE                        | 5%     | 4%     |\n| Fatalities                               | 0      | 0      |\n| TRCFR                                    | 1.51   | 2.75   |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ          | 21.3   | 20.2   |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent        | 1.24   | 1.23   |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3(3) | 8.0    | n/a    |\n| Employee numbers                         | 1,400  | 1,000  |",

In the first half of 2020, Covid-19-related mining operation shutdowns in South Africa led to tighter supply and higher manganese ore prices. In the second half of 2020, manganese ore prices eased as South African supply volumes returned to close to pre-Covid-19 levels.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nAttributable manganese ore production was in line with the prior year at 3.5 Mt as the impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns in South Africa in the first half of the year was largely o/ffset by an increase in Australian ore production on the back of improved mining and concentrator performance.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic Report\n\n## Crop Nutrients continued\n\nAs a result of the highly e/fficient mine and conveyor design and the minimal processing requirements of the polyhalite ore, our POLY4 product will benefit from an extremely low carbon footprint, as well as being certified for organic use.\n\nAside from the world class nature of the orebody and the quality of the operation we are developing, the addition of POLY4 to our product range aligns well with our portfolio trajectory towards those products that support a low carbon economy and global consumer demand - in this case, for food.\n\n## Woodsmith project\n\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc on 17 March 2020, integration activities have progressed well and the development of the project continued, with total capital expenditure of $292 million incurred by Anglo American during 2020. By the end of December, the excavation of the conveyor tunnel had reached almost 12 km and continued to progress well. At the mine head, the first shaft-boring machine has been assembled within the service shaft and is being commissioned, while good progress is also being made on the production shaft. The impact of Covid-19 on the project's development has been limited to date due to the successful implementation of appropriate health measures.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Anglo American initiated a detailed technical review of the project's development plan with the objectives of optimising the project and aligning it with Anglo American's technical and other standards. This review is nearing completion and confirms the high quality of the overall project design and development approach. Ahead of the scheduled mid-2021 Board update, in which we will present final capital and schedule estimates, we are refining two aspects of the project that we had allowed for in our investment case: we will likely bring forward the investment in additional ventilation to increase early production flexibility, and we are working through the detailed scheduling of the two shaft installations.\n\nTotal capital expenditure in 2021 is expected to be $0.5 billion, $0.2 billion higher than originally planned at the completion of the takeover. This investment reflects the good progress made in 2020 and the focus on certain critical-path items in 2021, including the continuation of the conveyor tunnel and site preparation for the processing facility, in addition to the ongoing shaft sinking programme.\n\n## Market development - POLY4\n\nSupply agreements with a global customer base are in place, including with a number of well-established counterparties such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, BayWa AG, Cibra, IFFCO, Wilmar Group and Muntajat. Many of these agreements have price levels benchmarked against the market prices of the underlying key nutrients within POLY4 and have been set up on a take-orpay basis. In total, these o/fftake arrangements accommodate production in excess of 10 Mtpa.\n\nThe ongoing focus of the market development activities is now around developing and implementing detailed sales and marketing strategies for each region and supporting customers with their own market development activities in order to further promote POLY4 to the end-users of the product. At the end of December, full scale farm trials, with more than 200 commercial partners around the world, were testing POLY4 as part of the commercial demonstration programme that is a key part of the product marketing strategy.\n\n## 2020 Results - Crop Nutrients\n\n|                                       |   2020 | 2019 (1)   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|------------|\n| Group revenue - $m (2)                | 107    | n/a        |\n| Underlying EBITDA - $m (2)            |   1    | n/a        |\n| Fatalities                            |   0    | n/a        |\n| TRCFR                                 |   0.81 | n/a        |\n| Energy consumption - million GJ       |   0.1  | n/a        |\n| GHG emissions - Mt CO2 equivalent     |   0.01 | n/a        |\n| Total water withdrawals - million m 3 |   0.2  | n/a        |\n| Employee numbers                      | 300    | n/a        |",

It does not include taxes incurred by other parties (e.g. customers and employees) but collected and paid by the Group on their behalf. Figures disclosed are based on numbers disclosed within the Group's income statement and exclude the impact of certain associates and joint ventures.\n- (5) Data relates to subsidiaries and joint operations over which Anglo American has management control. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, data excludes De Beers' joint operations in Namibia and Botswana. Prior years' data includes De Beers' joint operations in Namibia and Botswana.\n- (6) Energy savings (%) is calculated as (avoided energy use)/(avoided energy use + actual energy use) where actual energy use is 81 million GJ and avoided energy use is 7.1 million GJ.\n- (7) GHG savings (%) is calculated as (avoided GHG emissions)/(avoided GHG emissions + actual GHG emissions) where actual GHG emissions is 16.1 MtCO2e and avoided GHG emissions is 8.2 MtCO2e.\n- (8) During 2020, we continued building water balances for all our sites and generated a water reporting data set (using the ICMM metrics) for all withdrawals, consumptions, discharges, and re-use/recycling. This has allowed us to, for the first time, evaluate e/fficiency and fresh water withdrawals in a consistent way across all our operations. We also reviewed and restated the 2015 baseline data used to set our milestone and targets, correcting discrepancies and standardising the metrics used for reporting withdrawals. From 2020, we will work with this validated data. By the end of 2020, all our sites had water balances in place for the purpose of water accounting and reporting. We continue to focus on installing critical monitoring instrumentation to improve the accuracy of these water balances and therefore the data we report. This is enabling us to more accurately assess our achievements to date and understand the challenges ahead. Given the breadth and reach of the improvements to our water definitions, in 2020 we have focused on restating the 2015 and 2020 data. In 2021, we will complete the restatement of the 2016-19 withdrawal data. For this reason, this report only includes data from 2020.\n- (9) In 2020, we launched a new integrated social performance management system (Social Way 3.0) which has raised performance expectations and has resulted in continued improvement in our social performance. Prior to 2020, our target was full compliance against our previous standard. As we implement the new standard, sites have been required to set milestone targets on the way to the requirement of full compliance by 2022. Data for 2020 and 2019 is, therefore, not comparable. Sites are expected to have fully implemented the Social Way 3.0 by the end of 2022.\n- (10) Attributable free cash flow includes expenditure on non-current intangible assets (excluding goodwill).",

The Board is committed to ensuring that we continue to adhere to high standards of corporate governance.'\n\nStuart Chambers\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section of the Integrated Annual Report provides an overview of the means by which the Company is directed and controlled. The Board is there to support and challenge management and to ensure that we operate in a manner that promotes the long term success of Anglo American. Over the next few pages we describe the ways in which we seek to achieve this.\n\n## Board composition\n\nWe announced a number of changes to the Board in 2020 and into 2021 as we continually refresh its composition. In carrying out such ongoing Board refreshment, which is beneficial in itself in bringing new perspectives to the Board, we strive to maintain the right balance of experience, skills, continuity and diversity required to be successful.\n\nAs we began the year, I was pleased to welcome Nonkululeko Nyembezi to the Board on 1 January 2020. Nonkululeko's engineering background and extensive experience spanning mining, steel, financial services and technology in South African and global organisations provides us great breadth of insight. In December, I was also pleased to announce that Hilary Maxson will be joining the Board on 1 June 2021. Hilary brings a combination of experience spanning finance, the capital markets, energy and technology gained across her executive career in the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia. In February 2021, we announced the appointment of Elisabeth Brinton, who joins the Board on 1 March 2021. Elisabeth's international career and experience of developing clean energy strategies aligned with climate change reduction, with a clear commercial focus on the potential for digital technologies, will bring additional insights to our Board discussions.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 5 May 2020, Dr Mphu Ramatlapeng stepped down from the Board after almost seven years and, on 31 December 2020, Jim Rutherford stepped down after seven years. I would like to reiterate my thanks to both Mphu and Jim for their dedicated service and the contributions they made to the Board.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, one-third of the Board directors were female. As part of the ongoing refreshment of the Board as tenures expire, and while the Nomination Committee identifies new non-executive directors, there may be times when the size and composition of the Board fluctuates. Following Mphu's retirement in May 2020, the Board reduced in number and female members represented 27%. Following Jim's retirement at the end of the reporting year and at the date of this report, 30% of the 10 Board directors are female, five di/fferent nationalities are represented bringing experience from all Anglo American's major markets, and two directors are people of colour. With the appointments of Elisabeth and Hilary in 2021, the Board will be at 42% female membership. We anticipate that future appointments will, as a whole, continue to support the Board's diversity aims.\n\nThe work of the Nomination Committee and the processes used in relation to Board appointments are described on page 115.\n\n## Global Workforce Advisory Panel\n\nThe Board enthusiastically embraces the board-workforce engagement recommendations contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). The Board and management carefully considered options for the most e/ffective, practical and sustainable way to meaningfully achieve the level of engagement contemplated by the Code. In 2019, we formed a Global Workforce Advisory Panel (the Panel) - comprising 12 employees drawn from across our business - and designated our senior independent director, Byron Grote, to chair and engage with the Panel, to enable the Board to better understand and take into account the views of the workforce. Since its inception, the Panel has met on three occasions, discussing a broad range of subjects. In 2020, the Panel overcame travel restrictions imposed by Covid-19 and held two virtual meetings to discuss a number of topics, including the Group's response to the pandemic. The Board and I were pleased with the quality and the richness of the feedback we received from the Panel and look forward to its continued insights.\n\n- For more information on the Panel and the ways in which we currently engage with our workforce: See page 112",

They provide an opportunity for all directors to learn more about the operations and understand the opportunities and challenges faced by the businesses in their local environments. Site visits are a key mechanism for the Board to directly engage with the workforce from a range of backgrounds and seniority, and also present opportunities to meet with local stakeholders and understand their interests and concerns first hand. While the pandemic prevented us from conducting a full Board physical site visit during the year, and limited opportunities for non-executive directors' site visits. The Board managed to participate in a 'virtual site visit' to our Woodsmith project in the UK, acquired as part of the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc in 2020. The site visits are described on page 110.\n\n## Board e/ffectiveness\n\nAt least every three years the Board and its committees are evaluated by an external third party that interviews the directors and senior management to form an objective opinion on the performance of the Board and its members. Every board and every individual can benefit and improve from the receipt of constructive feedback and this Board and its directors are no exception. In 2018, we conducted an external e/ffectiveness review of the Board, its committees and each of the directors. Internal reviews were carried out in 2019 and again in 2020. The actions we took during 2020 to address the points raised in the 2019 internal review, the processes used, and the results of the 2020 evaluation are described on page 109. I am pleased to report that the overall conclusion was that the Board and committees continue to function well. Of course, there is always room for improvement and each committee and the Board itself are developing action plans to ensure that we address the points raised by the evaluations. Our 2021 e/ffectiveness review will be externally facilitated, and the results reported on in our 2021 Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## The Board and Covid-19\n\nLike many bodies, the Board had to adapt its practices in order to function e/ffectively through the pandemic. I am pleased with how the Board rose to the challenge to continue to operate e/ffectively notwithstanding the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, we conducted all of our meetings virtually and were regularly updated by management in between formal Board meetings on the Group's response to the pandemic. We have also managed to ensure new directors' onboarding programmes have continued as planned, albeit in a virtual environment, and the virtual format of meetings has a/fforded the Board greater opportunities to engage with each other, with management and with employees.\n\n## Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Board supports the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which is available on the FRC's website (www.frc.org.uk). The principles and provisions of the Code have applied throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2020. It is the Board's view that the Company has complied throughout the year with the Code, with the exception of Provision 38 which relates to pension contribution rates. The Group's position in respect of this matter is detailed on page 131. The ways in which the Code has been applied can be found on the following pages:\n\n## Code section and where to find details.\n\n## Section 1: Board leadership and company purpose\n\nFurther detail on how the Board promotes the long term success of the Group is provided in the Strategic Report on pages 8-19. Relations with shareholders are described on page 113. For the ways in which the Board engages with its key stakeholders, see page 13 of our Strategic Report and our Section 172 statement on page 18, and the Stakeholder engagement section on pages 112-113 of this report. Our whistleblowing programme is described on page 122.\n\n## Section 2: Division of responsibilities\n\nPages 100-106 give details of the Board and executive management and the Board governance structure.\n\n## Section 3: Composition, succession and evaluation\n\nThe processes we followed to refresh the Board, and the work of the Nomination Committee, are described on page 115.\n\n## Section 4: Audit, risk and internal control\n\nThe report of the Audit Committee is found on pages 116-122, with further detail on the Group's principal risks to the business in the Strategic Report on pages 53-57.\n\n## Section 5: Remuneration\n\nThe Group's remuneration policy and the report of the Remuneration Committee are found on pages 123-147.\n\nI was disappointed that we were unable to conduct our AGM in the usual fashion but was pleased that we were nonetheless able to use the opportunity of our AGM to engage with shareholders, and answer more questions than could normally be addressed at a conventional AGM, through our question registration process.\n\n## Committee governance\n\nStarting on page 114, each of the Board committee chairs presents a report on the activities of their committee during 2020. The e/ffective and e/fficient operation of the committees and their interaction with the Board are vital to ensure that all matters receive the necessary attention in a timely manner. I am grateful to the members and the chairs of those committees in particular for their commitment and the work that they do throughout the year in this regard.\n\nI hope you find this report useful and informative. I look forward to engaging with as many of you as possible at our 2021 AGM (whether we are able to hold it physically or are required to hold it virtually) and would encourage you to vote your shares even if you cannot attend in person, so that we gain a better understanding of the views of our shareholders as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stuart Chambers\n\nChairman",

The Board is supported by a number of committees, to which it has delegated certain powers. The role of these committees is summarised below, and their membership, responsibilities and activities during the year are detailed on pages 114-123.\n\nSome decisions are su/fficiently material that they can only be made by the Board as a whole. The schedule of 'Matters Reserved for the Anglo American plc Board', and the committees' terms of reference, explain which matters are delegated and which are retained for Board approval, and these documents can be found on the Group's website.\n\nThe Board delegates executive responsibilities to the chief executive, who is advised and supported by the Group Management Committee (GMC). The GMC comprises the chief executive, business unit CEOs, Group directors of corporate functions and the Group general counsel and company secretary. The names of the GMC members, their roles and biographical details appear on pages 104-105.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThe Board currently comprises 10 directors: the chairman, chief executive, two further executive directors (our finance director and technical director) and six independent non-executive directors.

        "page_content": "the appointment of two additional independent non-executive directors who will join the Board in 2021. The roles of our directors are summarised opposite.\n\nThe broad range of skills and experience our Board members contribute to the long term sustainable success of the Group are set out on pages 100-103 and illustrated below. The Board is supported by the Group general counsel and company secretary.\n\nThere is a clear separation of responsibilities at the head of the Company between the leadership of the Board (the responsibility of the chairman) and the executive responsibility for leadership of the Company's business (the responsibility of the chief executive).\n\n## Independence of the non-executive directors\n\nAt the date of this report, just under two-thirds of the Board are independent non-executive directors. The Board determines all of the non-executive directors (other than the chairman) to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with their ability to exercise independent judgement. The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) does not consider a chairman to be independent due to the unique position the role holds in corporate governance. Stuart Chambers met the independence criteria contained in the Code when he was appointed as the Group's chairman in 2017.\n\nIn May 2021, Anne Stevens will have served on the Board for nine years. As a result, the assessment of her independence has been subjected to heightened scrutiny. The Board remains satisfied that Mrs Stevens displays independence of thought, mindset and judgement in her role as a non-executive director. Her continuity of service and commitment provide an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Group that is valuable to the Board, Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees. The Board strongly believes that Mrs Stevens continues to demonstrate excellent stewardship as chair of the Remuneration Committee and will provide continuity and stability as the Board's composition transitions through its progressive refreshment, as well as steering the Committee through the ongoing challenges stemming from the impact of Covid-19 on remuneration. In considering the directors standing for annual re-election at the Company's AGM, the Board will continue to be rigorous in scrutinising Mrs Stevens' position ahead of our 2022 AGM.\n\nThe chairman and the non-executive directors regularly meet without the executive directors present. The senior independent director engages with the non-executive directors, without the chairman present, to appraise the chairman's performance. In 2021, due to travel restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Grote engaged with the non-executive directors using remote technology.\n\n## Time commitment and external appointments\n\nThe Board, through the Nomination Committee, considers annually the time commitment expected from each of the non-executive directors to meet the expectations of their role.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that non-executive directors have business interests other than those of the Company. Prior to their appointment to the Board, non-executive directors are required to declare any directorships, appointments and other business interests to the Company in writing. Non-executive directors are required to seek the approval of the chairman, chief executive and Group general counsel and company secretary, on behalf of the Board, before accepting additional significant commitments that might a/ffect the time they are able to devote to their role. New appointments are then reported to the full Board.\n\nCurrently, several of the non-executive directors hold more than two external appointments (although some of these are not-forprofit organisations). The Board has considered these external commitments, taking into account the time commitment required for each role, and is satisfied they do not impact upon the individual Board members' ability to discharge their responsibilities fully\n\n## Board experience and diversity\n\nThe broad range of skills and experience and the diversity of our Board as at the date of this report are illustrated below.\n\n## Targets of the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reports\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that it has the right balance of skills, experience and diversity. At the beginning of 2020, 33% of the Board were female and three were directors of colour. During 2020, however, the female board target recommended by the Hampton-Alexander Report was not maintained due to fluctuations in the size and composition of the Board as tenures expired. Following Dr Ramatlapeng's retirement in May 2020, the Board reduced in size and female members represented 27%. At the date of this report, three (30%) of the 10 directors are female and two (20%) are people of colour. Five di/fferent nationalities are represented, bringing experience from all of Anglo American's major markets. In March 2021, following the appointment of Elisabeth Brinton, Anglo American will be compliant with the Hampton-Alexander board target, with 36% of the Board being female, increasing to 42% by June 2021 with the appointment of Hilary Maxson.

This includes the provision of a comprehensive, tailored induction programme and individual briefings with GMC members and their teams to provide newly appointed directors with information about the Group's business, culture and values, and other relevant information to assist them in e/ffectively performing their duties. In addition to scheduled Board operational site visits, non-executive directors are expected to spend time at the Group's operations to meet management and members of the workforce.\n\n- - Following their appointments as independent non-executive directors in November 2019 and January 2020 respectively, Hixonia Nyasulu and Nonkululeko Nyembezi undertook tailored and comprehensive onboarding programmes.\n- - Despite global travel restrictions as a result of Covid-19, Ms Nyembezi's induction has been extensive and almost entirely conducted using videoconferencing.

        "page_content": "## Board, Committee and individual director e/ffectiveness in 2020\n\nEach year, the Board undertakes a rigorous review of its own e/ffectiveness and performance and that of its committees and individual directors. At least every three years, the review is externally facilitated. The last externally facilitated e/ffectiveness review of the Board was undertaken in 2018, the results of which were reported in the 2018 Integrated Annual Report.\n\nIn 2019, the Board conducted an internal evaluation and identified five e/ffectiveness priority areas for 2020, which were reported on in the 2019 Integrated Annual Report. An action plan to address these areas was developed in 2020 and progress measured throughout the year, as illustrated in the table below.\n\nThe Board succeeded in implementing the action plan in full in 2020, with the exception that, due to travel restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, limited opportunities were available for in-person engagement with future leaders in the Group's talent pipeline and this area will be prioritised during 2021.\n\nAgain in 2020, the directors completed online, questionnaire-based internal e/ffectiveness reviews. To allow the Board and its committees to judge progress over the past two years, the review explored similar areas to the 2019 internal evaluation. The 2020 review rea/ffirmed that the Board believes that it continues to be highly\n\ne/ffective, collegiate and well-functioning. Importantly, the review found that the Board continues to be clearer and more aligned on strategy at the end of 2020 than at the beginning of the year and that the greater emphasis on strategic discussions was highly valuable and e/ffective.\n\nThe review of the chairman's performance was led by the senior independent director. The chairman was not present during the discussions with both executive and non-executive directors as it related to him. All directors commended the chairman on his continued strong leadership of the Board, noting that he fosters a supportive culture that facilitates the contribution of each director. In addition, the chairman received a report evaluating the individual directors' performance. To complement the internal review process, the chairman held one-to-one meetings with each of the directors.\n\nThe Board's e/ffectiveness review in 2021 will be externally facilitated, the results of which will be reported on in the 2021 Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## Committee e/ffectiveness\n\nThe committee evaluations looked at ways in which they could improve their overall e/ffectiveness, their performance and areas they needed to address in 2021. All committees were believed to be performing well and were appropriately constituted.\n\n## Following the 2019 evaluation, the Board identified the e/ffectiveness priority areas below for 2020:\n\n| Topic                              | Areas identified for action                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Actions taken in 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strategy                           | focus on strategic issues throughout the year.

        "page_content": "## Board activity\n\nThe Board is responsible for the overall conduct of the Group's business, its strategic direction and its culture, ensuring these are aligned to our Purpose and Values. The chairman is responsible for setting the agenda. The rolling agenda of matters discussed by the Board is described and explained on the page opposite. The Board is scheduled to meet at least six times a year but meets more often when circumstances warrant this. In addition, the Board dedicates a full meeting to the discussion of the Group's strategy, addressing short, medium and long term issues. Annually, each of the Group's business unit heads presents to the Board in some depth on key aspects of their business. In 2020, the Board met on nine occasions.\n\nIn between meetings, the Board receives regular updates from the chief executive on operational and business performance. In 2020, the Board received frequent updates from the chief executive on the Group's response to Covid-19 and the strategies in place to minimise the impact of the pandemic on the Group's people and business.\n\nThe agenda of matters discussed by the Board in 2020 is described and explained on the facing page.\n\n## Board and non-executive directors' visits to Group operations in 2020\n\nUndertaking regular site visits allows the directors to gain a better understanding of the Group's operations and culture, and a/ffords Board members the opportunity to meet and engage with a diverse cross-section of employees.\n\nDuring 2020, as a result of Covid-19-related restrictions on movement, limited opportunities were available for physical Board visits to Group operations. We anticipate that in-person Board site visits will resume when travel restrictions are eased, ensuring that the safety and well-being of our Board and employees are always prioritised. The non-executive directors' visits to Group operations that did go ahead during 2020 are described below.\n\n- - Prior to Covid-19 travel restrictions being introduced, in early March 2020, the chairman, chairman of the Sustainability Committee and non-executive directors Marcelo Bastos and Anne Stevens spent four days at the Group's operations in Peru and Chile, accompanied by the CEO of Base Metals, Ruben Fernandes. They visited the Quellaveco copper project, the Algarrobal olive plantation social project and the Hogar Belen orphanage in Peru, spending time with the Quellaveco leadership team. They visited the Collahuasi mine, Las T\u00f3rtolas plant and El Soldado copper mine in Chile.\n- - In October 2020, Nonkululeko Nyembezi, who resides in South Africa, joined newly appointed Anglo American Platinum non-executive directors on a visit to Platinum Group Metals' processing operations in South Africa. The directors visited the Waterval Smelter, the Anglo Converter Plant and the Precious Metals Refinery.\n- - In December 2020, the chairman and senior independent director visited the Group's newly acquired Woodsmith project in the UK.\n\nFor the site visits described above, all required safety protocols were observed and adhered to. Where relevant, additional Covid-19 safety protocols and social distancing measures were in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Stuart Chambers (second from right), Ian Ashby (left background), Anne Stevens (front middle) with CEO Anglo American Peru, Tom McCulley (middle background) at a visit to the Algarrobal olive plantation social project in Peru in early March 2020.\n\n## Virtual site visit: Crop Nutrients business\n\nThe Board usually meets at least once a year at one of the Group's operations. As a result of the global pandemic, in 2020 the Board's site visit was organised as a 'virtual site visit' to the Crop Nutrients Woodsmith project. The Group acquired the Woodsmith project, a deep mine and associated transport, processing and shipping infrastructure development under construction in north east England, in March 2020.\n\nThe virtual site visit incorporated digital pre-reading materials, a newly filmed site visit video, links to videos, including an online visitor safety induction, and detailed presentations from the Crop Nutrients leadership team using videoconferencing. The site visit video took Board members on a tour of the facilities, allowed directors to meet some of the team, and gave insights into the wider community issues and work of the business.\n\nThe comprehensive overview a/fforded the Board a better understanding of the Crop Nutrients business, the Woodsmith project, its people, local communities, sustainability performance and its high grade polyhalite resource.\n\n'A virtual site visit can never replace meeting our leaders and employees in person at Group operations, but in these unprecedented times, the Board had a great opportunity to discover more about our Crop Nutrients business and its people, and to engage with its leadership team.'\n\n## Marcelo Bastos\n\nIndependent Non-executive Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- In March 2020, Marcelo Bastos stands at the place where the final stockpile dome will be constructed at the Quellaveco copper project.",

Stakeholder considerations form part of discussions at Board meetings and the decisions we make take into account potential impacts on our stakeholders, as described in the Section 172 statement on page 18 of the Strategic Report. How the Board interacts directly with some of its key stakeholders is illustrated below. For further information on reflecting stakeholder views in the Board's decision-making, please see pages 12-13.\n\n## Global Workforce Advisory Panel\n\nAnglo American's Global Workforce Advisory Panel (the Panel) was established in 2019, following changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code that recommended company boards establish a way to hear directly from employees. The intention is to give employees more of a 'voice' in the boardroom so their views can be better understood and considered when decisions are being made about the future of the business. The Panel a/ffords greater opportunities for the Board to understand how the Group's culture, Purpose and Values are embedded into the organisation.\n\n## Composition of the Panel\n\nThe Panel is made up of 12 employee representatives, drawn from each country where the Group has a significant presence, and is chaired by our Board's senior independent director, Byron Grote. Panel members are nominated using agreed criteria set out in its terms of reference and selected to ensure representatives, throughout the organisation, are appropriately balanced across the areas of gender, ethnicity, age and seniority. New Panel members undertake a training and development programme to ensure a clear understanding of their role and to support them in being e/ffective employee representatives. The Panel is supported by the Group's company secretarial and employee engagement teams.\n\n## The Panel in 2020\n\nPanel members meet at least twice a year with Byron Grote, who feeds key themes back to the Board. In 2020, the Panel managed to overcome Covid-19 challenges to meet virtually on two occasions, in March and October.\n\nThe Panel was due to meet in person, in Johannesburg, in March 2020. The meeting was swiftly reconfigured and the Panel met virtually over two sessions, to accommodate members in di/fferent global time zones.\n\nTopics on the agenda included the findings of the Group's 2019 global employee engagement survey, 'Have Your Say', Anglo American's Values refresh and the launch of De Beers' new Purpose and Ambition.\n\nAt the second meeting of the year, which took place in October, the topic of conversation was the global Covid-19 pandemic and how Group colleagues were experiencing Anglo American's response to it.\n\nThe Panel is scheduled to meet twice in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ntokozo Khanyile\n\nNtokozo is SHE manager at Kumba Iron Ore's Kolomela mine, and has been a Panel member since its inception.\n\n'Covid-19 did have an impact on how we worked as a Panel serious or emotional topics aren't so easy to discuss in a virtual call. But virtual is now the new normal and I do feel we were able to represent our colleagues well, despite the challenges.\n\n'A year into our roles as Panel members, I think we are all very clear about our mandate to act as the voice of employees in the boardroom. And we were all able to feed back the same sentiments in relation to the way the Group's leadership team demonstrated our Value of Care and Respect throughout the pandemic. They acted swiftly, were proactive in their decisionmaking, and turned things round in very short timescales.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Byron Grote\n\nByron is the Board's senior independent director and in 2019 was designated by the Board to chair the Panel.\n\n'As a Panel, we adapted well to the virtual meeting format and the sessions gave me great insight into how each agenda topic has been experienced across the business.\n\n'I shared the key messages from our October meeting with my fellow Board members during our most recent meeting. The response from them was positive, with favourable comments received about the richness of the feedback provided.\n\n'I look forward to continuing our Panel engagements in 2021, with the hope of convening in person, once it is safe to do so.'\n\n## Global employee engagement survey\n\nThe Board was updated on the Groupwide action plans that had been developed by management to address the results of the global employee engagement survey, 'Have Your Say', which was undertaken in 2019.\n\n- For more information on our People and workforce culture: See pages 43-49",

        "page_content": "## Investor engagement\n\nThe Group always has an active engagement programme with its key financial audiences, including investors and sell-side analysts, as well as potential shareholders. Maintaining an open dialogue with investors was arguably more important than ever through the uncertainty of 2020, particularly during the first half of the year, as financial markets sought to gain a deep understanding of the ways in which the Group was responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Group's investor relations department received a significant increase in the usual volume of engagement requests, particularly during March through June, which the Group was pleased to accommodate as part of its ongoing commitment to transparency. A Covid-19 response page was also set up on the Group's website to keep all stakeholders appraised of the latest developments.\n\nAll investor engagements were conducted through virtual platforms from mid-March, allowing the Group to continue with its regular scheduled programme of roadshow meetings and presentations, including at the time of the interim and final results, as well as attendance at investor conferences. Owing to the lack of travel in response to the pandemic, the investor relations department and the management team were able to attend a higher than usual number of conferences, as well as host ad hoc investor meetings, during 2020. Any significant concerns raised by a shareholder in relation to the Company and its a/ffairs are communicated to the Board.\n\nThe Board receives a briefing at each meeting from the Group head of investor relations and analysts' reports are circulated to the directors. Feedback from meetings held between executive management, or the investor relations department, and institutional shareholders, is also communicated to the Board. In response to the pandemic, this was supplemented by additional frequent updates on the reaction of the financial markets to unfolding events during March-August. To supplement this feedback, the chairman also hosted a series of meetings with some of the Company's largest shareholders to listen to investor feedback first hand.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nDue to the lockdown measures imposed by the UK government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Company was unable to host the AGM in its usual format in 2020. The Board values the AGM as an opportunity for its retail shareholders to raise questions and comments to the Board and instead shareholders were invited to submit their questions in advance of the meeting. All questions and the Company's responses were promptly published on the Group's website. The lack of time constraint allowed for a much greater number of questions to be addressed than is usually possible.\n\nVoting levels at the 2020 AGM were approximately 70%, with generally less than 1% being votes withheld. All resolutions submitted to the meeting in 2020 were passed with at least 90% of votes in favour, apart from the authority to disapply pre-emption rights (79.87%). The votes cast against the resolution to disapply preemption rights were received predominantly from our South African investors. The Company has consulted with its South African shareholders, recognising that the authority sought is accepted market practice in South Africa, and the Company will be seeking an authority at the 2021 AGM to disapply pre-emption rights up to 2.5% of the issued share capital.\n\n## Investor engagement in 2020\n\n## January\n\nClosed period\n\nInvestor presentation: O/ffer for Sirius Minerals Plc Q4 2019 Production Report Investor Mining & Tailings Safety Summit\n\n## March\n\nInvestor roadshows: London, Edinburgh and South Africa Conferences: Citi Global Natural Resources (London) and Exane Basic Materials (London)\n\n## May\n\nInvestor roadshows: London and Edinburgh Conferences: Bank of America Metals and Mining\n\n## July\n\nClosed period Q2 2020 Production Report 2020 interim results\n\nInvestor roadshows: London\n\n## September\n\nInvestor roadshows: London, Edinburgh, North America, South Africa and Europe Conferences: Credit Suisse Steel and Mining, Bernstein Pan European Strategic Decisions Morgan Stanley Sales Desk Briefing\n\n## November\n\nInvestor roadshows: North America Chairman investor meetings Climate Action 100+ investor meeting: Net Zero Framework and other matters\n\nConferences: UBS European, Goldman Sachs London Natural Resources, RBC Global Mining and Materials, Goldman Sachs Global Metals and Mining\n\n## February\n\n2019 preliminary results Conferences: BMO Global Metals & Mining (Florida) Investor roadshows: London and North America\n\n## April\n\nClimate Action 100+ investor\n\nmeeting\n\nQ1 2020 Production Report\n\n## June\n\nConferences: J.P.

Three of the four meetings were held using videoconferencing, due to travel restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. At each meeting, the Committee reviews detailed reports covering the Group's performance across a range of sustainability areas, including: safety; health and wellness; socio-political trends; human rights; climate change; and environmental and social performance.\n\nSignificant social, safety, health and environmental incidents are reviewed at each meeting, as are the results from operational risk reviews and operational risk assurance.\n\nThe Committee seeks to address the fundamental root causes of all fatal incidents occurring across Anglo American.\n\nIn 2020, two members of the workforce lost their lives at the Group's managed operations. Preliminary observations from each of these fatal incidents were reported to the next Committee meeting following their occurrence, noting the factors surrounding the incidents, mitigation steps being taken and the process for formal investigation.

Two of the three meetings were held using videoconferencing, due to travel restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussions at the meetings covered the responsibilities outlined above, with particular focus on non-executive and executive succession planning.\n\nThe following matters were considered during 2020:\n\n- - The composition, structure and size of the Board and its committees, and the leadership needs of the organisation\n- - Updating the Board's skills, experience and diversity matrix\n- - Succession planning for the chairs of the Audit and Remuneration committees\n- - Approving the appointment of Spencer Stuart as external search consultant to facilitate non-executive appointments\n- - Formalising the search processes for non-executive appointments and making recommendations to the Board on the appointments of Elisabeth Brinton and Hilary Maxson\n- - The time commitment expected from each of the non-executive directors to meet the expectations of their role\n- - Recommending that the Board support the election or re-election of each of the directors standing at the AGM in 2020. The length of tenure of the non-executive directors was taken into account when considering supporting their re-election\n- - Succession planning for the Group chief executive, finance director and technical director\n- - Group Management Committee and senior leadership succession\n- - Committee membership changes for recommending to the Board, following the appointments of new non-executive directors\n- - The Committee's internal e/ffectiveness review.\n\n## Process used in relation to Board appointments\n\nAs part of the Board's ongoing refreshment programme, during 2020, the Nomination Committee led search processes to recruit two new non-executive directors, to ensure that the capabilities and attributes lost as a result of retirements during the year were replaced, to reflect the Board's updated skills, experience and diversity matrix, and to ensure continued gender and ethnic diversity.\n\nSpencer Stuart was retained by the Committee to assist with the search process in each case. Spencer Stuart has previously worked for the Group in recruiting for non-executive and senior appointments and accordingly has a good understanding of the Board's requirements, given the markets in which the most suitable candidates were likely to be found. They are also accredited under the UK Government's Enhanced Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.\n\nPrior to each search commencing, the Nomination Committee agreed the skills and experience they considered necessary for the role and provided this to Spencer Stuart. Longlists of potential candidates were then identified by Spencer Stuart and discussed with the Committee members to agree shortlists to be interviewed. In each case, the initial list of potential prospects included ethnically and gender-diverse candidates. Shortlisted candidates were interviewed by members of the Committee and, where practical, other directors.\n\nThe results of the internally conducted Board and committee e/ffectiveness reviews in 2020 are on page 109.\n\nInformation on the Group's policy on diversity and inclusion, and details of the gender balance of Anglo American's senior management and their direct reports (defined as our Group Management Committee and those reporting to the committee), can be found in the People section on page 48.",

The proposed change in auditor was communicated to shareholders in May 2019. This extended lead time provided a smooth handover process from Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), the previous Statutory Auditor, and allowed PwC to shadow Deloitte through areas of the 2019 statutory audit process, giving them a good understanding of the business.\n\nPwC have undertaken a thorough induction process to enhance their understanding of the business. This has included meetings with management and executives across the business and a number of site visits across the jurisdictions in which the Group operates; including Brazil, South Africa and Singapore.\n\nIn addition, PwC have participated in workshops on material judgemental areas prior to their first half year review. The Company and PwC adopted a collaborative approach throughout the year, encouraging ongoing, open communication on current matters as and when they arose.\n\nAnglo American confirms compliance during the year with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority Order on mandatory tendering and audit committee responsibilities.\n\n## Ensuring the independence and e/ffectiveness of the external auditor\n\nAnglo American's Group policy on External Auditor Independence was updated for the 2020 financial year and approved by the Committee. The updated policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC's revised Ethical Standard published in 2019.\n\nA key factor that may impair an auditor's independence is a lack of control over non-audit services provided by the external auditor. The external auditor's independence is deemed to be impaired if the auditor provides a service that:\n\n- - Results in the auditor acting as a manager or employee of the Group\n- - Puts the auditor in the role of advocate for the Group\n- - Creates a mutuality of interest between the auditor and the Group.\n\nAnglo American addresses this issue through the following measures:\n\n- - The prohibition of selected services - this includes the undertaking of internal audit services. The permitted non-audit services mirrors the 'Whitelist' included in the FRC's revised Ethical Standard\n- - Prior approval by the Audit Committee of non-audit services where the cost of the proposed service exceeds or is expected to exceed $100,000\n- - Disclosure of the extent and nature of non-audit services.",

        "page_content": "Anglo American's approach to the provision of non-audit services is contained within its policy on External Auditor Independence.\n\nNon-audit work is only undertaken where there is commercial sense in using the auditor without jeopardising auditor independence; for example, where the service is related to the assurance provided by the auditor or benefits from the knowledge the auditor has of the business.\n\nNon-audit fees represented 28% of the 2020 audit fee of $10.8 million. A more detailed analysis is provided on page 223.\n\nOther safeguards\n\n- - The external auditor is required to adhere to a rotation policy based on best practice and professional standards in the UK. The standard period for rotation of the audit engagement partner and any key audit partners is five years. The audit engagement partner, Mark King, was appointed in 2020 and will rotate o/ff at the end of the 2024 audit in accordance with this requirement.\n- - Any PwC partner designated as a key audit partner of Anglo American will rotate o/ff the audit at the end of 2024 and shall not be employed by Anglo American in a key management position unless a period of at least two years has elapsed since the conclusion of the last relevant audit.\n- - The external auditor is required to assess periodically whether, in their professional judgement, they are independent of the Group.\n- - The Audit Committee ensures that the scope of the auditor's work is su/fficient and that the auditor is fairly remunerated. The Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal during the tender process and received assurance that the proposed fees were appropriate for the scope of work required. Subsequent to the audit tender process, a limited number of recurring and nonrecurring scope changes were agreed. The Committee agreed an audit fee of $10.8 million (2019: $9.9 million) for statutory audit services in the year.\n- - The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditor.\n- - The Audit Committee has the authority to engage independent counsel and other advisers as they determine necessary to resolve issues on the auditor's independence.\n- - An annual assessment is undertaken of the auditor's e/ffectiveness through a structured questionnaire and input from all business units and Group functions covering all aspects of the audit process. The Audit Committee members also participate in this assessment, which evaluates audit planning, execution, communications and reporting. The assessment identifies strengths and areas for improvement, which are discussed with the auditor and action plans agreed. The assessment of Deloitte was conducted in 2020 for the 2019 audit. While the 2019 audit was Deloitte's final year as auditor, the assessment was considered to be helpful for future focus areas for the PwC Audit. The results of the assessment showed that the audit continued to be assessed as e/ffective.\n- - The Committee reviewed the assessment of audit quality. The Deloitte audit for the 2019 financial year was subjected to detailed challenge, including lead engagement partner review and independent partner review of all aspects of the audit engagement, accounting matters and audit opinion. In respect of the performance of PwC, the Committee reviewed the key findings of the FRC's 2019 Audit Quality Inspection Report on PwC together with the steps being undertaken to address the findings. The Committee also reviewed the measures taken by PwC to support audit quality, including their significant focus on robust challenge and appropriate scepticism in respect of management's assumptions. As this was PwC's first year as auditor, an in-depth review of their performance will be conducted ahead of their review of the 2021 interim results.\n\n## Conclusions of the Audit Committee for 2020\n\nThe Audit Committee has satisfied itself that the external auditor's independence was not impaired.\n\nThe Audit Committee held meetings with the external auditor, without the presence of management, on two occasions, and the chairman of the Audit Committee held regular meetings with the lead audit engagement partner during the year.\n\n## Consideration given to the appointment of the external auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee's assessment of the external auditor's performance and independence underpins its recommendation to the Board to propose to shareholders the re-appointment of PwC as auditor until the conclusion of the AGM in 2022. Resolutions to authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine the remuneration of PwC will be proposed at the AGM on 5 May 2021.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRisk management is the responsibility of the Board and is integral to the achievement of the Group's objectives. The Board establishes the system of risk management, setting risk appetite and maintaining the system of internal control to manage risk within the Group. The robust process of identifying and evaluating the principal and emerging risks was in place during 2020 and up to the date of this report. The Group's system of risk management and internal control is monitored by the Audit Committee under delegation from the Board.\n\nThe system of risk management is designed to ensure awareness of risks that threaten the achievement of objectives. The controls that mitigate those risks are identified so that assurance can be provided on the e/ffectiveness of those controls and a determination can be made as to whether the risk is operating within the Group's risk appetite. We seek to embed a culture of risk awareness into the development of our strategic and operational objectives.\n\nThe process for identification and assessment of the principal risks combines a top-down and bottom-up approach. At the operations level, a process to identify all risks that prevent the achievement of objectives is undertaken. Detailed analysis of the material risks at each location is performed to ensure management understanding of the risk and controls that reduce likelihood of occurrence and impact should the risk materialise. These operational-risk profiles contribute to the assessment of risks at the business unit level. Executive management at each business unit assesses risks that threaten achievement of the business unit objectives and the status of controls, or actions, that mitigate those risks. At the Group level, risks are identified through assessment of global factors a/ffecting the industry and the Group specifically, as well as the risks arising from the business unit assessments. Materiality of risk is determined through assessment of the various impacts that may arise and likelihood of occurrence. An exception relates to those risks deemed catastrophic in nature, where the focus of assessment is on impact and status of internal controls, given the very low likelihood of occurrence. When considering the impact of any risk, we assess safety, environmental, financial, legal or regulatory, social and reputational consequences.\n\nRegular reports on the status of risks and controls are presented to executive management teams throughout the year. The Audit Committee reviews reports on the overall Anglo American risk profile on two occasions during the year and conducts in-depth reviews of specific risks during its meetings over the course of the year. Each principal risk is assigned to either the Board or the relevant Board committees to oversee executive management actions in response to that risk. The Audit Committee reviews that oversight process on an annual basis.\n\nDetails of the principal risks are provided on pages 54-57.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nWe define risk appetite as 'the nature and extent of risk that Anglo American is willing to accept in relation to the pursuit of its objectives'. Each principal risk is assessed as to whether it is operating within the limit of appetite for the Group, based on review of the external factors influencing that risk, the status of management actions to mitigate or control the risk and the potential impact should the risk materialise. For risks operating beyond the limit of appetite, a change in strategy may be required. For risks operating within, but approaching the limit of appetite, specific management actions may be required to ensure the risk remains within the limit of appetite.\n\n## Risk management and the system of internal control\n\nControls either reduce the likelihood or impact of any risk, while the identification of material controls - i.e. those controls that have the most influence in mitigating a risk - is an important input for audit planning.\n\nThe system of internal control operates on a collaborative 'three lines' approach, with operating management owning and managing risks and controls on a day-to-day basis, and business unit or functional management fulfilling a second line role through frequent oversight of implementation of controls, and providing complementary expertise, support and challenge relating to the management of risk.\n\nA centrally managed internal audit department provides the third line role by reviewing the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the internal control environment, which includes the work performed by the first and second lines management teams. External assurance providers sit outside the three lines' roles but provide additional assurance to satisfy legislative and regulatory expectations, or requests from management or the Board to complement internal sources of assurance.\n\nInternal audit operated in all of the Group's managed businesses in 2020, reporting its work to executive management and the Audit Committee on a regular basis. The internal audit department's mandate and annual audit coverage plans were approved by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe scope of internal audit work covers the broad spectrum of risk to which the Group is exposed. The audit of controls associated with major operating/technical risks is undertaken in conjunction with relevant experts from the Technical and Sustainability function, the results of which were shared with the Sustainability Committee and Audit Committee.\n\nIn determining its opinion that the internal financial controls and internal control and risk management environment was e/ffective during 2020, the Audit Committee considered the following factors:\n\n- - The results of internal audit work, including the response of management to completion of actions arising from audit work\n- - The key risk areas of judgement and estimation uncertainty within financial reporting and mitigating actions taken by management\n- - The output of risk management work\n- - The output of external audit work and other assurance providers\n- - Issues identified by management or reported through whistleblowing arrangements, and the results of investigations into allegations of breaches of our values and business principles.\n\n## Reviewing the e/ffectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board, through the Audit Committee, fulfils its responsibility in reviewing the e/ffectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control through review of reports submitted over the course of the year covering the risk management process, adequacy of the internal control environment, consideration of risk appetite, in-depth reviews of specific risks and the results of external audit work. The Sustainability Committee also reviews technical and safety risks in detail and reports its findings to the Board.\n\n## Reviewing the e/ffectiveness of internal audit\n\nThe Committee assesses the work of internal audit on a regular basis through the receipt of reports on the progress of the internal audit plan and issues arising and through its annual e/ffectiveness review. The resources of internal audit are also monitored to ensure appropriate expertise and experience. The Committee met with the head of internal audit, in the absence of management on two occasions during 2020. Furthermore, the chair of the Committee held regular one-to-one meetings with the head of internal audit. This enables further evaluation of the work performed.\n\n## Whistleblowing programme\n\nThe Group operates a multilingual whistleblowing facility which uses a reporting platform provided by a third party service provider. The whistleblowing programme is called YourVoice and continues to facilitate confidential and anonymous reporting of a wide range of concerns including:\n\n- - People\n- - Safety\n- - Legal and regulatory (including bribery and corruption)\n- - Fraud and theft\n- - Information management\n- - Social and environment issues.\n\nYourVoice channel is available to our employees in our managed operations as well as to all external stakeholders, such as suppliers, community members, and members of the public a/ffected by our operation.\n\nDuring 2020, we received 614 reports through the YourVoice channel, a 22% increase from 2019. Although much fewer than prior years, we continued to receive reports about procurement fraud committed by an external criminal syndicate in South Africa, and we continue to work with law enforcement authorities on this.\n\n722 allegations were closed during this reporting period, including intakes of 2020 and prior years. 31% of the 2020 allegations closed were substantiated or partially substantiated. All whistleblowing reports are assessed and investigated as appropriate. Appropriate actions were taken against substantiated allegations in accordance with Group policies.\n\nThe continued rise in reports is attributed to the increased awareness of the channel and growing culture of trust among our employees and other stakeholders to raise their concerns with confidence. The promotion of this channel through other relevant Groupwide initiatives, policies, and programmes, also encouraged a healthier 'speak up' culture.\n\nThe current process facilitates the opportunity to take early remedial actions and enables management to address any systemic issues identified. For this purpose, protocols have been agreed with the Group's senior management for early involvement and support in sensitive investigation cases, such as fraud, bullying, harassment, safety and others with significant reputational damage.\n\nThe Audit Committee is charged with the responsibility of monitoring and advancing the programme on a continuous basis.",

        "page_content": "## Introductory letter\n\n## Response to Covid-19\n\n## Governance\n\n## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\nOur diversified mix of premium quality metals and minerals is well suited to helping the world decarbonise. The acquisition of the Woodsmith project (now our Crop Nutrients business) and the planned exit from our Thermal Coal operations takes us further towards a more sustainable future.\n\nAs the worst global public health crisis in 100 years, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on both business and society in general.\n\nThe Board is proud of the way Anglo American has acted in accordance with its values and provided global leadership and coordination, including in safety, health, supply chain and innovation, with our communities, with governments and within the industry. Through these actions, the company has worked to protect the safety and health of colleagues and communities; to maintain the security and integrity of its assets; to ensure the continued supply of essential raw materials to customers; and to preserve its ability to return to full operations as swiftly as possible.\n\nPeople are at the heart of our business and our overwhelming priority is the safety and health of our colleagues and their families. Our WeCare lives and livelihoods programme was launched in response to the pandemic, focused on four key pillars of physical health, mental health, community response and living with dignity. It ensured relevant controls were in place to monitor, prevent and mitigate the risks of Covid-19. This included administering 163,231 Covid tests for employees, contractors and their families. Importantly, we continued to pay colleagues who were unable or not required to work during lockdowns and protected jobs by delaying any planned restructuring through the peak of Covid-19 related disruption.\n\nWorking with community, traditional and faith leaders, as well as government agencies, our teams provided the support needed on the ground. Our community oriented primary care programme reached 2.7 million people and deployed clinical sta/ff in support of government e/fforts, including providing training to 4,015 community health workers. We provided water to 176,500 people and 52,500 food aid parcels to vulnerable households. To date, $40 million has been provided in many forms to support communities in tackling Covid-19.\n\nAnglo American constructed a broad based response that has been warmly welcomed by our employees and stakeholders alike. The actions taken with colleagues, communities, governments and customers (as detailed in our 2020 Sustainability Report, pages 1921) prioritised the health and safety of our workforce, and our host communities, while ensuring the continuity of our business. Going into 2021, we continue to provide support while we transition into the all important phase of sustained recovery.\n\nIn solidarity with the global fight against the pandemic, all GMC and Board members donated 30% of their salary or fees for three months to Covid-19-related causes.\n\n## Business and strategic context\n\nOur approach to pay aims to reward both delivery of long term strategy and annual goals. We do this by balancing metrics that focus on the future with those focused on key short term outcomes.\n\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time, and it is vital that we understand the impact our business has on the environment and minimise the impact of our operations. Countries and companies are working to curb greenhouse gas emissions and the global response is a move towards a greener world. Anglo American is fully committed to helping enable this sustainable future.\n\nWith the company having met its interim greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets a year early, the commitment has been added to achieving carbon neutrality across our operations by 2040, and to have eight of our operations carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nThis sustainable future being envisioned relies in part on technologies that reduce water usage, require less energy and produce less waste. Predictive data analytics will transform our operations in environmental management and health.\n\nThe Committee has sought to align executive pay with this critical agenda, with health, environment and social responsibility metrics featuring across both the annual and long term incentives. Additionally, our ongoing portfolio strategy and FutureSmart Mining \u2122 programme goals, which drive long term sustainability, are captured within the strategic and personal objectives of the annual bonus. These metrics cascade through the organisation, ensuring that everyone is aligned to help deliver a sustainable future.\n\nEnsuring that we have the right environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics in place, incentivising both the key initiatives that will drive step change performance, as well as capturing the resulting progress, remains an ongoing focus for the Committee.\n\n## Decision-making\n\nIn making decisions on remuneration outcomes and policy for the executive directors, the Committee has taken into consideration: company performance, which includes financial performance; progress in safety; personal achievements within the context of our strategic ambitions around innovation; and transforming our portfolio. We also continue to consider shareholder opinion, shareholder experience, pay for the wider workforce, and wider societal expectations. As a Committee, we continue to strive to make decisions that strike a balance between incentivising the management team, paying for good performance and being equitable in the broader context.\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 made 2020 a challenging year for all our stakeholders and the Committee determined that pay decisions must look beyond purely internal metrics to take account of the external impacts of Covid-19 and the relative performance of management in dealing with the pandemic - the payment of incentives in this extraordinary year is not automatic. It is the Committee's strong belief that the actions taken by management to protect lives and livelihoods through the pandemic, both inside the company and across the communities we serve, have been industry-leading. For this reason, whilst we have not increased pay outcomes or adjusted performance metrics to reflect the impact of Covid-19 on our business, the Committee does believe it appropriate to pay the bonus and LTIP outcomes based on the actual results delivered against the targets as set at the start of the year.\n\n## Policy approval and continued shareholder consultation\n\nAs detailed in last year's directors' remuneration report, an updated directors' remuneration policy was put to vote at the AGM on 5 May 2020. I am pleased to report that the new policy passed with the overwhelming support of 95.61% of shareholders. Likewise, support was given for renewed share plan rules governing our LTIP awards and deferred bonus awards.\n\nThe Committee engaged extensively with shareholders through the development of the policy and I would like to thank all those who took part in the consultations for their constructive dialogue and comments.\n\n## 2020 outcomes\n\n## Safety, health and environment\n\nCreating a safety culture at all levels of the organisation by incorporating innovation and digitalisation has become the focus for ensuring our commitment to safe working practices, and the continued commitment to achieving zero harm.\n\nTragically, we lost two colleagues in work-related incidents at our managed operations. This is the lowest number of fatalities ever recorded in our business but, as a Board, we reiterate that any loss of life is unacceptable. To reflect the loss of two lives at our",

        "page_content": "managed operations, the Committee exercised its discretion to operate the safety deductor on the overall annual bonus outcomes.\n\nIn 2020, we continued the trajectory of reducing total recordable injuries with the lowest outcome on record. The Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce is a key workstream to ensure we achieve our goal of zero harm, making sure every colleague returns home safe each day.\n\nWe have made a public commitment to an industry-leading target of achieving carbon neutrality across our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040, and have developed plans to achieve carbon neutrality at eight of our assets by 2030.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nDespite the impact of Covid-19, the Group's 2020 financial performance has been robust, with strong copper, PGMs and iron ore prices o/ffsetting weaknesses in diamonds, metallurgical coal and thermal coal.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for the year decreased by 2% due to the impact of Covid-19 and operational disruption at Grosvenor and the PGMs business. Attributable free cash flow was 47% lower, due largely to a temporary increase of working capital and investments in the business; however return on capital employed (ROCE) performance was strong at 17%, above our target return through the cycle. In 2020, we also saw impressive relative share price performance resulting in a TSR of 16.2% for the year, versus (11.4)% for the FTSE 100.\n\nThe Committee considered the operation of the policy in 2020 and the pay outcomes to be appropriate and reflective of performance.\n\n## Bonus outcomes\n\nEPS performance measured using fixed prices and foreign exchange (FX) rates was 103 cps and resulted in 0% vesting of the 25% of the annual bonus determined by this metric. The 25% of the annual bonus based on underlying EPS at actual prices and FX rates resulted in a 75% vesting, with a result of 253 cps.\n\nThe Group delivered a best-ever safety performance and continued to make good progress towards our environmental and health goals, resulting in a 90% payment against SHE targets (this does not include the safety deductor which is applied on the whole award).\n\nBonus outcomes after the safety deductor were between 54.6% and 55.6% of maximum, 3% lower than the bonuses paid in respect of 2019. The Committee did not adjust bonus outcomes as a result of Covid-19.\n\n## 2018 LTIP outcomes\n\nThe shareholder experience over the three-year performance period was a positive one, the TSR outcome of 71.1% is significantly higher than the FTSE 100 median TSR of (2.6)% and the Euromoney Global Mining Index TSR of 43.1%. This resulted in full vesting of the 70% based on the two TSR components.\n\nThe 10% of the award dependent on ROCE vested at 58%, based on attributable ROCE of 17% for the year. Growth in operational cash flow was impacted by a temporary increase in working capital due to increased inventory in PGMs and diamonds, as well as by increased capital expenditure of $4.1 billion that includes growth projects and life-extension projects. This resulted in attributable free cash outflow of $3.6 billion over the three years (2019: inflow of $3.2 billion) resulting in 0% vesting for the 10% of the LTIP for this measure.\n\nThe sustainability measures were partially achieved, resulting in an 80% vesting for the 10% of the LTIP based on ESG measures.\n\nThe LTIP awards will therefore vest at 83.8% of maximum. No adjustments were made to the LTIP vesting or performance outcomes to account for the impact of Covid-19. The vesting cap introduced in 2017 will not come into force for the 2018 LTIP vesting based on current share prices.\n\nThe Committee considered the annual bonus and LTIP outcomes for 2020 to be a fair reflection of the performance of the business and the experience of shareholders and stakeholders.\n\n## Fairness and wider workforce pay\n\nLast year, I detailed the formation of a Global Workforce Advisory Panel chaired by our senior independent director Byron Grote to facilitate how the Board communicates with and takes aboard the views of the wider workforce. Despite challenging conditions, two meetings took place, with the results being reported back to the Board and discussed by the Committee.\n\nA dedicated fairness section has been introduced, detailing gender pay gap numbers, the CEO pay ratio, and illustrations of how our pay structure is cascaded through the business.\n\n## CEO pay ratio\n\nFor the third year, we include a comparison of the CEO's remuneration to the pay for an employee at the median, lower quartile and upper quartile of the UK employee population. In 2019, our median CEO pay ratio was 133:1, this has fallen to 105:1 for 2020. On a like-for-like basis (excluding employees within our Crop Nutrients business) the ratio has fallen to 95:1. This fall in the like-forlike comparison is due to the lower share vesting value, which has a greater impact on CEO remuneration than on the wider workforce; and the reduction in the CEO's pension.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAnglo American has set out a clear path that positions us to play a key enabling role in transitioning to a low carbon economy. The portfolio, technology and sustainability programmes that determine our future have been defined and, following review by the Committee, are now clearly reflected in our incentives. Specific climate and other ESG metrics feature in both annual and long term incentives, and the delivery of our portfolio and FutureSmart Mining\u2122 programmes is captured within the strategic and personal objectives of the annual bonus. This cascades through the incentives of employees across Anglo American. This process of reviewing the structure of incentives to ensure we optimise alignment between pay and the strategy will continue as we seek to ensure our pay outcomes reflect the experience of all our stakeholders.\n\nLooking forward to 2021, there will be further challenges stemming from the fall-out of Covid-19. The Committee will look closely at incentive levels to ensure that they o/ffer a true reflection of the company's performance and management delivery.\n\n## Salaries\n\nThe Committee approved a 2% increase to executive directors' salaries in 2021, in line with the 2% increase awarded to the Group's UK-based employees. Taking into account the continued reduction in the executive directors' pension contributions (3.33% reduction in 2021), it will mean that, for a second consecutive year, the overall level of fixed pay will be lower than in the previous year.\n\n## Implementation of incentives in 2021\n\nThere are no changes to the incentive levels in 2021, with the maximum opportunities for the annual bonus and LTIP remaining at 210% and 300% of salary respectively. Performance measures attached to the awards are under the terms of the updated policy. Details of performance conditions attached to the 2021 incentives can be found in the implementation report that begins on page 129.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCovid-19 has impacted every part of society and I am proud of the company's resilience and response to the challenges posed. The Committee is equipped with a clear and transparent remuneration policy that provides the structure for remuneration of directors to be predictable but also retains the necessary flexibility to allow a response to the changing global environment and to execute the company's Purpose of re-imagining mining to improve people's lives .\n\n## Anne Stevens\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee",

Deferral and annual grant of awards ensure performance measures will continue to be aligned.   The Committee's powers of discretion ensure that there will be no rewards under incentives for poor performance. Focus on share ownership and long term sustainable performance is reflected in the updated policy. LTIP measures support a  long term focus for executives, including on environmental issues.                                                                        |\n\n## Summary of policy and statement of implementation of policy in 2021\n\nThe following pages provide a summary of the key elements of our directors' remuneration policy. The last column of the table below states how the remuneration policy will be applied in 2021.\n\nFor 2021, there are no significant changes in approach compared to 2020. The Committee has, however, reviewed the performance measures for the annual bonus and LTIP and some changes have been made, as summarised below.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nThe annual bonus measures for 2021 are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed in the 2021 annual report on remuneration. Specific details of individual and strategic performance targets for 2021 will also be included in the 2021 report.\n\nIn line with the policy, at least 50% of the annual bonus will be linked to financial performance. For 2021, EPS will account for 34% of the annual bonus. Half of this will be based on performance at outturn prices and FX, and half on performance at fixed prices and FX. Sustaining attributable free cash flow (SAFCF) will be introduced to the annual bonus and account for 16% of the annual bonus at fixed prices and FX.\n\nIn 2021, the structure of the LTIP will continue to include a 50% weighting on relative TSR. Financial measures based on ROCE and SAFCF will continue to account for 15% each, with the remainder of the measures focused on strategic objectives, including critical ESG priorities. For 2021, SAFCF will be measured at actual prices and FX (previously measured at fixed prices and FX).\n\nThe measure of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been retained given its importance to the Group in achieving its Sustainable Mining Plan's commitments of a 30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. The energy e/fficiency measure from the prior year has been removed, as the Committee considered that this was su/fficiently captured, in future years, through a focus on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. A measure related to tailings facilities has also been retained following the approval of the new Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) which will see the programme continue for another four to five years. It was initially intended that the measure on tailings facilities would be included in the 2020 LTIP only, but it has been retained with the adoption of the new international standard given its importance to the Group's environmental goals.\n\nThe introduction of a social responsibility measure provides focus on this critical aspect of community sustainability and our social licence to operate. The measure will focus on one of our Sustainable Mining Plan's key commitments of delivering socio-economic development to our host communities. Our Sustainable Mining Plan commits to five jobs supported in host regions for every on-site job by 2030, with a focus on programmes aimed at women, youth and people with disabilities. The measure in the 2021 LTIP will be to support two jobs o/ff-site by the end of 2023 for each on-site job.\n\nThe three-year SAFCF measure in the LTIP will be at actual prices and FX and is considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive; disclosing it would enable competitors to derive information as to our detailed business plan. The actual targets, along with the outcomes, will be disclosed in the 2023 remuneration report. The definition of SAFCF can be found on page 247.",

The Committee takes into consideration achievement against these in-post guidelines when making grants under the Company's various incentive plans.\n\nIn order to provide further long term alignment with shareholders, and in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, executive directors will normally be expected to maintain a holding of Company shares for a period after their employment. Executive directors will normally be required to continue to hold the lower of the in-post requirement at the time of cessation and the actual shareholding at cessation. The requirement applies for a two-year period post-termination, and applies to all share awards granted under the BSP or LTIP from 2020 onwards.\n\n## Non-executive director fee policy\n\nThe full remuneration policy for our NEDs is outlined in the 2019 annual report.

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Annual bonus outcomes for 2020 (audited)\n\n50% of the total 2020 annual bonus is payable in cash, with 50% deferred into shares. One-third of the deferred shares will vest after two years subject to continued employment; the remaining two thirds will vest after three years.\n\n50% of each executive director's bonus outcome was assessed against EPS targets. 20% each was assessed against strategic and Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) measures, with the remaining 10% being assessed against the achievement of individual objectives.\n\nStrategic and SHE objectives are shared for each executive director, with individual objectives being tailored for their specific roles. The key individual performance measures are assessed against the overall operational and financial performance of the business. The 2020 bonus is again subject to a safety deductor, which for executive directors resulted in a  3.5% reduction of overall values.\n\nIn 2020, our record on systemic safety, which is recognised in the SHE targets, was positive. The Group recorded an all-time low injury frequency rate, with our total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) decreasing more than 20% over the three-year average.\n\nTragically, we lost two colleagues in work-related incidents at the Group's managed operations. While this represents a best ever outcome for Anglo American and a continued improvement in progress towards our goal of zero harm, any loss of life is unacceptable and will be reflected in a  discretionary 3.5% reduction to overall bonus results for the executive directors and other leaders across the Group. In determining this reduction, the Committee has taken account of the continued year-on-year improvement in reducing fatalities that has been achieved. However, given the progress made over recent years and the internal focus placed on achieving zero harm, the Committee believes that future application of the safety deductor must reflect a new baseline in performance and expectations in our journey to zero harm. As such, the approach to the safety deductor will be reviewed in 2021.\n\nThese fatal incidents highlight how important it is for us to continue to improve the safety of everyone associated with Anglo American, including beyond the mine gate.\n\n## Discretion\n\nIncentives are designed to ensure they drive appropriate short and long term behaviours and it is the Committee's general preference to avoid making any adjustments. Aside from the utilisation of discretion to apply the safety deductor, the Committee did not make any discretionary adjustments to the 2020 bonus outcomes.\n\n## Summary of 2020 annual bonus vesting\n\n|                | Financial metrics  (50%)   | SHE metrics  (20%)   | Strategic metrics  (20%)   | Personal metrics  (10%)   | Total vesting pre-  safety deductor (%)   | Vesting after 3.5%  safety deductor (%) (1)   | Annual bonus  value   (\u00a3'000)   |\n|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Mark Cutifani  | 18.6%                      | 18.0%                | 12.0%                      | 8.0%                      | 56.6%                                     | 54.6%                                         | \u00a31,573,612                      |\n| Stephen Pearce | 18.6%                      | 18.0%                | 12.0%                      | 9. 0 %                    | 5 7. 6 %                                  | 55.6%                                         | \u00a3965,125                        |\n| Tony O'Neill   | 18.6%                      | 18.0%                | 12.0%                      | 9. 0 %                    | 5 7. 6 %                                  | 55.6%                                         | \u00a31,000,878                      |\n\n## Annual bonus performance assessment for 2020 (audited)\n\nThe financial element of the 2020 annual bonus is measured against underlying EPS targets. In line with the prior year, 50% of the earnings element of the annual bonus was evaluated against fixed prices and FX rates, with the remaining portion evaluated at actual prices and FX rates. The fixed price and FX rate EPS portion is designed to monitor Group operational performance, excluding the impact of the variations in price and currency fluctuations. Both target ranges are illustrated in the financial performance table, with 25% vesting for performance at threshold.\n\nUnderlying EPS assessed at actual prices and FX rates for the year was 253 cps (2019: 275 cps) corresponding to a 75% (2019: 47%) vesting performance. This reflected the strong price environment for the Group's basket of commodities, particularly for PGMs, iron ore and copper, and a robust operational performance at Minas-Rio (Iron Ore) and Collahuasi (Copper), that helped o/ffset operational instability at Metallurgical Coal and PGMs, and Covid-19 disruptions across the Group.\n\nEPS assessed at fixed prices and FX rates was 103 cps (2019: 182 cps), corresponding to a 0% (2019: 33%) vesting performance. Vesting of the combined EPS element was 37.3% (2019: 40%). The EPS element corresponds to 50% of the annual bonus award, with the 37.3% outcome equivalent to 18.6% (2019: 20%) of overall opportunity.\n\nIn 2020, shared strategic objectives were introduced into the annual bonus. These objectives reflect the Group's strategic priorities for the year, incorporating a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Following the end of the year, the Committee made a detailed assessment of performance, leading to the evaluations shown in the tables below.\n\nThe executive directors have 10% of the annual bonus weighted to individual performance measures (40% in 2019), focusing on the critical deliverables for each executive director in the areas of Portfolio, Innovation and People. The following tables detail the achievement against these objectives for each executive director.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Metric                     | Threshold   | Maximum     | Outcome     | Weighting   | Vesting   |\n|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Actual prices and FX rates | $1.87/share | $2.87/share | $2.53/share | 25%         | 74.5%     |\n| Fixed prices and FX rates  | $2.14/share | $2.60/share | $1.03/share | 25%         | -%        |\n| Total                      |             |             |             | 50%         | 37%       |",

Euromoney Global Mining Index\n- ii. FTSE 100 constituents over the three-year period to 31 December 2020\n- -  Group attributable ROCE in year to 31 December 2020\n- -  Three year Group attributable FCF to 31 December 2020\n- -  Site level sustainability strategy\n- -  Concurrent rehabilitation of open cast mining operations.\n\nTSR Performance over the three-year period was strong, with shareholders seeing a TSR of 71%, well above the FTSE 100 median TSR of (2.6)% and the Euromoney Global Mining Index TSR of 43.1%.\n\nROCE was 17%, delivering a partial payment. Attributable free cash flow at $(3.6) billion was due to higher working capital as a result of a temporary increase in inventory in 2020.\n\nA sustainability measure required all sites to have a five-year site level strategy in place, which was achieved in full. The seedling rehabilitation goals were spread over three years to allow flexibility with changing business plans; goals were met in one of the three years resulting in 33% vesting for this element of the award. This resulted in an 80% total vesting against ESG measures.\n\nAs outlined above, the 2018 LTIP performance assessment resulted in an overall achievement of 83.8%. At an 83.8% vest and based on current share price, the cap on vesting value does not come into e/ffect. At an 83.8% vesting level, the share price required for the cap to come into e/ffect is \u00a342.46.\n\n## Discretion\n\nNo adjustments were made to the LTIP targets or outcome.\n\n## Performance assessment for 2018 LTIP awards\n\n| Measure                                                   | Weighting   | Threshold  performance  (25% vesting)                                  | Stretch  performance  (100% vesting)                                   | Actual  performance   | Vesting  outcome   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Euromoney Global Mining Index TSR                         | 47%         | Index performance  (43.1%)                                             | Index +6% p.a.

These include beneficial and conditional interests.\n\n## Executive director shareholding requirements\n\nAs per the 2020 remuneration policy, the executive director shareholding guidelines were strengthened, with Mark Cutifani being expected to hold interests in shares to a value of four times basic salary (built up over five years), and Stephen Pearce and Tony O'Neill being expected to hold shares to a value of three times salary. For the purposes of calculating progress against the shareholding requirement, incentive shares with performance conditions are not included, while BSP shares are included on a net of tax basis.\n\nAt the date of preparation of this report, all executive directors have met their shareholding requirements, Mark Cutifani has net shareholdings (including Bonus Shares) equal to 1,790% of basic salary, 848% for Stephen Pearce and 1,457% for Tony O'Neill, calculated using the average share price between 1 October and 31 December 2020 of \u00a321.50.\n\n## Di/fferences from 31 December 2020 to 24 February 2021\n\nMark Cutifani's, Stephen Pearce's and Tony O'Neill's interests increased by 20, 22 and 22 shares respectively during the period between 31 December 2020 to 24 February 2021, as a result of the acquisition of shares under the SIP. Their total holdings therefore increased to 1,911,811; 769,823; and 1,064,771 respectively. There have been no other changes in the interests of the directors in shares between 31 December 2020 and 24 February 2021.\n\n## Shares in Anglo American plc at 31 December 2020\n\n|                      |            |                          |                  |       | Conditional  (no performance conditions)   | Conditional (with  performance conditions)   | Total     |\n|----------------------|------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Directors            | Beneficial | Within a  holding period | BSP Bonus Shares | SIP   | SAYE                                       | LTIP                                         | Total     |\n| Mark Cutifani        | 526,266    | 475,698                  | 256,164          | 4,113 | 1,212                                      | 648,338                                      | 1,911,791 |\n| Stephen Pearce       | 107,764    | 160,100                  | 106,832          | 1,474 | 2,895                                      | 390,736                                      | 769,801   |\n| Tony O'Neill         | 219,813    | 270,987                  | 164,817          | 2,463 | 1,459                                      | 405,210                                      | 1,064,749 |\n| Stuart Chambers      | 12,508     | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 12,508    |\n| Ian Ashby (1)        | 2,180      | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 2,180     |\n| Marcelo Bastos       | 1,475      | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 1,475     |\n| Byron Grote (1)      | 40,896     | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 40,896    |\n| Hixonia Nyasulu      | 1,455      | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 1,455     |\n| Nonkululeko Nyembezi | 1,032      | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 1,032     |\n| Anne Stevens         | 2,122      | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 2,122     |\n|                      |            | -                        |                  |       |                                            |                                              |           |\n| Former directors     |            |                          |                  |       |                                            |                                              |           |\n| Mphu Ramatlapeng (2) | 7,361      | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 7,361     |\n| Jim Rutherford (3)   | 45,000     | -                        | -                |       | -                                          | -                                            | 45,000    |\n\n- (1) Included in the beneficial interests of Ian Ashby and Byron Grote are shares held via unsponsored ADRs.\n- (2) Mphu Ramatlapeng stepped down from the Board with e/ffect from 5 May 2020; her interests are shown at that date.\n- (3) Jim Rutherford stepped down from the Board with e/ffect from 31 December 2020; his interests are shown at that date.",

During the year, our senior independent director Byron Grote led the Global Workforce Advisory Panel in gathering views of employees on a broad range of issues; executive remuneration was not raised as an issue in 2020.\n\nDuring 2020, we welcomed new colleagues stemming from the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc (now our Crop Nutrients business). Work is still being undertaken to integrate them into the Anglo American remuneration framework, as such this population has been excluded from some of the disclosures in this section.\n\n## Cascade of pay elements through employee population\n\nThe following table represents the cascade of our remuneration elements across our UK employee population. Please note employees of our Crop Nutrients business are not currently aligned to this remuneration structure as work is still ongoing in integrating them into the Anglo American remuneration framework.\n\n| Population                            | Remuneration  element      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| All UK  employees                     | Salary                     | Salaries are determined based on the role and market rates; regular benchmarking exercises are taken to ensure  salaries remain competitive against the market.                                                                                                         |\n|                                       |                            | We are an accredited Living Wage employer and all employees are paid at least the Real Living Wage.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                                       | Pension                    | All employees are able to participate in the company's Defined Contribution scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                                       | Benefits                   | All employees are eligible to participate in our range of benefits ranging from private medical coverage,  occupational health services (including Covid-19 testing), and life assurance to a range of well-being and  shopping benefits.                               |\n|                                       | SAYE                       | All employees are eligible to participate in the company's SAYE scheme, which encourages employee share  ownership and the opportunity to share in the value created in the company.                                                                                    |\n|                                       | SIP                        | All employees who have been in employment for three months or more are eligible to participate in the company's                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Management  and senior  management    | Annual Bonus               | Our UK workforce (excluding interns) are eligible to participate in our annual bonus scheme.

The LTIP ensures the focus of the decision-making  population is on long term value creation. |\n| Executive  directors and  GMC members | Shareholding  requirements | The executive director shareholding requirements were further strengthened in our 2020 remuneration policy,  ensuring greater alignment with interests of shareholders. GMC members are also now subject to a shareholding  requirement.                                |\n\nOur key SHE and ESG commitments flow through to the incentives for all eligible employees. The annual bonus scheme outcomes for all eligible employees are determined by team based goals that include SHE measures, financial metrics and critical strategic measures. All eligible employees are incentivised to work collectively on key priorities, including the environmental commitment to develop a roadmap to carbon neutrality, and are subject to the safety deductor. The long term incentive plan awards granted to management and senior management includes the performance measures applicable to our executive directors, which for 2021 includes ESG measures relating to reducing GHG emissions, tailings facilities and livelihoods.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe UK Gender Pay Gap reporting requirement is a regulation under The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 that is designed to provide public transparency in relation to the di/fference between men's and women's earnings, on average, within a company.\n\nThis regulation came into e/ffect on 6 April 2017 and all UK registered employers that employ 250 or more people in Great Britain are required to disclose the specifically defined information by 4 April 2021. The source data for the required information must be at the 'snapshot date' of 5 April 2020.\n\nAnglo American Services (UK) Limited is the UK company that employs the majority of Anglo American's UK workforce and is predominantly engaged in the provision of head o/ffice corporate services to Anglo American's global operations. The following sets out the information required by the UK regulation for Anglo American Services (UK) Limited, as at 5 April 2020.\n\nAnglo American is confident that it complies with the UK's Equal Pay legislation, which governs the right to equal pay between men and women for equal work.\n\n## Summary\n\nOur mean UK hourly pay gap of 47% is primarily a function of the representation of men in the most senior management roles in our UK head o/ffice, as shown most clearly in the quartile analysis. On a global basis (1) , our gender pay gap of 17.9% reflects the far greater balance across the full breadth of our business activities.\n\n- (1) Weighted average gender pay gap of the guaranteed pay of those employees in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Singapore, South Africa and the UK who are subject to the Anglo American Groupwide reward structures",

The gaps shown below are largely attributable to the fact that more men than women are working in more highly paid, senior roles.\n\nAt the snapshot date of 5 April 2020, Anglo American Services (UK) Ltd had a UK workforce of 280 employees:\n\n- - Of this population, 46% were men and 54% were women\n- - Although there has been a significant improvement year-onyear, the senior management population was made up of a substantially higher proportion of men (73%) than women (27%)\n- - Leading to a 47% mean and 36% median UK hourly pay gap (2019: 50% mean and 38% median).\n\n## Hourly pay gap ratios\n\nThe table below ranks Anglo America Services (UK) Ltd's 280 UK employees' hourly pay from lowest to highest and then splits the number of employees into equally sized groups.\n\nReflecting the hourly pay gap described above, the information below shows that there has been a slight deterioration yearon-year in the upper quartile, where the percentage of women decreased from 34% to 30%; however, the percentage of women in the upper middle quartile increased from 40% to 47%. Proportionally, there remain more male employees than female employees in the higher pay quartiles.\n\n## Hourly pay quartiles\n\n| Hourly pay quartiles   |   2020  Percentage  males   in Quartile |   2020  Percentage  females   in Quartile |   2019  Percentage  males in  Quartile |   2019  Percentage  females in  Quartile |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Lower                  |                                      19 |                                        81 |                                     19 |                                       81 |\n| Lower Middle           |                                      41 |                                        59 |                                     43 |                                       57 |\n| Upper Middle           |                                      53 |                                        47 |                                     60 |                                       40 |\n| Upper                  |                                      70 |                                        30 |                                     66 |                                       34 |\n\n## Remuneration disclosures\n\n## Ten-year remuneration and returns\n\nThe TSR chart shows the Group's TSR performance against the performance of the FTSE 100 index from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020. The FTSE 100 index was chosen as this is a widely recognised broad index of which Anglo American has been a long term constituent.\n\nThe TSR performance since 2013, when the current chief executive took o/ffice, versus the FTSE 100 index is positive.\n\nTSR is calculated in US dollars, and assumes all dividends are reinvested. The TSR level shown as at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the five-day period up to and including that date.\n\nThe table opposite shows the total remuneration earned by the incumbent chief executive over the same 10-year period, along with the proportion of maximum opportunity earned in relation to each type of incentive.\n\nThe total amounts are based on the same methodology as for the single figure table for executive directors on page 133 of this report.\n\nAnglo American's UK performance pay schemes operate irrespective of gender, with the majority of UK employees eligible to receive variable bonus pay during the year. In 2020, 84% of male and 81% of female employees received a bonus, with the di/fference relating to there being more women than men in junior roles that do not receive bonuses. The population that does not receive a bonus is formed of interns and employees who joined the company after 1 October 2019.\n\nThe factors driving the bonus pay gap are the same as for the hourly pay gap, being the imbalanced gender composition across the more senior roles in our UK headquarters. Variable performance pay structures for the most senior employees di/ffer from those of the wider workforce, thereby further widening the gap. The increase in the mean bonus pay gap for 2020 was anticipated, owing to the share component of the 2017 bonus (which reflected the continued lower share price experienced in early 2017) vesting in March 2020. We expect to see this bonus pay gap reduce as the proportion of female employees in more senior roles continues to increase.\n\n## Progress in 2020 and our commitment for the future\n\nWe have been working to address the challenges of the longstanding gender imbalance within our industry, most evident at senior levels. We are making considerable progress, including by reinforcing a more inclusive working culture that enables everyone to thrive and through focusing on areas such as recruitment, talent development, mentoring and apprentices.\n\nAcross our global business, we are aligned to the HamptonAlexander recommendations to achieve 33% female representation across our Executive Committee and those that report to it, which we target to achieve by 2023.  By the end of 2020, female representation had increased to 27% in this population from 24% in 2019.  By building on what we have achieved so far, we are confident that we will continue to attract a diverse pool of talent to support our commitment to purpose-led high performance.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee continues to critically review our pay structures to make sure that they are inclusive for our whole employee population and we take this responsibility very seriously.\n\n## GLYPH<6>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<8>GLYPH<5>GLYPH<13>GLYPH<25>/ffGLYPH<26>fiGLYPH<6>GLYPH<4>GLYPH<3>fiGLYPH<12>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<26>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<16>GLYPH<26>GLYPH<24>/ffGLYPH<8>GLYPH<10>GLYPH<25>\n\n<!-- image -->",

At 105:1, the CEO pay ratio at the median is lower than the median ratio of 133:1 in 2019 and 191:1 in 2018. There are two primary drivers of this outcome:\n\n- - The CEO's total remuneration has fallen from \u00a310.75 million to \u00a37.82 million. This is largely due to the decrease in the vesting of the 2018 LTIP award which fell from 92.5% to 83.8% and was granted over a much lower number of shares in comparison to the number granted in 2017\n- - The 2020 calculation includes employees from our newly acquired Crop Nutrients business which has a greater proportion of operational roles compared to the rest of Anglo American's UK employees. As such, the average remuneration levels for employees of the Crop Nutrients business is lower than for other UK Anglo American employees.\n\nOn a like-for-like basis, excluding the Crop Nutrient business, employee population from the analysis, the ratio falls to 95:1. This demonstrates a continued declining trend in the CEO pay ratio.\n\nAs for previous years and in line with our executive director remuneration strategy, our CEO pay comprises a higher proportion of incentive pay compared to the wider employee population. This will likely remain the key driver of fluctuations in the ratio from year to year.\n\nOption A has been used to calculate the ratio, being the most comprehensive methodology of the three prescribed methods. This methodology uses the full-time equivalent pay and benefits data for all UK employees during the year and compares the single figure number for employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles against the CEO at the snapshot date of 31 December 2020, the last day of the financial year.\n\nPlease note, the methodology for the calculation of each employee's single figure number has been updated in line with the changes in approach to calculating the single figure number as outlined in notes 3 and 4 for the single figure table on page 133.\n\nThe salary, benefits and share plan data has been taken on a full-time equivalent basis; however the annual bonus amounts have been taken on an estimated basis. All other elements were calculated in line with the methodology used for the chief executive.\n\nThe employee at the 50th percentile does not participate in a long term incentive plan and does not receive all benefits applicable to the chief executive. Therefore, the ratio is not a direct comparison with the total remuneration of the chief executive. Having reviewed the reasons for the change in the median pay ratio, the company is satisfied that the ratio is appropriate.\n\n| Financial year ending                  | Method  used   | 25th  percentile   | Median  percentile   | 75th  percentile   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| 2020                                   | Option A       | 157:1              | 105:1                | 62:1               |\n| 2020 excluding Crop Nutrients business | Option A       | 149:1              | 95:1                 | 45:1               |\n| 2019 (1)                               | Option A       | 205:1              | 133:1                | 60:1               |\n\n|                            | Salary   | Salary     | Salary   | Total remuneration   | Total remuneration   | Total remuneration   |\n|----------------------------|----------|------------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| CEO pay ratio              | 2020     | 2020 ex CN | 2019 (1) | 2020                 | 2020 ex CN           | 2019 (1)             |\n| 25th percentile employee   | \u00a345,039  | \u00a340,800    | \u00a341,706  | \u00a349,805              | \u00a352,335              | \u00a352,301              |\n| Median percentile employee | \u00a364,080  | \u00a359,776    | \u00a354,810  | \u00a374,193              | \u00a382,048              | \u00a380,811              |\n| 75th percentile employee   | \u00a391,350  | \u00a378,000    | \u00a3108,200 | \u00a3126,812             | \u00a3173,877             | \u00a3178,416             |",

We show the average change in each element for UK-based Anglo American Services (UK) Ltd employees below GMC level (this excludes De Beers and Crop Nutrients business employees). This population is being used, as Anglo American plc does not have any employees. The chosen population is considered to be the most relevant employee comparator group given the Groupwide nature of roles performed at the corporate head o/ffice. Please note, this population does not include employees who joined Anglo American as part of the Sirius Minerals Plc acquisition.\n\n## Distribution statement for 2020\n\nThe table opposite sets out the total expenditure on employee reward over 2020, compared to profit generated by the company and the dividends received by investors. Underlying earnings are shown, as this is one of the Group's key measures of performance, while employee numbers help put the payroll costs of employees into context.\n\n|                           |                         | 2020  Salaries/fees (1)   | 2020  Benefits (2)   | 2020  Bonus   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| Executive directors       | Executive directors     |                           |                      |               |\n| Mark  Cutifani            | \u00a3'000                   | 1,371                     | 41                   | 1,574         |\n| Mark  Cutifani            | % change                | 2%                        | 7%                   | (4%)          |\n| Stephen  Pearce           | \u00a3'000                   | 826                       | 37                   | 965           |\n|                           | % change                | 2%                        | (5%)                 | (4%)          |\n| Tony                      | \u00a3'000                   | 857                       | 38                   | 1,001         |\n| O'Neill                   | % change                | 2%                        | 12%                  | (4%)          |\n| Non-executive directors   | Non-executive directors |                           |                      |               |\n| Stuart                    | \u00a3'000                   | 700                       | 7                    | 0             |\n| Chambers                  | % change                | -%                        | 46%                  | -%            |\n| Ian                       | \u00a3'000                   | 145                       | 0                    | 0             |\n| Ashby                     | % change                | 10%                       | -%                   | -%            |\n| Marcelo  Bastos (4)       | \u00a3'000                   | 105                       | 0                    | 0             |\n| Marcelo  Bastos (4)       | % change                | 2%                        | -%                   | -%            |\n| Byron                     | \u00a3'000                   | 175                       | 0                    | 0             |\n| Grote                     | % change                | 4%                        | -%                   | -%            |\n| Hixonia  Nyasulu (4)      | \u00a3'000                   | 100                       | 0                    | 0             |\n| Hixonia  Nyasulu (4)      | % change                | 11%                       | -%                   | -%            |\n| Nonkululeko  Nyembezi (5) | \u00a3'000                   | 115                       | 0                    | 0             |\n| Nonkululeko  Nyembezi (5) | % change                | -%                        | -%                   | -%            |\n| Anne  Stevens             | \u00a3'000                   | 145                       | 0                    | 0             |\n| Anne  Stevens             | % change                | 4%                        | -%                   | -%            |\n| UK  employees             | \u00a3'000                   | 106                       | 19                   | 92            |\n| UK  employees             | % change (6)            | 5%                        | 11%                  | 7%            |\n\n- (5) Nonkululeko Nyembezi joined the Board on 01 January 2020; no change is calculable for 2020.\n\n| Distribution statement                                   |          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Underlying earnings (1)                                  | $m       | 3,135  | 3,468  |\n| Underlying earnings (1)                                  | % change | (10)   | 7      |\n| Dividends payable for year  to company shareholders      | $m       | 904    | 1,422  |\n| Dividends payable for year  to company shareholders      | % change | (36)   | 10     |\n| Dividends payable for year  to non-controlling interests | $m       | 810    | 759    |\n| Dividends payable for year  to non-controlling interests | % change | 7      | (13)   |\n| Payroll costs for all  employees                         | $m       | 3,365  | 3,467  |\n| Payroll costs for all  employees                         | % change | (3)    | (1)    |\n| Share buybacks                                           | $m       | 223    | 777    |\n| Share buybacks                                           | % change | (71)   |        |\n| Employee numbers                                         | '000     | 64     | 63     |\n| Employee numbers                                         | % change | 2      | (2)    |\n\n- (1) See page 164 for details on how underlying earnings are calculated.",

Under that law the directors have prepared the group financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Additionally, the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules require the directors to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework', and applicable law).\n\nUnder company law, directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of a/ffairs of the Group and parent Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- -  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently\n- -  State whether International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002\n\nas it applies in the European Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 have been followed for the parent Company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements\n\n- -  Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent\n- -  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent Company will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are su/fficient to show and explain the Group's and parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors' remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may di/ffer from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2020\n\nThe directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and parent Company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nWe confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- -  The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group\n- -  The parent Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the parent Company\n\n- -  The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and parent Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Mark Cutifani\n\n## Stephen Pearce\n\nChief Executive\n\nFinance Director\n\n24 February 2021",

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 37 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Context\n\nThe context of our audit is set by 2020 being our first year as external auditors of the Group. As part of our audit transition, we performed specific procedures over opening balances by shadowing the prior year audit undertaken by the predecessor auditor, reviewing the predecessor auditor working papers in the UK and in each of the countries in scope of the Group audit, and re-evaluating the predecessor auditor's conclusions in respect of key accounting judgements in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2020.\n\nWe performed process walkthroughs to understand and evaluate the key financial processes and controls across the Group and, in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, a review of the half year financial information. Following this work, we performed early audit procedures in advance of the year-end (otherwise known as our pre year-end audit work) in each of the Group's controlled inscope locations. The objective of the pre year-end audit work was to ensure that each of our teams was appropriately orientated and able to decide what work needed to be done when and where at year-end, to enable early consideration of as many key accounting judgements as possible before the year-end and to identify any businesses or specific areas where additional audit attention might be required at year-end.\n\nThe audit transition, half year review and pre year-end audit work were important in determining our final 2020 Group audit scope and areas of focus. As we undertook each phase of this first year audit, we regularly updated our risk assessment to reflect audit findings, including our assessment of the Group's control environment and the impact on our planned audit approach.\n\nAs a result of the impact of Covid-19, certain countries were placed under restrictive government lockdowns for part of our audit transition and the duration of our 2020 audit, which impacted the way we conducted our work, with more procedures being performed remotely and additional work being performed to address the requirements of ISA (UK) 500 Audit Evidence . The impacts of the pandemic, both from a financial reporting perspective and as it related to delivering the audit largely remotely, were continuously reevaluated throughout the year, including the impact of the pandemic on our risk assessment which was regularly updated to reflect our audit findings from each stage of our work.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- - Our audit included full scope audits or specified procedures at each of the Group's in-scope business units, joint ventures and associates ('components').\n- - Taken together, the components at which audit work was performed accounted for 97% of consolidated revenue, 92% of consolidated profit before tax and 92% of consolidated profit before tax, special items and remeasurements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- - Assessment of impairment and impairment reversals for intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in associates and joint ventures (Group) and investments in subsidiaries (parent Company)\n- - Recoverability of deferred tax assets in Brazil (Group)\n- - Provisions for environmental restoration and decommissioning (Group)\n- - Fair value allocation of the purchase price in respect of the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc (Group)\n- - Covid-19 (Group and parent Company)\n\n## Materiality\n\n- - Overall Group materiality: $200 million based on approximately 3.3% of the Group's three year average consolidated profit before tax, special items and remeasurements\n- - Overall parent Company materiality: $80 million which represents less than 1% of total assets\n- - Performance materiality: $150 million (Group) and $60 million (parent Company)",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and other financial information\n\n## Independent auditors' report to the members of Anglo American plc\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the failure to comply with environmental regulations, health and safety regulations and anti-bribery and corruption laws, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries and management bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- - Discussions with management, Internal Audit and the Group's legal advisors, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non -compliance with laws and regulation and fraud\n- - Understanding and evaluating controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities and fraud\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Assessment of impairment and impairment reversals for intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in associates and joint ventures (Group) and investments in subsidiaries (parent Company)\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group has intangible assets of $3,103 million (2019: $3,086 million), property, plant and equipment of $36,419 million (2019: $34,201 million) and investments in associates and joint ventures of $1,258 million (2019: $1,333 million). Impairment charges to all these asset categories have been recognised in previous years.\n\nThe determination of whether an impairment or impairment reversal trigger exists can be judgemental. Management must determine the recoverable amount when impairment indicators or indicators of impairment reversal are identified.\n\nThe Group has goodwill of $1,963 million as at 31 December 2020 (2019: $1,981 million), predominantly associated with the De Beers business unit. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nThe determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of value-in-use ('VIU') and fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD'), requires judgement and estimation on the part of management in identifying and then determining the recoverable amounts for the relevant cash-generating units ('CGUs'). Recoverable amounts are based on management's view of key value driver inputs and external market conditions such as future commodity prices, the timing and approval of future capital and operating expenditure, and the most appropriate discount rate. Estimation uncertainty is considered to have increased this year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and increased market volatility as a result.\n\nFor all material finite-lived intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in associates and joint ventures we undertook the following to test management's assessment for indicators of impairment/impairment reversal:\n\n- - understood and evaluated management's processes and controls in respect of the impairment assessment process;\n- - assessed the appropriateness of management's identification of the Group's CGUs; and\n- - evaluated and challenged management's assessment and judgements in respect of impairment/impairment reversal indicators, including ensuring that the impact of Covid-19, climate change and recent commodity price and foreign exchange volatility were appropriately included and considered in management's impairment trigger assessment and conclusions.\n\n- - Assessing significant judgements and estimates in particular those relating to impairment, deferred taxes and environmental and decommissioning provisions, and the disclosure of these items (and as outlined further in the 'Key audit matters' section of this report)\n- - Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular journal entries posted with unusual account combinations\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nThe CGUs where impairment triggers were identified in the year include: Barro Alto (Nickel and Manganese), De Beers (Diamonds), Moranbah-Grosvenor (Coal), Dawson (Coal), Goedehoop (Coal), Khwezela (Coal), Butsanani (Coal), Isibonelo (Coal), El Soldado (Copper) and Cerrej\u00f3n (Coal). As triggers for impairment/impairment reversals were identified in respect of these CGUs, management prepared a detailed cash flow model on a FVLCD basis to estimate the recoverable amount. Management's analysis determined that impairment losses had occurred, amounting to $589 million at Barro Alto and $149 million in relation to South African thermal coal CGUs.\n\nManagement also recorded further impairment charges in relation to specific assets at Moranbah-Grosvenor (Coal) of $100 million, the Group's share of impairments of $72 million at Samancor (Nickel and Manganese) and other assets of $42 million.\n\nRefer to notes 7 and 8 for management conclusions and the Audit Committee's views.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the parent Company holds investments in subsidiaries amounting to $31,651 million (2019: $30,876 million). Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at historical cost less accumulated impairment.\n\nJudgement is required to assess if impairment triggers exist and where triggers are identified, if the investment carrying value is supported by the recoverable amount. In assessing for impairment triggers, management considers if the underlying net assets of the investment support the carrying amount and whether other facts and circumstances, including impairments recorded in the Group financial statements, would be indicative of a trigger.\n\nBased on management's assessment, no impairment triggers in respect of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries were identified at the balance sheet date.\n\nRefer to note 1 of the parent Company's accounts.\n\nSpecifically, for each CGU where triggers for impairment or impairment reversals were identified, and in respect of the De Beers CGU where an annual goodwill impairment test was required, management prepared a detailed cash flow model on a FVLCD basis to estimate the recoverable amount. Our procedures in respect of each model included:\n\n- - verifying the integrity of formulae and the mathematical accuracy of management's valuation models;\n- - consideration of the impact of the latest life of mine plan assumptions and ensuring that the valuation model reflected the latest plans. This included assessing the competence and objectivity of management's internal technical experts in preparing the plan;\n- - assessing the reliability of management's forecast capital and operating expenses with reference to comparing budgeted results to actual performance in prior periods. Where we identified significant shortfalls against budget in prior years, this informed our determination of sensitivities to apply as we formed our independent view about reasonable downside scenarios;\n- - with the support of our valuations experts, assessing the discount rate used in each model and whether it fell within a reasonable range taking account of external market data. Where it did not, we applied our independent view of a more appropriate rate to management's forecast. Our assessment of discount rates also included consideration of country and asset specific risks and challenging management to ensure that these had been appropriately captured in either the discount rate or underlying cash flow forecasts;\n- - benchmarking management's forecast commodity price and foreign exchange assumptions against our own collated consensus data to assess whether they fell within an external analyst range. Specially in respect of De Beers, we engaged our economics experts to challenge and assess the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions used in deriving forecast diamond prices;\n- - challenged and verified that the cash flow forecasts appropriately captured and considered the impact of carbon emissions on price, mine plan costs and cost of capital where material;\n- - based on the procedures above, we satisfied ourselves that management's calculation of any impairment loss recorded was correctly calculated; and\n- - we assessed whether the assumptions had been determined and applied on a consistent basis, where relevant, across the Group. Furthermore, we considered the increased estimation uncertainty as a result of Covid-19 and challenged management as to how this had been incorporated into the assumptions and forecast cash flows.\n\nAs a result of our work, we determined that the impairment charges recorded are appropriate and that adequate disclosures have been made in the financial statements.\n\nIn respect of investments in subsidiaries in the parent Company, we undertook the following to test management's assessment for indicators of impairment:\n\n- - evaluated and challenged management's assessment and judgements, including ensuring that consideration had been given to the results of the Group's impairment assessment in respect of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment;\n- - verified the mathematical accuracy of management's assessment and that the net assets of the subsidiaries being assessed agreed to the respective subsidiary balance sheet at 31 December 2020; and\n- - independently performed an assessment of other internal and external impairment triggers, including considering the market capitalisation of the Group with reference to the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries in the parent Company to identify other possible impairment indicators.\n\nAs a result of our work, we are satisfied that management's assessment is appropriate and that there are no indicators of impairment in respect of the carrying value of the parent Company's investments in subsidiaries at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information",

Deferred tax assets have not been  recognised on temporary differences of $11.9 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019:  $10.8 billion). As the Minas-Rio mine does not have a sustained history of  taxable profits, management view that there is greater uncertainty regarding  longer term taxable forecast profits. The recognition of deferred tax in Brazil is  further complicated as a consequence of the Brazilian corporate tax returns  being filed in a different currency to the accounting functional currency which | In respect of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we evaluated  management's assessment as to whether there were sufficient taxable  profit forecasts to support the recognition of the deferred tax assets. We  evaluated management's future cash flow forecasts, including comparing  budgeted results to actual performance in prior periods and the process  by which they were prepared ensuring consistency of cash flows with those  used for the purpose of impairment testing. Based on our procedures, we  observed that future cash flow forecasts were consistent with those used for  impairment testing and supported the recoverability of the deferred tax  assets recognised. We further challenged the underlying model used to  calculate the deferred tax asset including verifying the integrity of formulae,  the mathematical accuracy of management's model and that the  calculation of the model resulted in an outcome in compliance with IAS 12  Income Taxes .

An additional seven components were identified as requiring a complete audit due to specific risk characteristics and in order to achieve the required coverage in respect of each material line item in the financial statements, including the Group's Corporate function. Specified procedures over significant balances and transactions were performed at one of the Group's joint ventures to obtain appropriate coverage of all material balances.\n\nRecognising that not every operation or business in a component is included in our Group audit scope, we considered as part of our Group audit oversight responsibility what audit coverage had been obtained in aggregate by our component teams by reference to operations or businesses at which audit work had been undertaken.\n\nWhere the work was performed by component audit teams or at a central function, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. As a result of the impacts of Covid-19, certain countries were placed under restrictive government lockdowns for the duration of both our transition and audit procedures which impacted the way we conducted our work, with more procedures being\n\nperformed remotely and additional work being performed to address the requirements of ISA (UK) 500 Audit Evidence . In practice, this meant some component teams were able to attend client sites once restrictions permitted, or were able to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence remotely given more than one piece of audit evidence could be obtained to support the same transaction.\n\nAs a result of Covid-19, we were unable to visit any component teams for the 2020 audit. As such, our oversight procedures included the issuance of formal, written instructions to component auditors setting out the work to be performed at each location and regular communication throughout the audit cycle including regular component calls, review of component auditor work papers and participation in audit clearance meetings. In most cases communication was performed through video conferencing. We also held audit planning workshops for each component in March 2020, largely focused on the extensive planning of audit transition, our first year audit and how we would adapt and respond to the changes in working practices as a result of the pandemic.\n\nTaken together, the components where we performed our audit work accounted for 97% of consolidated revenue, 92% of consolidated profit before tax and 92% of consolidated profit before tax, special items and remeasurements. This was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the Group level, including disaggregated analytical review procedures and our evaluation of entity level controls, which covers a significant portion of the Group's smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included in our Group audit scope.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                 | Group financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Parent Company financial statements                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall materiality             | $200 million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | $80 million                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| How we determined it            | Approximately 3.3% of the Group's three year average  consolidated profit before tax, special items and  remeasurements.                                                                                                                                                             | Based on 1% of total assets, capped at the appropriate  allocation of Group materiality to the Corporate  component.                                                                          |\n| Rationale for benchmark applied | Profit before tax, special items and remeasurements is  used as the materiality benchmark. The directors use this  measure as they believe that it reflects the underlying  performance of the Group and is one of the metrics as  to how the directors are measured on performance. | We considered total assets to be an appropriate  benchmark for the parent Company, given that it is the  ultimate holding company and holds material  investments in subsidiary undertakings. |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was $60 million to $90 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to $150 million for the Group financial statements and $60 million for the parent Company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $10 million (Group audit) and $4 million (parent Company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and the parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- - Obtaining and examining management's base case forecasts and downside scenarios, checking that the forecasts have been subject to board review and approval;\n- - Considering the historical reliability of management forecasting for cash flow and net debt by comparing budgeted results to actual performance;\n- - Reviewing the key inputs into the model, such as commodity prices and production forecasts, to ensure that these were consistent with our understanding and the inputs used in other key accounting judgements in the financial statements such as impairment and deferred tax recoverability;\n- - Performing our own independent sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes in cash flow and net debt on the resources available to the Group;\n- - Reviewing the covenants applicable to the Group's borrowings and assessing whether the forecasts supported ongoing compliance with the covenants; and",

The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic report and Directors' report\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the parent Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- - The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- - The disclosures in the Integrated Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- - The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and parent Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- - The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and parent Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- - The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the parent Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- - The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and parent Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- - The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- - The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the parent Company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.\n\n## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\n## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- - we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- - certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- - the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 5 May 2020 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 and subsequent financial periods. This is therefore our first year of uninterrupted engagement.\n\n## Mark King (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors London 24 February 2021",

Financial performance by segment\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's operating segments are aligned to those business units that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Operating segments with similar economic characteristics are aggregated into reportable segments.\n\nOn 17 March 2020 the Group acquired a 100% interest in Sirius Minerals Plc, and since that date it has been accounted for as a subsidiary of the Group and reported as the Crop Nutrients segment. As a result of the acquisition the Group has gained control of the Woodsmith project, located in North Yorkshire, UK. For details of this acquisition, see note 33.\n\nShipping revenue related to shipments of the Group's products is shown within the relevant operating segment. Revenue from other shipping arrangements is presented within the 'Corporate and other' segment, which also includes unallocated corporate costs and exploration costs.\n\nThe disclosures in this note include certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including definitions, please refer to page 246.\n\n## Segment results\n\n|                                                           | 2020

Thermal coal underlying EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2020, excluding non-equity traded sales, was a loss of $87 million (2019: profit of $95 million).\n\n## Group revenue by destination\n\nThe Group's geographical analysis of segment revenue is allocated based on the customer's port of destination. Where the port of destination is not known, revenue is allocated based on the customer's country of domicile.\n\n|                     | 2020        | 2020   | 2019        | 2019   |\n|---------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|\n|                     | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      |\n| China               | 12,596      | 39%    | 9,470       | 30%    |\n| India               | 2,012       | 6%     | 2,898       | 9%     |\n| Japan               | 4,076       | 13%    | 3,114       | 10%    |\n| Other Asia          | 4,808       | 15%    | 6,055       | 19%    |\n| South Africa        | 627         | 2%     | 807         | 3%     |\n| Other Africa        | 899         | 3%     | 1,220       | 4%     |\n| Brazil              | 462         | 1%     | 437         | 1%     |\n| Chile               | 507         | 2%     | 574         | 2%     |\n| Other South America | 21          | -      | 71          | -      |\n| North America       | 850         | 3%     | 786         | 2%     |\n| Australia           | 8           | -      | 229         | 1%     |\n| United Kingdom (1)  | 2,064       | 6%     | 2,379       | 7%     |\n| Other Europe        | 3,408       | 10%    | 3,785       | 12%    |\n|                     | 32,338      | 100%   | 31,825      | 100%   |",

The weighted average number of shares has decreased since 2019, principally due to the share buyback announced in 2019, which concluded in March 2020. The diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding, including share options and awards, is calculated on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. In the year ended 31 December 2020 there were 198,161 (2019: 57,399) share options that were potentially dilutive but not included in the calculation of diluted earnings because they were anti-dilutive.\n\nHeadline earnings, a Johannesburg Stock Exchange defined performance measure, is reconciled from profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company as follows:\n\n| US$ million                                                           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company             | 2,089  | 3,547  |\n| Special items and remeasurements                                      | 1,046  | (79)   |\n| Underlying earnings for the financial year                            | 3,135  | 3,468  |\n| Operating special items - restructuring                               | (40)   | -      |\n| Other operating special items                                         | -      | (63)   |\n| Operating remeasurements                                              | (71)   | (100)  |\n| Non-operating special items - charges relating to BEE transactions    | -      | (11)   |\n| Non-operating special items - remeasurement of deferred consideration | 348    | 41     |\n| Financing special items and remeasurements                            | (8)    | (9)    |\n| Tax special items and remeasurements                                  | (344)  | 109    |\n| Other reconciling items                                               | 36     | 24     |\n| Headline earnings for the financial year                              | 3,056  | 3,459  |\n\nThe reconciling items above are shown net of tax and non-controlling interests.\n\nOther reconciling items principally relate to adjustments to former operations and disposals of property, plant and equipment and investments (2019: relate to adjustments to former operations and disposals of property, plant and equipment and investments).\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

Significant accounting matters\n\nIn the course of preparing financial statements, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that can have a significant impact on the financial statements. The critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that affect the results for the year ended 31 December 2020 are set out below. In addition to these items, further detail on other significant judgements and estimates determined by management is provided, where applicable, in the relevant note to the financial statements.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe Group has considered the impact of Covid-19 on each of its significant accounting judgements and estimates. The Group's principal source of estimation uncertainty continues to be in relation to assumptions used for the assessment of impairment and impairment reversal of assets where indicators of impairment or impairment reversal are identified. No further significant estimates have been identified as a result of Covid-19, although the pandemic has increased the level of uncertainty inherent in all future cash flow forecasts.\n\nThe price and foreign exchange rate assumptions used to forecast future cash flows for impairment assessment purposes have been made with reference to both the short term observable impact of Covid-19 and the forecast medium and longer term impact on the world economy and commodity prices.\n\n## Impairment and impairment reversals of assets\n\n## i) Critical accounting judgements\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are any indicators that its assets and cash generating units (CGUs) may be impaired. Operating and economic assumptions which could affect the valuation of assets using discounted cash flows, including those that could be impacted by the Group's current and emerging principal risks such as climate change, are updated regularly as part of the Group's planning and forecasting processes. Judgement is therefore required to determine whether the updates represent significant changes in the service potential of an asset or CGU, and are therefore indicators of impairment or impairment reversal. The judgement also takes into account the Group's long term economic forecasts, market consensus and sensitivity analysis of the discounted cash flow models used to value the Group's assets.\n\nAssets (other than goodwill) that have been previously impaired must be assessed for indicators of both impairment and impairment reversal. Such assets are generally carried on the balance sheet at a value close to their recoverable amount at the last assessment. Therefore in principle any change to operational plans or assumptions or economic parameters could result in further impairment or impairment reversal if an indicator is identified. Significant operating assets that the Group has previously impaired include Minas-Rio (Iron Ore); Dawson, Khwezela and Goedehoop (Coal); Barro Alto and Samancor (Nickel and Manganese) and El Soldado (Copper). These assets have a combined carrying value of $6.4 billion within property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2020, of which the most significant individual asset is Minas-Rio, which has a carrying value of $5.2 billion and cumulative impairment eligible for future reversal of $4.1 billion. The Group has also previously impaired its investment in Cerrej\u00f3n. This asset has a carrying value of $0.4 billion and is accounted for as an investment in associate.\n\nSpecial items and remeasurements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2019: $0.1 bn)\n\n## ii) Cash flow projections for impairment testing\n\nExpected future cash flows used in discounted cash flow models are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. They are significantly affected by a number of factors including Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, together with economic factors such as commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates and estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure. Where discounted cash flow models based on management's assumptions are used, the resulting fair value measurements are considered to be at level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement , as they depend to a significant extent on unobservable valuation inputs.\n\nCash flow projections are based on financial budgets and Life of Mine Plans or, for non-mine assets, an equivalent appropriate long term forecast, incorporating key assumptions as detailed below:\n\n- - Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Ore Reserves and, where considered appropriate, Mineral Resources are incorporated in projected cash flows, based on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources statements and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resources are included where management has a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction, despite additional evaluation still being required prior to meeting the required confidence to convert to Ore Reserves.\n- - Commodity and product prices\n\nCommodity and product prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked with external sources of information such as the range of available analyst forecasts and for the short term, spot prices. In estimating the forecast cash flows, management also takes into account the expected realised price from existing contractual arrangements.\n\n- - Foreign exchange rates\n- Foreign exchange rates are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked with external sources of information for relevant countries of operation or directly from external forecasts. Long term foreign exchange rates are kept constant on a real basis.\n- - Discount rates\n\nCash flow projections used in fair value less costs of disposal impairment models are discounted based on real post-tax discount rates, assessed annually. Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including the risk profile of the individual asset and country risk. A real discount rate of 7.0% has been used in the majority of the Group's fair value less costs of disposal models which are prepared in US dollars (2019: 7.0% used in all valuation models). A real discount rate of 9.5% has been used for South African thermal coal assets (for which the valuation model has been prepared in South African rand) to reflect specific risk factors including country risk, climate change risks and other asset specific risks.",

Significant accounting matters continued\n\n- - Operating costs, capital expenditure and other operating factors Operating costs and capital expenditure are based on financial budgets covering a five-year period. Cash flow projections beyond five years are based on Life of Mine Plans or non-mine production plans, as applicable, and internal management forecasts. Cost assumptions incorporate management experience and expectations, as well as the nature and location of the operation and the risks associated therewith (for example, the grade of Ore Reserves varying significantly over time and unforeseen operational issues). Underlying input cost assumptions are consistent with related output price assumptions. Other operating factors, such as the timelines of granting licences and permits are based on management's best estimate of the outcome of uncertain future events at the balance sheet date. For further information refer to the unaudited Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020.\n\nWhere an asset has potential for future development through capital investment, to which a market participant would attribute value, and the costs and economic benefits can be estimated reliably, this development is included in the recoverable amount (with appropriate risk adjustments).\n\n## - Climate change\n\nClimate change may have a number of impacts for the Group including the risks and opportunities relating to the demand for the Group's commodities as a result of the transition to a low carbon economy and physical risks caused by climate change. For managed operations, the Group has incorporated carbon pricing, where material, in its projected cash flows. Short term carbon prices are incorporated based on currently enacted legislation, and where applicable longer term carbon prices are based on latest internal views, formed with reference to external forecasts. Separate carbon prices are used for developed and developing economies. Carbon costs are based on a carbon price per tonne/CO2e, multiplied by estimated Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The cost and benefit of achieving the Group's emissions reduction strategy is included when the Group has a high degree of confidence that a project will achieve a reduction, which typically aligns with the related capital project being internally approved. The Group's commodity price and other key assumptions represent management's best estimate and do not reflect a specific climate-related scenario.\n\n## iii) Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nFor assets where indicators of impairment or impairment reversal are identified, the Group performs impairment reviews to assess the recoverable amount of its operating assets principally with reference to fair value less costs of disposal, assessed using discounted cash flow models. Mining operations are large, complex assets requiring significant technical and financial resources to operate. Their value may be sensitive to a range of characteristics unique to each asset. Management applies judgement in determining the assumptions that are considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be applied by market participants as outlined in note 39D. All assumptions are made from the perspective of a hypothetical informed market participant (as required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement ). As a result, these assumptions may differ from the Group's own internal forecasts.\n\n## De Beers goodwill\n\nThe valuation of De Beers has been assessed as at 31 December 2020 and the recoverable amount was considered to exceed the carrying value by $1.2 billion. The valuation, based on discounted cash flows, is sensitive to input assumptions particularly in relation to the foreign exchange assumption for producer currencies against the US dollar (affecting the cost of production in US dollar terms) and the future price growth for diamonds.\n\nThe foreign exchange assumptions in respect of the producer currency rates against the USD are sourced from an external provider. In the short term to medium term we assume the southern African producer currencies exchange rates are broadly flat compared to FY20 actual rates. Thereafter the rates are assumed to depreciate by the inflation differential between producer economies and the US.\n\nThe two primary factors impacting price growth are expected consumer demand growth and changes in global supply.\n\nExpected consumer demand growth (in USD terms) is driven predominantly by:\n\n- - local currency GDP growth expectations in the primary markets in which diamonds are sold\n\nDesirability includes all aspects of buying behaviour such as competition for share of wallet from other luxury products including experiential holidays, hardline and softline goods, new technology and other products such as labgrown diamonds.\n\nBased on external forecasts the Group is anticipating a protracted 'U' shaped recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic which assumes that consumer demand recovers to the level seen in 2018 by the end of 2022, although the Group has prepared for a more prolonged recovery. Following the steep recovery forecast in 2021 the medium term real GDP growth assumption in US dollar terms is 4.2% which is sourced from an external provider and is weighted by the key markets in which we operate including the US, China, India, Japan, Gulf Region and Eurozone. Over the long term consumer demand is expected to grow at least in line with inflation .\n\nThe external foreign exchange forecast is of annual US dollar depreciation of 1.5% against the Chinese renminbi, 0.7% against the Indian rupee, 0.8% against the Japanese yen and 1.6% against the euro for the medium term compared to FY20 actual average rates.\n\nThe consumer demand forecast has assumed a growth in the short term market penetration of labgrown diamonds which is then forecast to revert back to a stable share of the market by 2025 as the product becomes distinguished as a separate category. Otherwise, changes in total global supply are driven primarily by the output anticipated from new projects and assumes a continued supply contraction over the long term.\n\nThe valuation remains sensitive to consumer demand growth which could result in both upside and downside risk. For example, a reduction in the weighted GDP growth rates, a strengthening of the US dollar against other consumer country currencies or an increase in substitution by labgrown diamonds would suppress consumer demand growth. These factors have a range of possible impacts that may not occur independently of each other.\n\nA range of alternative scenarios have been considered in determining whether there is a reasonably possible change in the forecast for foreign exchange rates in producer countries in conjunction with a reasonably possible change in consumer demand growth, which would result in the recoverable amount equating to the carrying amount.\n\nA 5% strengthening of the producer currencies against our assumed US dollar forecast in conjunction with a 0.3 percentage point underperformance in our mid to long term consumer demand growth expectation would result in the recoverable amount equating to the carrying amount. This reduction in the consumer demand growth might be brought about through either a 15% one off appreciation of the US dollar against consumer countries' currencies or a reduction in long term real GDP growth assumptions by 0.3 percentage points with other valuation assumptions remaining the same.\n\nDuring the global pandemic we have seen more marginal producers pause production and they are only likely to resume production if there is a stronger recovery in demand than we forecast. Our assessment is that no reasonably possible change in global supply with other assumptions remaining the same, would result in the recoverable amount equating to the carrying amount.\n\n## Barro Alto\n\nBarro Alto (Nickel and Manganese) was previously impaired by $0.8 billion in 2013. Following a revision to the Group's medium and long term nickel price forecast, the recoverable amount has been reassessed and an impairment of $589 million recorded against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment ($589 million after tax) to bring the carrying value in line with the recoverable amount of $0.8 billion.\n\nThe valuation, based on discounted cash flows, is sensitive to changes in input assumptions, particularly in relation to future nickel prices. The forecast realised price is calculated using the forecast LME nickel price as reference, with adjustments to reflect the specific nature of the product. In addition to the base case valuation, alternative scenarios have been considered to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions. The model uses prices that fall within the analyst range throughout the model. The nickel price in the model falls within the lowest quartile of the analyst price range of $5.6/lb to $6.4/lb in the period 2023-2025 (LME nickel, 2020 real basis). The long term price used after this period is consistent with the analyst mean. If the model assumptions were changed by $0.5/lb in each year with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, this would change the valuation by $0.3 billion.",

Significant accounting matters continued\n\nThe model uses a forecast for the average Brazilian real to US dollar nominal exchange rate which falls within the analyst range of 3.2 BRL/$ to 5.8 BRL/$. A 10% appreciation of the Brazilian real compared to the valuation assumptions across the forecasted period would decrease the valuation by $0.3 billion.\n\n## Moranbah-Grosvenor\n\nMoranbah North and Grosvenor (Coal) are adjacent longwall metallurgical coal operations in Queensland, Australia, sharing infrastructure and processing facilities. The two operations are assessed for impairment as a single CGU. The recoverable amount, based on a discounted cash flow model, supports the carrying value of $2.7 billion.\n\nThe valuation is sensitive to changes in input assumptions, particularly in relation to future metallurgical coal prices and foreign exchange rates. The model uses forecast metallurgical coal prices that fall within the analyst range throughout the model. The long term price in the model from 2026 onwards falls within the top quartile of the analyst price range of $150/tonne to $160/tonne (hard coking coal 2020 real basis). The model uses a forecast for the average Australian dollar to US dollar nominal exchange rate which falls within the analyst range of 0.67 AUD/$ to 0.94 AUD/$.\n\nIn addition to the base case valuation, alternative scenarios have been considered to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions, principally price and foreign exchange forecasts, including the potential impact of the transition towards a low carbon economy on the metallurgical coal price in the long term in the event that alternative steelmaking technologies prove viable at scale. If the model assumptions were reduced by $10/tonne from 2026 onwards with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, this would result in an impairment of $0.3 billion. A 10% appreciation of the Australian dollar compared to the valuation assumptions across the forecasted period would result in an impairment of $0.8 billion.\n\n## Cerrej\u00f3n\n\nThe Group has a 33% interest in Cerrej\u00f3n, an exporter of Colombian thermal coal, which is accounted for as an investment in an associate. The Group's investment was previously impaired by $0.3 billion in 2019. The valuation, based on discounted cash flows, is sensitive to changes in input assumptions, particularly in relation to future Colombian thermal coal prices. The forecast realised price is calculated using API4 FOB Richards Bay as reference, with adjustments to reflect the quality and location of the product.\n\nFollowing the approval of a new Life of Mine Plan, the recoverable amount of the investment was reassessed during the year. This valuation, based on a discounted cash flow model, supported the carrying value of $0.4 billion. In addition to the base case valuation, alternative scenarios were considered to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions. The most significant input to the valuation was the short to medium term price for thermal coal used to calculate the forecast realised price. The model used prices linked to thermal coal prices that fell within the analyst range throughout the model. The thermal coal price in the model fell within the top quartile of the analyst range from 2026 onwards, of $80/tonne to $82/tonne API4 FOB Richards Bay reference basis, 2020 real terms. If the model assumptions were changed by $5/tonne in each year with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, this would change the valuation by $0.2 billion.\n\n## South African thermal coal\n\nThe Group's South African thermal coal mines have been reviewed for impairment and impairment reversal on an individual basis as each mine represents a separate cash generating unit. Impairment triggers were identified for the Goedehoop, Khwezela, Butsanani and Isibonelo cash generating units. Impairments totalling $149 million ($119 million after tax and non-controlling interests) were recorded against these cash generating units to bring the carrying value of the assets into line with the recoverable amount. These impairments have been allocated principally against property, plant and equipment. The valuation of each of these assets is not considered to be a significant accounting matter as no reasonably possible change in assumptions would materially change the carrying value.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes , the Group reassesses the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. This assessment is performed for each jurisdiction based upon the application of tax law, the likelihood of taxable profits arising in future periods and the likelihood that tax assets will be utilised. In determining the likelihood of future taxable profits, the Group considers the financial forecasts and the associated risks from operational and financial uncertainties. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is therefore subject to the same significant judgements and assumptions as are relevant to the Group's impairment testing; notably commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.\n\nA net deferred tax asset of $380 million (2019: $664 million) is recognised in Brazil in relation to the Minas-Rio iron ore mine. This net deferred tax asset represents the full recognition. Current forecasts expect carried forward losses to be fully utilised over the next 5 to 10 years. The current period increase in deferred tax asset recognition is offset by a greater increase in deferred tax liabilities arising on functional currency movements . The recovery of the deferred tax assets has been assessed based on current profit projections and the utilisation of all temporary differences has been modelled over the remaining life of the mine. Appropriate assessment is given to the weighting of long-term forecasts which by their nature are less reliable than short-term profit projections. Where deferred tax assets are only partially recognised, the judgemental nature of the weighting of profit forecasts could affect the amount of deferred tax recognised. As Minas-Rio is fully recognising all deferred tax attributes in 2020 there is no associated sensitivity to this weighting.\n\nA 10% movement of the year end Brazilian real foreign currency rate compared to the assumption used in the model would move the net recognised deferred tax asset by $0.1 billion.",

These items, along with related tax and noncontrolling interests, are excluded from underlying earnings, which is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM). For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including definitions, please refer to page 246.\n\n- - Operating special items are those that relate to the operating performance of the Group and principally include impairment charges and reversals and restructuring costs.\n- - Non-operating special items are those that relate to changes in the Group's asset portfolio. This category principally includes profits and losses on disposals of businesses and investments or closure of operations, adjustments relating to business combinations, and adjustments relating to former operations of the Group, such as changes in the measurement of deferred consideration receivable or provisions recognised on disposal or closure of operations in prior periods. This category also includes charges relating to Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transactions.\n- - Financing special items are those that relate to financing activities and include realised gains and losses on early repayment of borrowings, and the unwinding of the discount on material provisions previously recognised as special items.\n- - Tax special items are those that relate to tax charges or credits where the associated cash outflow or inflow is anticipated to be significant due to its size and nature, principally including resolution of tax enquiries.\n\n## Remeasurements\n\nRemeasurements are items that are excluded from underlying earnings in order to reverse timing differences in the recognition of gains and losses in the income statement in relation to transactions that, while economically linked, are subject to different accounting measurement or recognition criteria. Remeasurements include mark-to-market movements on derivatives that are economic hedges of transactions not yet recorded in the financial statements, in order to ensure that the overall economic impact of such transactions is reflected within the Group's underlying earnings in the period in which they occur. When the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are recorded in underlying earnings within either revenue, operating costs or net finance costs as appropriate. If the underlying transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in remeasurements on settlement of the derivative.\n\n- - Operating remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on derivatives relating to revenue, operating costs or capital expenditure transactions. They also include the reversal through depreciation and amortisation of a fair value gain or loss, arising on revaluation of a previously held equity interest in a business combination.\n- - Financing remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities that represent economic hedges, including accounting hedges, related to financing arrangements.\n- - Tax remeasurements include foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local currency financial information and hence tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations.\n\n## Operating special items\n\n## Impairments and impairment reversals\n\nNet impairments and impairment reversals of $808 million ($770 million after tax and non-controlling interests) for the year ended 31 December 2020 principally comprise the impairment charges to operations at Barro Alto (Nickel and Manganese) of $589 million ($589 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) and South African thermal coal (Coal) of $149 million ($119 million after tax and non-controlling interests).\n\nFurther information on significant accounting matters relating to impairments and impairment reversals is provided in note 7.\n\n## 2019\n\nNet impairments and impairment reversals of $131 million after tax and noncontrolling interests for the year ended 31 December 2019 principally comprised the impairment reversals of Minas-Rio (Iron Ore) of $1,033 million and impairment charges of South African thermal coal (Coal) of $585 million, Cerrej\u00f3n (Coal) of $334 million, and Corporate assets (Corporate and other) of $30 million.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nRestructuring costs of $50 million ($40 million after tax and non-controlling interests) for the year ended 31 December 2020 principally consist of restructuring programmes of $30 million ($22 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in De Beers.\n\n## 2019\n\nThere were no restructuring costs recorded in the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

Average attributable capital employed has increased to $30.5 billion (2019: $28.4 billion), primarily due to increased growth capital expenditure, largely at Quellaveco (Copper), working capital build and the acquisition of Sirius Minerals Plc.\n\n|                       | Attributable ROCE %   | Attributable ROCE %   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                       | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| De Beers              | -                     | 2                     |\n| Copper                | 19                    | 16                    |\n| Platinum Group Metals | 48                    | 38                    |\n| Iron Ore              | 41                    | 31                    |\n| Coal                  | (16)                  | 26                    |\n| Nickel and Manganese  | 17                    | 20                    |\n| Crop Nutrients        | n/a                   | n/a                   |\n| Corporate and other   | n/a                   | n/a                   |\n|                       | 17                    | 19                    |\n\n## 9.

Of these, $517 million (2019: $517 million) have indefinite useful lives.\n\n## Further information\n\nGoodwill relates to the following cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs:\n\n| US$ million           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| De Beers              | 1,619  | 1,636  |\n| Copper Chile          | 124    | 124    |\n| Platinum Group Metals | 209    | 209    |\n| Other                 | 11     | 12     |\n|                       | 1,963  | 1,981  |\n\n## Accounting judgement\n\nGoodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by assessing the recoverable amount of the related CGU or group of CGUs. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on fair value less costs of disposal using discounted cash flow projections. Other than in relation to De Beers as set out in note 7, management believes that any reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts. The key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out in note 7.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSee note 39D for the Group's accounting policies on intangible assets.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each of the cash generating units (CGUs) or group of CGUs has been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal basis. The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 7.\n\n## Deferred stripping\n\nIn certain mining operations, rock or soil overlying a mineral deposit, known as overburden, and other waste materials must be removed to access the orebody. The process of removing overburden and other mine waste materials is referred to as stripping.\n\nThe Group defers stripping costs onto the balance sheet where they are considered to improve access to ore in future periods. Where the amount to be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined based on the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for the identified component of the orebody. This determination is dependent on an individual mine's design and Life of Mine Plan and therefore changes to the design or Life of Mine Plan will result in changes to these estimates. Identification of the components of a mine's orebody is made by reference to the Life of Mine Plan. The assessment depends on a range of factors including each mine's specific operational features and materiality.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSee note 39D for the Group's accounting policies on property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 12.

Financial assets held at fair value through profit and loss comprise financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be classified under either of the other two categories.\n\n|                                | 2020 2019                            | 2020 2019                               | 2020 2019                                          | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019                            | 2020 2019                               | 2020 2019                                           | 2020 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| US$ million                    | Financial  assets at  amortised cost | At fair value  through  profit and loss | At fair value through other  comprehensive  income | Total       | Financial  assets at  amortised cost | At fair value  through  profit and loss | At fair value  through other  comprehensive  income | Total       |\n| At 1 January                   | 373                                  | 3                                       | 58                                                 | 434         | 358                                  | -                                       | 38                                                  | 396         |\n| Additions                      | -                                    | -                                       | 3                                                  | 3           | -                                    | -                                       | 4                                                   | 4           |\n| Interest receivable            | 7                                    | -                                       | -                                                  | 7           | 19                                   | -                                       | -                                                   | 19          |\n| Net loans (repaid)/advanced    | (67)                                 | -                                       | -                                                  | (67)        | 33                                   | 17                                      | -                                                   | 50          |\n| Disposals                      | -                                    | -                                       | (9)                                                | (9)         | -                                    | -                                       | -                                                   | -           |\n| Impairments                    | (20)                                 | -                                       | -                                                  | (20)        | (5)                                  | -                                       | -                                                   | (5)         |\n| Fair value and other movements | (23)                                 | 28                                      | 77                                                 | 82          | -                                    | (14)                                    | 21                                                  | 7           |\n| Currency movements             | (63)                                 | 2                                       | 2                                                  | (59)        | (32)                                 | -                                       | (5)                                                 | (37)        |\n| At 31 December                 | 207                                  | 33                                      | 131                                                | 371         | 373                                  | 3                                       | 58                                                  | 434         |\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSee note 39D for the Group's accounting policies on financial asset investments.\n\n## 15.

A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs, based on management's best estimate of the legal and constructive obligations incurred. Changes in legislation could result in changes in provisions recognised. It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 10 years.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nProvision is made for the present value of costs relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site restoration work. It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.\n\nThe pre-tax, real discount rates that have been used in calculating the environmental restoration and decommissioning liabilities as at 31 December 2020, in the principal currencies in which these liabilities are denominated and with matching maturities to the timelines are as follows: US dollar: 0.0%-0.1% (2019: 1.5%); South African rand: 4.3%-4.9% (2019: 4.0%); Australian dollar: 0.0%-0.3% (2019: 2.0%); Chilean peso: 0.0%-1.4% (2019: 2.5%); and Brazilian real: 3.4%-4.4% (2019: 6.0%).\n\nDecommissioning amounts capitalised and Environmental Restoration charged to the income statement in the year are principally driven by changes in the discount rates and other changes in underlying estimates.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nProvision is made for statutory or contractual employee entitlements where there is significant uncertainty over the timing or amount of settlement. It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred when employees choose to take their benefits.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nProvision is made for the present value of certain long term contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the Group's obligations is expected to exceed the benefits to be received. It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a period of up to six years.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

Provisions for liabilities and charges continued\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions primarily relate to social commitments in Quellaveco and other claims and liabilities.\n\n## Environmental rehabilitation trusts\n\nThe Group makes contributions to controlled funds that were established to meet the cost of some of its restoration and environmental rehabilitation liabilities in South Africa. The funds comprise the following investments, which with the exception of some cash balances, are held in unit trusts:\n\n| US$ million               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity                    |     92 |     97 |\n| Bonds                     |    152 |    147 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents |     57 |     57 |\n|                           |    301 |    301 |\n\nThese assets are primarily denominated in South African rand. Where not held in a unit trust, cash and cash equivalents are held in short term fixed deposits or earn interest at floating inter-bank rates. Bonds held in unit trusts earn interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 8.0% (2019: 8.0%) for an average period of five years (2019: six years). Amounts held in unit trusts are recorded at fair value through profit and loss. Investments in unit trusts with a fair value of $198 million are at level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and set out in note 22. The remaining amounts of $86 million held in unit trusts are at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThese funds are not available for the general purposes of the Group. All income from these assets is reinvested to meet specific environmental obligations. These obligations are included in provisions stated above.\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\n## Environmental restoration and decommissioning provisions\n\nThe recognition and measurement of environmental restoration and decommissioning provisions requires judgement and is based on assumptions and estimates, including the required closure and rehabilitation costs, the timing of future cash flows, and the discount rates applied. The Group considers that no reasonably possible change to a single assumption would have a material impact on the provisions, however a combination of changes in multiple assumptions may.\n\nThe Group considers the impact of climate change on environmental restoration and decommissioning provisions, specifically the timing of future cash flows, and has concluded that it does not currently represent a key source of estimation uncertainty. Changes to legislation, including in relation to climate change, are factored into the provisions when the legislation becomes enacted.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSee note 39D for the Group's accounting policy on environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations.\n\n## 16. Deferred tax\n\n## Overview\n\nThe movement in net deferred tax liabilities during the year is as follows:\n\n| US$ million                            | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| At 1 January                           | (2,865) | (2,766) |\n| Acquired through business combinations | (8)     | -       |\n| Charged to the income statement        | (314)   | (52)    |\n| Charged to equity                      | (26)    | (7)     |\n| Currency movements                     | 48      | (40)    |\n| At 31 December                         | (3,165) | (2,865) |",

This relates primarily to tax losses, deductible goodwill and fixed asset temporary differences, and is partially offset by functional currency taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the business has forecast taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered.\n\nThe Group has the following temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised:\n\n|                         | 2020                  | 2020                  | 2020                          | 2020   | 2019                  | 2019                  | 2019                          | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------|\n| US$ million             | Tax losses  - revenue | Tax losses  - capital | Other  temporary  differences | Total  | Tax losses  - revenue | Tax losses  - capital | Other  temporary  differences | Total  |\n| Expiry date             |                       |                       |                               |        |                       |                       |                               |        |\n| Less than five years    | 2                     | -                     | 113                           | 115    | 21                    | -                     | -                             | 21     |\n| Greater than five years | 103                   | -                     | -                             | 103    | 17                    | -                     | 1,680                         | 1,697  |\n| No expiry date          | 5,423                 | 2,124                 | 4,145                         | 11,692 | 5,486                 | 2,157                 | 1,390                         | 9,033  |\n|                         | 5,528                 | 2,124                 | 4,258                         | 11,910 | 5,524                 | 2,157                 | 3,070                         | 10,751 |\n\nNo deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures and joint operations where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group uses the Board approved forecasts as the basis for the profits expected to arise in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures and joint operations is represented by the contribution of those investments to the Group's retained earnings and amounted to $18,605 million (2019 restated: $17,981 million).\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax asset\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes , the Group reassesses the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

The write-down of inventories to net realisable value (net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases) amounted to $360 million (2019: $140 million).\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\nAccounting for inventory involves the use of judgements and estimates, particularly related to the measurement and valuation of work in progress inventory within the production process. Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, are calculated by engineers using available industry, engineering and scientific data. Estimates used are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSee note 39E for the Group's accounting policy on inventories and note 39A for the change in inventories accounting policy during the year and the impact on the prior year.",

Trade and other receivables\n\n## Overview\n\nTrade receivables are amounts due from the Group's customers for commodities and services the Group has provided. Many of the Group's sales are provisionally priced, which means that the price is finalised at a date after the sale takes place. When there is uncertainty about the final amount that will be received, the receivable is marked to market based on the forward price.\n\nTrade and other receivables also includes amounts receivable for VAT and other indirect taxes, prepaid expenses and amounts receivable from others for non-sale transactions. Contract assets represent amounts receivable for ongoing construction projects and amounts receivable from external parties for nonsale transactions from the Group's operations.\n\n|                   | 2020                | 2020               | 2020   | 2019                | 2019               | 2019   |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------|---------------------|--------------------|--------|\n| US$ million       | Due within one year | Due after one year | Total  | Due within one year | Due after one year | Total  |\n| Trade receivables | 1,984               | 42                 | 2,026  | 1,212               | 19                 | 1,231  |\n| Tax receivables   | 609                 | 351                | 960    | 554                 | 342                | 896    |\n| Accrued income    | 133                 | -                  | 133    | 84                  | -                  | 84     |\n| Prepayments       | 438                 | 70                 | 508    | 151                 | 44                 | 195    |\n| Contract assets   | 126                 | -                  | 126    | 46                  | -                  | 46     |\n| Other receivables | 596                 | 524                | 1,120  | 339                 | 271                | 610    |\n|                   | 3,886               | 987                | 4,873  | 2,386               | 676                | 3,062  |\n\n## Further information\n\nThe Group applies the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, as permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments . The expected credit losses on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default experience and financial metrics, adjusted as appropriate for current observable data.\n\nAs part of its approach to working capital management the Group uses debtor discounting arrangements. These arrangements are on a non-recourse basis and hence the related receivables are derecognised from the Group balance sheet.\n\nOf the year end trade receivables balance, $54 million (2019: $35 million) were past due, stated after an associated impairment provision of $18 million (2019: $22 million). Given the use of payment security instruments (including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions), and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts are considered recoverable. The historical level of customer default is minimal and there is no current observable data to indicate a material future default. As a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.\n\nTrade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short term in nature and are measured at their nominal value (with the exception of receivables relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 39C), net of appropriate provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.\n\n## 19. Trade and other payables\n\n## Overview\n\nTrade and other payables include amounts owed to suppliers, tax authorities and other parties that are typically due to be settled within 12 months. The total also includes contract liabilities, which represents monies received from customers but for which we have not yet delivered the associated service. These amounts are recognised as revenue when the service is provided. All revenue relating to performance obligations which were incomplete as at 31 December 2019 was recognised during the year. Other payables includes deferred consideration in respect of business combinations and dividends payable to non-controlling interests.\n\n| US$ million                              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade payables                           | 2,974  | 2,543  |\n| Accruals                                 | 1,714  | 1,635  |\n| Contract liabilities and deferred income | 1,400  | 764    |\n| Tax and social security                  | 116    | 81     |\n| Other payables                           | 809    | 476    |\n|                                          | 7,013  | 5,499  |\n\n## Further information\n\nTrade payables are non-interest bearing and are measured at their nominal value (with the exception of payables relating to provisionally priced commodity purchases which are marked to market using the appropriate forward price) until settled. $321 million (2019: $126 million) of other payables are included within non-current liabilities.\n\nContract liabilities and deferred income represent $1,263 million (2019: $694 million) for payments received in advance for metal which is expected to be delivered within six months and $115 million (2019: $53 million) in respect of freight and performance obligations which are expected to be completed within 30 to 45 days.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

The Group therefore monitors the cash and debt associated with these operations separately. These restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the Group's ability to meet its ongoing obligations. On an owned basis cash and cash equivalents in South Africa is $5,658 million (2019: $5,001 million) and net cash is $4,407 million (2019: $4,282 million).\n\nAs part of the Group cash pooling arrangement, cash and cash equivalents that are legally owned by South African companies are managed outside of South Africa. Below is a breakdown of net debt managed in South Africa:\n\n| US$ million                     | 2020    | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents       | 367     | 389    |\n| Short term borrowings           | (173)   | (42)   |\n| Medium and long term borrowings | (1,079) | (678)  |\n| Net debt excluding derivatives  | (885)   | (331)  |\n| Derivatives hedging net debt    | 1       | 1      |\n| Net debt including derivatives  | (884)   | (330)  |\n\nOn 26 February 2020, South Africa's Minister of Finance announced in his Budget Speech that the country would shift from a policy of exchange controls to a risk-based capital flow management system in line with international best practice and in order to facilitate cross-border financial transactions, in support of trade and investment. This change aligns South Africa with the foreign direct investment criteria implemented by other OECD nations and removes the previous restrictions on the Group's ability to permanently remit cash earned from operating activities in South Africa, aligning the Group with other global companies that operate in South Africa.\n\nSubsequently, on 24 February 2021, South Africa's Minister of Finance announced that from 1 March 2021, specific rules for companies with a primary listing offshore will be automatically aligned to current foreign direct investment rules. Separate disclosure of the Group's South African cash and debt balances will therefore no longer be relevant.\n\nDuring 2021, the South African National Treasury and the Reserve Bank will continue to develop the legislative framework for the new capital flow management system announced in the 2020 Budget. This framework is expected to be substantively completed in 2021 .\n\n## Other\n\nThe debit valuation adjustments of nil (2019: $1 million) reduce the valuation of derivative liabilities hedging net debt reflecting the impact of the Group's own credit risk. These adjustments are excluded from the Group's definition of net debt.\n\nCash and cash equivalents includes $357 million (2019: $338 million) which is restricted. This primarily relates to cash which is required to cover initial margin on trading exchanges and cash which is held in joint operations where the timing of dividends is jointly controlled by the joint operators.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSee note 39F for the Group's accounting policy on cash and debt.",

Borrowings\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group borrows mostly in the capital markets through bonds issued in the US markets, under the Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme and the South African Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) programme. The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Group's borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.\n\nIn April 2020, the Group issued $750 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2025 and $750 million 5.625% Senior Notes due 2030 as part of the Group's routine financing.

Financial instruments and derivatives\n\n## Financial instruments overview\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value. For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available (for example forward exchange rate, interest rate or commodity price curve), unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.\n\nWhere discounted cash flow models based on management's assumptions are used, the resulting fair value measurements are considered to be at level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement , as they depend to a significant extent on unobservable valuation inputs.\n\nAll derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.\n\n|                                    | 2020                                  | 2020                                 | 2020                                                | 2020                    | 2020                                      | 2020     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| US$ million                        | At fair value through profit and loss | Financial  assets at  amortised cost | At fair value  through other  comprehensive  income | Designated  into hedges | Financial  liabilities at  amortised cost | Total    |\n| Financial assets                   |                                       |                                      |                                                     |                         |                                           |          |\n| Trade and other receivables        | 2,173                                 | 1,121                                | -

The fair value of these borrowings is $9,340 million (2019: $9,598 million), which is measured using quoted indicative broker prices and consequently categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the remaining borrowings at amortised cost includes bonds which are not designated into hedge relationships, bank borrowings and lease liabilities. The carrying value of these bonds is $2,150 million (2019: $29 million) and the fair value is $2,606 million (2019: $29 million). The carrying value of the remaining borrowings at amortised cost are considered to approximate the fair value.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group offsets financial assets and liabilities and presents them on a net basis in the Consolidated balance sheet only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and the Group intends to either settle the recognised amounts on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, certain over-the-counter derivatives entered into by the Group and recognised at fair value through profit and loss are both subject to enforceable ISDA master netting arrangements and intended to be settled on a net basis. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation , the positions of these derivatives have been offset; those in a liability position totalling $16 million (2019: $28 million liability position) were offset against those in an asset position totalling $665 million (2019: $62 million asset position). The net asset position of $649 million (2019: $34 million net asset position) is presented within derivative assets (2019: within derivative assets) in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIf certain credit events (such as default) were to occur additional derivative instruments would be settled on a net basis under ISDA agreements. Interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps in a liability position totalling $210 million (2019: $334 million asset position) would be offset against those in an asset position totalling $645 million (2019: $600 million liability position). These instruments are presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated balance sheet as the Group does not have a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts in the absence of a credit event occurring.",

Financial instruments and derivatives continued\n\n## Derivatives overview\n\nThe Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures; however, it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. Such derivatives are classified as 'Held for trading' and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.\n\nThe use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nIn accordance with the Group's policy, interest rate swaps are taken out to swap the Group's fixed rate borrowings to floating rate. These have been designated as fair value hedges. The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates. At 31 December 2020, this adjustment was to increase the carrying value of borrowings by $458 million (2019: $264 million increase). Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements. Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a loss on fair value hedged items of $194 million (2019: $234 million loss), offset by a gain on fair value hedging instruments of $188 million (2019: $236 million gain).\n\n## Held for trading\n\nThe Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges. This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IFRS 9 Financial Instruments hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt. A fair value gain of $462 million in respect of these cross currency swaps has been recognised in the Consolidated income statement (2019: loss of $56 million) and is presented within financing remeasurements net of foreign exchange losses on the related borrowings of $435 million (2019: $43 million gain). Fair value changes on held for trading derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements or within underlying earnings in accordance with the policy set out in note 8.\n\n## Further information on derivatives\n\n## Fair value of derivative positions\n\nThe fair value of the Group's open derivative positions at 31 December (excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet), recorded within 'Derivative financial assets' and 'Derivative financial liabilities', is as follows:\n\n|                                                      | Current   | Current   | Current   | Current   | Non-current   | Non-current   | Non-current   | Non-current   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                      | 2020      | 2020      | 2019      | 2019      | 2020          | 2020          | 2019          | 2019          |\n| US$ million                                          | Asset     | Liability | Asset     | Liability | Asset         | Liability     | Asset         | Liability     |\n| Derivatives hedging net debt                         |           |           |           |           |               |               |               |               |\n| Fair value hedge                                     |           |           |           |           |               |               |               |               |\n| Interest rate swaps                                  | 9         | -         | 7         | -         | 558           | (26)          | 347           | -             |\n| Held for trading                                     |           |           |           |           |               |               |               |               |\n| Forward foreign currency contracts                   | -         | (20)      | 8         | (16)      | -             | -             | -             | -             |\n| Cross currency swaps                                 | -         | (19)      | -         | (66)      | 79            | (166)         | -             | (519)         |\n| Debit valuation adjustment to derivative liabilities | -         | -         | -         | -         | -             | -             | -             | 1             |\n|                                                      | 9         | (39)      | 15        | (82)      | 637           | (192)         | 347           | (518)         |\n| Other derivatives                                    | 96        | (175)     | 71        | (73)      | -             | -             | -             | (4)           |\n| Total derivatives                                    | 105       | (214)     | 86        | (155)     | 637           | (192)         | 347           | (522)         |\n\nOther derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure, forward commodity contracts and other commodity contracts that are accounted for as 'Held for trading'. These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group. The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at 31 December, at market prices and rates available at the time.\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nCertain of the Group's financial instruments, principally derivatives, are required to be measured on the balance sheet at fair value. Where a quoted market price for an identical instrument is not available, a valuation model is used to estimate the fair value based on the net present value of the expected cash flows under the contract. Valuation assumptions are usually based on observable market data (for example forward foreign exchange rate, interest rate or commodity price curves) where available.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSee notes 39D and 39F for the Group's accounting policies on financial asset investments, impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.",

Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting structures. The risk management processes of the Group's independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Group's own policy.\n\nThe types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December is as follows:\n\n- - liquidity risk\n- - credit risk\n- - commodity price risk\n- - foreign exchange risk\n- - interest rate risk.\n\n## A. Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities (including refinancing, where necessary) in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist. In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.\n\nCertain borrowing facilities within the Group are the subject of financial covenants that vary from facility to facility, but which would be considered normal for such facilities, such as the ratio of net debt to tangible net worth. The respective borrowers remain in compliance with these financial covenants at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe expected undiscounted cash flows of the Group's net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date, are as follows:\n\n|                                                               | 2020                                       | 2020                                       | 2020                                             | 2020                                             | 2020                                            | 2020                     | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| US$ million                                                   | Amount due for  repayment  within one year | Greater than one year, less than two years | Greater than  two years, less  than three  years | Greater than  three years, less  than four years | Greater than  four years, less  than five years | Greater than  five years | Total    |\n| Net debt financial liabilities                                |                                            |                                            |                                                  |                                                  |                                                 |                          |          |\n| Borrowings                                                    | (1,028)                                    | (1,078)                                    | (1,307)                                          | (777)                                            | (2,166)                                         | (6,468)                  | (12,824) |\n| Expected future interest payments                             | (442)                                      | (420)                                      | (376)                                            | (326)                                            | (265)                                           | (1,192)                  | (3,021)  |\n| Derivatives hedging net debt -

Financial risk management continued\n\nThe Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December:\n\n| US$ million                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expiry date                                    |        |        |\n| Within one year                                | 2,228  | 228    |\n| Greater than one year, less than two years     | 615    | 394    |\n| Greater than two years, less than three years  | 1,453  | 1,121  |\n| Greater than three years, less than four years | 916    | 1,538  |\n| Greater than four years, less than five years  | 4,718  | 5,385  |\n| Greater than five years                        | 47     | -      |\n|                                                | 9,977  | 8,666  |\n\nOn 10 February 2020, the Group extended the maturity of $4.3 billion of its revolving credit facility by one year to March 2025 and $0.2 billion of its revolving credit facility by two years to March 2025. The Group also extended the maturity of a $0.2 billion bilateral facility by one year to March 2025.\n\nIn April 2020, the Group signed a new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with an initial maturity date of April 2021. The Group has, at its sole discretion, two options to extend the facility for a further six months to October 2021 and April 2022.\n\nUndrawn committed borrowing facilities expiring within one year include undrawn South African rand facilities equivalent to $0.1 billion (2019: $0.2 billion) in respect of facilities with a 364 day maturity which roll automatically on a daily basis, unless notice is served.\n\n## B. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay its obligation.\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows:\n\n| US$ million                        | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents          | 7,521  | 6,345  |\n| Trade and other receivables        | 3,294  | 1,932  |\n| Financial asset investments        | 240    | 373    |\n| Derivative financial assets        | 742    | 433    |\n| Environmental rehabilitation trust | 209    | 204    |\n|                                    | 12,006 | 9,287  |\n\nThe Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions approved by the Board. Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity (in case of relationship banks) and fund size (in case of asset managers).\n\nGiven the diverse nature of the Group's operations (both in relation to commodity markets and geographically), and the use of payment security instruments (including letters of credit from financial institutions), it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.\n\nThe classification of trade and other receivables excludes prepayments and tax receivables, the classification of financial asset investments excludes equity investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income and the classification of environmental rehabilitation trust excludes equity investments.\n\n## C. Commodity price risk\n\nThe Group's earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.\n\nThe Group's policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons. In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge the price risk.\n\nCertain of the Group's sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements. The exposure of the Group's financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows:\n\n|                                                          | 2020 2019 (1)                | 2020 2019 (1)          | 2020 2019 (1)                   | 2020 2019 (1)   | 2020 2019 (1)                | 2020 2019 (1)          | 2020 2019 (1)                   | 2020 2019 (1)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                          | Commodity price linked       | Commodity price linked |                                 |                 | Commodity price linked       | Commodity price linked |                                 |                 |\n| US$ million                                              | Subject to  price  movements | Fixed price            | Not linked to  commodity  price | Total           | Subject to  price  movements | Fixed price            | Not linked to  commodity  price | Total           |\n| Total net financial instruments  (excluding derivatives) | 1,110                        | 478                    | (9,750)                         | (8,162)         | 622                          | 290                    | (7,589)                         | (6,677)         |\n| Derivatives                                              | (80)                         | (5)                    | 421                             | 336             | (4)                          | -                      | (240)                           | (244)           |\n|                                                          | 1,030                        | 473                    | (9,329)                         | (7,826)         | 618                          | 290                    | (7,829)                         | (6,921)         |\n\nCommodity price linked financial instruments subject to price movements include provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.\n\nCommodity price linked financial instruments at fixed price include receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## D. Foreign exchange risk\n\nAs a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.\n\nThe South African rand, Chilean pesos, Brazilian real and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs. A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Group's earnings. The Group's policy is generally not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, although exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.\n\nIn addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities. The Group's policy is to evaluate whether or not to hedge its non-US dollar capital expenditure on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the estimated foreign exchange exposure, liquidity of foreign exchange markets and the cost of executing a hedging strategy.\n\nNet other financial liabilities (excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt) are $2,251 million. This includes net assets of $458 million denominated in US dollars, and net liabilities of $222 million denominated in Brazilian real, $296 million denominated in Australian dollars, $399 million denominated in Chilean pesos and $1,436 million denominated in South African rand.\n\n## E. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact the value of short term investments and financing activities. The Group is principally exposed to US and South African interest rates.\n\nVarious inter-bank offer rates (IBOR) are expected to be replaced by alternative risk-free rates by the end of 2021 as part of the IBOR reform. The Group is managing the transition to alternative risk-free rates with respect to its hedging arrangements and any future transactions in the financial market.\n\nThe Group's policy is to borrow funds at fixed rates of interest. The Group uses interest rate contracts to convert the majority of borrowings to floating rates of interest and manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt.\n\nIn respect of financial assets, the Group's policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments (less than one year) in order to maintain liquidity.\n\nAnalysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within the table below. Net other financial liabilities (excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt) of $2,251 million (2019: $2,295 million) are primarily non-interest bearing.\n\nThe table below reflects the exposure of the Group's net debt to currency and interest rate risk.\n\n|                                | 2020                       | 2020                      | 2020                   | 2020                          | 2020                             | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n| US$ million                    | Cash and cash  equivalents | Floating rate  borrowings | Fixed rate  borrowings | Derivatives  hedging net debt | Impact of  currency  derivatives | Total   |\n| US dollar                      | 6,801                      | (1,102)                   | (7,732)                | 414                           | (3,722)                          | (5,341) |\n| Euro                           | 16                         | -

Retirement benefits\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans with the most significant plans being in South Africa and the United Kingdom. It also operates post employment medical plans, the majority of which are unfunded, principally in South Africa. The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans (net of amounts capitalised) was $131 million (2019: $136 million) and for defined contribution medical plans (net of amounts capitalised) was $63 million (2019: $69 million).\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans\n\n## Characteristics of plans\n\nThe majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded. The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction. The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme. The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation to termination indemnity plans in Chile.\n\n## South Africa\n\nThe pension plans in South Africa are in surplus. All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual. As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made. The Group's provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom. These plans are closed to new members and to the future accrual of benefits. The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.\n\n## Other\n\nOther pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.\n\n## Contributions\n\nEmployer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year. Employer contributions made to funded pension plans in the year ended 31 December 2020 were $42 million (2019: $41 million). In addition, $21 million (2019: $21 million) of benefits were paid to unfunded pension plans and $23 million (2019: $25 million) of benefits were paid in relation to post employment medical plans. The Group expects to contribute $22 million to its pension plans and $27 million to its post employment medical plans in 2021.\n\n## Income statement\n\nThe amounts recognised in the Consolidated income statement are as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2020          | 2020                            | 2020   | 2019          | 2019                          | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|--------|\n| US$ million                                       | Pension plans | Post  employment  medical plans | Total  | Pension plans | Post employment medical plans | Total  |\n| Charged to operating costs                        | 17            | 2                               | 19     | 12            | 3                             | 15     |\n| Net (credit)/charge to net finance costs          | (7)           | 32                              | 25     | (16)          | 35                            | 19     |\n| Total net charge/(credit) to the income statement | 10            | 34                              | 44     | (4)           | 38                            | 34     |\n\nNet (credit)/charge to net finance costs includes interest expense on surplus restriction of $10 million (2019: $11 million).",

Therefore, defined benefit pension plans in surplus are included in Pension asset surplus and other non-current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Further information\n\n## Movement analysis\n\nThe changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:\n\n|                                                        | 2020           | 2020                            | 2020   | 2019           | 2019                            | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|--------|----------------|---------------------------------|--------|\n| US$ million                                            | Pension  plans | Post  employment  medical plans | Total  | Pension  plans | Post  employment  medical plans | Total  |\n| At 1 January                                           | 5,258          | 12                              | 5,270  | 4,791          | 12                              | 4,803  |\n| Interest income                                        | 145            | 1                               | 146    | 188            | 1                               | 189    |\n| Return on plan assets, excluding interest income       | 470            | -                               | 470    | 334            | -                               | 334    |\n| Contributions paid by employer to funded pension plans | 42             | -                               | 42     | 41             | -                               | 41     |\n| Benefits paid                                          | (241)          | (1)                             | (242)  | (236)          | (1)                             | (237)  |\n| Effects of curtailments/settlements                    | -              | -                               | -      | (2)            | -                               | (2)    |\n| Other                                                  | 11             | -                               | 11     | 17             | -                               | 17     |\n| Currency movements                                     | 151            | -                               | 151    | 125            | -                               | 125    |\n| As at 31 December                                      | 5,836          | 12                              | 5,848  | 5,258          | 12                              | 5,270  |\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

The fair value of the assets of the funded plans was sufficient to cover 115% (2019: 115%) of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.

Retirement benefits continued\n\nThe weighted average duration of the South African plans is 9 years (2019: 9 years), United Kingdom plans is 18 years (2019: 18 years) and plans in other regions is 14 years (2019: 14 years). This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.\n\nMortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.

The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2020. Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.

All of these Company schemes, as well as any non-cyclical awards, are equity settled either by award of ordinary shares (BSP, LTIP, SIP and Non-cyclical) or award of options to acquire ordinary shares (SAYE). The awards are conditional on employment. LTIP awards granted prior to 2017 vest in accordance with the achievement of performance conditions based on a Group ROCE target and relative TSR targets. LTIPs granted since 2017 vest in accordance with the achievement of relative TSR targets and a balanced scorecard of measures including a Group ROCE target, a Sustaining attributable free cash flow target and environmental, social and governance targets.\n\nThe total share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares for the year is split as follows:\n\n| US$ million                                                      |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| BSP                                                              |     82 |     80 |\n| LTIP                                                             |     59 |     58 |\n| Other schemes                                                    |      5 |      3 |\n| Share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares |    146 |    141 |\n\nIn addition there are equity settled share-based payment charges of $10 million (2019: $6 million) relating to Kumba Iron Ore Limited shares and $11 million (2019: $10 million) relating to Anglo American Platinum Limited shares.

Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes that a material liability arising from the indemnities provided is remote.\n\nThe Group is required to provide guarantees in several jurisdictions in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations. The Group has provided for the estimated cost of these activities.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\n## Metallurgical Coal\n\nIn 2014, the Metallurgical Coal business was granted an arbitration award of $107 million against MMTC Limited in respect of a contractual dispute. The award has since been challenged in the Indian courts, during which time interest has continued to accrue. On 17 December 2020 the Indian Supreme Court found in favour of the Metallurgical Coal business. Following the hearing of a Review Petition, the Indian Supreme Court has determined that it will consider the question of interest payable on the award. The precise value and timing of receipt of such finding remains uncertain and hence no receivable has been recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\n## Anglo American South Africa Proprietary Limited (AASA)\n\nIn October 2020, an application was filed in the Gauteng Local Division (Johannesburg) of the High Court in South Africa to seek the certification of two classes of claimants in a legal action against Anglo American South Africa Proprietary Limited (AASA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American plc.\n\nThe legal action relates to lead contamination in the vicinity of a former lead mine in Kabwe, Zambia, which is alleged to have resulted from the operation of the mine, specifically between 1925 and 1974. AASA held a shareholding in the company that operated the mine during this period while other entities within the Anglo American Group at the time, and on occasion AASA, provided services to the mine during the period.\n\nThe mine was then nationalised and continued to operate for 20 years until its closure in 1994.\n\nThe claim fails to take into account the existence of a number of parties that had roles in the ownership and operation of the mine between the inception of the mine and 1994, and in the post-closure management of the mine site during the 27 years which have passed since its closure in 1994. The industrial processing of metals continues at and around the mine site to this day, as does significant informal mining activity.\n\nThe central allegation in the case is that lead emissions from operational and waste management activities undertaken at the mine in the period from 1925 to 1974 have made a material contribution to lead-related health impacts experienced by members of the local community, giving rise to alleged actionable claims against AASA.",

Contingent assets and liabilities continued\n\nThe application seeks to certify two classes of claimants, the first consisting of children from the Kabwe District and the second of women of child-bearing age from the Kabwe District. The claimants' lawyers allege that members of each class have suffered actionable injury as a result of exposure to lead. The application proposes that the first stage of the claim (where common issues will be decided) should proceed on an 'opt-out' basis (meaning anyone who meets the criteria for one of the classes is automatically included as a claimant unless they opt-out) while the second stage (where claimants will need to prove their individual claims) should proceed on an 'opt-in' basis (where individuals will need to actively 'opt-in' to become a claimant). There are 13 individuals representing the two classes and at the time of the application there were said to be 1,071 individuals who have signed up to bring individual claims as part of the second opt-in stage, in the event that the classes are certified and the claim proceeds beyond the first stage. The application contends that it is likely that a substantial number of additional potential claimants would seek to join the claim at the second stage. The claimants' lawyers have estimated that the two classes of claimants, as they are currently defined, could ultimately comprise approximately 142,000 individuals.\n\nThe claimants are seeking compensation for alleged personal injury and the costs of remediation, however no indication of the amount of damages being sought (either on a per claimant or total basis) has been provided in the application.\n\nAASA has noted its intention to oppose the class certification application, and will defend itself against the allegations made. It is currently investigating the detailed allegations and is due to file its response to the application in April 2021. The class certification hearing is likely to take place in the last quarter of 2021, alternatively in the first half of 2022.\n\nThis litigation is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is not currently possible to make a reasonable estimate of the outcome, quantum or timing of any potential future determination, and therefore no provision has been recognised.\n\n## De Beers\n\nGuarantees provided in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations involve judgements in terms of the outcome of future events. In one of the territories in which De Beers operates, conditions exist, or are proposed, with respect to backfilling pits on closure. A formal appeal has been lodged to remove the existing backfilling condition and no provision has been raised on the basis that it is not probable that this condition will be enforced. Should the appeal not be successful the estimated cost of backfilling is $274 million.\n\n## Accounting judgement\n\nWhere the existence of an asset is contingent on uncertain future events which are outside the Group's control, the asset is only recognised once it becomes virtually certain that the Group will receive future economic benefits.\n\nA provision is recognised where, based on the Group's legal views and, in some cases, independent advice, it is considered probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle a present obligation that can be measured reliably.",

Acquisitions and disposals continued\n\n## Royalty liability\n\nUnder financing arrangements prior to the Group's acquisition of the Woodsmith project, Hancock British Holdings Limited (Hancock) paid $250 million in return for future royalty payments amounting to 5% of gross revenues from the project on the first 13 million tonnes of product sold in each calendar year and a further 1% of gross revenues on sales in excess of 13 million tonnes.\n\nThe liability to make these future payments was recognised at its fair value when the Group acquired the Woodsmith project, as required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations , and is subsequently measured under amortised cost. An interest expense is recorded in each period which reflects the interest rate used to calculate the fair value of the liability at acquisition.\n\nFuture royalty payments will vary based on the actual revenues achieved by the Woodsmith project. This uncertainty over future cash flows represents an embedded derivative. This derivative is measured at fair value and presented within derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities as appropriate. The fair value of the embedded derivative is valued as the discounted present value of all differences in expected royalty payments between the expectation prevailing on the acquisition date and the latest period end date. At 31 December 2020 the embedded derivative had nil value as there was no difference between the latest expectation of royalty payments due and the expectation that prevailed at the acquisition date.\n\n## Other acquisitions\n\nOther cash paid in respect of acquisitions principally relates to the payment of deferred consideration in respect of the acquisition of control of the Mototolo mine (Platinum Group Metals) which took place in 2018.\n\n## 2019\n\nDuring 2019 the Group made a cash payment of $13 million in relation to the acquisition of control of the Mototolo mine (Platinum Group Metals).\n\n## Disposals\n\nIn the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group received net cash of $384 million on disposals which principally relates to the settlement of deferred consideration balances at Platinum Group Metals of $224 million and the sale of 12% of the Group's interest in the Grosvenor mine (Coal) for $154 million as part of the equalisation of ownership across its integrated Australian metallurgical coal operations at Moranbah North and Grosvenor, resulting in a loss of $22 million which was recognised as a non-operating special item. Refer to note 8.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019 the Group received net cash of $24 million on disposals which principally relate to Platinum Group Metals.",

operations or joint ventures according to the rights and obligations of the parties, as described in note 39I. Judgement is required in determining this classification through an evaluation of the facts and circumstances arising from each individual arrangement. When a joint arrangement has been structured through a separate vehicle, consideration has been given to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances. When the activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties and, the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this indicates that the parties to the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. Certain joint arrangements that are structured through separate vehicles including Collahuasi, Debswana and Namdeb Holdings are accounted for as joint operations. These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties sharing joint control, indicating that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the parties; this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations for the liabilities. It is primarily these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification as joint operations.",

Related undertakings of the Group\n\nThe Group consists of the parent Company, Anglo American plc, incorporated in the United Kingdom and its subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates. In accordance with Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 a full list of related undertakings, the country of incorporation and the effective percentage of equity owned as at 31 December 2020 is disclosed below. Unless otherwise disclosed all entities with an indirect equity holding of greater than 51% are considered subsidiary undertakings. See note 34 for the Group's principal subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates.\n\nAs disclosed in the Group's published tax strategy, the Group does not use tax haven jurisdictions to manage taxes. There remain a small number of undertakings in the Group which are registered in tax haven jurisdictions and have remained so for other business purposes. The Group is well advanced in our strategy to remove legacy undertakings from tax haven jurisdictions, and, where possible, these entities are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom regardless of where they are registered. Where the tax residency of a related undertaking is different from its country of incorporation, this is referenced in the notes to the list below.\n\nPercentage\n\n| Country of  incorporation (1)(2)   | Name of undertaking                                                                      | of equity owned (3)         | Share class                                                                          | Registered address                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| See page 222 for footnotes.        | See page 222 for footnotes.                                                              | See page 222 for footnotes. | See page 222 for footnotes.                                                          | See page 222 for footnotes.                                                                         |\n| Angola                             | Anglo American Discovery (Moxico) -  Prospeccao E Exploracao Mineira (SU), LDA           | 100%                        | Quota                                                                                | Edif\u00edcio Kilamba, 20. \u1d52  Andar, Avenida 4 de Fevereiro,  Marginal de Luanda, Luanda                 |\n| Angola                             | Anglo American Discovery (Cunene) -  Prospeccao E Exploracao Mineira (SU), LDA           | 100%                        | Quota                                                                                | Edif\u00edcio Kilamba, 20. \u1d52  Andar, Avenida 4 de Fevereiro,  Marginal de Luanda, Luanda                 |\n| Angola                             | De Beers Angola Holdings SARL                                                            | 85%                         | Quota                                                                                | Rua Rainha Ginga 87 9 \u1d52  andar, Luanda, Rep\u00fablica de  Angola, Caixa Postal 4031                     |\n| Anguilla                           | Carbones del Cerrejon Limited (4)                                                        | 33%                         | Ordinary                                                                             | Babrow's Commercial Complex, Box 1341, The Valley                                                   |\n| Argentina                          | Minera Anglo American Argentina S.A.U                                                    | 100%                        | Ordinary Nominative                                                                  | Olegario V.

Leases\n\n## Overview\n\nLease agreements give rise to the recognition of a right-of-use asset (see note 11) and a related liability for future lease payments (see note 21).\n\n## Further information\n\n## Amounts recognised in the balance sheet\n\nThe balance sheet shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\nRight-of use assets are detailed in note 11. Per requirements of IFRS 16 Leases , lease agreements give rise to the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a related liability for future lease payments. The costs of leases other than short term leases less than 12 months, variable leasing costs and leases of low value assets are allocated between the depreciation of right-of-use assets and a finance charge representing the unwind of the discount on lease liabilities.\n\nLeases relate principally to corporate offices, diamond jewellery retail outlets and shipping vessels. The Group leases land and buildings for its office space, for employee accommodation and retail stores for De Beers Jewellers. The leases for office space typically run for 5 to 25 years, employee accommodation up to 25 years and leases of retail stores 5 to 25 years. Some longer leases incorporate fixed increases in rentals or provide for annual uplifts based upon an index, typically a measure of inflation.\n\nLease liabilities balance and maturity analysis:\n\n| US$ million                                      |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Amount due for repayment within one year         |    198 |    245 |\n| Greater than one year, less than two years       |    103 |    113 |\n| Greater than two years, less than three years    |     58 |     75 |\n| Greater than three years, less than four years   |     42 |     34 |\n| Greater than four years, less than five years    |     35 |     35 |\n| Greater than five years                          |    240 |    203 |\n| Total due for repayment after more than one year |    478 |    460 |\n| Total                                            |    676 |    705 |\n\n## Amounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss\n\nThe statement of profit or loss shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\n| US$ million                                                                                               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Depreciation (see note 11)                                                                                |    177 |    255 |\n| Interest expense (included in finance costs, see note 4)                                                  |     32 |     32 |\n| Expense relating to short term leases less than 12 months, variable leasing costs and leases of low value |    123 |     36 |\n\n## Amounts recognised in the cash flow statement\n\nIn the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 31 December 2020, the total amount of cash paid in respect of leases recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet are split between repayments of principal of $195 million (2019: $272 million) and repayments of interest of $26 million (2019: $30 million), both presented within cash flows from financing activities. The repayment of both principal and interest forms part of both the Attributable free cash flow and Sustaining attributable free cash flow Alternative Performance Measures.\n\n## Further disclosures\n\nFurther disclosures required by IFRS 16 Leases are presented in notes 4, 11 and 21.\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\nAt the date of inception of a new contract or significant modification of an existing contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To identify lease arrangements, the Group assesses whether:\n\n- - The contract specifies the use of an identified asset or collection of assets.\n- - The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset(s).\n- - The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset(s).\n\nThe Group has paid particular attention to the judgement over whether the lessor has a substantive right to substitute the specified assets for alternatives.\n\n- - Many assets used by the Group are highly specialised in nature and are purpose-built or modified to meet the Group's specification. Judgement is required to assess whether the assets can be substituted and used for other purposes without significant additional modification.\n- - The remote location of some of the Group's operations presents practical difficulties to the substitution of assets. Judgement is required to determine whether assets in remote locations can be relocated to other locations within a reasonable timeframe and cost.\n- - At some locations, high levels of security restrict the movement of assets to alternative locations, limiting the ability to substitute assets.\n- - The Group's health and safety standards exceed statutory requirements in some jurisdictions. This places limitations on the ability to substitute certain assets, such as vehicles. Judgement is required to assess whether equivalent assets meeting the Group's requirements can be sourced within required operational timeframes.\n\nThe Group recognises a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nAccounting policies applied to lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets are set out respectively in notes 39F and 39D.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements",

        "page_content": "## Other items\n\n## 39. Accounting policies\n\n## A. Basis of preparation Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency rules of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom as applicable to periodic financial reporting. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities and certain financial instruments. A summary of the principal Group accounting policies is set out below.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.\n\nThe Group's results are presented in US dollars, the currency in which its business is primarily conducted.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for the changes set out below:\n\n## Adoption of new accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following new accounting pronouncements became effective in the current reporting period:\n\n- - Definition of Material - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8\n- - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards\n- - Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations\n\nThe adoption of these new accounting pronouncements has not had a significant impact on the accounting policies, methods of computation or presentation applied by the Group.\n\n## Physical settlement of contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item\n\nIn March 2019, the International Financial Reporting IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) issued an agenda decision on the Physical Settlement of Contracts to Buy or Sell a Non-Financial Item. The committee concluded that, for physical commodity trades within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , entities should not reverse previously recognised unrealised marked to market movements on settlement of the contract and that the settlement entries should instead include an entry for the settlement of the previously recognised derivative asset or liability. The Group has now amended its accounting policies and processes to comply with the agenda decision. The impact of adopting the agenda decision is not material for either the current or comparative period and hence comparative period results have not been restated.\n\n## Inventory accounting policy\n\nThe Group has amended its inventory accounting policy to present inventories not expected to be processed in the next 12 months within noncurrent assets. As a result, ore stockpiles that are included within work in progress totalling $643 million at 31 December 2019 have been reclassified to non-current assets.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the Group financial review on pages 62-65. Further details of our policy on financial risk management are set out in note 23 to the financial statements on pages 192-194. The Group's net debt (including related hedges) at 31 December 2020 was $5.6 billion (2019: $4.6 billion), representing a gearing level of 15% (2019: 13%). The Group's liquidity position (defined as cash and undrawn committed facilities) of $17.5 billion at 31 December 2020 remains strong. Details of borrowings and facilities are set out in note 21 on page 187 and net debt is set out in note 20 on pages 185-186.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements\n\nThe directors have considered the Group's cash flow forecasts for the period to the end of March 2022 under base and downside scenarios, with consideration given to the uncertainty of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on both the wider macro-economic environment, including demand for the Group's products and realised prices, and the Group's operations, including production levels. In all of the scenarios modelled, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity throughout the period of assessment without the use of mitigating actions.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the Group's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities for the period assessed. For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.\n\n## New IFRS accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nThe Group has not early adopted any other amendment, standard or interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective. It is expected that where applicable, these standards and amendments will be adopted on each respective effective date. The following new or amended IFRS accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group:\n\n- - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: classification of liabilities as current or non-current\n- - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n- - Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and continent assets: onerous contracts\n- - Amendments to IFRS 3 Business combinations: updating a reference to the conceptual framework\n- - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n\n## IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use\n\nwas published in\n\nAn amendment to IAS 16 Proceeds before intended use May 2020 and will be effective for the Group from 1 January 2022.\n\nThe amendment prohibits an entity from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds received from selling items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. The proceeds from selling these items, and the associated costs will be recognised in the income statement. IAS 2 Inventories should be applied in identifying and measuring the cost of the items.\n\nSignificant judgement will be required in allocating costs between those costs associated with producing and selling items before the item of property, plant and equipment is available for its intended use, and those costs associated with bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has begun its impact assessment on the amendment. It is expected to impact projects entering commercial production in 2022.\n\n## B. Basis of consolidation\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements incorporate a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. Intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation, where appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Other items\n\n## 39. Accounting policies continued\n\nFor non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are presented in equity separately from the equity attributable to shareholders of the Company. Profit or loss and other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the Company and to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a change in control are accounted for in equity. The carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recorded directly in equity and attributed to the shareholders of the Company.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nForeign currency transactions by Group companies are recognised in the functional currencies of the companies at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period and are classified in the income statement according to the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nOn consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions. Any exchange differences arising are classified within the statement of comprehensive income and transferred to the Group's cumulative translation adjustment reserve. Exchange differences on foreign currency balances with foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, and therefore form part of the Group's net investment in these foreign operations, are offset in the cumulative translation adjustment reserve.\n\nCumulative translation differences are recycled from equity and recognised as income or expense on disposal of the operation to which they relate.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## Tenon\n\nTenon Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited (Tenon), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American South Africa Proprietary Limited (AASA), has entered into agreements with Epoch Investment Holdings (RF) Proprietary Limited (Epoch), Epoch Two Investment Holdings (RF) Proprietary Limited (Epoch Two) and Tarl Investment Holdings (RF) Proprietary Limited (Tarl) (collectively the Investment Companies), each owned by independent charitable trusts whose trustees are independent of the Group. Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party (which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries) to take transfer of the Anglo American plc shares each has purchased on the market. Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for nonvoting participating redeemable preference shares in the Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market. These payments by Tenon were sourced from the cash resources of AASA. Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31 December 2025 against payment of an average amount of $3.87 per share to Epoch, $6.02 per share to Epoch Two and $4.99 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party. These funds will then become available for redemption of the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies. The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the Anglo American plc shares will accrue to Tenon and, as these are own shares of the Company, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement of Anglo American plc.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements\n\nUnder the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares. The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl. The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl. Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.\n\nThe structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with participation in future dividend receipts. The Investment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 (2019: 112,300,129) Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.2% (2019: 8.2%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares) with a market value of $3,720 million (2019: $3,207 million). The Investment Companies are not permitted to hold more than an aggregate of 10% of the issued share capital of Anglo American plc at any one time.\n\nThe Investment Companies are considered to be structured entities. Although the Group has no voting rights in the Investment Companies and cannot appoint or remove trustees of the charitable trusts, the Group considers that the agreement outlined above, including Tenon's right to nominate the transferee of the Anglo American plc shares held by the Investment Companies, results in the Group having control over the Investment Companies as defined under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements . Accordingly, the Investment Companies are required to be consolidated by the Group.\n\n## C. Financial performance Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognised in a manner that depicts the pattern of the transfer of goods and services to customers. The amount recognised reflects the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Sales contracts are evaluated to determine the performance obligations, the transaction price and the point at which there is transfer of control. The transactional price is the amount of consideration due in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer, and is allocated against the performance obligations and recognised in accordance with whether control is recognised over a defined period or at a specific point in time.\n\nRevenue is derived principally from commodity sales, and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. A sale is recognised when control has been transferred. This is usually when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.\n\nSales of metal concentrate are stated at their invoiced amount which is net of treatment and refining charges. Sales of certain commodities are provisionally priced such that the price is not settled until a predetermined future date and is based on the market price at that time. These sales are marked to market at each reporting date using the forward price for the period equivalent to that outlined in the contract. Revenue on provisionally priced sales is recognised at the forward market price when control passes to the customer and is classified as revenue from contracts with customers. Subsequent mark-to-market adjustments are recognised in revenue from other sources.\n\nRevenues from the sale of material by-products are recognised within revenue at the point control passes. Where a by-product is not regarded as significant, revenue may be credited against the cost of sales.\n\nRevenue from services is recognised over time in line with the policy above. For contracts which contain separate performance obligations for the sale of commodities and the provision of freight services, the portion of the revenue representing the obligation to perform the freight service is deferred and recognised over time as the obligation is fulfilled, along with the associated costs. In situations where the Group is acting as an agent, amounts billed to customers are offset against the relevant costs.\n\nInterest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established.",

        "page_content": "## Other items\n\n## 39. Accounting policies continued\n\n## Exploration and evaluation expenditure\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure is expensed in the year in which it is incurred.\n\nExploration expenditure is the cost of exploring for Mineral Resources other than that occurring at existing operations and projects and comprises geological and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling and sampling and Mineral Resource development.\n\nEvaluation expenditure includes the cost of conceptual and pre-feasibility studies and evaluation of Mineral Resources at existing operations.\n\nWhen a decision is taken that a mining project is technically feasible and commercially viable, usually after a pre-feasibility study has been completed, subsequent directly attributable expenditure, including feasibility study costs, are considered development expenditure and are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.\n\nExploration properties acquired are recognised on the balance sheet when management considers that their value is recoverable. These properties are measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Short term and low value leases\n\nLeases with a term of less than 12 months or those with committed payments of less than $5,000 are not recognised in the balance sheet. The Group recognises payments for these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term within operating costs in underlying EBITDA.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nInterest on borrowings directly relating to the financing of qualifying assets in the course of construction is added to the capitalised cost of those projects under 'Capital works in progress', until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhere funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## D. Capital base\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill arising thereon\n\nThe identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, a joint arrangement or an associate, which can be measured reliably, are recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition. The estimation of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities is subjective and the use of different valuation assumptions could have a significant impact on financial results. Goodwill is the fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent consideration and previously held noncontrolling interests) less the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable net assets on acquisition.\n\nWhere a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held interests in the acquiree are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nAmounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.\n\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the business combination are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint operations is included within intangible assets. Goodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included within the carrying value of the investment.\n\nWhere the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of the acquisition, the surplus, which represents the discount on the acquisition, is recognised directly in the income statement in the period of acquisition.\n\nFor non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially recorded at the non-controlling interests' proportion of the fair values of net assets recognised at acquisition.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements\n\n## Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\nGoodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash generating units (CGUs) that is expected to benefit from synergies of the combination, and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group's Board of directors for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.\n\nAny impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. Impairment of goodwill is not subsequently reversed.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use (VIU) assessed using discounted cash flow models, as explained in note 7. In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset or CGU. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nIn addition, in making assessments for impairment, management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets, including goodwill, that do not generate independent cash inflows to appropriate CGUs.\n\nSubsequent changes to the CGU allocation, to the timing of cash flows or to the assumptions used to determine the cash flows could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.\n\n## Non-mining licences and other intangible assets\n\nNon-mining licences and other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, usually between 3 and 20 years, except goodwill and those intangible assets that are considered to have indefinite lives. For intangible assets with a finite life, the amortisation period is determined as the period over which the Group expects to obtain benefits from the asset, taking account of all relevant facts and circumstances including contractual lives and expectations about the renewal of contractual arrangements without significant incremental costs. An intangible asset is deemed to have an indefinite life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. Amortisation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.\n\n## Deferred stripping\n\nThe removal of rock or soil overlying a mineral deposit, overburden, and other waste materials is often necessary during the initial development of an open pit mine site, in order to access the orebody. The process of removing overburden and other mine waste materials is referred to as stripping. The directly attributable cost of this activity is capitalised in full within 'Mining properties - owned', until the point at which the mine is considered to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. This is classified as growth or life extension capital expenditure, within investing cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Other items\n\n## 39. Accounting policies continued\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements\n\n'Capital works in progress' are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, at which point they are transferred to the appropriate asset class.\n\nThe removal of waste material after the point at which depreciation commences is referred to as production stripping. When the waste removal activity improves access to ore extracted in the current period, the costs of production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs in accordance with the principles of IAS 2 Inventories.\n\nWhere production stripping activity both produces inventory and improves access to ore in future periods the associated costs of waste removal are allocated between the two elements. The portion that benefits future ore extraction is capitalised within 'Mining properties - owned'. This is classified as stripping and development capital expenditure, within investing cash flows. If the amount to be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined based on the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for the identified component of the orebody. This determination is dependent on an individual mine's design and Life of Mine Plan and therefore changes to the design or Life of Mine Plan will result in changes to these estimates. Identification of the components of a mine's orebody is made by reference to the Life of Mine Plan. The assessment depends on a range of factors including each mine's specific operational features and materiality.\n\nIn certain instances significant levels of waste removal may occur during the production phase with little or no associated production. This may occur at both open pit and underground mines, for example longwall development.\n\nThe cost of this waste removal is capitalised in full to 'Mining properties owned'.\n\nAll amounts capitalised in respect of waste removal are depreciated using the unit of production method for the component of the orebody to which they relate, consistent with depreciation of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe effects of changes to the Life of Mine Plan on the expected cost of waste removal or remaining Ore Reserves for a component are accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost is the fair value of consideration required to acquire and develop the asset and includes the purchase price, acquisition of mineral rights, costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation and, for assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, borrowing costs.\n\nGains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the net proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. The gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Depreciation of property, plant and equipment\n\nMining properties are depreciated to their residual values using the unit of production method based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves and, in certain limited circumstances, other Mineral Resources included in the Life of Mine Plan. These other Mineral Resources are included in depreciation calculations where, taking into account historical rates of conversion to Ore Reserves, there is a high degree of confidence that they will be extracted in an economic manner. This is the case principally for diamond operations, where depreciation calculations are based on Diamond Reserves and Diamond Resources included in the Life of Mine Plan. This reflects the unique nature of diamond deposits where, due to the difficulty in estimating grade, Life of Mine Plans frequently include significant amounts of Inferred Resources.\n\nBuildings and items of plant and equipment for which the consumption of economic benefit is linked primarily to utilisation or to throughput rather than production, are depreciated to their residual values at varying rates on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, or the Reserve Life, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives normally vary from up to 20 years for items of plant and equipment to a maximum of 50 years for buildings. Under limited circumstances, items of plant and equipment may be depreciated over a period that exceeds the Reserve Life by taking into account additional Mineral Resources other than Proved and Probable Reserves included in the Life of Mine Plan, after making allowance for expected production losses based on historical rates of Mineral Resource to Ore Reserve conversion.\n\n## Land is not depreciated.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components).\n\nDepreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.\n\n## Leased right-of-use assets\n\nLeased right-of-use assets are included within property, plant and equipment, and on inception of the lease are recognised at the amount of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs for dismantling, removing, or restoring the underlying asset and less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or, if shorter, the useful life of the asset. The useful lives of rightof-use assets are estimated on the same basis as those of owned property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates, are financial asset investments and are initially recognised at fair value. The Group's financial assets are classified into the following measurement categories: debt instruments at amortised cost, equity instruments and debt instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss. Financial assets are classified as at amortised cost only if the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nAt subsequent reporting dates, financial assets at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. Other investments are classified as either at fair value through profit or loss (which includes investments held for trading) or at fair value through OCI. Both categories are subsequently measured at fair value. Where investments are held for trading purposes, unrealised gains and losses for the period are included in the income statement within other gains and losses.\n\nThe Group has elected to measure equity instruments, which are neither held for trading nor are contingent consideration in a business combination, at fair value through OCI as this better reflects the strategic nature of the Group's equity investments. For equity instruments at fair value through OCI, changes in fair value, including those related to foreign exchange, are recognised in other comprehensive income and there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nA financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses, defined as the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows that are expected to be received, associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and fair value through OCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables only, the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 is applied, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nLosses are recognised in the income statement. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.\n\nImpairment losses relating to equity instruments at fair value through OCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired, the right to receive cash flows has been retained but an obligation to on-pay them in full without material delay has been assumed or the right to receive cash flows has been transferred together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the associated obligation has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.",

Accounting policies continued\n\n## Environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nAn obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining asset. Costs for restoration of site damage, rehabilitation and environmental costs are estimated using either the work of external consultants or internal experts. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.\n\nThese costs are recognised in the income statement over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and recognised in the income statement as extraction progresses.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision represents management's best estimate of the consideration required to complete the restoration and rehabilitation activity, the application of the relevant regulatory framework and timing of expenditure. These estimates are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset in the current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the asset value is increased and there is an indication that the revised carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment test is performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out above.\n\nFor some South African operations annual contributions are made to dedicated environmental rehabilitation trusts to fund the estimated cost of rehabilitation during and at the end of the life of the relevant mine. The Group exercises full control of these trusts and therefore the trusts are consolidated. The trusts' assets are disclosed separately on the balance sheet as non-current assets.\n\nThe trusts' assets are measured based on the nature of the underlying assets in accordance with accounting policies for similar assets.\n\n## E. Working capital\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory and work in progress are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, except for inventory held by commodity broker-traders which is measured at fair value less costs to sell. The production cost of inventory includes an appropriate proportion of depreciation and production overheads. Cost is determined on the following basis:\n\n- - Raw materials and consumables are measured at cost on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis or a weighted average cost basis\n- - Work in progress and finished products are measured at raw material cost, labour cost and a proportion of production overhead expenses\n- - Metal and coal stocks are included within finished products and are measured at average cost.\n\nAt precious metals operations that produce 'joint products', cost is allocated among products according to the ratio of contribution of these metals to gross sales revenues.\n\nInventory is recognised as a current asset where it is expected to be consumed in the next 12 months. Stockpiles are classified as non-current where stockpiles are not expected to be processed in the next 12 months and there is no market to sell the product in its current state.\n\n## F. Net debt and financial risk management Cash and debt\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits, together with short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within short term borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement are shown net of overdrafts. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost except for money market fund investments\n\n## Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified and accounted for as debt or equity according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nInterest bearing borrowings and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities recognised on balance sheet are recognised within borrowings as part of net debt. On inception, the lease liability is recognised as the present value of the expected future lease payments, calculated using the Group's incremental borrowing rate, adjusted to reflect the length of the lease and country of location. For a minority of leases where it is possible to determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, it is used in place of the Group's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nLease payments included in the lease liability consist of each of the following:\n\n- - Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments\n- - Payments whose variability is dependent only upon an index or a rate, measured initially using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is revalued when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate\n- - Any amounts expected to be payable under a guarantee of residual value\n- - The exercise price of a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, the lease payments after the date of a renewal option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise its option to renew the lease, and penalties for exiting a lease agreement unless the Group is reasonably certain not to exit the lease early.\n\nVariable leasing costs (other than those referred to above) and the costs of non-lease components are not included in the lease liability and are charged to operating costs in underlying EBITDA as they are incurred.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change to the forecast lease payments. When the lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of-use asset.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nIn order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risk, the Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts. Commodity based (own use) contracts that meet the scope exemption in IFRS 9 are recognised in earnings when they are settled by physical delivery. Commodity contracts which do not meet the own use criteria are accounted for as derivatives.\n\nAll derivatives are held at fair value in the balance sheet within 'Derivative financial assets' or 'Derivative financial liabilities' except if they are linked to settlement and delivery of an unquoted equity instrument and the fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case they are carried at cost. Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the contractual maturity of the derivative. A derivative cannot be measured reliably where the range of reasonable fair value estimates is significant and the probabilities of various estimates cannot be reasonably assessed.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Other items\n\n## 39. Accounting policies continued\n\nFor an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. The corresponding entry and gains or losses arising from remeasuring the associated derivative are recognised in the income statement within financing remeasurements.\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group's material hedging instruments are interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms to the related debt instruments, such as payment dates, maturities and notional amount. As all critical terms matched during the year, there was no material hedge ineffectiveness. The Group also uses cross currency swaps to manage foreign exchange risk associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. These are not designated in an accounting hedge as there is a natural offset against foreign exchange movements on associated borrowings.\n\nThe Group has designated the embedded derivative component of the royalty liability (see note 33) as a cash flow hedge of future revenue cash flows from the Woodsmith project. At 31 December 2020 the derivative is held at nil value and hence no accounting entries have been made. In future periods, assuming the hedge remains effective, fair value derivative gains and losses as a result of changing forecast price and production forecasts will be recorded within other comprehensive income and recycled to financing costs as the related revenue is recognised.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement for the period.\n\nChanges in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated in a hedge relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nDerivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-financial host contracts (other than financial assets in the scope of IFRS 9) are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the host contracts themselves are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.\n\nDerivatives embedded in contracts which are financial assets in the scope of IFRS 9 are not separated and the whole contract is accounted for at either amortised cost or fair value.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures\n\nThe Group uses interest rate derivatives to swap the majority of its Euro, Sterling and US dollar bonds from fixed interest rates to EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR and USD LIBOR respectively. Any non-USD interest rate derivatives are swapped to USD LIBOR using cross currency interest rate swaps which are not designated into hedges. The interest rate derivatives are designated into fair value hedges.\n\nEURIBOR and LIBOR are expected to be replaced by alternative risk-free rates by the end of 2021 as part of inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform. Phase 2 IBOR amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instrumen ts, IAS 39 Hedge Accounting, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases were published in August 2020 and are effective from 1 January 2021.\n\nThe Group is continuing preparation for transition to incorporate alternative risk-free rates where the current interest benchmarks used by the Group are EURIBOR and LIBOR. The Group is monitoring the market and discussing the potential changes with its counterparties in order to effectively transition to alternative risk-free rates. The published amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 modify specific hedge accounting requirements and allow it to be assumed that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the uncertainties of IBOR reform when performing hedge effectiveness testing.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements\n\nThe Group will continue to apply the Phase 1 amendments to IFRS 9 until the uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reforms with respect to the timing and the amount of the underlying cash flows that the Group is exposed to ends. The Group is currently assessing alternative interest rate derivative contracts and the reliance upon replacement rates where relevant.\n\nSee note 21 for a list of the Group's Euro, Sterling and US dollar bonds which in turn reflects the nominal amount of the hedging instruments for those bonds which have been hedged.\n\n## G. Taxation\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax expense includes the current tax and deferred tax charge recognised in the income statement.\n\nCurrent tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Probable taxable profits are based on evidence of historical profitability and taxable profit forecasts limited by reference to the criteria set out in IAS 12 Income Taxes . Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction (other than in a business combination) that affects neither taxable profit nor accounting profit.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis with that taxation authority.\n\n## H. Employees\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nThe Group's accounting policy involves the use of 'best estimate' assumptions in calculating the schemes' valuations in accordance with the accounting standard. This valuation methodology differs from that applied in calculating the funding valuations, which require the use of 'prudent' assumptions, such as lower discount rates, higher assumed rates of future inflation expectations and greater improvements in life expectancy, leading to a higher value placed on the liabilities. The funding valuations are carried out every three years, using the projected unit credit method, by independent qualified actuaries and are used to determine the money that must be put into the funded schemes. The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for its employees as well as post employment medical plans. For defined contribution plans the amount recognised in the income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the year.",

        "page_content": "## Other items\n\n## 39. Accounting policies continued\n\nFor defined benefit pension and post employment medical plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out at least every three years using the projected unit credit method and updates are performed for each financial year end. The average discount rate for the plans' liabilities is based on AA rated corporate bonds of a suitable duration and currency or, where there is no deep market for such bonds, is based on government bonds. Pension plan assets are measured using year end market values.\n\nRemeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, movements in asset surplus restrictions and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest income) are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income and are not recycled to the income statement. Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to operating profit. The net interest income or cost on the net defined benefit asset or liability is included in investment income or interest expense respectively.\n\nPast service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest.\n\nThe retirement benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet represents the present value of the deficit or surplus of the defined benefit plans. Any recognised surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of shares that will eventually vest. For those share schemes with market related vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date. The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model.\n\nFor all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the grant date. For all share schemes with non -market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the relevant charge. Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.\n\n## I. Group structure\n\n## Associates and joint arrangements\n\nAssociates are investments over which the Group has significant influence, which is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but without the ability to exercise control or joint control. Typically the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity of its associates.\n\nJoint arrangements are arrangements in which the Group shares joint control with one or more parties. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, and exists only when decisions about the activities that significantly affect the arrangement's returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nJudgement is required in determining this classification through an evaluation of the facts and circumstances arising from each individual arrangement. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. In joint operations, the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement, whereas in joint ventures, the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nJoint arrangements that are not structured through a separate vehicle are always joint operations. Joint arrangements that are structured through a separate vehicle may be either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the substance of the arrangement. In these cases, consideration is given to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances. When the activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties, and the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this indicates that the parties to the arrangements have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.\n\n## Financial statements and other financial information\n\nNotes to the financial statements\n\nCertain joint arrangements that are structured through separate vehicles including Collahuasi, Debswana and Namdeb are accounted for as joint operations. These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties sharing joint control, indicating that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the parties; this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations for the liabilities. It is primarily these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification as joint operations.\n\nThe Group accounts for joint operations by recognising the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses for which it has rights or obligations, including its share of such items held or incurred jointly.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale. The Group's share of associates' and joint ventures' net income is based on their most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim statements drawn up to the Group's balance sheet date.\n\nThe total carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings, any other movements in reserves and any long term debt interests which in substance form part of the Group's net investment, less any cumulative impairments. The carrying values of associates and joint ventures are reviewed on a regular basis and if there is objective evidence that an impairment in value has occurred as a result of one or more events during the period, the investment is impaired. Investments which have been previously impaired are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment reversal.\n\nThe Group's share of an associate's or joint venture's losses in excess of its interest in that associate or joint venture is not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is met only when a sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification, management is committed to the sale and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale from the date these conditions are met and are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resulting impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nOn classification as held for sale the assets are no longer depreciated. Comparative amounts are not adjusted.\n\n## Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transactions\n\nWhere the Group disposes of a portion of a South African based subsidiary or operation to a BEE company at a discount to fair value, the transaction is considered to be a share-based payment (in line with the principle contained in South Africa interpretation AC 503 Accounting for Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Transactions ).\n\nThe discount provided or value given is calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments and the cost, representing the fair value of the BEE credentials obtained by the subsidiary, is recorded in the income statement.",

Accounting policies: Anglo American plc (the Company)\n\nThe Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements (FRS 100) and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).\n\nThe Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410).\n\nA summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies.\n\nAs permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the statement of comprehensive income of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.\n\nThe Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:\n\n- - the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46-52 of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments\n- - the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures\n- - the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement\n- - the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1\n- - the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134-136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements\n- - the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows\n- - the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n- - the requirements of paragraph 17 and 18A of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures\n- - the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nThe Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the instrument. Financial instruments are derecognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire.\n\n## Dividends\n\nInterim equity dividends are recognised when declared. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments .\n\nThe Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of shares that will eventually vest. For those share schemes with market related vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date. The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the grant date. For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the relevant charge. Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.\n\nThe Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings. Equity settled share-based payments that are made to employees of the Company's subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company's investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.\n\nAny payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in Investments in subsidiaries.\n\n## Taxation\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of the Company, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.\n\nThe only income of the Company is dividend income from subsidiaries. This income is non-taxable and there is no tax charge for the year.",

        "page_content": "## Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources\n\n## as at 31 December 2020\n\nThe Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this report were prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc Group Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Reporting Policy. This policy stipulates that the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2012 edition (the JORC Code) be used as a minimum standard. Some Anglo American plc subsidiaries have a primary listing in South Africa where public reporting is carried out in accordance with the South African Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (the SAMREC Code). The SAMREC Code is similar to the JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology appearing in this section follows the definitions in both the JORC (2012) and SAMREC (2016) Codes. Ore Reserves in the context of this report have the same meaning as 'Mineral Reserves' as defined by the SAMREC Code and the CIM (Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy and Petroleum) Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.\n\nThe information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC or SAMREC Codes. All Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking. All the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the information in the form and context in which it appears. The names of the Competent Persons (CPs) along with their Recognised Professional Organisation (RPO) affiliation and years of relevant experience are listed in the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020.\n\nAnglo American Group companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of reviews aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. The reviews are conducted by suitably qualified Competent Persons from within the Anglo American Group or by independent consultants. The frequency and depth of the reviews is a function of the perceived risks and/or uncertainties associated with a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource. The overall value of the entity and time that has elapsed since an independent third-party review are also considered. Those operations/projects that were subjected to independent third-party reviews during the year are indicated in footnotes to the tables in the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020.\n\nBoth the JORC and SAMREC Codes require due consideration of reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction for Mineral Resource definition. These include long-range commodity price forecasts which are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long term economic outlooks. The calculation of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are based on long term prices determined at the beginning of the second quarter of each year. Ore Reserves are dynamic and more likely to be affected by fluctuations in the prices of commodities, uncertainties in production costs, processing costs and other mining, infrastructure, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors which may impact the financial condition and prospects of the Group. Mineral Resource estimates also change and tend to be most influenced by new information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly by the conversion to Ore Reserves. Unless stated otherwise, Mineral Resources are additional to (i.e. exclusive of) those resources converted to Ore Reserves and are reported on a dry tonnes basis.\n\nMineral Resource classification defines the confidence associated with different parts of the Mineral Resource. The confidence that is assigned refers collectively to the reliability of the Grade and Tonnage estimates. This reliability includes consideration for the fidelity of the base data, the geological continuity predicated by the level of understanding of the geology, the likely precision of the grade estimates and understanding of grade variability, as well as various other factors (in particular density) that may influence the confidence that can be assigned to the Mineral Resource. Most business units have developed commodity-specific scorecard-based approaches to the classification of their Mineral Resources.\n\nThe appropriate Mineral Resource classification is determined by the appointed Competent (or Qualified) Persons. The choice of category of Mineral Resource depends upon the quantity, distribution and quality of geoscientific information available and the level of confidence in these data.\n\nThe estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are stated as at 31 December 2020. The figures in the tables have been rounded, and if used to derive totals and averages, minor differences may result.\n\nThe Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020 should be considered the only valid source of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource information for the Anglo American Group exclusive of Kumba Iron Ore and Anglo American Platinum Limited, which publish their own independent annual reports.\n\nIt is accepted that mine design and planning may include some Inferred Mineral Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources in the Life of Mine Plan (LOM Plan) are described as 'Inferred (in LOM Plan)' separately from the remaining Inferred Mineral Resources described as 'Inferred (ex. LOM Plan)', as required. These resources are declared without application of Modifying Factors. Reserve Life reflects the scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan.\n\nThe Ownership (Attributable) Percentage that Anglo American holds in each operation and project is presented beside the name of each entity and is the Group's effective ownership interest. Operations and projects which fall below the internal threshold for reporting (25% attributable interest) are not reported. Operations or projects which were disposed of during 2020 and hence not reported are: Elizabeth Bay and Douglas Bay (Diamonds).\n\nIn South Africa, the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Number 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) that was implemented on 1 May 2004, (subsequently amended by the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment Act 49 of 2008) effectively transferred custodianship of the previously privately held mineral rights to the State.\n\nA Prospecting Right is a right issued in terms of the MPRDA that is valid for up to five years, with the possibility of a further extension of three years.\n\nA Mining Right is a right issued in terms of the MPRDA and is valid for up to 30 years, with the possibility of a further extension of 30 years. The Minister of Mineral Resources will grant a renewal of the Mining Right if the terms and conditions of the Mining Right have been complied with and the applicant is not in contravention of any relevant provisions of the MPRDA.\n\nIn preparing the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statement for South African assets, Anglo American plc has adopted the following reporting principles in respect of Prospecting Rights and Mining Rights:\n\n- - Where applications for Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory authorities, the relevant Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources have been included in the statement.\n- - Where applications for Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been initially refused by the regulatory authorities, but are the subject of ongoing legal process and discussions with the relevant authorities and where Anglo American plc has reasonable expectations that the rights will be granted in due course, the relevant Mineral Resources have been included in the statement (any associated comments appear in the footnotes).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe detailed Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates, Reserve and Resource Reconciliation Overview, Definitions and Glossary are contained in the separate Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2020 which is available in the Annual Reporting Centre on the Anglo American website.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary of terms\n\n## Ore Reserves\n\nAn 'Ore Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. 'Modifying Factors' are (realistically assumed) considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Ore Reserves are subdivided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves.\n\nA 'Proved Ore Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.\n\nA 'Probable Ore Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Ore Reserve. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development of the deposit.\n\n## Mineral Resources\n\nA 'Mineral Resource' is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.\n\nA 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.\n\nA Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proved Ore Reserve or under certain circumstances to a Probable Ore Reserve.\n\nAn 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered.\n\nAn Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Ore Reserve.\n\nAn 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.\n\nAn Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.\n\n## Life of Mine Plan (LOM Plan)\n\nA design and costing study of an existing operation in which appropriate assessments have been made of realistically assumed geological, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social, governmental, engineering, operational and all other Modifying Factors, which are considered in sufficient detail to demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction is reasonably justified.\n\n## Reserve Life\n\nThe scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved LOM Plan.\n\n## Inferred (in LOM Plan)\n\nInferred Resources within the scheduled LOM Plan.\n\n## Inferred (ex. LOM Plan)\n\nThe portion of Inferred Resources with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction not considered in the LOM Plan.\n\n## Fatal-injury frequency rate (FIFR) (1)\n\nFIFR is the number of employee or contractor fatal injuries due to all causes per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\n## Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (1)\n\nLTIFR is the number of lost time injuries (LTIs) for both employees and contractors per 1,000,000 hours worked. An LTI is a work related injury resulting in the person being unable to attend work or perform the routine functions of his/her job, on the next calendar day after the day of the injury, whether a scheduled workday or not. Restricted work cases are therefore counted as LTIs.\n\n## Total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) (1)\n\nTRCFR is the number of fatal injuries, lost time injuries and medical treatment cases for both employees and contractors per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\n## New cases of occupational disease (NCOD) (1)\n\nNCOD is the sum of occupational diseases due to asbestosis, noise-induced hearing loss, silicosis, coal-workers' pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive air ways disease, occupational tuberculosis, occupational asthma, hand/arm vibration syndrome, musculoskeletal disorders, occupational dermatitis, occupational cancers, sensitisation to platinum or rhodium salts, malaria, venus thromboembolism, work-related mental disorders and other occupational diseases.\n\n## Total energy consumed (1)\n\nTotal amount of energy consumed is the sum of total energy from electricity purchased, total energy from fossil fuels and total energy from renewable fuels and is measured in million gigajoules (GJ).\n\n## Total water withdrawals (1)\n\nTotal water withdrawals by source, reported in line with International Council on Metals and Mining (ICMM) guidance, includes: surface water; groundwater; seawater, and third-party water, and is measured in million m 3 .",

Where emission factors are available for specific countries or sub-regions from government and regulatory authorities, these are applied. Australian operations apply conversion factors required by the government for regulatory reporting and operations in Brazil apply local factors for biomass and biofuel. Factors for CO2e from electricity are based on local grid factors.\n\nBased on a self-assessment, Anglo American believes it reports in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol, as issued prior to the 2015 revision on Scope 2 emissions reporting. In line with the GHG Protocol's 'management control' boundary, 100% of the direct and indirect emissions for managed operations are accounted for while zero emissions for joint ventures and other investments are included in the reporting scope.\n\n## Level 3, 4 and 5 environmental incidents (1)\n\nEnvironmental incidents are unplanned or unwanted events resulting from our operations that adversely impact the environment or contravene local regulations/permit conditions. They are classified from minor (Level 1) to significant (Level 5) depending on the duration and extent of impact, as well as the sensitivity and/or biodiversity value of the receiving environment. Level 3-5 incidents are those which we consider to have prolonged impacts on the local environments, lasting in excess of one month and affecting areas greater than several hundred metres on site, or extending beyond the boundaries of our immediate operations.\n\n## Total amount spent on corporate social investment (CSI)\n\nCategories for corporate social investment expenditure include charitable donations, community investment and commercial initiatives. CSI contributions can take the form of cash donations, contributions in kind and employees' working hours spent on charity and volunteering projects during work hours. Not included is expenditure that is necessary for the development of an operation (e.g. resettlement of families) or receiving a licence. Training expenditure for individuals who will be employed by the Company following completion of training is not included. CSI is reported in US dollars and converted from the currency of the operations at the average foreign exchange rate applied by Anglo American for financial reporting purposes.\n\nCharitable donations include charitable and philanthropic gifts and contributions that tend to be ad hoc and one-off's.\n\nCommunity investment includes the funding of community partnerships which address social issues, the costs of providing public facilities to community members who are not employees or dependents, the marginal value of land or other assets transferred to community ownership, and income creation schemes or mentoring/ volunteering initiatives that do not have a principally commercial justification.\n\nCommercial initiatives include enterprise development and other community initiatives/partnerships that can also directly support the success of the Company (such as supplier development). There must, however be a clear and primary element of public benefit.\n\nWe prohibit the making of donations for political purposes to any politician, political party or related organisation, an official of a political party or candidate for political office in any circumstances either directly or through third parties.\n\nAnglo American supports jobs through training, mentoring and capacity development. The number of jobs supported includes existing jobs (in activities supported by the intervention) and newly created jobs through the programmes. Jobs supported are measured as full time equivalent jobs.\n\n## Businesses supported through enterprise development initiatives\n\nAnglo American supports a range of entrepreneurs, micro, small and medium enterprises, including farm households for agricultural development programmes, participating in the programme in our countries of operations through mentoring, technical assistance and funding, depending on the specific programme. The programmes are implemented by our strategic partner TechnoServe, in collaboration with other local partners.  The programmes are engaged in ongoing monitoring and data is reported at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Local procurement measurement\n\nLaunched in 2010, our Local Procurement Policy provides a framework for supporting development outcomes through targeted procurement initiatives. This policy is further strengthened by region specific policies, especially as it relates to Host Community Procurement. Local and Host Community procurement strategies articulate the value to Anglo American and local Host communities.\n\nThe measurement of local host community procurement varies between operations, and is informed by a combination of development outcomes and legal requirements. Local procurement (which is defined as in-county procurement) occurs on multiple levels, and often as a combination of factors, including procurement from host, indigenous and previously disadvantaged communities.\n\n- - Host communities: includes suppliers who have their main place of business in the direct vicinity of the operation, as defined per region.\n- - Indigenous communities: includes First Nation-owned companies (De Beers Canada), Aboriginal owned supplier businesses (Australia).\n- - Previously disadvantaged and marginalised groups: includes targeted preferential procurement expenditure from identified beneficiary groups e.g. Black owned businesses (South Africa).\n\nIn most instances, our local procurement initiatives also take into account communities that may be affected by our operations - specifically referred to as Host Community Procurement, and aimed at ensuring maximum impact on host communities in the direct vicinity of our operations. To improve accuracy and provide a clear and focused approach to our reporting, and to ensure maximum positive impact on our host community and local suppliers, we started to redefine how we measure our support for local and host community suppliers during 2019. In 2020 it was further rolled out and we will continue to expand its reach until all regions have been included. We will also continue to harmonise our data across the regions.\n\n- (1) Data relates to subsidiaries and joint operations over which Anglo American has management control. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, data excludes results from De Beers' joint operations in Namibia and Botswana. Prior years' data includes results from De Beers' joint operations in Namibia and Botswana.

Certain financial measures cannot be directly derived from the financial statements as they contain additional information, such as financial information from earlier periods or profit estimates or projections. The accounting policies applied when calculating APMs are, where relevant and unless otherwise stated, substantially the same as those disclosed in the Group's Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 with the exception of the new accounting pronouncements disclosed in note 39.\n- - Non-financial APMs: These measures incorporate certain non-financial information that management believes is useful when assessing the performance of the Group.\n\nAPMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, the APMs used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies.\n\nAPMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with IFRS.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Group uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and business units, either by adjusting for uncontrollable factors or special items which impact upon IFRS measures or, by aggregating measures, to aid the user of the Annual Report in understanding the activity taking place across the Group's portfolio.\n\n- 1. Earnings volatility: The Group mines and markets commodities and precious metals and minerals. The sector is characterised by significant volatility in earnings driven by movements in macro-economic factors, primarily price and foreign exchange. This volatility is outside the control of management and can mask underlying changes in performance. As such, when comparing year-on-year performance, management excludes certain items (such as those classed as 'special items') to aid comparability and then quantifies and isolates uncontrollable factors in order to improve understanding of the controllable portion of variances.\n- 2. Nature of investment: Investments in the sector typically occur over several years and are large, requiring significant funding before generating cash. These investments are often made with partners and the nature of the Group's ownership interest affects how the financial results of these operations are reflected in the Group's results e.g. whether full consolidation (subsidiaries), consolidation of the Group's attributable assets and liabilities (joint operations) or equity accounted (associates and joint ventures). Attributable metrics are therefore presented to help demonstrate the financial performance and returns available to the Group, for investment and financing activities, excluding the effect of different accounting treatments for different ownership interests.\n- 3. Portfolio complexity: The Group operates in a number of different, but complementary commodities, precious metals and minerals. The cost, value of and return from each saleable unit (e.g. tonne, pound, carat, ounce) can differ materially between each business. This makes understanding both the overall portfolio performance, and the relative performance of its constituent parts on a like-for-like basis, more challenging. The Group therefore uses composite APMs to provide a consistent metric to assess performance at the portfolio level.\n\nConsequently, APMs are used by the Board and management for planning and reporting. A subset is also used by management in setting director and management remuneration, such as attributable free cash flow prior to growth capital expenditure. The measures are also used in discussions with the investment analyst community and credit rating agencies.\n\n## Financial APMs\n\n| Group APM                                            | Closest equivalent  IFRS measure                                                            | Adjustments to reconcile to primary statements                                                                                                                                | Rationale for adjustments                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Income statement                                     | Income statement                                                                            | Income statement                                                                                                                                                              | Income statement                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Group revenue                                        | Revenue                                                                                     | -

The calculation of underlying earnings per share is disclosed within note 3 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Mining EBITDA margin\n\nThe mining EBITDA margin is derived from the Group's underlying EBITDA as a percentage of Group revenue, adjusted to exclude certain items to better reflect the performance of the Group's mining business. The mining EBITDA margin reflects Debswana accounting treatment as a 50/50 joint operation, excludes third-party sales, purchases and trading and excludes Platinum Group Metals' purchase of concentrate.\n\n| US$ million (unless otherwise stated)                               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Underlying EBITDA                                                   | 9,802  | 10,006 |\n| Group revenue                                                       | 32,338 | 31,825 |\n| Margin                                                              | 30%    | 31%    |\n| Adjustments for:                                                    |        |        |\n| Debswana adjustment to reflect as a 50/50  joint operation          | 2%     | 2%     |\n| Exclude third-party purchases, trading  activity and processing (1) | 11%    | 9%     |\n| Mining EBITDA margin                                                | 43%    | 42%    |\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents (including derivatives that provide an economic hedge of net debt, see note 22, but excluding the impact of the debit valuation adjustment on these derivatives, explained in note 20). A reconciliation to the Consolidated\n\nbalance sheet is provided within note 20 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nCapital expenditure is defined as cash expenditure on property, plant and equipment, including related derivatives, and is presented net of proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment and includes direct funding for capital expenditure from non-controlling interests and reimbursement of capital expenditure in order to match more closely the way in which it is managed. A reconciliation to 'Expenditure on property, plant and equipment', the closest equivalent IFRS measure to capital expenditure, is provided within note 12 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nOperating cash flows generated by operations that have not yet reached commercial production are also included in capital expenditure. However, capital expenditure is also periodically shown on an underlying basis i.e. before inclusion of capitalised operating cash flows. Where this occurs, the measure is footnoted as such.\n\n## Sustaining capital\n\nSustaining capital is calculated as capital expenditure excluding capitalised operating cash flows and growth projects. Expenditure on growth projects in 2020 principally related to Quellaveco and the Woodsmith polyhalite project acquired in March 2020, and construction of another diamond mining vessel (2019: Quellaveco and the greenfield synthetic diamond plant in Oregon (De Beers)). The Group uses sustaining capital as a measure to provide additional information to understand the capital needed to sustain the current production base of existing assets.\n\n## Attributable return on capital employed (ROCE)\n\nROCE is a ratio that measures the efficiency and profitability of a company's capital investments. Attributable ROCE displays how effectively assets are generating profit on invested capital for the equity shareholders of the Company. It is calculated as attributable underlying EBIT divided by average attributable capital employed.\n\nAttributable underlying EBIT excludes the underlying EBIT of non -controlling interests.\n\nCapital employed is defined as net assets excluding net debt and financial asset investments. Attributable capital employed excludes capital employed of non-controlling interests. Average attributable capital employed is calculated by adding the opening and closing attributable capital employed for the relevant period and dividing by two.\n\nAttributable ROCE is also used as an incentive measure in executives' remuneration and is predicated upon the achievement of ROCE targets in the final year of a three year performance period.\n\nA reconciliation to 'Profit/(loss) before net finance income/(costs) and tax', the closest equivalent IFRS measure to underlying EBIT, is provided within note 2 to the Consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation to 'Net assets', the closest equivalent IFRS measure to capital employed, is provided within note 9 to the Consolidated financial statements. The table below reconciles underlying EBIT and capital employed to attributable underlying EBIT and average attributable capital employed by segment.\n\n|                       | Attributable ROCE %   | Attributable ROCE %   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                       | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| De Beers              | -                     | 2                     |\n| Copper                | 19                    | 16                    |\n| Platinum Group Metals | 48                    | 38                    |\n| Iron Ore              | 41                    | 31                    |\n| Coal                  | (16)                  | 26                    |\n| Nickel and Manganese  | 17                    | 20                    |\n| Crop Nutrients        | n/a                   | n/a                   |\n| Corporate and other   | n/a                   | n/a                   |\n|                       | 17                    | 19                    |",

Sustaining attributable free cash flow is also used as an incentive measure in executives' remuneration and is proposed to be used in LTIP 20. It is calculated as attributable free cash flow prior to growth capex and expenditure on non-current intangible assets (excluding goodwill). A reconciliation of 'Cash flows from operations', the closest equivalent IFRS measure, is provided on page 64 of the Group financial review. Growth capital expenditure in 2020 principally related to Quellaveco, Woodsmith, and construction of another diamond mining vessel (2019: Quellaveco and construction of a greenfield synthetic diamond plant (De Beers)).",

It is calculated by expressing each commodity's volume as revenue, subsequently converting the revenue into copper equivalent units by dividing by the copper price (per tonne). Long term forecast prices (and foreign exchange rates where appropriate) are used, in order that period-on-period comparisons exclude any impact for movements in price.\n\nWhen calculating copper equivalent production, domestic thermal coal sales are excluded, as are sales from non-mining activities. Volume from projects in pre-commercial production are included.\n\n## Unit cost\n\nUnit cost is the direct cash cost including direct cash support costs incurred in producing one unit of saleable production. Unit cost relates to equity production only.\n\nFor bulk products (iron ore, coal), unit costs shown are FOB i.e. cost on board at port. For base metals (copper, nickel), they are shown at C1 i.e. after inclusion of by-product credits and logistics costs. For PGMs and diamonds, unit costs include all direct expensed cash costs incurred i.e. excluding, among other things, market development activity, corporate overhead etc. Platinum Group Metals unit costs exclude by-product credits. Royalties are excluded from all unit cost calculations.\n\n## Copper equivalent unit cost\n\nCopper equivalent unit cost is the cost incurred to produce one tonne of copper equivalent. Only the cost incurred in mined output from subsidiaries and joint operations is included, representing direct costs in the Consolidated income statement controllable by the Group. Costs and volumes from associates and joint ventures are excluded, as are those from operations that are not yet in commercial production, that deliver domestic production, and those associated with third party volume purchases of diamonds and PGMs concentrate.\n\nWhen calculating copper equivalent unit cost, unit costs for each commodity are multiplied by relevant production, combined and then divided by the total copper equivalent production, to get a copper equivalent unit cost i.e. the cost of mining one tonne of copper equivalent. The metric is in US dollars and, where appropriate, long term foreign exchange rates are used to convert from local currency to US dollars.\n\n## Productivity\n\nThe Group's productivity measure calculates the copper equivalent production generated per employee. It is a measure that represents how well headcount is driving revenue. It is calculated by dividing copper equivalent production by the average direct headcount from consolidated mining operations in a given year.\n\n## Volume and cash cost improvements\n\nThe Group uses an underlying EBITDA waterfall to understand its year-onyear underlying EBITDA performance. The waterfall isolates the impact of uncontrollable factors in order that the real year-on-year improvement in performance can be seen by the user.\n\nThree variables are normalised, in the results of subsidiaries and joint operations, for:\n\n- - Price: The movement in price between comparative periods is removed by multiplying current year sales volume by the movement in realised price for each product group.\n- - Foreign exchange: The year-on-year movement in exchange is removed from the current year non-US dollar cost base i.e. costs are restated at prior year foreign exchange rates. The non-US dollar cash cost base excludes costs which are price linked (e.g. purchase of concentrate from third party PGMs providers, third party diamond purchases).\n- - Inflation: CPI is removed from cash costs, restating these costs at the pricing level of the base year.\n\nThe remaining variances in the underlying EBITDA waterfall are in real US dollar terms for the base year i.e. for a waterfall comparing 2020 with 2019, the sales volume and cash cost variances exclude the impact of price, foreign exchange and CPI and are hence in real 2019 terms. This allows the user of the waterfall to understand the underlying real movement in sales volumes and cash costs on a consistent basis.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report\n\nThis section includes certain disclosures which are required by law to be included in the Directors' report.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Companies Act), the following items have been reported in other sections of the Integrated Annual Report and are included in this Directors' report by reference:\n\n- - Details of the directors of the Company can be found on pages 100-103\n- - Directors' interests in shares at 31 December 2020 and any changes thereafter, can be found on page 142 of the directors' remuneration report\n- - Events occurring after the end of the year are set out in note 29 to the financial statements on page 204\n- - The Strategic Report on pages 2-96 gives a fair review of the business and an indication of likely future developments and fulfils the requirements set out in section 414C of the Companies Act\n- - Details of the Group's governance arrangements and its compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) can be found on pages 98-147\n- - Comprehensive details of the Group's approach to financial risk management are given in note 23 to the financial statements on pages 192-194\n- - The Group's disclosure of its greenhouse gas emissions can be found on page 37. The Group's Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) disclosures can be found on page 257\n- - Details of employee engagement can be found on pages 43-49 and 112\n- - Details of stakeholder engagement can be found on pages 13, 18 and 112-113.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the Group financial review on pages 62-65. Further details of our policy on financial risk management are set out in note 23 to the financial statements on pages 192-194. The Group's net debt (including related hedges) at 31 December 2020 was $5.6 billion (2019: $4.6 billion), representing a gearing level of 15% (2019: 13%). The Group's liquidity position (defined as cash and undrawn committed facilities) of $17.5 billion at 31 December 2020 remains strong. Details of borrowings and facilities are set out in note 21 on page 187 and net debt is set out in note 20 on pages 185-186.\n\nThe directors have considered the Group's cash flow forecasts for the period to the end of March 2022 under base and downside scenarios, with consideration given to the uncertainty of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on both the wider macro-economic environment, including demand for the Group's products and realised prices, and the Group's operations, including production levels. In all of the scenarios modelled, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity throughout the period of assessment without the use of mitigating actions.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the Group's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities for the period assessed. For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.\n\n## Dividends\n\nAn interim dividend of 28 US cents per ordinary share was paid on 25 September 2020. The directors are recommending that a final dividend of 72 US cents per ordinary share be paid on 7 May 2021 to ordinary shareholders on the register at the close of business on 19 March 2021, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM to be held on 5 May 2021. This would bring the total dividend in respect of 2020 to US$1.00 per ordinary share. In accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the final dividend will be accounted for in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Anglo American Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) holds shares to facilitate the operation of certain of the Group's share option and share incentive schemes (share plans). The EBT has waived the right to receive dividends on shares held on behalf of share plans participants employed by the Group in countries other than the UK and South Africa.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe Company's issued share capital as at 31 December 2020, together with details of share allotments and issue of treasury shares during the year, is set out in note 24 on page 195.\n\n## Significant shareholdings\n\nThe Company has been notified of the following significant shareholdings:\n\n| Company                                                     | Number of shares   |   Percentage of voting rights |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Public Investment Corporation                               | 93,551,783         |                          6.86 |\n| BlackRock Inc                                               | 84,968,927         |                          6.05 |\n| Coronation Asset Management (Pty) Ltd                       | 41,280,874         |                          3.03 |\n| Tarl Investment Holdings (RF) Proprietary  Limited (1)      | 47,275,613         |                          3.37 |\n| Epoch Two Investment Holdings (RF)  Proprietary Limited (1) | 42,166,686         |                          3.01 |\n\n## Disclosure table pursuant to Listing Rule 9.8.4C\n\n| Listing Rule   | Information to be included                                        | Disclosure                                                                                                         |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 9.8.4(1)       | Interest capitalised by the  Group                                | See note 4, page 166                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(2)       | Unaudited financial  information (LR 9.2.18)                      | None                                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(4)       | Long term incentive scheme  only involving a director  (LR 9.4.3) | None                                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(5)       | Directors' waivers of  emoluments                                 | None                                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(6)       | Directors' waivers of future  emoluments                          | None                                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(7)       | Non pro rata allotments for  cash (issuer)                        | Treasury shares have been  issued pursuant to the exercise  of options awarded under  shareholder approved schemes |\n| 9.8.4(8)       | Non pro rata allotments for  cash (major subsidiaries)            | None                                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(9)       | Listed company is a  subsidiary of another  company               | Not applicable                                                                                                     |\n| 9.8.4(10)      | Contracts of significance  involving a director                   | None                                                                                                               |\n| 9.8.4(11)      | Contracts of significance  involving a controlling  shareholder   | Not applicable                                                                                                     |\n| 9.8.4(12)      | Waivers of dividends                                              | See 'Dividends' paragraph on  this page                                                                            |\n| 9.8.4(13)      | Waivers of future dividends                                       | See 'Dividends' paragraph on  this page                                                                            |\n| 9.8.4(14)      | Agreement with a controlling  shareholding LR 9.2.2AR(2)(a)       | Not applicable                                                                                                     |\n\n## Sustainable development\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2020 is published on the Group's website on 8 March 2021.\n\nThis report focuses on the safety, health, sustainable development and environmental performance of the Group's managed operations, its performance with regard to the Group's Code of Conduct, and the operational dimensions of its social programmes.",

        "page_content": "## Other information\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Audit information\n\nThe directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware, that all directors have taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.\n\n## Employment and other policies\n\nThe Group's key operating businesses are empowered to manage within the context of the different legislative and social demands of the diverse countries in which those businesses operate, subject to the standards embodied in Anglo American's Code of Conduct. Within all the Group's businesses, the safe and effective performance of employees and the maintenance of positive employee relations are of fundamental importance. Managers are charged with ensuring that the following key principles are upheld:\n\n- - Adherence to national legal standards on employment and workplace rights at all times\n- - Adherence to the International Labour Organization's core labour rights, including: prohibition of child labour; prohibition of inhumane treatment of employees and any form of forced labour, physical punishment or other abuse; recognition of the right of our employees to freedom of association and the promotion of workplace equality; and the elimination of all forms of unfair discrimination\n- - Continual promotion of safe and healthy working practices\n- - Provision of opportunities for employees to enhance their work related skills and capabilities\n- - Adoption of fair and appropriate procedures for determining terms and conditions of employment.\n\nIt is the Group's policy that people with disabilities should have full and fair consideration for all vacancies. Employment of disabled people is considered on merit and with regard only to the ability of any applicant to carry out the role. We endeavour to retain the employment of, and arrange suitable retraining, for any employees in the workforce who become disabled during their employment. Where possible we will adjust a person's working environment to enable them to stay in our employment.\n\nThe Group promotes an inclusive and diverse environment where every colleague is valued and respected for who they are, and has the opportunity to fulfil their potential. The Group is focused on providing a workplace where everyone can thrive and has introduced a number of Groupwide policies to encourage this. The Group's inclusion and diversity policy reflects its commitment as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and is aligned both to the labour rights principles set out in the International Labour Organization core conventions and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The Group has also introduced a bullying, harassment and victimisation policy which clearly states its zero tolerance to such behaviours along with the agreement for a Groupwide flexible working policy.\n\nFurther, the Group is committed to treating employees at all levels with respect and consideration, to investing in their development and to ensuring that their careers are not constrained by discrimination or arbitrary barriers.\n\nThe Anglo American Code of Conduct is supported by an underlying framework of policies and procedures which provide specific guidance to employees on the behaviour required to reinforce the Group's values and uphold the Group's specific commitments to prioritise safety, health and the environment; treat people with care and respect, conduct business with integrity and protect its physical assets and information. The Code of Conduct and accompanying policies can be accessed via the Group's website.\n\nIn addition to meeting legal requirements, all Anglo American suppliers must adhere to the Responsible Sourcing Standard for Suppliers, which is available on the Group's website and referenced in contracts.\n\nThe Business Integrity Policy and associated 11 Prevention of Corruption Procedures set out the Group's anti-bribery and corruption commitment by clearly stating that the Group will neither give nor accept bribes, nor permit others to do so in its name. The policy sets out the standards of conduct required at every level within Anglo American, including subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, on the part of those with which the Group does business and those who work on the Group's behalf, in combating corrupt behaviour of all types.\n\nThe policy and procedures have been translated into the main languages that are used across the Group's operations. A dedicated team, operating within a broader risk management and business assurance team oversees the implementation of the Code of Conduct and Business Integrity Policy. They work with the Group legal function, senior managers in the business units and corporate functions; and provide guidance and support with the implementation and monitoring of said procedures, managing and identifying bribery and corruption risks and provide online and face-to-face training for relevant employees, including those in high-risk roles. The internal audit team regularly provide assurance on the effectiveness of the anti-bribery and corruption controls that support adherence to the policy and associated procedures.\n\nThe Group's whistleblowing facility YourVoice is available to employees and external stakeholders to confidentially report concerns including business integrity, ethical, legal, supplier relationship, safety and health, and human resources issues.\n\nThe Group has an intranet called Eureka! and an employee app called Engage, launched in 2020, which help employees to connect, communicate and collaborate more effectively.\n\n## Political donations\n\nNo political donations were made during 2020. Anglo American has an established policy of not making donations to, or incurring expenses for the benefit of any political party in any part of the world, including any political party or political organisation as defined in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.\n\n## Additional information for shareholders\n\nSet out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Company's current Articles and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act) required as a result of the implementation of the Takeover Directive in English law. This is a summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further information is required.\n\n## Dividends and distributions\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may, by ordinary resolution, from time to time declare final dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies such payment.\n\nThe Board may withhold payment of all, or any part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the Company's shares, from a person with a 0.25% interest or more (as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been served with a notice after failing to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act.\n\n## Rights and obligations attaching to shares\n\nThe rights and obligations attaching to the shares are set out in the Articles.\n\nThe Articles may only be changed by a special resolution passed by the shareholders.\n\n## Voting\n\nSubject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached by or in accordance with the Articles to any class of shares, on a show of hands every member who is present in person at a general meeting shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is the holder. It is, and has been for some years, the Company's practice to hold a poll on every resolution at shareholder meetings.\n\nWhere shares are held by trustees/nominees in respect of the Group's employee share plans and the voting rights attached to such shares are not directly exercisable by the employees, it is the Company's practice that such rights are not exercised by the relevant trustee/nominee.\n\nUnder the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting.\n\nA member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A member that is a corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a general meeting or class meeting as a corporate representative. Where a shareholder appoints more than one corporate representative in respect of its shareholding, but in respect of different shares, those corporate representatives can act independently of each other, and validly vote in different ways.",

        "page_content": "## Other information\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Restrictions on voting\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nNo member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her to vote either personally or by proxy at a shareholders' meeting, or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to shareholders' meetings, if any call or other sum presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she has been served with a notice after failing to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act.\n\n## Issue of shares\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act relating to authority and preemption rights and of any resolution of the Company in a UK general meeting, all unissued shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the directors and they may allot, grant options over, or otherwise dispose of them to such persons at such times, and on such terms, as they think proper.\n\n## Shares in uncertificated form\n\nAny share or class of shares of the Company may be issued or held (including any shares or class of shares held on the South African Branch Register or any other overseas branch register of the members of the Company) on such terms, or in such a way, that: title to it or them is not, or must not be, evidenced by a certificate; or it or they may or must be transferred wholly or partly without a certificate. The directors have power to take such steps as they think fit in relation to: the evidencing of and transfer of title to uncertificated shares (including in connection with the issue of such shares); any records relating to the holding of uncertificated shares; the conversion of certificated shares into uncertificated shares; or the conversion of uncertificated shares into certificated shares. The Company may by notice to the holder of a share require that share: if it is uncertificated, to be converted into certificated form; and if it is certificated, to be converted into uncertificated form, to enable it to be dealt with in accordance with the Articles.\n\nIf: the Articles give the directors power to take action, or require other persons to take action, in order to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares; and uncertificated shares are subject to that power, but the power is expressed in terms which assume the use of a certificate or other written instrument, the directors may take such action as is necessary or expedient to achieve the same results when exercising that power in relation to uncertificated shares. The directors may take such action as they consider appropriate to achieve the sale, transfer, disposal, forfeiture, re-allotment or surrender of an uncertificated share or otherwise to enforce a lien in respect of it. This may include converting such share to certificated form. Unless the directors resolve otherwise, shares which a member holds in uncertificated form must be treated as separate holdings from any shares which that member holds in certificated form. A class of shares must not be treated as two classes simply because some shares of that class are held in certificated form and others are held in uncertificated form.\n\n## Deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nVotes are exercisable at a general meeting of the Company in respect of which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nSubject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding, or representing by proxy, at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.\n\nAll transfers of shares that are in certificated form may be effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to the directors and may be under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of shareholders. All transfers of shares registered on the main register of members that are in uncertificated form may be effected by means of the CREST system. All transfers of uncertified shares registered on the branch register of members in South Africa may be effected via the Transfer Secretary.\n\nThe directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it:\n\n- (a) is in respect of only one class of share\n- (b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do).\n\nThe directors may decline to register any transfer of shares in certificated form unless: the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; the instrument of transfer is lodged (duly stamped if required) at the Transfer Office accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) or such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer or, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on the transferor's behalf, the authority of that person to do so; and it is fully paid. The directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly.\n\nIf the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send the refusal to the allottee or the transferee within two months after the date on which the letter of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company.\n\nA shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares to take place.\n\n## Directors\n\nDirectors shall not be fewer than 5 nor more than 18 in number. A director is not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification. The Company may by ordinary resolution increase or reduce the maximum or minimum number of directors.\n\n## Powers of directors\n\nSubject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions given by special resolution, the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company.\n\nThe Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, property and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security, for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.\n\nThe Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, but no dividend shall be payable in excess of the amount recommended by the directors.\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Articles and to the rights attaching to any shares, any dividends or other monies payable on or in respect of a share may be paid in such currency as the directors may determine. The directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him/her to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to shares of the Company. The directors may retain any dividends payable on shares on which the Company has a lien, and may apply the same in or towards satisfaction of the debts, liabilities or engagements in respect of which the lien exists.\n\n## Appointment and replacement of directors\n\nThe directors may from time to time appoint one or more directors. The Board may appoint any person to be a director (so long as the total number of directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles). Any such director shall hold office only until the next AGM and shall then be eligible for election.\n\nThe Articles provide that at each AGM all those directors who have been in office for three years or more since their election, or last re-election, shall retire from office. In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election. However, in accordance with the Code, all directors will be subject to annual re-election.",

In aggregate, this financing is considered significant to the Group and in the event of a takeover (change of control) of the Company, these contracts may be cancelled, become immediately payable or be subject to acceleration.\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business the Group's subsidiaries enter into a number of other commercial agreements, some of which would alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company. None of these are considered by the Group to be significant to the Group as a whole.\n\n## Purchases of own shares\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2020, authority was given for the Company to purchase, in the market, up to 204.7 million ordinary shares of 54 86 /91 US cents each. This authority will expire at the 2021 AGM and, in accordance with usual practice, a resolution to renew it for another year will be proposed.\n\nOn 25 July 2019, the Company announced its intention to return up to $1 billion to shareholders through an on-market irrevocable and nondiscretionary share buyback programme (the 'Programme'). The Programme started in July 2019 and ended in March 2020. This additional return recognises the resilience of the Company's balance sheet, and the Board's confidence in funding the Company's portfolio of highly attractive near and medium term growth opportunities. The Programme returned to shareholders a total of $0.8 billion in 2019 and $0.2 billion in 2020, with the programme having concluded on 2 March 2020.\n\nDetails of the shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled under the Programme during the financial period are set out below.

Copies of these indemnities are open for inspection at the Company's registered office. Given the current circumstances, copies of the indemnities will be available to members for inspection on request. Requests should be sent by email to Cosec.Admin@angloamerican.com.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Richard Price\n\nGroup General Counsel and Company Secretary 24 February 2021",

In order to register for these services, UK shareholders should contact the UK Registrars or log on to\n\nwww.shareview.co.uk and follow the on-screen instructions. It will be necessary to have a shareholder reference number when registering, which is shown on share certificates, dividend tax vouchers and proxy cards.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are declared and paid in US dollars to shareholders with registered addresses in all countries except the UK, eurozone countries and South Africa where they are paid in sterling, euros and South African rand respectively. Shareholders outside South Africa may elect to receive their dividends in US dollars.\n\nShareholders with bank accounts in the UK or South Africa can have their cash dividends credited directly to their own accounts. Shareholders should contact the relevant Registrar or Transfer Secretary to make use of this facility. South African branch register shareholders would need South African exchange control approval to mandate their dividends to an account outside South Africa.\n\nThe Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), which enables shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends into purchasing Anglo American shares. Details of the DRIP and how to join are available from Anglo American's UK Registrars and South African Transfer Secretaries and on the Group's website.\n\n## ShareGift\n\nThe Company supports ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme administered by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation (registered charity number 1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders with very small numbers of shares which might be considered uneconomic to sell are able to donate them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift, the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of charities. For those shareholders who wish to use ShareGift, transfer forms are available from the Registrars and further details of the scheme can be found on the website www.sharegift.org .\n\n## Share dealing service\n\nTelephone, internet and postal share dealing services have been arranged through Equiniti, providing a simple way for European residents to buy or sell Anglo American shares. For telephone transactions call 0345 603 7037 during normal office hours and for internet dealing log on to\n\nwww.shareview.co.uk/dealing .

For further details on the postal dealing service call 0371 384 2248 (or +44 (0) 121 415 7172 from overseas).\n\n## Unsolicited mail\n\nUnder the Companies Act, the Company is obliged to make the share register available upon request on payment of the appropriate fee. Because of this, some shareholders may receive unsolicited mail. If you wish to limit the receipt of addressed marketing mail you can register with the Mailing Preference Service (MPS). The quickest way to register with the MPS is via the website: www.mpsonline.org.uk . Alternatively you can register by telephone on: 020 7291 3310, or by email to: mps@dma.org.uk, or by writing to MPS Freepost LON20771, London W1E 0ZT.",

The use of those generic terms herein is for convenience only, and is in no way indicative of how the Anglo American Group or any entity within it is structured, managed or controlled. Anglo American subsidiaries, and their management, are responsible for their own day-to-day operations, including but not limited to securing and maintaining all relevant licences and permits, operational adaptation and implementation of Group policies, management, training and any applicable local grievance mechanisms. Anglo American produces Groupwide policies and procedures to ensure best uniform practices and standardisation across the Anglo American Group but is not responsible for the day to day implementation of such policies. Such policies and procedures constitute prescribed minimum standards only. Group operating subsidiaries are responsible for adapting those policies and procedures to reflect local conditions where appropriate, and for implementation, oversight and monitoring within their specific businesses.\n\n## Forward-looking statements and third-party information\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American's financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource estimates) and environmental, social and corporate governance goals and aspirations, are forward-looking statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American, or industry results, to be materially di/fferent from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause Anglo American's actual results, performance or achievements to di/ffer materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery rates and other operational capabilities, safety, health or environmental incidents, the e/ffects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the outcome of litigation or regulatory proceedings, the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transportation infrastructure, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of su/fficient credit, the e/ffects of inflation, political uncertainty and economic conditions in relevant areas of the world, the actions of competitors, activities by courts, regulators and governmental authorities such as in relation to permitting or forcing closure of mines and ceasing of operations or maintenance of Anglo American's assets and changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts over land and resource ownership rights and such other risk factors identified in the section of this document titled 'Managing Risk E/ffectively'. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Anglo American expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Botswana Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulations) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing in this document should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Anglo American will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.\n\nCertain statistical and other information about Anglo American included in this document is sourced from publicly available third-party sources. As such, it has not been independently verified and presents the views of those third parties, though these may not necessarily correspond to the views held by Anglo American and Anglo American expressly disclaims any responsibility for, or liability in respect of, such information.\n\nDesigned and produced by SALTERBAXTER MSL www.salterbaxter.com\n\nThis document is printed on Vision Superior which has been independently certified according to the rules of the Forest Stewardship Council \u00ae (FSC).\n\nPrinted in the UK by Pureprint using its pureprint \u00ae environmental printing technology, and vegetable inks were used throughout.
