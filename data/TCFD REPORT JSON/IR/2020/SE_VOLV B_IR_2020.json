Together with business partners and suppliers, we supported our customers through all stages of the crisis. We handled dramatic fluctuations in demand while taking decisive steps forward towards tomorrow's fossil-free transport system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe demonstrated that we have significantly improved our volume and cost flexibility, which were crucial factors behind our earnings resilience in 2020. Despite a loss of almost SEK 100 billion in revenues, we were able to deliver an adjusted operating income of SEK 28.6 billion with a margin of 8.4%. I would like to thank all my colleagues and our business partners for their fantastic efforts in very difficult circumstances.\n\nAfter several years of high activity levels, we entered 2020 well prepared to handle lower demand, but no one could have foreseen a situation where, within a few days, we stopped large parts of our global production system and were forced to temporarily lay off tens of thousands of employees for several weeks due to the global Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith health and safety as the highest priority, we focused on our colleagues and customers, on our cash flow and our costs. Thanks to the great commitment of our employees and business partners, we were able to help our customers keep their businesses running, which in many cases are so crucial for society to function, such as securing food and medical supplies and other socially critical activities. At the same time, we reduced other activities to a minimum to create flexibility and room to maneuver.\n\nWhen it then became possible to restart production, we worked closely with our suppliers to keep pace with the recovery in demand. The way we have handled - and continue to handle - this crisis has made me even more convinced of the power that exists in the Volvo Group to both cope with and drive change. We have shown great volume  flexibility,  which  has  been  possible  thanks  to  the  great competence and the fantastic commitment of colleagues all over the world and a good collaboration with our business partners. The crisis has also shown the importance of being able to act quickly, dare to make decisions and take responsibility locally and regionally. We will continue our path of decentralization, so that those closest to our customers and other partners in the value chain also have a mandate to take the right initiatives and decisions.\n\nIn our truck business, we could see that our customers' activity levels recovered gradually during the summer when the first wave of restrictions was eased to later in the year return to about the same level as in 2019 in most markets. We first noted a recovery in the service business when the utilization of customer fleets returned, which contributed to increased optimism among customers and was then followed by an increase in demand for new trucks. In total, this meant that net sales in the truck business amounted to SEK 208 billion (277) with an adjusted operating margin of 8.3% (11.4).\n\nConstruction activity also gradually improved in most markets after the closures in the spring. During the year we continued to strengthen our position with increased market shares in China, the largest market in the world that had very good growth during the year. Volvo CE's net sales ended at SEK 81 billion (89). The adjusted operating margin was 12.4% (13.4).\n\nVolvo Buses was hit hard by the effects of the pandemic. Restrictions meant that the coach business basically stopped completely in all major markets. City bus operations held up better, but net sales for 2020 decreased to SEK 20 billion (31) with an adjusted operating margin of -2.2% (4.3).\n\nVolvo Penta continued to be successful thanks to its innovative power and ability to take advantage of the Group's technology. Volvo Penta reached net sales of SEK 12 billion (13) and an adjusted operating margin of 12.2% (14.1).\n\nThe  importance  of  our  customer  financing  operations  in  Volvo Financial Services is particularly clear in difficult times. Proactive work to support customers meant that the vast majority were able to get",

        "page_content": "through the most difficult months during the pandemic and that we were able to keep credit losses down. When activity in the economies increased again, our customers' ability to pay gradually improved. Despite a challenging year, VFS generated an adjusted operating income of SEK 1,606 M (2,766) and a return on equity of 8.3% (15.0).\n\nThroughout the year, we worked to adjust our activity level, and during the second half of the year in particular, we also focused on converting  temporary  cost  savings  into  structural  measures,  to ensure that we have good room for maneuver in a time that is still characterized by great uncertainty. This has meant difficult decisions and that colleagues unfortunately had to leave the Group. I would like to thank our labor representatives for a constructive dialogue in this work.\n\nIn total, the Volvo Group made an operating income of SEK 27.5 billion  and  the  operating  cash  flow  in  the  Industrial  Operations amounted to 18.5 billion. We have a strong financial position, which makes it possible for us to both invest in our future and return capital to our shareholders. The Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend of SEK 6.00 per share and an extra dividend of SEK 9.00 per share.\n\nAlthough uncertainty is still considerable in the short term, there is no doubt that demand for both transport and infrastructure will continue to grow in the long term. It is a development driven by factors such as population growth, urbanization, a growing affluent middle class and increasing e-commerce. It is also clear that we need to meet that demand with sustainable solutions. Our longterm ambition is to offer transport and infrastructure solutions that are 100% safe, 100% fossil-free and 100% more efficient than today. Safer because we always put people at the center, and we cannot accept a situation where more than one million people die every year in traffic accidents. Fossil-free because climate change is the biggest challenge of our time. More efficient because we can both help our customers save money and at the same time reduce the environmental impact by improving the efficiency of our transport and logistics systems. It is by delivering on this clear direction that the Volvo Group will continue to be successful.\n\nSustainability in a broad perspective is an integral part of our business. This applies to what business we do and in what way we conduct our business. During the year, we further strengthened our work with the principles of the UN Global Compact regarding business ethics, human rights, labor law and the environment. We have once again emphasized our commitment to the climate agreement adopted in Paris, and in order to be transparent about developments, we are joining the Science Based Targets initiative. To further improve the reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities, the Volvo Group supports the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and will continue to develop the company's reporting in accordance with its recommendations.\n\nA key part of achieving our ambitions in the climate area is about developing and offering electric trucks, buses, construction equipment and drivelines. The change takes place here and now. The interest from our customers is great, and they see the benefits of working with vehicles and machines that drastically reduce emissions and offer a quieter and better working environment for both drivers and the environment. Our roadmap is clear. We now also electrify our heavy-duty truck offers and take it step by step in all business areas. In the next few years, we will see electrification take off segment by segment, market by market and region by region. This is an opportunity for us to advance our positions further. An important key is our modular vehicle architecture that allows us to put either an internal combustion engine or an electric driveline in the same chassis. In this way, we reduce development time, costs\n\nand can enter the market faster with new offers. In addition, we can manufacture different variants on the same assembly line, which again reduces costs and enables us to scale up volumes quickly when conditions are right. Last but not least, we have very strong relationships with many of our customers who want to make this exciting journey with us and our partners. It is the power and trust in these collaborations that will make the shift take off.\n\nWe have a leading position and in 2020 we took further steps in several segments. Customers in both Europe and the US took electric distribution trucks from both Volvo Trucks and Renault Trucks into operation in their daily operations. Volvo Trucks is taking the next step this year and is also launching heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe. This way, customers are offered a complete program of electric  trucks.  Volume  production  is  planned  for  2022.  Mack Trucks introduced electric refuse trucks, Volvo Buses began deliveries of the largest order for electric buses in the Nordic region - 145 fully electric  articulated  buses  to  Gothenburg,  Sweden,  Volvo  Penta developed a driveline for firefighting vehicles and Volvo Construction Equipment began delivering electric compact excavators and compact wheel loaders. This is just to name a few examples.\n\nThe introduction of connected, electric and in some segments also autonomous solutions, calls for a holistic approach, where we take even greater responsibility for vehicles, battery and energy systems, uptime services, maintenance and repairs, financing and more. This opens up for new discussions with our customers about how we can work together to make the logistics chain even more efficient. Already today, we offer our customers production equipment - vehicles and machines with associated service - as a service at a fixed cost per month. Tomorrow, there will be a wider range of business models, from one-time transactions to situations where we offer our customers transport as a service. In this landscape, partnerships with other leading companies are an important component. During the past year, we signed agreements with Daimler Truck AG to form a joint venture for the development and large-scale production of fuel cells for electric vehicles and other applications, as well as with Isuzu Motors for the formation of a strategic alliance and the divestment of UD Trucks.\n\nThe past year really highlighted the need to be able to both perform here and now and at the same time transform and build for the future. I am proud of what we have achieved and also of the drive in the organization to constantly make things better. It is thanks to fantastic people that we will continue the journey of both improving profitability over the business cycle and developing tomorrow's climate-smart and competitive transport and infrastructure solutions.\n\nMartin Lundstedt President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

In many aspects it is becoming a better place to live in with a global decrease in poverty, increase in life expectancy and declining cost for renewable energy. But there are also challenges. The need to drive sustainable development and to grow within the planetary boundaries is greater than ever.\n\n## AN INCREASINGLY URBAN AND CONNECTED PLANET\n\nThe world's population is growing quickly and the world is becoming more urbanized. By 2030, it is expected that two thirds of the global population will be living in cities. Urbanization is a global megatrend - with many different faces and implications for transportation and infrastructure. Projections show that urbanization combined with the overall growth of the world population could add another 2.5 billion people to the urban community by 2050, equivalent to today's combined population of China and India. This development will have both environmental and social implications. Looking ten years into the future, we believe that sustainability is a pre-requisite for doing business. People shop online and more and more people prefer using services rather than owning products. More power has shifted from producers to consumers and expectations on user experience are extremely high. Companies use data to provide seamless and individualized services and products.\n\n## Factors expected to drive change\n\n## In 2030:\n\n- \u00b7 8.6 billion people share the planet, with 70% living in cities.\n- \u00b7 4 out of 5 economic superpowers are found in Asia.\n- \u00b7  90% of all people have access to the internet.\n- \u00b7  Effects from climate change are clearly visible.\n- \u00b7 Consumer power is increasing and  consumers are getting used to seamless and customized solutions in digital channels.\n\n## What will this mean for business?\n\n- \u00b7 Increased demand for transport and infrastructure solutions.\n- \u00b7 Being sustainable is a must.\n- \u00b7 An increasing number of consumers prefer utilizing services as opposed to owning products.\n- \u00b7 Companies owning customer interfaces and relevant data thrive as they can provide seamless and individualized services and products.\n- \u00b7 More power resides with the buyer. B2B (business-tobusiness) and B2C (business-to-consumer) have  merged into B2P  (business-to-people).",

Our commitment to achieving development without exceeding the planetary boundaries includes all 17 SDGs. Several topics, such as equality and fighting corruption are universal for all enterprises. Beyond these universal responsibilities, we identify closer connections and impacts from our business and operations in a number of goals.\n\nIn the Volvo Group, we describe our sustainability work in the areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate - reducing emissions from our own operations and value chain as well as from the use of our products. We focus on increased fuel and energy efficiency, electrification and alternative fuels.\n- \u00b7   Resources - utilizing transports and material in the most resourceefficient ways possible. We create value for our customers by providing them with higher uptime and utilization.\n- \u00b7   People - because safety and human rights make up the foundation for   prosperity.\n\nWe highlight some of our activities and their main connections to the SDGs in this report. In addition, in the Sustainability Notes on pages 150-171, we further connect our detailed disclosures to specific targets in the UN's sustainability agenda.\n\n## MOVING INTO THE GOLDEN AGE OF LOGISTICS\n\nAn increasing global population, booming e-commerce and a growing, connected middle class contribute to rising demand for construction and transportation in the future. Climate change, congested cities, hazardous road and working conditions call for future transportation technology and systems solutions that are safer, cleaner and more efficient. The increased need for transport and new infrastructure combined with the rapid development of new technologies provide great opportunities for our industry, which we believe is moving into a golden age of logistics. Looking ahead, we foresee that a new transport landscape will emerge. New technologies and new business models will result in safer, more sustainable and more efficient ways to move goods, material and people.\n\n## Factors expected to drive change\n\n- \u00b7 Electromobility requires total solutions.\n- \u00b7 Autonomous solutions give radical efficiency potential.\n- \u00b7 Digitalization and connectivity enable  optimization.\n- \u00b7  Sustainability equals profitability.\n\n## What will this mean for our industry?\n\n- \u00b7 Customer structure changes, increased importance of large customers.\n- \u00b7 From standardized  products to sustain able and tailor-made end-to-end solutions.\n- \u00b7 Different eco-systems  delivering customer value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

During this period, there was one major acquisition - 45% of Dongfeng Commercial Vehicles (DFCV) in China in 2015.\n\nThe period between 2016 and 2018 was characterized by reinforcement of the performance culture evidenced by a more\n\ndecentralized organization and a regionalized value-chain approach. The improved performance, with increased profitability and further customer focus developed into the current focus - Perform and Transform.\n\nPerform and Transform are not sequential events, they need to be run in parallel. To stay relevant and profitable, driving both current business performance and the transformation to meet future demands is our key focus going forward.\n\nThe continuous streamlining of the Group's business portfolio has also inclu ded the divestment of Volvo Cars (1999), Volvo Aero (2012), Volvo Rents (2014) and 75.1% of Wireless Car (2019).\n\n## 1999-2011\n\n## ACQUISITION-DRIVEN GROWTH\n\nScale, synergies and geographical expansion.\n\n## MAJOR ACQUISITIONS\n\n## 2001\n\nRenault Trucks and Mack Trucks\n\n## 2007\n\nNissan Diesel (now UD Trucks)\n\n## 2007\n\n70% of Lingong (SDLG)\n\n## 2007\n\nIngersoll Rand Road  Development\n\n## 2008\n\nVECV (joint venture with Eicher)",

Our focus has been on a gradual and consistent earnings improvement, reduced volatility in earnings and cash flow as well as allocating capital in a disciplined way. We have great assets in our people, products and services as well as production sites and well-established dealer networks. We are in a good position to support our customers. To keep this position and to be able to invest further in new technologies, our focus is on excelling on the basics as well as building resilience.\n\nOur current business will be the base for the Volvo Group in many years to come. The attention is on being agile and flexible in terms of production volumes, to use our common architecture and shared technology (CAST - see page 26) wherever possible and to have continuous  introductions  instead  of  major  launch  projects.  Our quality work is crucial to achieve customer satisfaction and the work of regionalizing our value chain is necessary to give our people the right prerequi sites to serve our customers.\n\nBuilding resilience is key to our long-term profitability. There are more than 2.8 million trucks, buses and machines, produced by the Volvo Group, operating on or off-road. Of those, more than 1.1 million are connected. With this as a base we can extend our service offer and defend or capture market share. Increasing uptime benefits our customers, and a larger service business also improves our  resilience across the business cycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfitability has improved in recent years. In 2020, the adjusted operating margin amounted to 8.4% (11.1), despite the impact from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In 2016-2020 the average adjusted operating margin was 9.1%.

We have made great progress in improving performance in recent years. Going forward, the speed of transformation will increase. Our ambitions are clear:\n\n- \u00b7 More than 50% of Group revenues should come from services and solutions by 2030\n- \u00b7 More than 35% of our vehicle sales should be electric by 2030\n- \u00b7 We will lead by example with a world-class, sustainable in-house logistics system by 2025\n- \u00b7 We will implement at least 100 transport and infrastructure solutions together with our customers by 2025.\n\n## Transform to provide value\n\nWe transform our business to provide even greater value to our customers and respond to the need for sustainable transport solutions that are safe, fossil free and more productive. The drivers of transformation within our industry are clear. Today's trucks are not used to their full capacity due to congestion, resting time regulations, and low fill rates. A fully-loaded truck operating on diesel is one of the most energy-efficient ways of transporting goods on our roads with current infrastructure, but there is no doubt that electromobility and alternative fuels will be crucial going forward, as we aim to provide even more sustainable transport solutions and meet future more stringent CO 2 regulations.\n\nWhen it comes to safety aspects, it is a fact that people die in traffic and human error is by far the main reason. It is also a fact that people and goods spend too much time in congestion. Our daily life\n\nBattery-electric vehicles are a good solution for city distribution, city buses, regional haulage and similar applications. For use cases with heavier loads or longer distances, hydrogen fuel cells will be an important technology. The two technologies complement each other, and both will be needed in order for us to build the sustainable transport system of tomorrow. '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMartin Lundstedt, President and CEO\n\npattern  and  non-optimized  infrastructure  and  logistics  models result both in temporary congestions and at other times heavily unutilized road networks. The last couple of years we have continuously invested in new business models and new technologies to be able to offer safer, more sustainable and more productive solutions to our customers. Another advantage is that our industrial footprint is easily adapted to manufacture vehicles with different drivelines on existing assembly lines.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for the Volvo Group and to get real traction and impact, the focus is on accelerating the commercialization of new technologies and business models. This is when the real change happens.\n\n## FAST-PACED INTRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur fast-paced introduction of electric trucks and buses has started. We are building on the experience from the city bus applications, where we have more than 10 years of experience from electrification - starting with hybridelectric solutions and building that into battery-electric buses. On the truck side, Volvo Trucks, Renault Trucks and Mack Trucks started series production of medium-duty trucks for important segments such as distribution, waste and recycling as well as urban construction in 2020. The Group will continue its step-by-step roll-out of products and solutions for all relevant truck segments: container haulage, heavy construction, regional haul and eventually also the really heavy-duty long haul segment, which will be a combination of battery-electric (BEV) and fuel cell-electric vehicles (FCEV). We are also reinforcing our capabilities and offerings when it comes to energy services.",

By delivering customer value we deliver value for ourselves and our stakeholders. Our customers contribute to prosperity by transporting people and goods as well as providing societies with infrastructure that advance development. Our aim is to support our customers by providing offers that increase their productivity, secure uptime and increase fuel efficiency, which drive their financial performance and reduce their impact on the environment.\n\n## REUSE\n\nWe strive to increase material efficiency and reduce energy use. In this work, we incorporate more recycled materials, recover heat and recycle waste. Our waste management is further described on page 158. Extending service life and operational uptime of assets is an important element of increased circularity and resource efficiency. Here, the main elements are to service, maintain and repair to increase the utilization rate of all materials in the products. As we increase our service-based business, the main output is uptime and availability of machines and vehicles. This is a prerequisite to focus even more on recyclability and remanufacturing. See examples on page 32.\n\n## RETAIL AND  SERVICE\n\nOur global network of dealers and service  centers staffed by competent and service- oriented personnel are key factors for customer satisfaction and success. The brand organizations within the Volvo Group support customers via efficient dealer workshops, and through service and maintenance agreements. With our service contracts and connected solutions, customers know when their vehicle or machine is due for service and what the cost will be for maintenance and repairs. Customers can bundle their vehicle, financing and other service purchases for a total solution. We work together with our retail organization through continuous improvement and dealer development programs to ensure our customers get the best possible service.\n\n## PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\nFulfilling our customers' needs and improving their profitability and environmental performance forms the basis of our product and service development. Product development is also influenced by legislation, changes in society and new technologies. There are strong trends such as automation, electromobility and connectivity that need to be balanced with investments in development of current technologies. Examples of customer solutions that are improv ing safety, efficiency and environmental performance are found on pages 24-36. Additional information about environmental and safety performance are found in the Sustainability Notes on pages 156 and 164.\n\n## PURCHASING\n\nLong-term cooperation with suppliers drives efficiency, quality and responsible behavior throughout the value chain. The Volvo Group is aiming for purchasing excellence, placing high demands on ourselves and our supply chain partners. We have both global and local supply chains to deliver components, parts and complete services and systems.\n\nWhen developing a robust supplier base, we look at a wide range of opportunities and risks. During 2020, we continued to prepare supply chain partners for new needs in the transformation towards carbon neutral products and  operations. We have also invited suppliers to collaborate for securing sustain able minerals. Read about social and environmental supplier assessments on page 167.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PRODUCTION AND  LOGISTICS\n\nOur global industrial and logistics  system efficiently uses continuous improvement to meet internal targets and deliver on customer expectations. The industrial system consists of capital-intensive component factories as well as labor intensive assembly plants. The component factories supply the Group's needs on a global basis, whereas assembly plants, in most cases, are located close to end-markets to cater for local needs and specifications and shorter delivery time.

Construction equipment operate at sites all around the world, us having delivered about 650,000 machines in the last ten years. For our customers, uptime is everything. Regardless if it is a customer that owns one single truck or a fleet of trucks, if they are a public transport provider or a coach owner, a construction entrepreneur or a quarry owner; their performance depends on reliable products and services that meet the needs of their business. The Volvo Group has a long heritage of developing smart solutions to boost their performance.\n\n## FOR EMPLOYEES\n\nThe Group's almost 100,000 employees are our most important asset. Employee engagement and a performance culture based on customer success, trust and passion are critical for the Group to fulfill its mission. The Group strives to offer competitive employment terms and benefits as well as a stimulating, safe and healthy work environment. In 2020 we paid SEK 40,887 M in salaries and remuneration.\n\n## FOR SOCIETY\n\nOur products and services make societies function. Our customers operate bus lines so that people can get to work, they transport food and industrial goods and they build infrastructure such as roads and hospitals. Furthermore, road transport directly creates millions of jobs around the world. We also contribute to the local economy by being a major employer in many communities, providing both direct and indirect employment. In 2020 the Group paid SEK 9,270 M in social costs, SEK 3,631 M in pension costs and SEK 4,927 M in income taxes, in total SEK 17, 828 M. We also pay customs duties as well as property and energy taxes.\n\n## FOR SUPPLIERS\n\nA solid supplier base and professional partnerships are essential for customer success. The Volvo Group provides both income and employment for a large number of companies and in many societies around the world. Purchased goods and services is the Volvo Group's single largest expense and in 2020 we bought goods and services for SEK 232,861 M.\n\n## FOR CREDITORS\n\nA long-term competitive business requires access to capital to be able to invest. The Volvo Group strives to ensure that the capital is used in the best possible way and to assure debt providers with the financial strength to secure proceeds and repayment. In 2020 the Volvo Group paid its creditors in the Industrial Operations SEK 1,102 M in interest.\n\n## FOR  SHARE HOLDERS\n\nThe Volvo Group strives to generate value for its shareholders. This is achieved through a positive share price development and payout of dividends. From 2015-2020 the price for the Volvo B share increased by 127%. Shareholders normally receive a certain portion of the retained earnings in the form of a dividend, after consideration has been given to the Group's need for capital for continued development according to its strategies. For 2020 the Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend of SEK 6.00 per share and an extra dividend of SEK 9.00 per share, in total SEK 30,502 M.\n\n## FOR THE VOLVO GROUP\n\nA significant portion of generated capital is normally transferred back into the business. The capital is used for investments that will strengthen competitiveness and create longterm value for the Group and its stakeholders. In 2020, the Volvo Group invested SEK 16.8 billion in R&D and another SEK 5.7 billion in properties, plants and equipment, in total SEK 22.5 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For product  development  this  means  developing  productive  and  fuelefficient solutions for our customers. In production we strive to have the highest quality, which also requires a high standard from our suppliers. Our distribution and service network secures availability and uptime for the customers. We use a circular mindset and adopt responsible business behavior to build trust and make sure our products contribute to prosperity.\n\nWe analyze the segments and applications our customers operate in to find the best current solutions, capture future opportunities and prepare for market changes. Our research projects, in collaboration with our customers and other partners, are a vital part of product development when we prepare for meeting future demands.\n\n## Create value for our customers\n\nFrom our day-to-day work with customers and through interviews, customer satisfaction surveys and materiality analysis, we know that our customers put the highest value on productivity, uptime and fuel  efficiency.  Future  technologies  provide  great  potential  for increased productivity for our customers. To secure uptime, new vehicles developed within the Volvo Group are equipped with connected devices to be able to download updates, schedule services and prevent unplanned stops. More than 1,1 million vehicles and machines are connected, which is important for us to be able to achieve the goals of increasing efficiency and minimizing environmental impact, as well as making our roads safer.\n\nsince this has a major impact on both the environment and our customers' profitability. For instance, we offer vehicles that can run on liquefied natural gas (LNG) or biogas as well as battery-electric vehicles.\n\nWe also continue to drive the performance of the internal combustion engine. In 2020, Volvo Trucks launched a new Volvo FH with  the  second  generation  of  the  fuel-saving  I-Save  package, which can cut fuel costs by up to 10% compared to the older model without I-Save. Read more about Volvo FH with I-Save on page 26. The truck was part of an extensive renewal from Volvo Trucks, which introduced four new heavy-duty trucks with a strong focus on the driver environment, safety and productivity. The four truck models, Volvo FH, FH16, FM and FMX, represent about two thirds of Volvo Trucks' deliveries.\n\n'We are really proud of this forward-looking investment. Our aim is to be our customers' best business partner by making them even more  competitive  and  help  them  attract  the  best  drivers  in  an increasingly tough market,' says Roger Alm, President Volvo Trucks.\n\n## Measure success\n\nCustomer satisfaction is the true measure of success. Our aspiration is to have leading customer satisfaction for all brands in their segments. Through world-wide surveys, each brand organization within the Volvo Group tracks customer satisfaction and brand image perception. The data is an important part of understanding our customers' needs and continuous improvement. Research and studies are performed by leading market research companies and carried out with decision makers among customers and non customers.\n\nIncreased fuel efficiency and adaption to renewable fuels and electrified vehicles and machines are central in our product development\n\n## SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS\n\n'Help me maintain my vehicle'\n\n'Keep my vehicle available'\n\n'Maximize the use of my vehicle'\n\n'Maximize the use of my fleet'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVehicle parts services 1\n\nVehicle uptime services\n\nVehicle productivity services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFleet productivity services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMobility services\n\n'Provide\n\nme with the\n\nright transport\n\ncapacity when\n\nI need it'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCING AND INSURANCE, INCLUDING USAGE-BASED MODELS\n\n## CONNECTED PLATFORM\n\n## VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT\n\nThere are different business models for different customers.

In order to have a rolling fleet that is completely fossil free by 2050, it is our ambition that all Volvo Group products delivered from 2040 should enable our customers to go fossil free. Even when the majority of vehicles are electric, we foresee use cases for internal com bustion engines (ICE) running on sustainable biofuels or other fossil-free fuels. As illustrated below, we expect a gradual shift into electric vehicles, both battery-electric and fuel cellelectric. Our ambition is that by 2030, electric vehicles should account for at least 35% of our vehicle sales. On the way towards decarbonized transport, there will be legislative milestones when it comes to CO 2 across the globe. We continue to invest in combustion engines and aftertreatment systems in order to increase efficiency, meet the legislative milestones and stay competitive. In addition to focusing on tailpipe emissions, we are working with and encouraging our suppliers and partners to introduce fossil-free materials (CO 2 -free steel, plastics and rubber) for the development of our products and solutions. We are also continuing the work to reduce emissions from our manufacturing operations by increasing the share of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency.

Therefore, our focus is on the development of products and solutions that reduce the CO 2 footprint for our customers. We also make significant efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions from our own operations.\n\nH2ACCELERATE\n\n## NEW COLLABORATION FOR ZERO EXHAUST EMISSION HYDROGEN TRUCKING\n\nIn December, the Volvo Group, Daimler Truck AG, IVECO, OMV and Shell committed to work together to help create the conditions for the mass-market roll-out of hydrogen trucks in Europe. As a growing number of governments and businesses align on a common vision of a net-zero emissions energy system, the H2Accelerate participants believe that hydrogen is an essential fuel for the complete decarbonization of the truck sector.\n\n## Electric solutions in all business areas\n\nElectrification will be key in the transition towards a fossil-free future. The Volvo Group aims for a fast-paced introduction of fully electric solutions in all its product areas. Electric propulsion allows for zero exhaust emissions in use but is dependent on the CO 2 footprint of the used electricity.\n\nPowered by alternative fuels such as sustainable biofuels and hydrogen, the combustion engine will continue to play a significant role for our customers' ability to reduce CO 2 emissions. We will continue to improve the efficiency of existing technology and we have high expectations for the use of alternative fuels where sustainable supply can be provided.\n\nToday, the transport system and infrastructure industry are to a great extent powered by fossil energy. We are in the beginning of a transition and Volvo Group's product portfolio is broad. We deliver products powered by conventional diesel, fossil-free alternative fuels, or a combination. We are working on electrifying transport and infrastructure solutions and we are investing in new technology development such as hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nVOLVO GROUP AND DAIMLER TRUCK\n\n## FORMATION OF A JOINT VENTURE FOR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF FUEL CELLS\n\nThe Volvo Group and Daimler Truck AG have signed a binding agreement for a joint venture to develop, produce and commercialize fuel-cell systems for use in heavy-duty trucks as the primary focus, as well as other applications. The ambition of both partners is to make the new company a leading global manufacturer of fuel cells, and thus help the world take a major step towards climate-neutral and sustainable transportation by 2050. The joint venture will take advantage of the expertise and extensive experience from several decades of development work on fuel cells at Daimler.\n\n'In the future, the world will be powered by a combination of battery- electric and fuel-cell electric vehicles, along with other renewable fuels to some extent. The formation of our fuel-cell joint venture is an important step in shaping a world we want to live in,' says Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO of the Volvo Group.\n\nThe Volvo Group will acquire 50% of the partnership interests in the joint venture for approximately EUR 0.6 billion on a cash and debt-free basis. Closing of the transaction is expected during the first half of 2021.\n\nVOLVO TRUCKS\n\n## LAUNCH OF A COMPLETE RANGE OF ELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\nIn 2021, hauliers in Europe will be able to order all-electric versions of Volvo's heavy-duty trucks. Volvo Trucks' massive drive towards electrification marks a major step forwards on the road to fossil-free transport.\n\nVolvo Trucks is adding the electric heavy-duty Volvo FH, Volvo FM and Volvo FMX trucks, which will be used for regional transport and urban construction operations in Europe, to the electric line-up. These trucks will have a gross combination weight of up to 44 tons. Depending on the battery configuration the range could be up to 300 km. Sales will begin in 2021 year and volume production will start in 2022.\n\nVolvo Trucks started manufacturing the Volvo FL Electric and Volvo FE Electric in 2019. This means that from 2021 onwards Volvo Trucks will sell a complete range of battery-electric trucks in Europe for distribution, refuse, regional transport and urban construction operations. Volvo Trucks will be offering holistic\n\nsolutions that include route planning, correctly specified vehicles, charging equipment, financing and services. Furthermore, in December 2020 sales of the Volvo VNR Electric, a truck for regional transport, started in North America.\n\n\"By rapidly increasing the number of heavy-duty electric trucks, we want to help our customers and transport buyers to achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. We're determined to continue driving our industry toward a sustainable future,\" says Roger Alm, President Volvo Trucks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Most importantly, both natural gas and biogas can be scaled up today to reduce fossil emissions. When the Volvo FH LNG is powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), CO 2 emissions can be reduced by up to 20% tank to wheel compared to conventional diesel. With liquefied biogas (LBG), the fossil emissions from the tank to wheel can be reduced to virtually zero. For our customers, the gas solution also helps to reduce total cost of ownership as the cost of LNG and LBG is usually lower per mile than diesel. The Volvo FH LNG has a range of up to 1,000 kilometers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCOMMON ARCHITECTURE AND SHARED TECHNOLOGY\n\n## MODULAR SYSTEM APPROACH\n\nBacking the Volvo Group's offers is an accumulated expertise in electrified transport solutions. The solutions are based on the Volvo Group's modular system made possible by applying CAST (Common Architecture and Shared Technology). The Volvo Group develops complete driveline solutions as well as systems and components for the business areas and adapts them to their market and application needs. By utilizing CAST, the Volvo Group can secure economies of scale and reduce the time to market. When developing a new product, we do not have to start from scratch. The Volvo Group was among the first in the world to offer electric buses. Thanks to CAST, we have been able to use these components and systems and ensure that we are now also among the first in the world to offer electrical solutions also for trucks, construction equipment and Volvo Penta. The Volvo Group has a global product development system with engineering resources in different parts of the world, close to customers, to ensure that every product delivers the unique brand value that customers expect.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The CO 2 emissions of a typical long-distance diesel Volvo truck have been reduced by more than 20% since the 1990s. The I-Save solution is the next step in fuel efficiency. By combining the highly efficient Volvo 13-liter Turbo Compound engine and fuel- saving features, such as the map-based I-See, Volvo FH with I-Save cuts fuel costs by up to 10% in long haul operations compared with the older model without I-Save. The powerful engine produces 300 Nm higher torque at low revs. So, less acceleration and fuel is needed to keep a steady speed in highway traffic. Working in combination with I-See, the engine makes it possible to tackle hills and gradients in a higher gear - saving fuel without losing speed. The extra torque also enables a higher average speed, especially notable in hill climbing. The completely self-learning I-See system uses cloud-based map data to analyze the topography and select the optimal gear and speed.\n\nThe difference in fuel consumption is computed by comparing the costs of diesel and AdBlue for I-Save: D13TC Euro 6 step D with the long-haul fuel package, with D13 eSCR Euro 6 step D without the long-haul fuel package. The actual fuel economy varies according to many factors, such as the driver's level of experience, use of cruise control, the vehicle specifications, vehicle load, actual topography and current weather conditions.\n\n## COMMERCIALIZATION IN NORTH AMERICA\n\n## Volvo VNR Electric\n\nVolvo Trucks started piloting the electric regional haul truck Volvo VNR Electric with customers in Southern California in the second half of 2020. In October, Volvo Trucks North America was awarded USD 21.7 M in grants to deploy 70 Volvo VNR Electric trucks in Southern California for regional freight distribution and drayage. This award enables the largest commercial deployment of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks in the US. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Targeted Air Shed Grant Program is providing USD 20 M in funding, supplemented by USD 1.7 M from the South Coast Air Quality Management District for charging infrastructure, to improve air quality in the region. Volvo Trucks will deliver the EPA-funded Volvo VNR Electric trucks to Southern California fleet operators starting in 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, allowing for at least a full year of operation by the end of the project period in 2023. Serial production of the Volvo VNR Electric will begin in 2021. The Volvo VNR Electric is offered with a range of operational solutions such as Volvo Gold Contract which covers all preventive maintenance and repairs, batteries included, as well as flexible financing and insurance solutions from Volvo Financial Services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRENAULT TRUCKS\n\n## ELECTRIC TRUCKS IN DAILY OPERATION\n\nIn November, Renault Trucks delivered three D Wide Z.E. electric trucks to the Carlsberg Group, which will be operated by its Swiss subsidiary, the Feldschl\u00f6sschen Brewery. Carlsberg aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, in particular by using electric trucks. These Renault Trucks D Wide Z.E. are the first of an order from Carlsberg for 20 fully- electric trucks.

VAS adopts a new business model for the Group that promotes Transport-as-a-Service. To do this VAS develops and commercializes holistic industrial autonomous transport solutions that improve productivity, reduce emissions and improve safety. Thanks to their autonomous nature, these solutions also offer process efficiency benefits and improved site efficiency.\n\nThe Volvo Group aims to reduce its environmental footprint by continuous improvements and disruptive innovation - and VAS plays an important part in that work. We believe that electrified and automated commercial vehicles and machines are one part of the solution to create sustainable societies that are also safer and more productive.\n\nVAS is targeting specific industry segments:\n\n- \u00b7  Mines and quarries, industrial materials handling facilities\n- \u00b7  Ports and logistics centers\n- \u00b7  Hub-to-hub highway transportation.\n\n5-10%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase efficiency in transport systems\n\nIncreasing transport efficiency offers opportunities to add sustainable value beyond fuel consumption and electrification. According to some estimates, assets such as trucks, buses and construction equipment are on average used 30% of their life cycles, and the average truck on the road carries 40-50% of its total capacity. Theoretically up to 50% of the transport\n\nis available for more cargo.

This means taking advantage of a wide range of opportunities that will result in reduced logistics costs, emissions and wasted resources.\n\nAs we focus even more on services, our aim is to increase the sales of total transport solutions. While the traditional transactional sales will remain, we offer different business model setups for different customers depending on their needs. More information on different business models is available on page 21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCreating solutions capable of maximizing transport efficiency through advanced automation is the goal of an entire industry. For VAS, it is likely to happen first in confined areas. One solution is called TARA - a complete transport system designed to operate autonomously within a confined area, like a quarry or a mine. With the TARA solutions a complete software and hardware stack, including the autonomous driving capabilities has been developed. TARA consists initially of the TA15 electric hauler (more variants will follow) and all the charging and supporting infrastructure needed to ensure operations are safe and efficient.\n\nThe TARA solution, including the ecosystem for electric and autonomous driving, brings substantial CO 2 reductions. When compared to today's operations it can cut CO 2 by 100% in the hauling part with the TA15 (if using CO 2 -neutral electricity) and up to 85% for the complete site.\n\n31",

With more than 1,1 million connected customer assets, we have the largest number of connected commercial vehicles and machines in the industry. Connectivity is essential to our goals of increasing efficiency and minimizing environmental impact, as  well as making our roads safer.\n\nConnectivity is one of the key technology areas for Volvo Group. Leveraging vehicle data, our solutions enable our customers to lower their costs and to increase their efficiency. Connectivity is also an enabler for Automation and Electromobility - both when it comes to technology and when it comes to services and solutions for these applications. Our solutions will increase transport and resource-efficiency through optimized traffic flows and a higher utilization of existing infrastructure.\n\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY\n\n## STEPS TO INCREASE CIRCULARITY\n\nVolvo Group has identified several business setups to increase circularity. The design phase is critical. We look at five main criteria in the design of new solutions - materials and production, fuel, exhaust emissions, maintenance and end-of-life treatment. For example, avoiding certain materials and substances already in the design phase helps to increase recycling rates of both components and complete vehicles. A typical truck from Volvo can be recycled at around 85% and an excavator to around 95-99% by weight.\n\nIn the production phase, we strive to minimize our CO 2 footprint by increasing energy efficiency and source more renewable energy. In 2020, the Volvo Bus plant in Bor\u00e5s achieved its 100% renewable energy status. Renewable energy accounted for 52% of the Group's total energy consumption in 2020 and the next milestone is to reach 65% by 2025. We also strive to reduce waste and continuously reduce our environmental footprint from our production - read more on page 158.\n\nIn the customer use phase, uptime and utilization of products, components and materials are in focus. Service, maintenance, repairs and remanufacturing are key elements in this phase. Volvo Group's products are made to be durable, and components are made to be remanufactured. One example is gearboxes. A remanufactured gearbox can save 50%, and sometimes up to 80%, of resources used compared to a new one. The saving comes from avoiding processing and refining new materials and the associated energy, water and emissions footprint. Our ambition is to increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour reman business by 60% by 2025 from a baseline in 2018.\n\nAt the end of the useful service life of components or vehicles, we can recover certain materials which directly become new raw material. One example is the recovery of palladium and platinum from scrapped diesel particulate filters. For trucks,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe also buy back complete vehicles to dismantle and use parts in our network of service workshops. Parts that can be refurbished or remanufactured are kept and used and the rest is sent for materials recycling.\n\nVolvo Buses collaborates with Stena Recycling's Battery Loop to reuse batteries for a second life storing renewable energy. When the batteries have served its second life, there is still value left in the battery components and they are recycled by Stena. As electrification accelerates, circularity becomes even more important. In January 2021, the creation of a new business area was announced, Volvo Energy, with the purpose of strengthening business flow of batteries over the life cycle.\n\nThe ambition of the Volvo Group is to use the above and additional elements of circularity and reduce environmental footprint of both products and operations. Today, almost 90% of the CO 2 footprint from raw materials comes from steel, iron, aluminum, rubber and plastics, which makes these the focus areas to collaborate around. Our ambition is to include more recycled materials also in the production of new parts. While a significant share of iron and aluminum are already from recycled material, we also collaborate with suppliers to increase the use of recycled plastics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It enables the connection of trucks and excavators, which increase efficiency and reduces transport emissions. After running successful field tests, a commercial contract was signed with the construction company NCC - a first for this type of service.\n\nEfficient Load Out was tested in a major infrastructure project in Gothenburg,  Sweden in collaboration with NCC. With the digital service, it is possible to secure between 96% and 100% load utilization for each transport, compared to typically 87%. Data shows that 350,000 tons have been excavated and transported in 11,000 trips during the pilot run. The connected process helped reduce the number of trips by 1,600 - and it is expected to save around 8,000 transports once the whole project is completed.\n\nWhen utilizing the system, the excavator operators and truck drivers start by logging in, and then the system gives the excavator operator a notification when there is a truck available for loading nearby. The truck driver is given a signal to drive to the excavator and start the loading - all whilst the excavator measures the weight of the load. When the weight goal is reached, a signal is sent that loading is complete and the truck can drive to its specific destination. The truck driver gets information about how much tonnage has been loaded, what kind of masses it is and what deposit to unload at.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVOLVO BUSES\n\n## Efficient, safe and sustainable public transport\n\nVolvo Buses' Zero City concept includes visions and opportunities to reduce emissions, noise, congestion and accidents.

Safety features  for  vehicles  and  machine  are  key,  but  our  work  also includes a range of engagements with customers and regulatory bodies, as well as road traffic safety and driver training. Visit volvogroup.com/safety for more information.\n\nWith safety, as well as with the environment, we believe in taking a full value chain approach. We work to improve health and safety in our own operations, and we set high standards for our partners in the supply chain. Collaboration, being innovative, lifelong learning, challenging the status quo and being curious drives engagement and improvement work. We strive to increase safety in our operations and have targeted to reduce the accident rate on an aggregated level by at least 50% by 2030, compared to 2019. Safety mindset is also the foundation for health, non-discrimination and other human rights aspects, which there are more details about in the Sustainability Notes on page 150-171.",

Volvo Haul Assist allows articulated haulers to communicate real-time positions to each other, improving hauler traffic flow on jobsites. In early 2020, Volvo Construction Equipment rolled out a new map feature on the Haul Assist application that allows operators to monitor hauler traffic around a jobsite and proactively adjust their driving according to traffic conditions. This update improves productivity and safety thanks to better communication and monitoring between machines.\n\nSAFETY AT VOLVO GROUP\n\n## HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING LOCKDOWNS\n\nVolvo Group were quick to adapt production and make remote work available when the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic became evident. The site in Motherwell, UK had already prepared a team of 30 trained mental health first aiders who were able to promptly provide support. Isolation during the pandemic and especially lockdowns can lead to colleagues feeling isolated, reduce engagement and increase anxiety so the site team used social media, text messaging and a telephone line to provide support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SAFETY FOCUS IN  OPERATIONS\n\nFor those needing to work on site, significant efforts to maintain safe operations have been put in place around the world. The plant in V\u00e9nissieux, near Lyon in France, was one of the first plants to close when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020 and also one of the first to restart. As part of re-starting operations, strict safety routines were deployed for all personnel with clear instructional videos on protective equipment, hand washing and steps to take if infected.

The vocational training school will train 40 trainees and 20 trainers each year, in addition to 480 employees from other transport companies who will benefit from short-term skill upgrading training on an annual basis. The project strives to introduce mandatory road safety training, such as defensive driving and awareness campaigns in schools in order to reduce the fatality rates from 65 to 32 per 10,000 registered vehicles in five years' time according to the target of the government. Furthermore, and in collaboration with the Ethiopian Federal Transport Authority, the project will establish standards for the teachers and students' certification and assist other schools to adopt a new curriculum for CVD training based on the success of this new institute.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the remanufacturing center, my colleagues and I conduct rigorous testing of each remanufactured part to ensure it meets the standards of the new part, and the old part will be revitalized after a series of remanufacturing processes. It is important work and I am thrilled when every little screw and nut can be reused, every reusable part turned into a remanufactured item that customers will need.

Back then, I thought I would need to change companies every two to five years, in order to develop my career. 25 years later, I am still here!\n\nThe opportunities in Volvo Group are many and varied. Over the years I've always taken the chance to make a difference and my efforts were recognized.

These new products will meet the needs of trucking applications requiring dry van/refrigerated, stake/ flatbed, dump and tank truck vocations.\n\nIn February, Volvo Trucks launched four new trucks, with a strong focus on the driver environment, safety and productivity. The four heavy-duty trucks; Volvo FH, FH16, FM and FMX, normally represent about two thirds of Volvo Trucks' deliveries. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the launch was subsequently postponed until the autumn of 2020.\n\n## Update on the impact from Covid-19 on the Volvo Group\n\nOn March 16, the Volvo Group issued a press release stating that the  consequences  of  the  Covid-19  outbreak  were  affecting  the Volvo Group and that there was a considerable risk of a material financial impact on the Group as from mid-March.\n\n## AB Volvo's Board of Directors withdrew proposal of extra dividend, maintained ordinary dividend\n\nOn March 19, the Volvo Group announced that in light of the general uncertainty and the measures taken to slow down the spread of Covid-19 and their effects on the Volvo Group, the Board of Directors of AB Volvo had decided to maintain the proposal to the Annual General Meeting on April 8, 2020 of an ordinary dividend of SEK 5.50 per share, but to withdraw the proposal of an extra dividend of SEK 7.50 per share.\n\n## Volvo provided an update on the situation in respect of Covid-19 and postponed the Annual General Meeting\n\nOn March 25, it was announced that the Board of Directors of AB Volvo had decided to postpone the Annual General Meeting given the uncertain and accelerating developments in the wake of Covid-19. The press release stated that 'In recent days, a number of government authorities around the world have continued to introduce measures that directly impact the Volvo Group's operations and customers. These decisions include closing borders, minimizing freedom of movement for citizens and closing businesses. Most of the Group's manufacturing plants are currently closed and employees in several countries have been temporarily laid off. Recent developments have a direct effect on economies important for the Volvo Group and the assessment is that the prevailing situation will lead to weaker demand for the Group's products and services. As already indicated, this will have a material negative effect on the Group's financial development.\n\nIn light of the above, the Board of Directors of AB Volvo has decided to postpone the Annual General Meeting in order to give the company and the Board a better opportunity to further evaluate the situation.'\n\nSubsequently it was decided that the Annual General Meeting was to be held on June 18, 2020 in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\n## The Volvo Group and Daimler Truck AG to lead the development of sustainable transportation by forming joint venture for large-scale production of fuel cells\n\nSharing the Green Deal vision of sustainable transport and a carbon neutral Europe by 2050, two leading companies in the commercial vehicle industry, Daimler Truck AG and the Volvo Group, on April 21, signed a preliminary non-binding agreement to establish a new joint venture.

The Volvo Group has a strong financial position. However, there was a general uncertainty created by Covid-19 and the effects on the Volvo Group from the measures taken in various countries to slow down the spread of the virus. As an effect the Board believed that it was appropriate, as a precautionary measure, to withdraw the dividend proposal.\n\n## Hel\u00e9ne Mellquist new President Volvo Penta\n\nOn June 9, Hel\u00e9ne Mellquist was appointed President of Volvo Penta and new member of Volvo Group Management.

Adjusted for currency movements the decrease was 18%.\n\nVehicle sales decreased by 23% adjusted for currency movements. Sales were lower in all business areas as a consequence of the measures to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic affecting customer demand, primarily in the spring. Service sales decreased by 4% adjusted for currency as a sharp drop in the utilization of vehicles and machines during the first half of the year. This was followed by a strong rebound when measures such as lockdowns were eased in many markets.\n\nNet sales in Trucks decreased by 21% adjusted for currency movements, as a consequence of lower deliveries in all main markets. For Construction Equipment currency-adjusted net sales decreased by 5% as an increase in volumes was offset by a negative product and market mix. Buses' net sales decreased by 33% adjusted for currency movements, primarily because of a steep drop in demand for coaches and related service sales. Net sales for Volvo Penta went down by 8% currency adjusted as increased service sales could not fully compensate for a drop in the sales of engines.\n\nThe Volvo Group's sales of defense material, as defined in the Swedish Military Equipment Ordinance (1992:1303) section A, amounted in 2020 to 0.93% (0.51) of net sales.\n\n## Operating income\n\nIn 2020, the global Covid-19 pandemic presented the Volvo Group with  challenges  that  was  unprecedented  in  modern  times.  The adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 28.6 billion (47.9), corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 8.4% (11.1).

Currency  effects  from  revaluation  of  assets  in foreign  subsidiaries  decreased  total  assets  by  SEK  41.9  billion. Adjusted for currency effects total assets increased by SEK 27.9 billion.

The equity ratio was 29.0% (27.0). On the same date  the  equity  ratio  in  the  Industrial  Operations  amounted  to 35.8% (33.1).\n\n## Net financial position\n\nIn 2020, net financial assets in the Volvo Group's Industrial Operations, excluding provisions for post-employment benefits and lease liabilities, increased by SEK 12.1 billion resulting in a net financial asset position of SEK 74.7 billion on December 31, 2020. The change was mainly an effect of a positive operating cash flow of SEK 18.5 billion, which was partly offset by a dividend to shareholders with non-controlling interest of SEK 0.8 billion and negative currency movements of SEK 2.2 billion.\n\nIncluding provisions for post-employment benefits and lease liabilities the Industrial Operations had net financial assets of SEK 51.0 billion. Provisions for post-employment benefits and lease liabilities decreased by SEK 1.6 billion. This was mainly due to pension payments of SEK 3.6 billion and positive currency movements of SEK 1.3 billion, offset by an increase in remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans of SEK 0.1 billion. The increase in remeasurements was primarily an effect of significantly lower interest rates, which were partly offset by higher return on assets. A correction of actuarial calculations has increased pension liabilities by SEK 1.1 billion.\n\n- Read more in Note 20 Provisions for post- employment benefits.\n\nThe Volvo Group's cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 85.2 billion on December 31, 2020, an increase of SEK 23.7 billion as an effect of the positive operating cash flow. In addition to this, granted but unutilized credit facilities amounted to SEK 41.6 billion (43.0), whereof SEK 5.5 billion will expire in 2022, SEK 1.0 billion in 2023, SEK 15.0 billion in 2024 and SEK 20.1 billion in 2025. Cash and cash equivalents include SEK 2.5 billion (2.4) that is not available to use by the Volvo Group and SEK 11.0 billion (9.1) where other limitations exist, mainly in countries where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply.\n\n- Read more in Note 18 Cash and cash equivalents.\n- Read more in Note 22 Liabilities, regarding the maturity structure on credit facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The lower operating cash flow compared to 2019 is primarily an effect of a reduction in operating income of SEK 20.9 billion as well as an increase in working capital of SEK 11.0 billion in 2020 compared to an increase of SEK 0.5 billion in 2019. This was partly offset by a reduction in income taxes paid of SEK 4.6 billion and lower investments of SEK 3.3 billion compared to 2019.\n\nOperating cash flow in Financial Services was positive in an amount of SEK 0.8 billion (-14.0). The change compared to 2019 was mainly due to a lower increase of new business volume in the credit portfolio.\n\n- Read more in Note 10 Income taxes.\n\nRead more in Note 21 Other provisions.\n\n## Investments and disposals\n\nThe Industrial Operations' investments in tangible and intangible assets during 2020 amounted to SEK 8.7 billion (11.9).\n\nTrucks investments in tangible and intangible assets amounted to SEK 6.8 billion (9.3). The major investments were related to industrial efficiency measures such as replacements and upgrades in our USA plants as well as the ongoing replacement of casting process equipment  in  Sk\u00f6vde,  Sweden.  Capital  expenditures  were  also related to product renewals such as the Renault Trucks Master and the development of electrical trucks with both product development activities and required adaptations in the plants. Investments in dealer networks and workshops were mainly made in Europe, primarily for upgrade and replacements.\n\nInvestments in Construction Equipment amounted to SEK 0.9 billion (1.1). The major investments in the plants were related to industrial efficiency measures and renewals mainly in Asia. The product related investments during the year were mainly continued investments in tooling and required adaptations in the plants for excavators.\n\nThe investments in Buses were SEK 0.3 billion (0.3), and in Volvo Penta SEK 0.5 billion (0.5).\n\nThe investment level for property, plant and equipment during 2020 was below last year as an effect of lower activity levels due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Investments in property, plant and equipment is expected to increase during 2021. Investments in optimization of the industrial footprint, product related tooling, replacements as well as dealer investments will continue to be the main areas.\n\n## Investments and divestments of shares\n\nIn total, investments and divestments of shares in 2020 had a negative impact on cash flow of SEK 0.5 billion compared with a positive impact of SEK 0.1 billion in 2019.\n\nRead more in Note 3 Acquisitions and divestments of shares and operations.\n\n## Acquired and divested operations\n\nIn total, acquired and divested operations in 2020 had a positive impact on cash flow of SEK 0.4 billion (1,3).\n\nRead more in Note 3 Acquisitions and divestments of shares and operations.\n\n## Financing and dividend\n\nNet borrowings increased by SEK 7.3 billion during 2020 to safeguard liquidity in the Volvo Group. In 2019 net borrowings increased by SEK 9.3 billion due to a growing credit portfolio in Financial Services. No dividend was paid to the shareholders of AB Volvo during 2020.\n\nRead more in Note 29 Cash flow regarding change in loans during 2020.\n\n## Change in cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Volvo Group's cash and cash equivalents increased by SEK 23.7 billion in 2020 due to the positive operating cash flow and amounted to SEK 85.2 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\n- Read more in Note 18 Cash and cash equivalents  regarding the accounting  policy.\n- Read more in Note 29 Cash flow regarding principles for preparing the cash flow statement.",

        "page_content": "## SALES AND PROFITABILITY AFFECTED BY LOWER VOLUMES\n\nNet sales in the truck business decreased by 25% to SEK 208.3 billion on as the consequences of combatting Covid-19 weighed on many markets. However, demand improved during the course of the year. The adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 17,251 M (31,552) corresponding to a margin of 8.3% (11.4).\n\n## Markets affected by Covid-19\n\nAfter a couple of years of good demand, the European and North American truck market started to slow down in the second half of 2019, and this continued into 2020. In Q2, all major regions followed the same pattern due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Initial disruptions to the supply chains were followed by dropping fleet utilization and a significant drop in demand. During the course of the quarter there was a gradual return on all these parameters. The supply chain, including the Volvo Group's plants, was re-started in May after about a month of complete standstill. As Covid-19 restrictions were eased in many countries, transport activity improved, with the recovery seen towards the end of Q2 continuing in Q3 and Q4. At the end of 2020, utilization of truck fleets in the major markets was back on par with the level of the preceding year. The increased freight activity was positive for customer profitability and many customers returned to their previously planned replacement cycles.\n\nDespite the gradual improvement seen over the course of the year, most markets declined during 2020. The European market for heavy-duty trucks decreased by 28% to 231,200 trucks while the North American market went down by 30% to 234,900 heavyduty trucks. In Brazil, the market declined by 10% to 67,400 heavyduty trucks. A general economic recovery, increased demand from the agriculture sector after a good harvest and an underlying need to replace old trucks almost weighed up the effect from Covid-19. The Indian truck market continued to be negatively impacted by a weak economic development and effects from measures to combat Covid-19. The Chinese market, on the other hand, continued to be strong, supported by governmental initiatives to stimulate the economy. Compared to the other major markets, demand for trucks in Japan remained relatively stable through the pandemic.\n\n## Orders and deliveries\n\nOrder intake to the Group's wholly-owned truck operations increased by  14%  to  208.505  (182,746)  trucks.

        "page_content": "In  2020,  a  total  of  166.481  trucks  where  delivered  from  the Group's wholly-owned operations, a decrease of 28% compared with 232,769 trucks in 2019. Deliveries decreased in all markets as a consequence of a general slowdown in many markets at the beginning of the year. This was aggravated by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which initially affected supply chains and subsequently demand. As the strong measures to combat the spread of the disease were eased, deliveries improved during the latter part of the year.\n\n## Lower volumes impacted profitability\n\nIn 2020, net sales in the truck operations decreased by 25% to SEK 208,262 M (276,647). Adjusted for currency movements, net sales decreased by 21%, of which vehicle sales decreased by 26% and service sales by 4%.\n\nAdjusted operating income amounted to SEK 17,251 M (31,552) corresponding to a margin of 8.3% (11.4), excluding adjustments of SEK -1,486 M. For information on adjustments, please see Key Ratios on page 194. The decreased earnings were mainly a result of lower vehicle and service volumes as well as decreased capacity utilization in the industrial system, while lower selling and administrative expenses, material costs and R&D expenses had a positive impact. Adjusted operating income for 2020 includes a positive effect of SEK 322 M from a correction of actuarial calculations of the Group's pension liabilities and SEK 362 M from a favorable tax ruling in Brazil. Adjusted operating income in 2019 included a positive impact of SEK 707 M from the sale of properties. Reported operating income amounted to SEK 15,764 M (31,552). Currency movements had a negative impact of SEK 1,707 M compared with 2019.\n\n## Important events\n\nIn Q1, Volvo Trucks launched a completely new generation of heavyduty trucks, with a strong focus on the driver environment, safety and productivity. The four trucks; Volvo FH, FH16, FM and FMX, normally represent about two thirds of Volvo Trucks' deliveries. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic the launch was subsequently postponed until the autumn.\n\nAlso in Q1, Mack Trucks launched medium-duty models for the North American market. These new products will meet the needs of trucking applications requiring dry van/refrigerated, stake/flatbed, dump and tank truck vocations.\n\nIn Q2, UD Trucks expanded its heavy-duty truck range with the launch of a new, short-cab Quon, enabling more cargo to be carried and thereby higher customer productivity. The model was available in Japan on June 1.\n\nIn Q3, Volvo Trucks started piloting the electric regional haul truck Volvo VNR Electric with customers in Southern California. Sales started in Q4 and serial production of the Volvo VNR Electric will begin in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlso in Q3, Mack Trucks delivered pre-production Mack LR Electric refuse trucks to New York Department of Sanitation and to Republic Services for in-service trials. Mack Trucks will start to take orders for the electric refuse truck in Q4 2020. Serial production will start 2021.\n\nThe new Volvo Trucks range - Volvo FH, Volvo FH16, Volvo FM and Volvo FMX - was successfully relaunched in Q3. Among the news was a new generation of the fuel-efficiency package I-Save for Volvo FH. The latest release of I-Save can cut fuel costs by up to 10% compared with the older version without I-Save. More information is available on page 27.\n\nIn July, it was decided to initiate a project to create a separate business unit for medium-duty trucks in Europe. Having a cross-functional team dedicated solely to medium-duty trucks will create the focus needed to improve the performance of this important business.\n\nIn October, the Volvo Group and Isuzu Motors signed binding agreements to form a strategic alliance within commercial vehicles. More information is available on the next page.\n\nIn November, the Volvo Group and Daimler Truck AG signed binding agreement for a joint venture to develop, produce and commercialize fuel-cell systems for use in heavy-duty trucks as the primary focus, as well as other applications. More information is available on page 25.\n\nIn November, Volvo Trucks announced that from 2021 onwards a complete range of battery-electric Volvo trucks will be offered in Europe for distribution, refuse, regional transport and urban construction operations. Volvo Trucks will be offering holistic solutions that include route planning, correctly specified vehicles, charging equipment, financing and services. Volvo Trucks' massive drive towards electrification marks a major step forwards on the road to fossil-free transport.",

        "page_content": "UD TRUCKS\n\n## Divestment of UD Trucks and formation of strategic alliance with Isuzu Motors\n\nIn October 2020, the Volvo Group and Isuzu Motors signed binding agreements to form a strategic alliance within commercial vehicles in order to capture the opportunities in the ongoing industry transformation, in accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 2019.\n\nThe agreements include Isuzu Motor's acquisition of UD Trucks from the Volvo Group for an enterprise value of JPY 243 billion (approx. SEK 20 billion). The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including approval from regulatory authorities. The alliance between the Volvo Group and Isuzu Motors is set to a build long-term and robust relationship that will encompass but not be limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Forming a technology partnership, intended to leverage the parties' complementary areas of expertise within both wellknown and new technologies and creating a larger volume base to support investments for world-class technology. The technology partnership encompasses joint development by Isuzu Motors and UD Trucks of common platforms for medium heavy-duty truck models for the Japanese market and other Asian markets, utilizing amongst others Volvo Group technology as well as the intended cooperation regarding new technologies such as autonomous driving, connectivity and medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles.\n- \u00b7 Creating the best long-term conditions for a stronger heavyduty truck business for UD Trucks and Isuzu Motors in Japan and across international markets by transferring ownership of the complete UD Trucks business from the Volvo Group to Isuzu Motors. This will accelerate growth by leveraging greater volumes and complementary capabil-\n\n Isuzu Motors from 2022 onwards. To secure smooth business continuation, the Volvo Group will provide transitional services to UD Trucks and also supply components to UD Trucks.\n\n- \u00b7 Exploring further opportunities for even broader and deeper collaboration within the commercial vehicle businesses across geographical areas and product lines for future urban logistics solutions. Isuzu Motors is one of the world-leaders in the segment of 3.5 to 15 ton light and medium-duty trucks with volumes of 252,000 units in 2019.\n- \u00b7 Exploring cooperation in the areas of purchasing and logistics, leveraging common technology, as well as the geographical footprint complementarity and volume expansion.\n\n'I have high expectations on this strategic alliance, which will make Volvo and Isuzu Motors even more competitive within their respective markets and segments. This is an opportunity to share technology investments and also to help each other grow. I am confident that UD Trucks will become a bridge between the Volvo Group and Isuzu Motors and that the strategic alliance will create the conditions to continue to develop UD Trucks to a new level within Isuzu Motors. I also want to express my pride at how the UD Trucks team has been able to serve customers and continue to improve financial performance also during this unprecedented period, characterized by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Volvo Group will continue to support UD Trucks, and participate in the Asian markets through this alliances' says Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO of the Volvo Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## GOOD PROFITABILITY\n\nA steep drop in demand, factory closures and supply chain disruptions all contributed to a weak first half of 2020. But a strong rebound,  particularly  in  the  world's  biggest  market,  China,  saw Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE)  recover much of the lost ground. For the full year 2020, net sales decreased by 8% to SEK 81.5  billion.  The  adjusted  operating  income  amounted  to  SEK 10,071 M (11,910) corresponding to a margin of 12.4% (13.4).\n\nIn line with its Building Tomorrow Together strategy, Volvo CE introduced  new  working  practices  and  organizational  changes designed to move closer to its customers and allow the business to self-manage day-to-day operations in a more efficient way. New Centers of Expertise for Uptime, Productivity and Parts Services & Logistics were introduced with the aim to expand revenues from services. Success in China is central to future growth and a line of new China-customer-focused excavators were rolled out by both Volvo and SDLG brands. Dealers remain the backbone of the company's route to market, but ecommerce options are also being explored as part of the transformation agenda. Volvo CE also continues along the path towards new technologies that offer more sustainable solutions. These include hybrid, battery-electric and fuel cell-electric solutions, while the combustion engine technology still has more to offer as it gets cleaner and more efficient.\n\n## China led recovery in demand\n\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic made its presence felt in sharply lower demand in China from early in 2020, an impact that then swept through all global markets to varying degrees during the first half of the year. Lockdowns, factory closures and other measures designed to limit the spread of the pandemic, along with external supply chain issues, also hampered deliveries. This was countered by a gradual improvement in customer sentiment and a strong, stimulus-driven recovery in China. The other markets also recovered in the second half of the year as construction activity rebounded. However, until November, both the European and North American markets were down by 14% while South America rose by 12% from low levels. Asia (excluding China) was down by 6% while China increased by 28%.\n\nIn 2020, Volvo CE had an increase in order intake of 17% to 97,987 machines (83,953). Order intake increased in all markets except North America, with increased demand for both Volvo and SDLG branded equipment. Total deliveries increased by 8% and amounted to 93,760 machines (86,885).\n\n## Bounce back after an initial fall\n\nA sharp drop in sales during the first half of the year was softened by a strong rebound as the year progressed, culminating in a relatively stable year overall despite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Net sales in 2020 decreased by 8% to SEK 81,543 M (88,606 M). Adjusted for currency movements, net sales decreased by 5%, of which machine sales declined by 5% and service sales by 2%.\n\n## IN BRIEF\n\nVolvo CE is one of the leaders in the development of products and services for the construction, extraction, waste processing, forestry and materials handling sectors.\n\n## Position on world market\n\nOne of the world's leading manufacturers of haulers, wheel loaders and excavators.

Currency movements had a negative impact of SEK 989 M compared with 2019.\n\n## Important events\n\nTo support the launch of the company's first fully electric compact machines,  Volvo  CE  introduced  the  industry's  first  online  prebooking sales platform, which allows customers in selected markets to pre-book the L25 Electric compact wheel loader and the ECR25 Electric compact excavator and reserve their places in the production queue. Deliveries of the machines began in Q4 with customer starts in several European markets.\n\nThe Volvo CE-developed battery-electric autonomous load carrier TA15 won a Red Dot Award for product design. With a 15 ton hauling capacity, the autonomous and cabless load carrier forms part of Volvo Autonomous Solutions' wider TARA transport solution concept, so that a series of them can be connected together to form a 'train' of machines, for maximum loading and hauling efficiency.\n\nVolvo CE and Finnish company Norrhydro have developed a digital hydraulic actuator that increases productivity while radically cutting fuel bills and CO 2 emissions in construction applications.

        "page_content": "## GLOBAL BUS MARKET SEVERELY AFFECTED BY COVID-19\n\nThe global bus market was severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. A steep decline in market demand and lockdowns disrupting supply chains, particularly affected Volvo Buses' coach business, whereas the transit bus market remained at relatively higher activity levels. The lower deliveries resulted in net sales declining by 36% to SEK 19.8 billion in 2020. The adjusted operating income amounted to SEK -445 M (1,337), as the low volumes could not be fully counteracted by significant cost reductions.\n\nVolvo Buses' strategic priorities are to enhance competitiveness and increase profitability by making both operational improvements and  transformational  changes  that  strengthen  the  commercial offering, improve quality and reduce cost. In 2020, transformational changes included extending the electromobility offering and further decentralizing decision-making in end-to-end business unit value chains. In line with this strategy, a dedicated global chassis organization was implemented. In Q4, Volvo Buses' business in India was divested to the Volvo Group's joint-venture VECV.\n\n## Increased demand for electric buses\n\nThe decline in demand affected all parts of the business, with a particularly severe impact on the coach business. The European market decreased  with  lower  volumes  in  all  areas.  In  North  America, demand also declined, and almost stopped in the coach market. Brazil started to pick up again in the second half of the year, similar to certain Asian markets.\n\nHowever, demand for end-to-end solutions for electrified buses continued to be strong. The product offering includes a range of electrified buses for Europe (Volvo) and North America (Nova Bus). This was extended with the new S-Charge hybrid model range including chassis for the global market. The offering also includes battery and charging infrastructure options as well as services. Charging solutions are developed together with external providers, including  fast-charging  (OppCharge),  now  also  with  a  pantograph-up solution, and depot charging.\n\nAt the end of the year, Volvo Buses started delivering the order for 157 electric articulated buses to Gothenburg, Sweden. In total, orders for 287 (315) Volvo branded fully electric buses were received from customers  in  countries  such  as  Sweden,  Norway,  Denmark  and Poland. 306 (438) electrified buses were delivered to cities across Europe, confirming electric buses as a sustainable and financially viable solution for high-capacity public transport. More than 5,000 Volvo branded electrified buses have been sold since the start in 2010.\n\n## Important orders\n\nThe New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority extended orders from the previous year with another order for 307 Prevost commuter buses and 500 Nova Bus transit buses.\n\n## IN BRIEF\n\nVolvo Buses is a leader in the development of sustainable public transport solutions and one of the world's largest manufacturers of premium buses, coaches and bus chassis. Volvo Buses has sales in 85 countries and a global service network with more than 1,500 dealerships and workshops. Production facilities are found in Europe, North America and South America.\n\n## Position on world market\n\nVolvo Buses is one of the world's largest producers of buses and coaches in the premium segment.\n\nShare of net sales by market %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNumber of regular  employees 6,608 (8,324)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBUSES\n\nThe offering includes city buses, intercity buses and coaches as well as associated transport systems, financial services and services for vehicle and traffic information.\n\n- 1 For information on adjusted operating income, please see Key Ratios on page 194.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Adjusted for currency movements, net sales decreased by 33%, of which vehicle sales decreased by 35%. Currency-adjusted service sales were down 22%, following a standstill in operations for many coach operators during the pandemic.\n\nAdjusted operating income amounted to SEK -445 M (1,337), corresponding to a margin of -2.2% (4.3) excluding adjustments of SEK -77 M. For information on adjustments, please see Key Ratios on page 194. Earnings were negatively impacted by decreased vehicle and service volumes as well as lower capacity utilization. Reduced selling, R&D and administration expenses contributed to mitigate some of the volume shortfall. Adjusted operating income includes a positive effect of SEK 52 M from a correction of actuarial calculations of the Group's pension liabilities. Reported operating income amounted to SEK -522 M (1,337). Currency movements had a negative impact in an amount of SEK 347 M compared with 2019.\n\n## Product and service introductions\n\nVolvo Buses introduced the new Volvo S-Charge model range including  chassis,  where  electric  propulsion  drives  the  hybrid  buses  at speeds up to 50 km/h. The buses can run in electric mode up to 1 km at a time. The upgrade also includes improved connectivity and Volvo's system for geo-fencing, Volvo Zone Management.\n\nVolvo Buses launched the new Volvo 9700 DD double-decker, aimed at the Nordic market for high capacity vehicles with premium comfort and safety features in the express segment.\n\nVolvo  Buses  together  with  Stena  Recycling  and  Batteryloop signed a global agreement on reuse of bus batteries, creating a new circular  business.  After  the  batteries  are  removed  from  Volvo's buses, they are reused as energy storage units in buildings and charging stations for a number of years.\n\n| Net sales and operating income  SEK M   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Europe                                  | 5,765  | 7,369  |\n| North America                           | 8,302  | 15,543 |\n| South America                           | 1,793  | 3,281  |\n| Asia                                    | 2,397  | 2,617  |\n| Africa and Oceania                      | 1,535  | 2,209  |\n| Total net sales                         | 19,791 | 31,019 |\n| Of which:                               |        |        |\n| Vehicles 1                              | 16,072 | 26,110 |\n| Services 1                              | 3,720  | 4,909  |\n| Adjusted operating income 2             | - 445  | 1,337  |\n| Adjustments 2                           | -77    | -      |\n| Operating income                        | - 522  | 1,337  |\n| Adjusted operating margin, %            | -2.2   | 4.3    |\n| Operating margin, %                     | -2.6   | 4.3    |\n\n- 1  Restate of 2019 between Vehicles and Services of SEK 510 M.\n- 2   For information on adjusted operating income, please see Key Ratios on page 194.\n\n| Deliveries by market   Number of buses   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Europe                                   | 1,565  | 2,350  |\n| North America                            | 1,644  | 3,084  |\n| South America                            | 1,152  | 1,917  |\n| Asia                                     | 1,097  | 1,465  |\n| Africa and Oceania                       | 797    | 915    |\n| Total deliveries                         | 6,215  | 9,731  |\n\n## VOLVO 7900 ELECTRIC\n\n## ROLLOUT OF VOLVO 7900 ELECTRIC ARTICULATED IN GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn December 13, 145 Volvo 7900 Electric Articulated buses began to operate 34 different routes on the streets in and around Gothenburg, Sweden - a significant milestone for both the city and Volvo Buses. With this 35% of the total bus fleet is electrified. The complete system solution includes a total of 157 electric buses, charging infrastructure, maintenance services and driver training. Making this one of the largest electric bus fleets in Europe, Gothenburg takes a big step to large-scale electrified public transport, moving towards a more sustainable city - a Zero City with zero emissions and zero noise. On a yearly basis, this will reduce CO 2 emissions by 14,500 tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 8,000 kg, and passengers will enjoy silent buses. The noise level of each bus is reduced by 7dB, halving its noise emissions. The goal set for the city of Gothenburg is for all city buses to be electric by 2030.",

Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 1,448 M (1,876).\n\nVolvo Penta operates in two businesses: Marine, consisting of the leisure and commercial segments and Industrial, which includes the off-road and power generation segments. Within marine, Volvo Penta aims to lead the industry, continuing to develop innovative products and solutions. For the industrial segments, Volvo Penta's goal is to be a key player, continuing to expand its strong footprint, seeking maximum leverage of Volvo Group assets in its offer, and adding value for customers in its application and integration expertise.\n\nVolvo Penta's strategy is focused on delivering customer success and continuously improving satisfaction. Volvo Penta's ambition is to deliver sustainable power solutions for both customers and society at large. This includes focus on full electric, hybrid and fuel cell solutions and also improved engine technologies. Volvo Penta aims to continue to perform with the current offer and to accelerate the transformation within electromobility, autonomous solutions and new services.\n\n## Market development\n\nThe marine leisure market weakened due to Covid-19 in the spring, but rebounded during Q3 and the development continued in Q4. The  market  for  larger  yachts  showed  a  strong  recovery.  In  the marine commercial market, many investments in new vessels were postponed to 2021. However, demand for vessels serving the offshore wind industry continued to show a positive development.\n\nThe market for industrial off-road engines slowed down due to a decline in the construction and agriculture machinery segments in most regions except China. However, markets started to rebound towards the end of the year. The industrial power generation market decreased globally in the spring but recovered thereafter.\n\n## Lower volumes impacted profitability\n\nVolvo Penta's net sales decreased by 11% to SEK 11,891 M compared with SEK 13,287 M in 2019. Adjusted for currency movements, net sales decreased by 8%, of which engine sales decreased by 11%, while service sales increased by 2%. Adjusted operating income amounted to SEK 1,448 M (1,876), corresponding to a margin of 12.2% (14.1), excluding adjustments of SEK -46 M. For information on adjustments, please see Key Ratios on page 194. Earnings were negatively impacted by lower engine volumes and restructuring costs of SEK 177 M related to the outboard business, which were partly offset by lower selling, administrative and R&D expenses.

A major milestone was realized with the delivery of a 600V electric driveline  for  Rosenbauer's  'Revolutionary  Technology'  fire  truck, which was revealed to the market in Q3 (see page 28). The Volvo Penta electric driveline delivers zero exhaust emissions and significantly reduced noise levels. During Q4, Volvo Penta announced collaboration with Danfoss Editron on powering two hybrid crew transfer vessels with new pilot technology (see below).\n\n## Further strengthened customer offer\n\nA number of product enhancements and reveals were made during 2020 with the aim to significantly reduce emissions and enhance the user experience. Volvo Penta revealed its new D8 industrial power generation engine, which offers industry-leading power density, compact size, as well as low fuel consumption and noise levels. This new\n\n## COLLABORATION WITH DANFOSS EDITRON\n\n## HYBRID CREW TRANSFER VESSELS\n\nVolvo Penta collaborates with Danfoss Editron on powering two hybrid crew transfer vessels with new pilot technology.

Additionally, Volvo Penta started delivery of its new D8 power generation engine to meet EU Stage V emissions, bringing the benefits of ease of installation, operation and maintenance, as well as reduced fuel consumption and improved total cost of ownership to a wide range of customers.\n\nVolvo Penta revealed an upgraded D16 engine designed for commercial marine use, including packages for marine gensets as well as IMO  Tier  III  compliance.  New  D8  and  D13  solutions  were  also revealed to meet EU Stage V marine emissions for Inland Waterways. The company announced updates to its D13 engine range for commercial marine use with increased performance and durability, for lower cost of ownership.\n\nAdditionally, Volvo Penta expanded its yacht offer with a new 13-liter IPS propulsion package designed for lower speed, semidisplacement yachts. A new 33-meter Mangusta yacht was one of the  new  superyachts  revealed  during  2020  with  this  propulsion package. Volvo Penta celebrated a key milestone with more than 30,000 Volvo Penta Inboard Performance System (IPS) installations across the marine sector. Volvo Penta IPS delivers a unique user experience with up to 30% reduced fuel consumption and 30% less CO 2 emissions compared to traditional inboard shafts.\n\nVolvo Penta also continued the evolution of its Easy Connect app, which provides users with data related to the engine, boat, and routes taken - directly to their smartphone or tablet. The app is being expanded with new features designed for commercial marine professionals.\n\nVolvo Penta decided to reprioritize its investments into areas such as electrification and other transformational technologies and has therefore decided not to further invest in the outboard segment at this time.\n\nIn January 2021, Volvo Penta announced the commercial availability of the industry's first fully integrated Assisted Docking. The system gives better control when docking a boat by automating the captain's intentions, helping the vessel stay on its intended course.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The connected insurance offering uses customized data-driven solutions that simplify and increase the speed of the customer's insurance experience. This digital platform makes it easy for customers to handle their insurance-related needs, including quotes, from a mobile phone, tablet or computer. Insurance companies will have access to live data about an insured customer's vehicle and their driving behavior for faster claims support, while using telematics data to potentially reduce a customer's insurance premium based on truck usage and responsible driving history. The offering will expand nationwide in the US, with future global expansion planned for the commercial transport industry.",

A long-term competitive business requires access to capital to be able to invest. Financial management ensures that the capital is used in the best possible way through well-defined ratios and objectives for the Industrial Operations as well as for the customer finance operations in Financial Services. The objective on Group operating margin and return on equity for Financial Services are intended to secure the return requirements from shareholders. The target on no net financial indebtedness under normal circumstances in  the  Industrial  Operations  and  the  equity  ratio  for  Financial Services are there to secure fi  nancial stability.\n\n## Steering principles to ensure financial flexibility\n\nTo ensure financial stability and flexibility throughout the business cycle the Volvo Group holds a strong liquidity position. Besides cash and marketable securities, the liquidity position is built up of revolving committed credit facilities. Funding and lending in Financial Services are in local currency and the portfolio is matched both from an interest and a liquidity risk perspective, in accordance with the Volvo Group policy. For further information, please see Note 4 to the  Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Diversified funding sources\n\nThe Volvo Group has centralized the portfolio man  agement of all financial assets and liabilities, funding operations and cash management through the internal bank, Volvo Treasury. The liability portfolio is separated into two portfolios, one for Industrial Operations and one for Financial Services, to correspond to the needs of the different  operations.  Volvo  Treasury  assures  the  possibility  to access  capital  markets  at  all  times  through  diversified  funding sources. Furthermore, the Group's global presence is supported by bond programs on major debt capital markets in the world. Besides the access to capital markets around the world, the Group uses different instruments, such as bilateral bank funding, corpor ate bonds and certificates, hybrid bonds, agency funding as well as securitization of assets in Financial Services' credit portfolio. An increasingly import ant part of the treasury work is to manage increased funding needs in new growth markets.\n\n## Green Finance Framework\n\nIn November, Volvo Group launched a Green Finance Framework for the financing of investments and projects in the area of clean transportation. The framework enables the Volvo Group to issue green bonds and other green financial instruments and allows the company to identify, select, manage and report on eligible projects and assets in line with International Capital Market Association Green Bond Principles. The funds will be earmarked to projects in areas such as R&D and manufacturing of electric vehicles, machines and engines with zero tailpipe emissions. Funds will also be used by Volvo Financial Services to offer green loans to customers who buy the Group's electric products.

The level of the credit rating is not only important for debt investors but also for a number of other stakeholders when it comes to creating long-term relationships. A strong credit rating has a positive effect on the  ability to attract and finance customers' purchases of the Group's products and on the trust from suppliers. It also gives access to more funding sources and lower cost of funds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Volvo Group has contractual relations with two global Credit Rating  Agencies  for  solicited  credit  ratings:  Moody's  Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poors'  Rating Services (S&P). During 2020, neither Moody's nor S&P made any rating changes.",

The price of the Volvo B share increased by 24% after having increased by 35% in 2019.\n\nThe Volvo share is listed on the stock exchange  Nasdaq Stockholm, Sweden. One A share carries one vote at General Meetings and one B share carries one tenth of a vote. Dividends are the same for both classes of shares. The Volvo share is included in many indices compiled by Dow Jones, FTSE, S&P and Nasdaq Nordic.\n\n## The Volvo share price increased\n\nIn  general,  the  leading  stock  exchanges  rose  during  2020.  On Nasdaq Stockholm the broad OMXSPI index rose by 11% after having risen by 30% in 2019. On Nasdaq Stockholm the share price for the Volvo A share rose by 24%, and at year-end the price was SEK 195.40 (158.20). The lowest closing price was SEK 99.00 on March 18 and the highest was SEK 203.00 on November 24. The share price for the Volvo B share rose by 24% and at year-end the price was SEK 193.80 (156.90). The lowest closing price was SEK 97.46 on March 18 and the highest was SEK 203.30 on November 24. In 2020, a total of 1.5 billion (1.2) Volvo shares at a value of SEK 224 billion (167) were traded on Nasdaq Stockholm, with a daily average of 5.9 million shares (4.8). In terms of value, the Volvo shares were the most traded on Nasdaq Stockholm in 2020. At year-end, Volvo's market capitalization was SEK 395 billion (335).\n\n## Share conversion option\n\nIn accordance with a resolution at the Annual General Meeting 2011, the Articles of Association have been amended to include a conversion clause, stipulating that series A shares may be converted into series B shares, on the request of the shareholder. During 2020, a total of 8,070,990 A shares were converted to B shares, representing 1.69% of the A shares that were outstanding at the end of 2019. Further information on the procedure is available on the Volvo Group's web site:   www. volvogroup.com\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board proposes an ordinary dividend of SEK 6.00 per share for the financial year 2020 and an extra dividend of SEK 9.00 per share, which would mean that a total of SEK 30,502 M would be transferred to AB Volvo's shareholders. For the preceding year a  dividend of SEK 5.50 per share and an extra dividend of SEK 7.50 per share were proposed, in total SEK 26,435 M. However, due to the uncertainty created by Covid-19 and the effects on the Volvo Group from the measures taken in various countries to slow down the spread of the virus, the Board believed that it was appropriate, as a precautionary measure, to withdraw the dividend proposals. Subsequently, the Annual General Meeting on June 18 resolved that no payment of dividend would be made and that the entire amount available would be carried forward.\n\n## Cancellation of own shares\n\nThe Annual General Meeting further resolved to adopt the Board's proposal to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of the company's approximately 95 million own shares (treasury shares) and an increase of the share capital by way of a bonus issue in order to restore the share capital.\n\n## Communication with shareholders\n\nDialogue with the shareholders is important for Volvo. In addition to the Annual General Meeting and a number of larger activities aimed\n\n## Why invest in the Volvo share?\n\n- \u00b7  Competitive products and services\n- \u00b7  Ambition to lead the transformation of our industry to sustainable solutions\n- \u00b7  Strong market positions globally\n- \u00b7  Improved profitability and cash flow in recent years\n- \u00b7  Strong financial position\n- \u00b7  Good cash returns to shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat professional investors, private shareholders and stock market analysts, the relationship between Volvo and the stock market is maintained through such events as press and telephone conferences in conjunction with the publication of interim reports, meetings with retail shareholders' associations, investor meetings and visits, as well as roadshows in Europe and North America. On volvogroup. com it is possible to access financial reports and search for information concerning the share and statistics for truck deliveries.

The website also offers the possibility to subscribe to information from the company.\n\nVolvo has decided to present its Corporate Governance Report as a  separate  document  to  the  Annual  Report  in  accordance  with Chapter 6 \u00a7 8 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and it is available on pages 172-187 of this Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\n## Contractual conditions related to takeover bids\n\nProvisions stipulating that an agreement can be changed or terminated if the control of the company is changed, so called change of control clauses, are included in some of the agreements whereby Renault Trucks has been given the right to sell Renault s.a.s. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd's light-duty trucks as well as in some of the Group's purchasing agreements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSome of Volvo Group's long-term loan agreements contain conditions stipulating the right for a bondholder to request repayment in advance under certain conditions following a change of the control of the company. These clauses are not unusual in loan agreements. In AB Volvo's opinion it has been necessary to accept those conditions in order to receive financing on otherwise acceptable terms.",

        "page_content": "## Cyclical commercial vehicles industry\n\nThe  Volvo  Group's  customers  operate  all  over  the  world,  some within a single country and others across borders. A multitude of global  and  regional  economic,  regulatory,  digital,  technological, climate and energy resource efficiency factors create strategic as well as operational challenges for the industry.\n\nLike many capital goods industries, the commercial vehicle industry generally has been cyclical, with a strong correlation to GDP and corresponding changes in transport demand, the need to replace aging vehicles and machines, as well as changing laws and regulations. Although there is a continued shift in focus in the commercial vehicle industry from product to service, the cyclicality in sales and profitability remains. The fluctuating demand for the Group's products  and  services  makes  the  financial  result  of  the  operations dependent on the Group's ability to react quickly to market changes.\n\nInability to adapt to a fluctuating demand could lead to capacity constraints or underutilization of resources, which could have a negative effect on earnings and financial position.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group strives to continuously balance production levels and operating expenses, as well as enhance business agility in fulfilling demands for new services.\n\n## Intense competition\n\nThe Volvo Group operates in markets which are highly competitive, and we face intense competition from global and local industry incumbents. We may also encounter increased competition from new market entrants, e.g. within the areas of sustainable transportation and increased logistics efficiency, new technologies and new business models, where current or new competitors may implement new technologies before the Volvo Group does, or may offer more attractively priced or enhanced products, services or solutions.\n\n## Comment\n\nGiven the width of brands within the Group, it is important to utilize synergies and economies of scale while at the same time empower the Business Areas to take responsibility for their businesses and offers. Continuous focus on diverse product, service and solution development to create customer and society value, together with a close monitoring of our competitors, are important components in our strategy to be a future industry leader.\n\n## Extensive government regulations\n\nRegulations regarding exhaust emissions, noise, safety and pollutants from production plants and products are extensive and evolving. Most of the regulatory challenges affecting the product range relate to reduced emission levels. In response to this, the Volvo\n\nGroup has, and expects to continue to have , significant expenditures in research and compliance to meet all applicable regulations. The Group also endeavors to collaborate and be transparent with all governing  bodies  in  certification  and  compliance  processes,  during development and throughout the lifecycle of Group products as well as in investments in production plants. It is of strategic importance to the Group to be able to comply with current and future emission standards and other applicable rules, and in the future the Group expects to spend even more in R&D investments to safeguard compliance  with  these  regulations.  Risks  for  the  Group  in  this  area include  noncompliance  with  applicable  regulations,  which  may result in reputational damage and significant penalties and costs of recalls and other remediation, and also failure to assure an updated and compliant product range in time to meet regulations.\n\nSafety regulations are also becoming increasingly important with autonomous vehicles in commercial applications. If regulations are not set, or clear enough, there is risk of not being able to scale up the autonomous offer, or not complying with regulations. A safety incident could have a detrimental effect on the Group's brand image and possibly earnings. An incident in the industry could also lead to quickly adjusted or new regulations.\n\nLocal protectionism leading to changes in local content requirements can put the Volvo Group at a disadvantage compared to local competitors, cause increased sourcing costs or require Volvo to make significant investments.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe product development capacities within the Volvo Group are coordinated, enabling a focus of resources for research and development to meet emission regulations.\n\n## Political instability, security\n\nThe Volvo Group is active in more than 190 countries across the world. Political instability, armed conflicts or civil unrest can impact the Group's ability to trade in affected areas. Acts of terrorism, sabotage or other criminal or illicit activities directed towards the Volvo Group's production system, transports or facilities, or those of its suppliers or customers, could cause harm to people and severely damage the Group's operations. The geopolitical situation, including e.g. ongoing trade discussions between USA and China and the Brexit process, may also give rise to further tariffs and other trade restrictions  and  barriers  being  imposed,  which  can  negatively impact the Group's production system and ability to conduct its operations.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group strives to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and implement appropriate measures to mitigate identified risks to avoid, prevent, reduce or transfer the impact.",

        "page_content": "## Technology shift and convergence\n\n## Comment\n\nBalancing the research and development resources between the traditional and new technologies is strategically important for the Volvo Group. New technologies arising from the increasing awareness  of  climate  change  and  the  digitalization  will  enable  autonomous,  electric  and  connected  vehicles  to  deeply  impact  the transport, logistics and construction industries - among others. The effect will be particularly strong at the convergence of these technologies as it affects vehicles, assets as well as infrastructures, and opens the way for a paradigm shift.\n\nThe lack of broadly accepted technologies and standards poses significant risks for the Volvo Group and other participants in these industries, as they are required to choose relevant technologies, time their introduction wisely, while respecting the wide spread in readiness level among markets and segments across the globe. The fact that  various  countries,  and  even  within  regions,  have  different climate related and environmental laws and regulations may lead to higher costs for the Volvo Group.\n\nA further level of risk relates to the need to evolve from a vehicle/ product focus towards an ecosystem-driven approach, where vehicles  and  infrastructures  are  to  be  developed  and  implemented simultaneously.\n\nIf the Volvo Group positions itself unsuccessfully in this technology shift, earnings capacity and financial standing could be severely affected.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group is striving to lead the technology development. Together  with  customers,  suppliers,  and  partners,  Volvo  Group explores new technologies, technology viability, desired features, and  cost,  safety,  climate  and  environmental  impact.  The  Volvo Group offers products and solutions which can support customers in reducing their environmental impact. This includes fuel efficiency, electrification and alternative fuels to reduce emissions from vehicles and machinery, as well as autonomous and connected solution and services to increase efficiency and productivity.\n\n## Customer satisfaction and demand\n\nTop priority for the Volvo Group is to support its customers' businesses and profitability in order for them to succeed, regardless of segment, brand, product or service. Customer satisfaction is reliant on the expectations in relation to the actual delivery or user experience of the total offer.\n\nCustomer demands are increasingly influenced by higher sustainability ambitions and stricter requirements from customers and end users on products and services.\n\nCustomer satisfaction and demand, and thereby the Group's sales and revenues, is at risk if the total experience is not at the expected level, price point or time.\n\nThe Volvo Group strives for a culture where customer success is at the heart of everything. Regardless of where in the value chain, the Group engages in understanding its customers' business and focus efforts on creating value from the customer's perspective.\n\nThe Volvo Group also puts a lot of effort on market research and customer  interviews  to  secure  knowledge  of  customer  needs. Within product development, the Group has implemented a project gate  model  and  a  governance  structure  where  risks  regarding project and product quality, cost, project lead time and product features are constantly monitored.\n\nStaff at retailers and workshops are continuously trained and provided with instructions and guidelines on how to interact with their customers to provide the best product life cycle profitability.\n\n## Industrial operations\n\nOur ability to deliver according to market demand depends significantly on obtaining a timely and adequate supply of materials, components and other vital services, as well as on our ability to properly utilize the capacity in the Group's different production and services facilities. The Group strives to produce components as well as complete vehicles and machines, and supply material to customers and factories in a sustainable and resource-efficient way. Our supplychain and industrial system may be affected by several factors, including shortages of materials and components, shortages of transport services, global trade discussions and other geopolitical developments as well as strikes, pandemics or extreme weather. Each of these factors could result in stoppages in production, operations and parts deliveries, which could have a material negative effect on the Group's financial performance\n\nElectrification of the products also poses higher risks of fires and harmed personnel as high voltage systems are introduced into the production facilities.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe organization is continuously working to manage and mitigate disturbances of the supply chain and in the industrial system The Group also seeks to mitigate risks by the integration of the industrial system itself through, among other things, improving the ability to manufacture and source from other Volvo Group sites and proactive monitoring of the supply chain. However, there can be no assurance that any such actions are sufficient to manage supply chain or industrial system disturbances at any given time.\n\nThe contributions to reducing environmental impact from the Group's operations include improving efficiency in the use of natural resources like water, energy and chemicals, reducing the dependency on hazardous substances, preventing adverse impacts from emissions  to  land,  water  and  air,  and  strategically  working  to increase renewable energy use and reduce CO 2 emissions.",

        "page_content": "## Reliance on suppliers and scarce materials\n\nThe ongoing technology shift into electrification and other new customer offerings, combined with required investments in traditional technologies, may move the industry and the Volvo Group towards reliance on new suppliers, new materials and on materials being used in new applications and in different quantities compared to traditional technologies. Some of these materials may pose a risk of supply due to scarcity or geopolitical, conflict or human rights concerns. At the same time the suppliers providing more traditional products might lose business and risk closing, which could leave the Volvo Group with a shortage of suppliers in a particular area and thereby a need to make investments.\n\n## Comment\n\nTo manage the high volatility in the commercial vehicle market, capacity management is a focus area. Another focus area is lifecycle assessments to manage life-cycle effects on environment and human rights in the supply chain. This is a key component of the Group's environmental policy.\n\n## Cybersecurity and IT infrastructure\n\nThe operation of many of the Volvo Group's business processes depends on reliable information technology (IT) systems and infrastructure. This applies to e.g. production, logistics and sales, as well as products using connectivity and automation features. Disruptions, cyberattacks and other security threats against our products or business could harm the Volvo Group's operations, reputation and have a significant adverse effect on earnings and financial position. Timely detection of cybersecurity and other security incidents is becoming increasingly complex, and the Volvo Group seeks to investigate and manage incidents with a view to prevent their recurrence.\n\nThe Volvo Group relies on third parties where significant parts of maintenance and operations of the IT systems has been outsourced. The Volvo Group has taken precautions in the selection and ongoing management of these third parties, but events or incidents caused by vulnerabilities in their operations or products could cause disruption of operations and loss or leakage of data.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group strives to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and implement  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  identified  risks  to avoid, prevent, reduce or transfer the impact. Security incidents that potentially involve personal data breach are managed as part of the Volvo Group Data Protection compliance program.\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and divestments\n\nIn addition to the Volvo Group's in-house work and focus on organic growth, we engage in acquisitions and divestments, as well as in JVs, partnerships and other forms of cooperation. This is essential parts in executing on our strategy. However, there can be no assurance that these transactions and cooperations become or remain successful, nor that they will deliver expected benefits. Acquisitions could  e.g.  result  in  incurrence  of  contingent  liabilities  and  an increase in amortization expenses and impairments related to goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as unanticipated difficulties in integration of an acquired entity. Divestments could present risks in e.g. the operational separation or through contractual undertakings or legal liabilities with respect to the business divested.\n\nJVs and partnerships may fail to perform as expected for various reasons, including our or our partner's incorrect assessment of needs and potential synergies, a failure to invest sufficient resources in the cooperation or a change of strategic direction that the cooperation fails to accommodate. Further, JVs and partnerships may restrict e.g. our ability to run independent operations within the scope of cooperation, and limitations in our or our partner's operational and financial resources may restrain the capabilities of the cooperation.\n\n## Comment\n\nVolvo Group evaluates potential acquisitions, business partners and JV's cross-functionally by following a four steps approach: 1) assess the strategic need, 2) define key areas to be filled, 3) collect and assess data, 4) present an informed and fact-based proposal for decision. The Group also makes in-depth analyses of selected projects after completion, to benefit from lessons learned.\n\n## Residual value commitments\n\nIf the Volvo Group is offering the customer a residual value commitment, it means that the customer can return the asset at the agreed date and to the agreed price.\n\nVolvo Group will have a residual value risk if the rebought vehicle can be sold only for a price below the vehicle's committed residual value. A residual value commitment can also become a future used vehicle inventory risk if vehicles are not sold, affecting the cash flow negatively.\n\n## Comment\n\nIn order to minimize the risk and the impact on future profitability, the Volvo Group has established processes and procedures within each  Business  Area,  where  each  Business  Area  assumes  the responsibility  for  establishing  and  maintaining  a  residual  value matrix to reflect fair future market values, proactive planning and management of expiring contracts as well as portfolio evaluation. For  further  information  on  residual  value  commitments  as  per December 31, 2020, please see Note 13 Tangible assets.",

        "page_content": "## Pandemics\n\nThe outbreak of pandemics throughout the world, such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, may lead to major disruptions in the economies of many  countries,  including  the  Group's  key  markets,  and  can  be expected to impact economic activity negatively going forward. The Covid-19 pandemic has had and might also continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the Group's products and services and on the financial performance of the Group. The duration and expected development of the Covid-19 pandemic is unknown, and no predictions can be made in relation to the length of present, and further measures that different countries and others may take in response to the crisis. However, any prolongation or worsening of the virus outbreak may lead to e.g. the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the extension of containment measures and restrictions on freedom of movement in the Group's key markets,\n- \u00b7 key suppliers experiencing severe financial difficulties,\n- \u00b7 shortages of necessary material and parts from suppliers directly or indirectly affected by the virus outbreak that may in turn lead to supply chain disruptions and production downtimes,\n- \u00b7 a larger number of customers directly or indirectly affected by the  virus outbreak having difficulties, or being prevented from, making payments to the Group when due,\n- \u00b7 further price pressure on new and used vehicles, which may give rise to write-downs or further reserve requirements with respect to vehicles in stock and residual value commitments,\n- \u00b7 impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets,\n- \u00b7 further disruption of financial markets and/or\n- \u00b7 a prolonged global economic downturn leading to a more severe reduction in demand for Group products.\n\nGiven the evolving nature of the crisis, the above list is not exhaustive, but each of these events, or any combination of them, could amplify the negative impact of the crisis on the Group's financial performance and have material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial development and shareholder value.\n\n## Comment\n\nManaging the immediate challenges and consequences of the Covid19 pandemic has been an important part of the work throughout 2020 and provided experience and learnings for future events. This work has involved teams on all levels in the Group, including local task forces, focusing on our colleagues, customers and business partners, with health and safety as first priority while maintaining a tight cost control and focus on cash.\n\n## Climate related and environmental regulations\n\nInternational agreements on limiting the CO 2 emissions, such as the Paris Agreement, together with related national and regional initiatives leads to continued and increased attention to climate change and influence regulatory development. Environmental legislation is\n\ndeveloping in areas such as vehicle regulations on CO 2 and on emission standards as well as chemical substance and noise regulations. Compliance with fuel efficiency and emission control requirements might lead to a need to accelerate introduction of significant volumes of electric vehicles as well as implementing additional new technologies for conventional diesel engines. This could lead to increased costs and potentially pose a transformative risk as there can be no assurance that these technologies can be produced and sold profitably or that customers will purchase those in the quantities needed to meet the regulatory requirements. These developments  increase  the  need  for  monitoring  and  adaption  to  new requirements. Even if challenges in these areas are resolved and handled, they could have a negative impact on the Group's reputation, usage of resources, and cost of production, and may result in adverse effects on earnings and financial position.\n\n## Comment\n\nTo mitigate risks and impact in the climate related and environmental regulatory area, the Volvo Group invests substantial resources to adhere to different legislations throughout the entire value chain. Examples of these are:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of upcoming climate related and environmental regulations and initiatives which could have an impact on the business\n- \u00b7 Governance structure to address upcoming climate related and environmental requirements\n- \u00b7 Prioritizations and investment decisions in regular operational processes.\n\n## Human capital\n\nThe Volvo Group strongly believes that there is a high correlation between the Group's future success and its capability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel. To meet expectations from employees and other stakeholders, a strong focus is required on areas such as leadership, empowerment, employee engagement, human rights, company culture and values, sharing of knowledge, and building diverse teams. Failure to do the right things in these areas can cause a negative impact on the Volvo Group's reputation, as well as on the image as an employer and on the ability to recruit, retain and develop the knowledge and skills of the employees necessary to ensure customer success.\n\n## Comment\n\nThis risk is managed by leveraging the full diversity of the workforce to ensure business success on a global arena and the Volvo Group continuously monitoring changing legislation to ensure compliance. The Volvo Group Pulse survey has been complemented by other tools and processes designed to increase dialogue, which allows the Group to capture the voice of employees and strengthen engagement. By uniting employees through a common set of behaviors that are  in  line  with  the  business  ambitions,  the  Group  consciously grows an inclusive culture and a value-based leadership.",

        "page_content": "## Human rights\n\nThe Volvo Group is committed to respect human rights in line with applicable legislation throughout the world, relevant global frameworks as well as its own standards. Adverse human rights impacts may potentially materialize not only within the Group's own organization, but also through the Group's business relationships and in the value chain. The Group is aware that conducting business in certain parts of the world constitutes higher risks for potential human rights violation and therefore has identified certain countries where the Volvo Group has a substantial number of employees and/or close business partners that are considered to have elevated risk in this respect. The Group is also aware that certain purchasing and customer segments constitutes higher risks for negative human rights impacts.\n\nThe consequences of human rights risks for the Volvo Group could range from liability to reputational and brand damage, depending also on the severity of the nature of harm done. This depends on whether the Group is seen in breach of applicable laws or is seen as causing, contributing to or being directly linked to the harm done, as defined in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n## Comment\n\nPeople are at the core of what the Volvo Group does. In the Volvo Group Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, human and labor rights issues such as mutual respect, non-discrimination, safe and  healthy  workplace,  freedom  of  association  and  collective bargaining, working hours and compensation, as well as modern slavery and child labor are emphasized.\n\n## COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\n## Non-compliance with data protection laws\n\nData protection laws apply to the Volvo Group in the jurisdictions in which Volvo operates. The EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), which became applicable from May 2018, has introduced increased monetary penalties for breaches of the regulation. Noncompliance with data protection laws could expose the Group to fines and penalties and severe infringements may potentially cause authorities to issue instructions to stop processing of personal data, which could disrupt operations. The Group could also be faced with litigations from persons allegedly affected by data protection violations. Data protection law infringements may hence involve severe negative impact for the business operations, including reputational damage and adverse effect on the Group's earnings and financial standing.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe data privacy area is closely monitored to identify improvement areas, as well as potential issues that may have a negative impact on the Volvo Group. The Code of Conduct emphasizes the importance of compliance with data protection legislation and a Volvo Group Data Privacy  Compliance  Program  has  been  established.  Further,  the Group Privacy Office (and connected network) manage implementation, monitoring and training in respect of the compliance program.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe Volvo Group owns or otherwise has rights to patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights that relate to the products and services that the Group manufactures and markets. These rights have\n\nbeen developed or acquired over a number of years and are valuable to the operations of the Volvo Group. Further, in order to safeguard investments in R&D, the Volvo Group has an intellectual property plan defining the creation and use of its intellectual property rights.\n\nThe share of trade in counterfeit goods as a proportion of global trade has grown significantly. Products infringing on Volvo Group's intellectual property rights are often of substandard quality and poses risks to the Group regarding the vehicle performance, like safety, quality and emission levels that will affect the climate, as well as the corporate brand reputation.\n\nAB Volvo and Volvo Car Corporation jointly own the Volvo brand and trademarks through Volvo Trademark Holding AB. AB Volvo has the exclusive right to use the Volvo name and trademark for its products and services and according to a license agreement. Similarly, Volvo Car Corporation has the exclusive right to use the Volvo name and trademark for its products and services. The Volvo Group's rights to use the Renault brand and trademarks are related to the truck operations only and are regulated by a license from Renault s.a.s., which owns the Renault brand and trademarks. In addition, the Volvo Group owns several other trademarks relating to its business. Use in possible conflict with third-party intellectual property rights, or third-parties' unauthorized use of the Volvo Group's proprietary rights, may have significant business impact on the Group.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group is continuously assessing intellectual property rights of third parties as well as possible infringements by third parties of the Group's intellectual property rights.",

        "page_content": "## Legal proceedings\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Volvo Group is involved in legal proceedings. These proceedings may relate to a number of topics, including vehicle safety and other product related claims, warranty claims, commercial disputes, intellectual property claims, allegations concerning health, environmental or safety issues, antitrust, tax or labor disputes and regulatory inquiries and investigations. Further, AB Volvo and other companies in the Group, as well as their officers, may be subject to claims alleging failures to comply with stock market regulations, securities law and other applicable rules and regulations. Legal proceedings can be expensive, lengthy, take up resources that could be used for other purposes and are often difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that provisions, where recognized, for a particular legal proceeding will cover the costs of an adverse outcome, nor that unprovisioned proceedings will not give rise to any significant additional expenditure. Information about certain legal proceedings involving entities within the Volvo Group, see Note 21 Other Provisions and in Note 24 Contingent Liabilities.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group has well-established structures and processes in place to evaluate and handle complaints and legal proceedings with the purpose of mitigating legal risks for the Group.\n\n## Corruption and non-compliance with competition law\n\nCorruption risks are primarily linked to the activities of the Volvo Group's business partners (distributors and sales agents), for which\n\nthe Group may be responsible, as well as to the behaviors of employees in situations in relation to public officials and other customer representatives. The overall risk level is also affected by the fact that Volvo pursues business operations in markets that are considered high-risk from a corruption perspective. Potential risks for noncompliance with competition law (e.g. price fixing, market sharing, unlawful information exchange, abuse of market power) are primarily linked to behavior of employees when interacting with competitors and other external stakeholders in various situations. Corruption as well as competition law infringements may involve severe negative impacts for the business operations, including reputational damage, legal proceedings, fines and imprisonment of employees. The Group could also be affected by claims raised by persons or entities affected by allegedly non-compliant practices.\n\n## Comment\n\nCorruption-related risks are managed via the Volvo Group's AntiCorruption Compliance Program, which consists of different mitigating activities including anti-corruption due diligence of business partners. This is to ensure that the Group selects the right business partners to prevent corrupt practices in connection with the sale of products and services. As regards to employees and contractors, the Code of Conduct emphasizes that Volvo employees and contractors may not participate in or endorse any corrupt practices. The Code of Conduct also emphasizes that the Group competes on the merit of products and services and do not take actions that are illegal under the competition laws, such as colluding with competitors. Also, regular training is provided.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n## Insurance\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Volvo Group generally takes out insurance coverage where it is legally or contractually obligated to do so and otherwise against such risks, in such amounts and on terms that it considers commercially motivated from time to time. Where insurance coverage cannot be procured on such terms, the Group can be exposed to material uninsured losses, which could have a materially adverse effect on Group operations and financial standing. For example, the Group has substantial operations in Japan that are not fully insured against effects from flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group strives to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and implement appropriate measures to mitigate identified risks to avoid, prevent, reduce or transfer the impact. This is a recurring process that adapts to changes in the risk and operational environment.\n\nThe Volvo Group is exposed to credit risk mainly through its sales to customers  in  the  Industrial  Operations,  and  its  long-term  credit receivables in its Financial Services operations. Total exposure as of December 31, 2020 can be found in Note 15 Customer-financing receivables, and Note 16 Receivables. The Group is also exposed to financial credit exposure due to short-term deposits with the Group's core banks and unrealized results from derivatives used for hedging purposes. For further information, please see Note 4 Goals and policies in financial risk management and Note 15 Customer- financing receivables. If several larger customers, dealers, or a core bank, fails to meet its undertakings the Group could suffer significant losses.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group has set clear principles for how to manage external customer  relationship,  including  customer  assessment,  how  to manage and measure exposure and mitigate risks, monitoring of the economic, political and industry conditions in each market, financ-",

The Group has several so-called CSA (Credit Support Annex) agreements in place in order to decrease credit exposure arising from hedge activities with financial derivatives.\n\n## Pension commitments\n\nThe Volvo Group has substantial pension commitments, some of which are owed under defined benefit plans. Changes in assumptions of interest and inflation rates, mortality, retirement age and pensionable remunerations could result in significant changes to the present value of already accrued benefit obligations as well as the cost of new benefit accruals, affecting funding level of such plans. The investment performance of pension assets may also substantially affect funding levels. Defined benefit plan assets are managed independently from the Group, with a significant portion of plan assets held in shares and other similar instruments that are exposed to market risks. Please see Note 20 Provisions for postemployment benefits for further information.\n\nIf there is a shortfall in benefit plans, the Volvo Group could be required to make substantial unexpected cash contributions, which would adversely affect cash flow and the Group's financial position.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe exposure is controlled in the short term by ensuring strict adherence to each plan's investment policy and by proactively implementing portfolio de-risking strategies when deemed necessary.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nVolvo Group's net financial debt structure is exposed to fluctuations in  market  interest  rates.  Movements  in  interest-rate  levels  may impact the Group's net income and cash flow or the value of financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Comment\n\nIndustrial Operation's interest-rate fixing for net financial debt is kept short, i.e. below six months, to leverage on the countercyclical relationship of short-term interest rates. Financial Services funding and lending shall be matched to mitigate undesired volatility in profitability due to interest-rate risk.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Volvo Group's global presence means that business is conducted in several different currency regions. More than 95% of the Group's net sales are generated in countries other than Sweden. The Volvo Group's cash flow, profitability, and balance sheet are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group strives to have sourcing and manufacturing located in the major markets which offsets structural currency exposures, and actively manages currency flows and translation risk to reduce the impact on profitability and cash flow.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIt is of critical importance for the Volvo Group to assure a sufficient payment capability over time, to continuously manage demands and expectations from external stakeholders.\n\nSudden changes in the business cycle, unforeseen events within the financial markets, changes in the Volvo Group's access to financial markets, and changes in customers' appetite for financing from the Group, may stress the Group's liquidity preparedness.\n\nFailure to properly manage the Group's liquidity risks, may cause material adverse impact on earnings capability and financial standing.\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Volvo Group ensures sound financial preparedness by always keeping a certain portion of its sales in liquid assets. A sound balance between short- and long-term debt maturities as well as long-term committed credit facilities and cash, are intended to secure liquidity preparedness and thus the Volvo Group's payment capability.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Volvo Group has substantial values in goodwill and other in tangible assets on its balance sheet. There is a risk for impairment if the calculated recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. Please see Note 12 Intangible assets. The calculated recoverable amounts differ between the operating segments and they are, to a varying degree, sensitive to changes in the business environment. Instability in the business performance and volatility in interest and currency rates may indicate a need for impairment.\n\n## Comment\n\nGoodwill and capitalized development cost not yet in use are evaluated yearly or at any indication of impairment. Other intangible assets, with finite useful lives, are evaluated in case of indication of impairment.",

The Volvo Group focuses on describing the accounting choices made within the framework of the prevailing IFRS standard and avoids repeating the actual text of the standard, unless the Volvo Group considers it particularly important to the understanding of the note's content. The following symbols I/S and B/S show if amounts in the notes can be found in the income statement or balance sheet. The total amount in tables and statements might not always summarize as there are rounding differences. The aim is to have each line item corresponding to the source and it might therefore be rounding differences in the total. Refer to the table below to see the note in which each accounting policy is applicable and the relevant IFRS standard with material impact.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Principles for consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the  parent  company, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies. Intra-group transactions as well as gains on transactions with joint ventures and associated companies are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n- Read more in Note 3 Acquisitions and divestment of shares and operations.\n- Read more in Note 5 Investments in joint ventures, associated companies and other shares and participations, about definitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.\n- Read more in Note 11 Non-controlling interest.\n\n## Translation to Swedish kronor when consolidating companies that have other functional currencies\n\nThe functional currency of each Volvo Group company is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the company operates. The primary economic environment is normally in which the company primarily generates and expends cash. The functional currency is in most cases, the currency in the country where the company is located. AB Volvo's and the Volvo Group's presentation currency is SEK. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, items in the income statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to SEK using monthly average exchange rates. Balance sheet items are translated into SEK using exchange rates at year end (closing rate). Exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.\n\nThe accumulated translation differences related to a certain subsidiary, joint venture or associated company are reversed to the income statement as a part of the gain/loss arising from disposal of the company or repayment of capital contribution from the company.\n\n## Receivables and liabilities in foreign currency\n\nReceivables and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity (foreign currencies) are translated to the functional currency using the closing rate. Exchange rate gains and losses arising from  operating  assets  and  liabilities  impact  operating  income  while exchange rate gains and losses arising from financial assets and liabilities impact other financial income and expenses. Interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities are defined as items included in the net financial position of the Volvo Group (see section Key ratios). Exchange rate differences\n\non loans and other financial instruments in foreign currency, which are used to hedge net assets in foreign subsidiaries and associated companies, are offset against translation differences in equity of the respective companies.\n\n- Read more in Note 4 Goals and policies in financial risk management, about currency exposure and currency risk management.\n\nThe most important exchange rates used in the consolidated financial statements are shown in table 1:1 .\n\n| Exchange rates   | Exchange rates   |   Average rate |   Average rate |   Closing rate  as of Dec 31 |   Closing rate  as of Dec 31 |\n|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Country          | Currency         |      2020      |      2019      |                    2020      |                    2019      |\n| Australia        | AUD              |         6.338  |         6.5724 |                       6.2646 |                       6.5125 |\n| Brazil           | BRL              |         1.8068 |         2.4007 |                       1.5715 |                       2.2979 |\n| Canada           | CAD              |         6.8603 |         7.1308 |                       6.3996 |                       7.1283 |\n| China            | CNY              |         1.3329 |         1.3691 |                       1.2537 |                       1.3333 |\n| Euro Zone        | EUR              |        10.4867 |        10.5888 |                      10.0375 |                      10.4336 |\n| Great Britain    | GBP              |        11.7981 |        12.0658 |                      11.0873 |                      12.2145 |\n| Japan            | JPY              |         0.0862 |         0.0868 |                       0.0792 |                       0.0853 |\n| Norway           | NOK              |         0.9786 |         1.0747 |                       0.9546 |                       1.0579 |\n| South Africa     | ZAR              |         0.5614 |         0.6548 |                       0.559  |                       0.6668 |\n| South Korea      | KRW              |         0.0078 |         0.0081 |                       0.0075 |                       0.0081 |\n| United States    | USD              |         9.2037 |         9.4604 |                       8.1886 |                       9.3171 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New accounting policies 2020\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, the Volvo Group has changed the classification of certain costs related to commercial customer commitments. This has caused a shift between the lines in the income statement for Industrial Operations as well as the Volvo Group, while Financial Services is not affected. Restated income statements for 2019 are disclosed in note 31.\n\nNo other new or revised accounting standards or interpretations effective from January 1, 2020 have significantly affected the Volvo Group's financial statements.\n\n## New accounting policies 2021 and later\n\nA number of accounting standards and interpretations have been published and is effective from 2021 and later.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IFRS 16\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 relates to the interest rate benchmark reform - phase 2 and provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the reform. The interest rate benchmark reform refers to the transition from current interest reference rate such as LIBOR to new benchmark interest rates. The Volvo Group closely follows the transition which will take place during 2021. The amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 will be applied when new interest rate benchmarks are incorporated in the underlying contracts which is expected to have taken place by the end of 2021. The amendment is effective from January 1, 2021.\n\nOther new and revised accounting standards or interpretations are not considered to have a material impact on the Volvo Group's financial statements.",

The preparation of AB Volvo's Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the recognized amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. In addition, the recognized amounts of net sales and expenses during the periods presented are affected.

Volvo Group measures acquired identifiable assets, tangible and intangible, and liabilities at fair value. Any surplus amount from the  purchase price, possible non-controlling interest and fair value of previously held equity interests at the acquisition date compared to the Volvo Group's share of acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill. Any deficit amount, known as gain from a bargain purchase, is recognized in the income statement.\n\nFor acquisitions done in stages, a business combination occurs only on the date control is achieved, which is also the time when goodwill is calculated. Transactions between the Volvo Group and owners with noncontrolling interest are recognized in equity as long as control of the subsidiary is retained. For each business combination, the Volvo Group decides whether the non-controlling interest shall be valued at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the net assets of the acquiree. All acquisition-related costs are expensed. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated as of the date of acquisition. Companies that have been divested are included in the consolidated financial statements up to and including the date of the divestment. Divestment of operations with the main purpose to dispose intangible and tangible assets is treated as disposal of intangible and tangible assets.\n\nIn a global group like the Volvo Group, processes are continuously ongoing regarding the sale of assets or groups of assets at minor values. When the criteria for being classified as an assets and liabilities held for sale are fulfilled and the asset or group of assets are of significant value, the asset or group of assets, both current and non-current, and the related liabilities are recog nized on separate lines in the balance sheet. The asset or group of assets are measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value after deductions for selling expenses. The balance sheet items and the potential income  effect  resulting  from  the  revaluation  to  fair  value  less  selling expenses are, if related to Industrial Operations, normally recognized in the segment Group functions & Other, otherwise in the Financial Services segment. When the sale is completed the result is distributed to the relevant  segments.\n\nAB Volvo's holding of shares in subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 is disclosed in note 13 Investments in shares and participations for the Parent Company. Significant acquisitions, formations and divestments for the Volvo Group are listed below.\n\n## Acquisitions during the period\n\nThe Volvo Group has not made any acquisitions during 2020 and 2019, which solely or jointly have had a significant impact on the Volvo Group's financial statements.",

The amounts mainly relate to the intended divestment  of  UD  Trucks  business  globally  from  the  Volvo  Group  to  Isuzu Motors. The delay in signing of the binding agreement to October 2020 has caused the period to complete the sale to be extended to more than 12 months from the initial reclassification. Based on the binding agreement the closing is expected during the first half of 2021. The transaction is  subject  to  certain  conditions,  including  approval  from  regulatory authorities.

The board of AB Volvo has adopted a financial risk policy that regulates how these risks should be controlled and governed and defines roles and responsibilities within the Volvo Group. The financial risk policy also establishes principles for how financial activities shall be carried out, sets mandates and steering principles for the management of financial risks as well as defines the financial instruments to be used for mitigating these risks. The board of AB Volvo is regularly informed about the development of the Volvo Group's financial risks and other matters covered within the financial risk policy. The financial risk policy is reviewed on an annual basis. The Volvo Group manages financial risk as an integrated element of\n\nthe business operations where parts of the responsibility for the finance operation and financial risk management are centralized to Volvo Group Treasury, the internal bank of the Volvo Group. The Volvo Group has managed to safeguard liquidity, perform financial activities and manage risk in accordance with the financial risk policy throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the financial markets. Information on the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic related to financial risks is included in the respective notes.\n\n- Read more in Note 30 Financial instruments about accounting policies for financial instruments.\n- Read  more in section Financial Management, page 64 and section Risks and uncertainties, page 68 about financial risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINTEREST RATE RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that changed interest rates will affect the Volvo Group's net income and cash flow (cash flow risk) or the fair value of financial assets and liabilities (price risk).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POLICY\n\nMatching the interest fixing terms of financial assets and liabilities reduces the exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to change/influence the interest fixing term for the Volvo Group's financial assets and liabilities. Currency interest rate swaps enable borrowing in foreign currencies from different markets without introducing currency risk. The Volvo Group may from time to time use other types of forward contracts (futures) and forward rate agreements (FRAs). Most of these contracts are used to hedge interest rate levels for current borrowing or investments.\n\n## Cash flow risks\n\nThe effect of changed interest rate levels on future currency and interest flows primarily pertains to Financial Services and Industrial Operations' net financial items. Financial Services measure the degree of match ing interest  rate  fixing  on  borrowing  and  lending.  The  calculation  of  the\n\nmatching degree excludes equity, which amounted to 8% in Financial Services. At year-end 2020, the degree of such matching ratio was 98% (99) in Financial Services which is in line with the Group policy.\n\nIn  addition to the financial assets in Financial Services, the Volvo Group's interest-bearing assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents. On December 31, 2020 the average interest on Industrial Operations financial assets was 0.2% (0.4). The Industrial Operations' results and profitability are closely aligned to the business cycle. Therefore, in order to minimize  the  interest  rate  risk,  outstanding  loans  had  interest  terms corresponding to an interest rate fixing of between one to three months. The average interest on Industrial Operations financial liabilities at year end amounted to 2.7% (4.4), including the Volvo Group's credit costs. The decrease primarily relates to the effect from the repayment of the first tranche of the hybrid bond in June 2020.\n\nTable 4:1 shows the impact on income after financial items in Industrial Operations' net financial position, excluding lease liabilities and pensions and similar obligations, if interest rates were to increase by 1 percentage point, assuming an average interest rate fixed term of three months on the liability side. 1 The impact on equity is earnings after tax.\n\n## Price risks  C\n\nExposure to price risk as a result of changed interest rate refers to financial assets and liabilities with a longer interest rate fixing term (fixed interest). This is not a risk for Industrial Operations since all outstanding loans are signed with a short interest rate fixing.\n\n- Read more in Note 20 Provisions for post-employment benefits regarding sensitivity analysis on the defined benefit obligations when changes in the applied assumptions for discount rate and inflations are made.",

Volvo Group Treasury is allowed to take limited active currency and interest rate positions in relation to the Financial Services portfolio. This responsibility is subject to, and shall be within, applicable market risk limitations. There are several measurements which can be used to define market risk. Volvo Group Treasury is using Value-at-Risk\n\n(VaR) as the main tool for mandating market risk (including interest rate risk, currency risk and liquidity risk). Volvo Group Treasury measures VaR over a one day holding period, using a 97.7% confidence level and historical volatility and correlation. The total VaR mandate for Volvo Group Treasury is SEK 150 M, and the usage is measured daily. As of December 31, 2020, the VaR usage was SEK 13.1 M (11.6).\n\nCURRENCY RISKS\n\n## CURRENCY RISKS B\n\nThe balance sheet may be affected by changes in different exchange rates.  Currency  risks  in  the  Volvo  Group's  operations  are  related  to changes in the value of contracted and expected future payment flows (commercial currency exposure), changes in the value of loans and investments (financial currency exposure) and changes in the value of assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries (currency exposure of equity).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POLICY\n\nThe aim of the Volvo Group's currency risk management is to secure cash flow from firm flows through currency hedges pursuant to the established Financial risk policy, and to minimize the exposure of financial items in the Volvo Group's balance sheet. Below is a presentation on how this work is conducted for commercial and financial currency exposure, and for currency exposure of equity.\n\n| Volvo Group's outstanding derivatives hedging commercial   currency risks December 31, 2020   |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Millions                                                                                      | USD/BRL |\n| Due date 2021                                                                                 | 10      |\n| Total local currency                                                                          | 10      |\n| Average contract rate                                                                         | 5.54    |\n| Market value of outstanding derivatives, SEK M                                                | 5       |",

Transaction exposure from commercial flows in foreign currency is generated from internal purchases and sales between manufacturing entities and market companies and external sales and purchases in foreign currency around the globe. As the predominant parts of the operations in the Volvo Group are situated outside Sweden, the fluctuations in currency rates affecting the transaction flows in foreign currency are in many cases not against SEK. Industrial Operations' transaction exposure from commercial flows for key currencies is presented in graph 4:5 . The graph represents the transaction exposure from commercial operating cash flows in foreign  currency, expressed as net surpluses or deficits in key currencies. The deficit in SEK and KRW is mainly an effect of manufacturing costs in the plants in Sweden and South Korea, but limited external revenues in those currencies. The surplus in EUR on the other hand, is the net of significant volumes of sales and purchases made between many entities around the globe in EUR. The surplus in USD is mainly generated from external sales to entities in the USA and emerging markets around the globe. The surplus in GBP is  generated from external sales to Great Britian.\n\nThe hedging of the Volvo Group's commercial currency exposure is executed centrally. The Volvo Group's consolidated currency portfolio exposure is the value of forecasted flows in foreign  currency. The Volvo Group only hedge the part of the forecasted portfolio that is considered highly probable to occur, i.e. firm flows, where the main parts will be realized within six months. The Volvo Group uses forward contracts and currency options to hedge the portion of the value of forecasted future payment flows in foreign currency. The hedged amount of firm flows for all periods fall within the framework of the Volvo Group's financial risk policy. The Covid-19 pandemic has created an uncertainty regarding forecasted flows in foreign currency with the consequence that the hedge activity has decreased substantially. Table 4:2 shows outstanding derivatives for the hedging of  commercial currency risks.\n\n## Translation exposure from the consolidation of operating income in\n\n## foreign  subsidiaries\n\nIn conjunction with the translation of operating income in foreign subsidiaries, the Volvo Group's income is impacted if currency rates change. The Volvo Group does not hedge this risk. Graph 4:7 shows the translation effect in key currencies when consolidating operating income for 2020 in foreign subsidiaries in the Volvo Group.\n\n- Read more in section Currency exposure of equity.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for transaction exposure 1\n\nThe table 4:3 illustrates the impact on operating income if key currencies for Volvo Group appreciate by 10% against all other currencies. Hedge accounting is not applied on derivatives hedging cash flows in foreign currency. As a consequence, the impact on equity equals the impact on operating income before tax.\n\n## Volvo Group currency review\n\nThe table and graphs 4:4 to 4:8 illustrate the transaction exposure and currency impact on operating income from commercial net flows in foreign currency , translation effect when consolidating operating income in foreign subsidiaries and currency impact on sales in key  currencies.\n\n- Read more about Volvo Group transaction exposure in section  Commercial currency exposure above.\n\n## Financial currency exposure\n\nLoans and investments in the Volvo Group's subsidiaries are performed mainly in local currencies through Volvo Group Treasury, which minimizes individual companies' financial currency exposure. Volvo Group Treasury uses various derivatives to facilitate lending and borrowing in different currencies  without  increasing  the  risk  for  the  Volvo  Group.  The  net financial position of the Volvo Group is affected by currency fluctuations since financial assets and liabilities are distributed among the Volvo Group companies that conduct their operations using different currencies.\n\n## Currency exposure of equity\n\nThe carrying amount of assets and liabilities in foreign  subsidiaries are affected by current exchange rates in conjunction with the translation of assets and liabilities to SEK. To minimize currency exposure of equity, the size of equity in foreign subsidiaries is continuously optimized with respect to commercial and legal conditions. Currency hedging of equity may occur in cases where a foreign subsidiary is considered overcapitalized. Net assets in foreign subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures amounted at year end 2020 to SEK 84 billion (90). The need to undertake currency hedging relating to investments in associated companies, joint ventures and other companies is assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOn the map on the previous pages the Volvo Group's net assets in different currencies (SEK bn) are displayed.\n\n- Read more in Note 30 Financial instruments about Volvo Group's policy choice on hedge accounting.\n\nany given time, so the actual effect of exchange rate changes may differ from the sensitivity analysis.

The credit portfolio should contain a distribution among different customer categories and industries. The credit risk is managed through active credit monitoring, follow-up routines and, where  applicable,  product  repossession.  Moreover,  regular  monitoring ensures that necessary allowances are made for expected credit losses on financial assets. Risk management practices and the impact on estimation uncertainty and critical judgement due to the Covid-19 pandemic for Financial Services are presented in note 15 Customer-financing receivables and for Industrial Operations in note 16 Receivables. Moreover, note 15 includes information on gross exposure for customer-financing receivables by past due status and in note 16 accounts receivables, a gross exposure for accounts receivables by past due status is presented in relation to allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nThe customer-financing receivables in the Volvo Group amounted to net SEK 129 billion (143) on December 31, 2020. The credit risk of this portfolio is distributed over a large number of retail customers and dealers.\n\nCollateral is provided in the form of the financed products. In the credit granting the Volvo Group strives for a balance between risk exposure and expected return.\n\nThe  Volvo  Group's  accounts  receivables  as  of  December  31,  2020 amounted to net SEK 36 billion (38).\n\n- Read more in Note 15 Customer-financing receivables about Volvo Group's concentration of credit risk in Financial Services.\n- Read more in Note 16 Receivables.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Volvo Group's financial assets are to a large extent managed by Volvo Group Treasury. All investments must meet the requirements of high liquid ity and low credit risk. According to the Volvo Group's financial risk policy, this includes using counterparties for investments and derivative transactions with a credit rating better or equivalent to A- from one of the well-established credit rating institutions or similar.\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  including  marketable  securities  as  of December 31, 2020 amounted to SEK 85 billion (62) and consists primarily of bank account positions.\n\nRead more in Note 18 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Financial counterparty risk\n\nThe use of derivatives involves a counterparty risk, in that a potential loss may not be possible to offset (in full or in part) against a potential gain if the counterparty fails to fulfill its part of the contract. The Volvo Group is actively working with limits per counterpart in order to reduce the risk for high net amounts towards individual counterparts. To reduce the expos ure further the Volvo Group enters into master netting agreements, so  called ISDA agreements, with all counterparts eligible for derivative transactions. The netting agreements provide the possibility for assets and lia bilities to be offset under certain circumstances, such as in the case of the counterpart's insolvency. A Credit Support Annex (CSA) often accompanies the ISDA agreement. The CSA stipulates the terms and conditions under which the two parties are required to make cash transfers to each other in order to further reduce the exposure from the net open positions. The netting agreements have no effect on the income statement or the financial position of the Volvo Group, since derivative transactions are accounted for on a gross basis. Table 4:9 shows the effect of netting agreements and cash transfers on the Volvo Group's gross exposure from outstanding interest and currency risk derivatives as of December 31, 2020.\n\n- Read more in Note 30 Financial instruments about the Volvo Group's gross exposure from positive derivatives per type of instrument.\n\n## The impact from netting agreements and cash transfers on the Volvo Group's gross exposure from derivatives as of Dec 31, 2020\n\n| SEK M                                                          | Gross amount   |   Netting  agreements | Cash   transfers   |   Net position | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|\n| Interest and currency risk derivatives reported as assets      | 6,050          |                  -864 | -4,428             |            758 | 87%      |\n| Interest and currency risk derivatives reported as liabilities | 1,357          |                  -864 | 0                  |            492 | 64%      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

A sound balance between current and non-current debt maturities, as well as non-current committed credit facilities, is intended to secure liquidity preparedness, and thus the Volvo Group's payment capability.\n\nThe Volvo Group's cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 85 billion (62) on December 31, 2020. In addition to this, granted but unutilized credit facilities amounted to SEK 42 billion (43). Graph 4:10 discloses expected future cash flows related to financial liabilities. Capital flow refers to expected payments of loans, lease liabilities and derivatives, see note 22 Liabilities. Expected interest flow refers to the future interest payments on loans, lease liabilities and derivatives based on interest rates anticipated by the market. The interest flow is recognized within cash flow from operating activities. The maturity structure of the unutilized credit facilities is disclosed in note 22, in table 22:3 . The predominant part of expected future cash flows that will occur in 2021 and 2022 is an effect of the Volvo Group's normal business cycle, with shorter duration in the portfolio within Financial Services compared to Industrial Operations.\n\nFinancial Services measure the degree to which the duration of borrowing and lending matches. The calculation of the matching degree excludes equity, which amounted to 8% in Financial Services. At year-end 2020, the degree of such matching was 98% (99) for the segment Financial Services, which was in line with the Volvo Group's policy. Volvo Group Treasury has, for practical as well as business reasons, the mandate to mismatch their portfolio for Financial Services between a matching ratio of 80-120%. At year-end 2020, the matching ratio was 99% (95). Any gains or losses from the mismatch impact the segment Group functions & other within industrial Operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OTHER PRICE RISKS\n\n## Commodity risks\n\nCommodity risk refers to the risk that changed commodity prices will affect the consolidated earnings within the Volvo Group. Procurement of commodities such as steel, precious metals and electricity are made in the Volvo Group on a regular basis where prices are set in the global markets.\n\nA hybrid bond amounting to EUR 1.5 billion was issued in the Volvo Group in 2014 in order to further strengthen the Volvo Group's balance sheet and prolong the maturity structure of the debt portfolio. The first tranche of this bond (EUR 0.9 billion) was repaid on June 10, 2020. The remaining tranche (EUR 0.6 billion) has a first call in 2023 and is classified as a loan with an original duration of 61.6 years, subordinated to all other financial liabilities currently outstanding.\n\n- Read  more  in Note 14 Leasing about the maturity for non-current lease  liabilities in table 14:4 .\n\nFuture cash flow including lease liabilities and derivatives related to non-current and current financial liabilities 1, 2\n\n4:10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1   In addition to derivatives included in graph 4:10 there are also derivatives in the Volvo Group related to financial liabilities with a positive fair value recognized as assets, which are expected to give a future capital flow of SEK 5.5 billion (1.3) and a future interest flow of SEK -0.1 billion (0.2).\n- 2  The interest payments related to the hybrid bond are included with an amount of SEK 0.9 billion (1.6), which pertains to the period through the first call date for the remaining tranche, in 2023. The interest payments that follow in the event that the call option is not exercised have as yet not been established.\n\n## POLICY\n\nChanges in commodity prices are included in the product cost calculation. Increased commodity prices are therefore reflected in the sales price of the Volvo Group's final products. Purchasing agreements with commodity suppliers  may  also  be  long-term  in  nature  or  structured  in  a  way  to decrease the volatility in commodity prices.",

A subsidiary is defined as an entity controlled by the Volvo Group. A subsidiary is controlled when the parent company has power over the investee, exposes over or hold rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and holds the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's return. Most of the Volvo Group's subsidiaries are 100% owned and are therefore considered to be controlled by the Volvo Group. For some subsidiaries there are restrictions on the Volvo Group's ability to access or use cash or cash equivalents from these subsidiaries.\n\n- Read more in Note 11 Non-controlling  interest.\n- Read more in Note 13 Investments in shares and participations in the parent company about the composition of the Volvo Group.\n- Read more in Note 18 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are companies over which the Volvo Group has controlling influence together with one or more external parties. Joint ventures are recognized by applying equity method accounting. The Volvo Group has holdings  in  a  few  joint  ventures  with  VE  Commercial  Vehicles,  Ltd., (VECV) being the significant holding. The investment in VECV is of a business-related nature and aims at strengthening the Volvo Group's position in India. VECV is included in the Trucks segment. During 2020, the Volvo Group, as part of Volvo Buses Transformation Program, divested Volvo Buses business in India to VECV. The Bus business has been integrated into VECV.\n\n## Associated companies\n\nAssociated companies are companies in which the Volvo Group has a significant influence. A strong indication of such influence is when the Group's holding is at least 20% but less than 50% of the voting rights. Holdings in associated companies are recognized in accordance with the equity method accounting. The ownership in the Chinese automotive manufacturer Dongfeng Commercial Vehicles Co., Ltd (DFCV) is classified as an associated company and is included in the Trucks segment.\n\nThe  Volvo  Group's  share  of  the  companies'  income/loss  recognized according to the equity method is included in the Volvo Group's income statement as income/loss from investments in joint ventures and associated companies. Where appropriate, the income has been reduced by depreciation of surplus values and the effect of applying different accounting policies has been taken into account. Income from companies recognized in accordance with the equity method is included in operating income  since  the  Volvo  Group's  investments  are  business  related  in nature. For practical reasons, some of the associated companies are included in the consolidated financial statements with a certain time lag, normally up to one quarter. Dividends from joint ventures and associated companies are not included in the consolidated income. The carrying amount of investments in joint ventures and associated companies are affected by the Volvo Group's share of the company's net income, less depreciation of surplus values and dividends received. Investments in joint ventures and associated companies are also affected by the Volvo Group's share of the company's other comprehensive income and by the translation difference from translating the company's equity in the consolidation of the Volvo Group. When applying the equity method and associates  or  joint  ventures  recognize  losses,  additional  impairment  losses might be recognized given any indication of impairment. For instance, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the shares is an indication of impairment. However, investments accounted for in accordance with the equity method cannot amount to a negative carrying value and losses are therefore not adjusted for if the holding is of a negative amount. Additional losses are provided for to the extent that the Volvo Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the joint venture or the associated company.\n\n## Other shares and participations\n\nOther shares and participations recognizes holding of shares in which the Volvo Group does not hold a significant influence. This generally means that the Volvo Group's holding of shares corresponds to less than 20% of the voting rights. Listed shares are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income since the shares are not held for trading. For unlisted  shares  and  participations,  a  fair  value  cannot  be  reasonably measured, hence these are measured at amortized cost. Earned or paid interest attributable to these assets is recognized in the income statement as part of net financial items, in accordance with the effective interest method. Dividends received attributable to these assets are recognized as income from other investments within operating income.\n\nRead more in Note 30 Financial instruments, regarding classification and valuation of financial instruments.",

The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing financial performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group Executive Board that makes strategic decisions.\n\nThe Volvo Group comprises ten business areas: Volvo Trucks, Mack Trucks, Renault Trucks, UD Trucks and JV's, Volvo Autonomous Solution, Volvo Construction Equipment, Volvo Buses, Volvo Penta, Arquus and Volvo Financial  Services.\n\nEach business area, except for the truck brands, Arquus, Volvo Autonomous Solution, is seen as a separate segment. Arquus is part of the segment Group functions & Other. On January 1, 2020 Volvo Autonomous\n\nSolution was created and the financial results are reported in the Trucks segment. The truck brands are seen as one segment since the operations are highly integrated, strategic allocation of resources are done to the total segment and the independence for each truck brand are lower compared to other  segments.  As  from  February  2021  a  new  business  area,  Volvo Energy, has been created and the financial result will be reported as part of the Trucks segment.\n\nThe Volvo Group has shared operations in both the Trucks segment and in the segment Group functions & Other. Shared operations for production, development and logistics for powertrain and parts are included in the Trucks segment. Volvo Group IT and Volvo Group Real Estate are seen as business support functions and are part of Group functions & Other. The cost of these operations is shared between the different business areas based on utilization according to principles set by the Volvo Group.\n\n| 2020                                                                         | Trucks   | Con- struction   Equipment   | Buses   | Volvo  Penta   | Group functions  & Other   incl. elim.   | Industrial  Operations   | Financial  Services   | Elimina- tions   | Volvo  Group   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|---------|----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Net sales, external  customers                                               | 206,198  | 81,230                       | 18,955  | 11,400         | 6,983                                    | 324,766                  | 13,679                | -

Revenue from vehicles and services are recognized when control has been transferred from Volvo Group to the customer. Control refers to the customers' ability to use vehicles or services in its operations and to obtain the associated cash flow related to the use. Vehicles and services are sold separately or as a combined offer. In combined offers where the vehicle and services are separable from each other and the customer can benefit from the vehicle and the service independently, the transaction price is allocated between vehicles and services based on stand-alone selling price according to price lists.\n\nThe  recognized  net  sales  in  Financial  Services  pertain  to  interest income related to finance leases and installment credits as well as income from operating lease contracts. Interest income are recognized during the underlying contract period and income from operating leasing is recognized over the leasing period.\n\n## Vehicles\n\nVehicles include sales of new vehicles, machines and engines as well as sales of used vehicles, machines, trailers, superstructures and special vehicles. A standard contractual warranty is included as part of the sales, read more in note 21 Other provisions about product warranty. The customer can pay for the vehicle at the point of sale or defer the payment by entering into agreements such as installment credits and finance lease.\n\nRevenue is recognized when the control of the vehicle has been transferred to the customer, normally at one point in time which is when the vehicle has been delivered to the customer. The value of rebates, returns and variable sales price have been considered as part of the revenue recognition.\n\nIf the sale of the vehicle is combined with a residual value commitment (buybacks and tradebacks) the criterion of transferring control is based on if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the option to return the vehicle or not. A significant economic incentive exists if the repurchase price is higher than the assessed fair market value i.e. net realizable value at the end of the residual value commitment period, or if the historical returns indicate that it is probable that the customer will return the vehicle at the end of the commitment period. Thus, the control has not been transferred and the sales transaction is recognized as an operating lease transaction. The revenue and expense are recognized over the residual value commitment period in the income statement. Assets under operating leases, a residual value liability, and a deferred lease income are recognized in the balance sheet. The asset is depreciated over the commitment period and the deferred lease income is recognized as revenue over  the  same  period.  The  residual  value  liability  amount  remains unchanged until the end of the commitment period. If the vehicle is returned at the end of the commitment period, the residual value liability is paid to the customer and the vehicle is reclassified from assets under operating lease to inventory.\n\n- Read more in Note 14 Leasing about lease income on assets under operating lease.\n\nIf the customer is not considered to have a significant economic incentive to return the vehicle, the sales transaction is recognized in accordance with the right of return model. Revenue corresponding to the sales amount less the buyback amount is recognized at the initial sale, as well as a pro-\n\nportionate share of cost of goods sold. The remaining revenue is recognized as a refund liability and the remaining cost of goods sold as a right of return asset during the commitment period. If the vehicle is not returned the refund liability is recognized as revenue and the right of return asset is recognized as cost of goods sold at the end of the commitment period.\n\n## Services\n\nServices  include  sale  of  spare  parts,  maintenance  services,  repairs, extended coverage and other aftermarket products. The control of the service has been transferred to the customer when the Volvo Group incurs the associated cost to deliver the service and the customer can benefit from the use of the delivered services. For spare parts, revenue is normally recognized at one point time, which is when it is delivered to the customer. For maintenance services and other aftermarket products, revenue is recognized over time, i.e. normally during the contract period. When payment for maintenance contracts is received in advance, the payment is recognized as a contract liability.\n\nServices also includes sales in Financial Services related to finance lease, installment credits and operating leases. During 2020, revenue from Financial Services operations amounted to SEK 13,960 M (14,870).\n\n- Read more in Note 6 Segment reporting regarding net sales by segment and market.\n- Read more in Note 14 Leasing about lease income on assets under operating lease and finance income om customer-financing receivables.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Sales with residual value commitments\n\nWhen the Volvo Group enters into sales transactions of vehicles with residual value commitments (buybacks and tradebacks) the judgment whether control has been transferred from Volvo Group to the customer and at what point in time revenue shall be recognized is critical. The judgment made is when a significant economic incentive exists or not for the customer to return the vehicle at the end of the commitment period. The assessment of significant economic incentive is performed at the inception of the contract and the outcome at the end of the commitment period can differ from the initial assessment. Factors that are considered and requires judgment is the assessed fair market value i.e. net realizable value at the end of the residual value commitment period and historical returns. The uncertainty due to Covid-19 and the macroeconomic development makes the judgment of the assessed fair market value even more difficult.\n\n- Read more in Note 13 Tangible assets for a description of residual value risks and the assessment of fair market value.\n\n## Variable sales price\n\nIn some sales transactions, the sales price is variable such as residual value guarantees. In assessing the variable sales price, the expected value method is used and revenue is recognized when it is highly probable that a reversal will not occur. Both the expected value method and the assessment of highly probable requires judgments to be able to make estimates. The estimates are made at the contract start with continuous assessment at each reporting period.",

The amount is specified in note 30 Financial Instruments in table 30:3 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nIncome tax for the period includes current and deferred taxes. Current taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax regulations prevailing in the countries where the group companies have operations.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized on differences that arise between the taxable value and carrying value of assets and liabilities as well as on tax-loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent it is probable that they will be utilized against future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities related to temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies are recognized in the balance sheet except when the Volvo Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference related to accumulated undistributed earnings and it is probable that a reversal will not be done in the foreseeable future.\n\nTax laws in Sweden and certain other countries allow companies to defer payment of taxes through allocations to untaxed reserves. In the Volvo Group financial statements, untaxed reserves give rise to temporary differences which are recognized as deferred tax liabilities.\n\nTax liabilities are recognized for income tax charges that are probable as a result of identified risks. Hence, when it is probable that the taxation authority or court will not accept an uncertain income tax treatment under tax law, adjustments of the tax liability are made for the estimated outcome. Tax claims for which no adjustment of the tax liability is  considered required are generally reported as contingent liabilities.\n\n- Read more in Note 24 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nThe Volvo Group recognizes deferred tax assets related to tax-loss carryforwards. The deferred tax assets are recognized based on a thorough assessment in order to ensure that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be generated in the coming years that will enable the tax-loss carryforwards to be utilized. The assessment is based on an evaluation of business plans. In addition, the possibility to offset tax assets and tax liabilities and the fact that the major part of the tax-loss carryforwards is related to countries with long or indefinite periods of utilization is considered. As a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic the evaluation of business plans for current year has been made on a more detailed level in order to evaluate potential risks. The evaluation has included potential limitations in time in certain markets.\n\nIf deferred tax assets related to tax-loss carryforwards are not expected to be realized based on current business plans, valuation allowances are recognized. If actual results differ from the business plans, or if business plans for future periods are adjusted, changes in the valuation allowance may  be  required.  Such  recognitions  and  adjustments  could  have  a significant impact on the financial position and the income for the period.\n\n## Uncertainty over income tax treatments and claims\n\nThe Volvo Group regularly evaluates income tax positions to determine if a tax liability or a contingent liability shall be recognized. The judgment is based on several factors, such as changes in facts and circumstances, the progress of the case and experience in similar cases. The actual outcome of income tax positions may deviate from the expected outcome and materially affect future financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Non-controlling interest equity is presented separately from the Parent Company's equity. In acquisitions, non-controlling interests are valued either at fair value or to a proportionate share of the acquired company's net assets. Ownership changes in non-controlling interests, not resulting in change of control, are recognized within equity.\n\nThe Volvo Group has a few non-wholly owned subsidiaries, of which Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co. (Lingong), in China, is the largest company with non-controlling interest. Owners with noncontrolling  interests hold a 30% shareholding in the company. During 2020,  the  profit  allocated  to  the  non-controlling  interest  in  Lingong amounted to SEK 742 M (614).

Goodwill is allocated and tested at the level of cash-generating units which are identified as the Volvo Group's operating segments. If the carrying amount of the tested cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The recoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is determined on the basis of value in use. The Volvo Group's valuation model is based on a discounted cash flow model, with a forecast period of five years. The valuation is based on a business plan which is an integral part of the Volvo Group's financial planning process and represents management's best estimate of the development of the Group's operations. Assumption of 2% (2) long-term market growth beyond the forecast period and the Group's expected performance in relation to this environment is a basis for the valuation. In the model, the Volvo Group is expected to maintain stable capital efficiency over time. Other parameters considered in the calculation are operating income, mix of products and services, expenses and level of capital expenditures. The Volvo Group uses a discount rate at 10% (10) before tax for 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the recoverable amount of Volvo Group's operations exceeded the carrying amount for all operating segments, thus no impairment was recognized. The Volvo Group has also analyzed whether a negative adjustment of several percentage points on the used assumptions for discount rate and operating income would result in impairment for goodwill, however none of the operating segments would be impaired as a result of this analysis. The operating parameters applied in the valuation are based on management's strategy and could indicate higher value than historical performance for each operating segment. Furthermore, the Volvo Group is operating in a cyclical industry why performance could vary over time.\n\nThe headroom differs between the operating segments why they are sensitive to changes in the assumptions described above to a varying degree. Therefore, the Volvo Group continuously follows the performance of the operating segments whose headroom is dependent on the fulfillment of the Volvo Group's assessments. Instability in the recovery of the market and volatility in interest and currency rates may lead to indications of a need for impairment. The most important factors for the future operations of the Volvo Group are described in the Volvo Group operating segment section, as well as in the Risk management section.\n\n## Research and development\n\nExpenditures for the development of new products and software are recognized as intangible assets if such expenditures, with a high degree of certainty, will result in future financial benefits for the company. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets.\n\nThe rules require stringent criteria to be met for these development expenditures to be recognized as assets. For example, it must be possible to prove the technical functionality of a new product or software prior to its development expenditure being recognized as an asset. In normal cases, this means that expenditures are capitalized only during the industrialization phase of a product development project. Other research and development costs are recognized in the income statement as incurred.\n\nThe  Volvo  Group  has  developed  a  process  for  conducting  product development projects, which has six phases focused on separate parts of\n\nthe  project.  Every  phase  starts  and  ends  with  a  reconciliation  point, known as a gate, for which the criteria must be met for the project's decision making committee to allow the project to progress to the next phase. During the industrialization phase, the industrial system is prepared for serial production and the product is launched. A corresponding process is developed for software development.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include trademarks, distribution networks, licenses and other rights. When participating in industrial projects in partnership with other companies the Volvo Group in certain cases pays an entrance fee to participate. These entrance fees are capitalized as intangible assets.\n\n## Amortization and impairment with finite useful life\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life. Amortization is based on the cost of the assets, adjusted by impairments when applicable and estimated useful lives. Amortization is recognized in the respective function to which it belongs, meaning that amortization of product development is part of the research and development expenses in the income statement. Impairment tests for amortizable assets are performed if there are indications of impairment. In addition, for capitalized development cost for products and software not yet in use, impairment tests are performed annually. If the recoverable amount of the asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognized and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The value in use is measured as the discounted future cash flows, which the asset is expected to generate either by itself or from the lowest cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\n## Amortization periods\n\n| Trademarks                       | Max 5 years   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Distribution networks            | 10 years      |\n| Product and software development | 3 to 8 years  |\n| Other intangible assets          | 3 to 5 years  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nImpairment testing of goodwill and capitalized development cost not yet in use are performed annually and in case of indication of impairment. Other intangible assets, with finite useful lives, are tested in case of indication of impairment. As the outbreak of Covid-19 is an event and indication of impairment, additional impairment tests on both goodwill and capitalized development cost have been conducted during 2020 to reflect the uncertainties and estimated impact on the financial performance of the Volvo Group. When conducting impairment tests, estimates have to be made to determine the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units. The  recoverable  amount  is  based  upon  management's  projections  of future cash flows, which are generally based on internal business plans and forecasts. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions made are reasonable, there are uncertainties which could materially affect the valuations. As described in the accounting policy for goodwill, headroom differs between the operating segments and they are, to a varying degree, sensitive to changes in assumptions and the business environment.",

Investment  properties  are  properties  owned  for  the  purpose  of obtaining rental income and appreciation in value. Investment properties are recognized at cost. For disclosure purposes, information regarding the estimated fair value of investment properties is based on an internal discounted cash flow projection as relevant observable market inputs for the assets are not available. The required return is based on current property market conditions for comparable properties in comparable locations. Hence, the applied valuation method to measure fair value is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and there have not been any changes in valuation method during the year. Land contains land and land improvements. Machinery and equipment consists of production related assets such as machinery, type-bound tools and other equipment. Construction in progress are assets under construction and advanced payments. Rightof-use assets relates to lease contracts with the Volvo Group as a lessee.\n\nAssets under operating leases are mainly owned by the Volvo Group. These transactions are accounted for as operating lease transactions and consists  of  contractual  operating  lease  agreements  with  customers within Financial Services and rental fleet which are assets used in a fleet for rental business within Industrial Operations. Some rental fleet assets are leased by the Volvo Group and later sub-leased to customers as operating leases. Sales with residual value commitments within Industrial Operations are also recognized within assets under operating leases.\n\nRead more in Note 7 Revenue about sales with residual value  commitments.\n\nRead more in Note 14 Leasing about right-of-use assets and assets under operating leases.\n\n## Depreciation and impairment\n\nProperty, plant, equipment and investment property are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the cost of the assets, adjusted by residual value when applicable, and estimated useful lives. Right-ofuse assets are generally depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Assets under operating leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the contract period. During the contract period, the depreciable amount is adjusted by accelerated depreciation and/or write-downs. The adjustment is recognized through the income statement to correspond to estimated future net realizable value to continuously reflect potential residual value risks at the end of the contract period. Depreciation is recognized in the respective function to which it belongs. Impairment tests are performed if there are indications of impairment by calculating a recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset's fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use.\n\n## Depreciation periods\n\nType-bound tools\n\n3 to 8 years\n\n- Operating leases, rental fleet\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nSales with residual value commitments\n\n3 to 5 years\n\n- Machinery and equipment\n\n5 to 20 years\n\n- Buildings and investment properties\n\n20 to 50 years\n\n- Land improvements\n\n20 years\n\n13:1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Impairment of tangible assets\n\nImpairment tests are performed if there is any indication that a tangible asset has been impaired. The impairment tests are based on estimation of the recoverable amount of the asset, or the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. To determine the recoverable amount, projections of future cash flows are used, which are based upon internal business plans and forecasts. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions made are reasonable, there are uncertainties which could materially affect the valuations.\n\n## Residual value risks\n\nVolvo Group is exposed to residual value risks related to assets under operating leases which is the risks that the Volvo Group in the future would have to dispose used vehicles at a loss if the price development of these products is worse than what was expected when the contracts were entered. The assessment of residual value risks is based upon an estimation of the used vehicle's future net realizable value (fair market value). The estimated future net realizable value of the vehicles at the end of the contract period is monitored individually on a continuing basis. Thus, a decline in prices for used vehicles may negatively affect the Volvo Group's operating income. High inventories in the truck industry and the construction equipment industry and low demand may have a negative impact on the prices of new and used vehicles. In monitoring estimated net realizable value of each vehicle included as assets under operating leases, management considers current price level of the used product model. The price level is impacted by value of optional equipment, mileage, current condition, future price deterioration due to expected change of market conditions, alternative distribution channels, inventory leadtime, repair and reconditioning costs, handling costs, indirect costs associated with the sale of used vehicles and legislative demands. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, an extensive analysis has been made during 2020 to evaluate the effects on used vehicles estimated net realizable value. A prolongation or worsening of the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to further price pressure and/or an increase of the return rate for used vehicles, which may give rise to accelerated depreciation and/or write-downs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the vehicle is returned by the end of the residual value commitment period or the leasing period, the vehicle is reclassified back to inventory.\n\nThe acquisition value of investment properties at year-end amounted to SEK 93 M (91). Reclassifications amounted to SEK 0 M (0). Accumulated depreciation amounted to SEK 33 M (28) at year-end, of which SEK 4 M (4) refers to 2020. The net carrying value amounted to SEK 60 M (63). The estimated fair value of investment properties amounted to SEK 91 M (94) at year-end and 97% (98) of the area available for lease was leased out during the year. Operating income was affected by rental income from investment properties that amounted to SEK 11 M (11) and direct costs that amounted to SEK 7 M (7).\n\n| Tangible assets,   Acquisition cost   | Property, plant, equipment   and investment property   | Property, plant, equipment   and investment property   | Property, plant, equipment   and investment property   | Property, plant, equipment   and investment property   | Property, plant, equipment   and investment property   | Assets under operating   leases 1   | Assets under operating   leases 1   | Assets under operating   leases 1          |                         |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                       | Buildings                                              | Land                                                   | Machinery  and equip- ment                             | Construc- tion in   progress                           | Right- of-use  assets 1                                | Operating  leases                   | Rental  fleet                       | Sales w.  residual  value  commit- ments 2 | Total  tangible  assets |\n| Opening balance 2019                  | 39,423                                                 | 12,514                                                 | 85,591                                                 | 5,801                                                  | -

Sales with residual value commitments (buybacks and tradebacks) are also accounted for as operating lease transactions when the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the option to return the vehicle and the control therefore has not been transferred to the customer. Operating lease agreements are recognized as tangible assets in assets under operating leases and are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if needed. The cost of an asset comprises the acquisition value and any initial direct costs related to the contract. Depreciation of the asset is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. During the period the depreciable amount is adjusted through the income statement by depreciations or write-downs to correspond to the estimated future realizable value to reflect residual value risks at the end of the contract period. Lease income is equally distributed over the contract period and recognized within net sales.\n\n- Read  more in Note 7 Revenue, about sales with residual value commitments.\n- Read  more in Note 13 Tangible assets, about residual value risks related to assets under operating lease.\n\nFinance leases are offered from Financial Services. As Industrial Operations  manufacture  the  vehicles  which  are  leased  from  Financial Services to the customers, the Volvo Group is acting as a manufacturer lessor. Hence, a finance lease asset gives rise to a selling profit which is recognized within Industrial Operations. Finance lease contracts are recognized  as  non-current  and  current  customer-financing  receivables within Financial Services. The asset is measured at an amount equal to the net investment in the finance lease contract corresponding to the gross investment (future minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value) discounted with the rate in the finance lease contract and reduced by unearned finance income and allowance for expected credit losses. Assessment of allowance for expected credit losses is reflected in the valuation of customer-financing receivables and recognized at initial recognition and reassessed during the contract period. Lease income is recognized as interest income within net sales in Financial Services. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are recognized as income as they occur. Payments received from finance lease contracts are distributed between interest income and amortization of the receivable.\n\nRead  more in Note 15 Customer-financing receivables, about finance leases.\n\n## Volvo Group as the lessee\n\nLease contracts are recognized as right-of-use (RoU) assets as well as interest-bearing lease liabilities in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recognized within other loans and are measured by the present value of future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted by using a rate reflecting what the Volvo Group would have to pay to borrow funds to acquire a similar asset, with similar collateral and similar term. RoU assets are presented as tangible assets and are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if needed. The cost of an RoU asset contains the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments\n\nmade before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received. Moreover, any initial direct costs are included as well as an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling, removing or restoring the underlying asset. The leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or over the useful life of the underlying asset if the ownership is transferred to the Volvo Group at the end of the lease term. The lease expense is recognized as depreciation of the asset within operating income and interest expense within the finance net. Payments made are  distributed between interest paid and amortization of the lease liability.\n\nLease contracts with the Volvo Group as the lessee are primarily contracts of real estate (such as office buildings, warehouses and dealer premises), company cars and production related assets. For real estate and company car leases, service components are normally a considerable portion of the contracts and are therefore separated. The service components are recognized as operating expenses and not included in the RoU asset and the lease liability. For other lease contracts, both the leased asset and services are included in the RoU asset and the lease liability.\n\nIf a lease contract includes variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate, or include a low value asset or has a lease term that is twelve months or less, the lease payments are recognized as operating expenses as they occur.\n\nDuring 2020, IASB added an exemption for lessees regarding accounting for Covid-19 related rent concessions. The Volvo Group does not apply the exemption since the lease modifications that have been negotiated as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Volvo Group during the year have not been material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets\n\nWhen entering a lease contract, judgments related to contract scope, lease term and interest rate used when discounting future lease payments are made which affects the measurement of the lease liability and the RoU asset.\n\nAssessment of contract scope includes judgments whether a leased asset and/or a service component is identified in the contract. In combined  contracts,  the  total  contract  amount  is  allocated  between  the leased asset and the service by using a market stand-alone price.\n\nWhen determining the lease term of a contract, judgments are also required. The lease term includes the non-cancellable period. If the Volvo Group is reasonably certain to use an option to extend the lease, or not to use an option to terminate the lease in advance, this is also considered. The contracts contain a range of different conditions. Extension and termination options are mainly related to real estate leases. Thus, all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to include optional periods are evaluated. The importance of the underlying asset in the operations and its location, availability of suitable alternatives, significant leasehold improvements, level of rentals in optional periods compared to market rates as well as past practice are examples of factors included in the assessment. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and are reassessed if an option is exercised.\n\nJudgments are also required to determine the interest rate when discounting future lease payments and whether the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined and thereby used, or if the Volvo Group's incremental borrowing rate should be used.",

The contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest and are valued at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Finance lease contracts are valued at amortized cost, for further information on recognition and classification see note 14 Leasing.\n\nThe Volvo Group is applying the simplified expected credit loss model for customer-financing receivables, under which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The allowance is recorded at initial recognition and is reassessed during the contract period.\n\nInterest income on customer-financing receivables is recognized within net sales, mainly within Financial Services. Changes to the allowance for expected  credit  losses  are  recognized  in  other  operating  income  and expense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Allowance for expected credit losses\n\nThe assessment of allowances for expected credit losses on customerfinancing receivables is dependent on estimates including assumptions regarding past dues, repossession rates and quality level of repossessed collateral.\n\nA collective assessment is made for customer-financing receivables that are not credit impaired. The assets are grouped based on shared risk characteristics such as type of customer, geographical area, initial credit risk rating, collateral type and date of initial recognition to evaluate the credit  losses  collectively.  Historical  information  regarding  credit  loss experience is used to forecast future losses, adjusted for  current and forecasted conditions in the different regions based on management's evaluation of macro-level and portfolio-level factors, such as GDP, oil prices, unemployment rates etc.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the assessment process has been intensified. The collective assessment for customer-financing receivables that are not credit impaired is reviewed and adjusted on a more detailed level, in order to identify individual segments in each market that are significantly impacted by the pandemic, to forecast future losses on those individual segments. As a critical part in the collective assessment, the largest customers in each market are reviewed individually based on the financial condition of each customer and the value of the underlying collateral. The impact from government programs and modifications through extended payment terms is taken into consideration and is monitored closely for on-going payment performance and signs of impairment. Worst case scenarios from historical information regarding credit loss experience is also used in order to estimate the potential impact of the pandemic.\n\nOverall, in the collective assessment the historical information regarding credit loss experience is still used as a base and is adjusted based on information from the detailed assessment from the largest customers. This provides a basic understanding of how the pandemic is impacting customers in various segments in each market to estimate expected credit losses on the rest of the customer-financing receivables portfolio.\n\nAn individual assessment is made for credit impaired customer-financing receivables based on the financial condition of the customers and the value of the underlying collateral and guarantees. The Volvo Group  considers a\n\nfinancial asset credit impaired if it meets one or more of the following criteria; when there are indications that the customer is unlikely to pay, such as bankruptcy filing, unauthorized transfer of collateral, at surrender of collateral etc. or, at the latest, when the customer fails to make contractual payment within 90 days of when the receivable falls due.\n\n## Risk management practices\n\nOther than the dealer financing, customer-financing receivables extend over several years, but normally the customers make monthly payments throughout the term to reduce the outstanding exposure. The customerfinancing receivables are secured by the financed commercial vehicles and equipment. However, in the case of customer default, the value of the repossessed  commercial  vehicles  and  equipment  may  not  necessarily cover the outstanding financed amount. In order to mitigate this risk, Financial Services has strong portfolio management processes based on prudent credit approval, active monitoring of individual loan performance, utilization of in-house and external collections, portfolio segmentation analysis, and on-going monitoring of the economic,  political and industry conditions in each market. In addition, other credit enhancements such as down payments, personal guarantees, credit insurance, liens on other property owned by the borrower etc. may be required at the time of origination or when there are signs of impairment. When customer- financing receivables exceed 90 days of overdue collateral repossession is initiated, although there may be circumstances where repossession is  initiated earlier. When the collateral is repossessed, the net realizable value is established and the vehicle is transferred to inventory and becomes part of the Volvo Group's normal business activity of selling used vehicles and equipment and the expected loss on the customer-financing receivable is written off. If repossession has not occurred on customer-financing receivables exceeding 180 days of overdue the expected loss on the receivable is written off. Financial Services continues to engage in enforcement activity on all customer financing- receivables written off during the year to attempt to recover the contractual amount not previously received from the customer.\n\nDuring 2020, a significant part of the customer-financing receivables has been modified through extended payment terms which is also delaying  the  individual  assessment  for  credit  impaired  customer-financing receivables. The amortized cost on customer-financing receivables before modifications amounted to SEK 38.6 billion. The typical modification provided to customers are reduced or zero payments for approximately three months with the original yield on the contract.\n\nRead more in Note 4 Goals and policies in financial risk management, for a description of credit risks, interest risks and currency risks.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total allowances for expected credit losses in Financial Services amounted to 2.07% (1.51) of the total credit portfolio in the segment. This reserve ratio is used as an important measure for Financial Services and includes operating leases and inventory. Allowances for expected credit losses for customer-financing receivables has increased since the beginning of the year from SEK 2,343 M to SEK 2,900 M primarily due to the impact from the many disruptions in the economies around the world due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This has impacted all markets and segments in Financial Services. Most of the increase in the allowance for expected credit losses due to the pandemic is recognized in customer financing-receivables not credit impaired as specific customers have not yet been identified as credit impaired. The main reason is that a significant part of the portfolio is modified through extended payment terms, which is delaying any potential impairment.",

        "page_content": "During the end of this year the majority of the customers have come to an end of their modification periods and have resumed to original payment levels. So far, the customers are generally able to make their payment obligations as a result of the extensions, increased government support programs and the financial recovery for companies during the modification periods  provided  by  Financial  Services  and  other  obligors.  Increased transport and construction activity in the second half of 2020 have also been beneficial for their financial situation. However, it is still expected that a number of customers will have difficulties to survive with the full impact of the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and when the government support programs no longer exist. The allowance for expected credit losses on credit impaired customer financing-receivables  is  expected  to  increase  during  next  year  as  customers  become impaired and at the same time the corresponding allowance for expected credit losses on customer financing-receivables not credit impaired will be released.\n\n- Read more in Note 30 Financial instruments, for information on the gain or loss recognized in the operating income arising from derecognition of customer-financing receivables in table 30:3 .\n\nTable 15:6 represents the gross credit exposure on customer-financing receivables within the Volvo Group per age interval. The lifetime expected credit  loss  allowance  for  customer-financing  receivables  not  credit im paired amounted to SEK 2,289 M (1,982) and allowance for customerfinancing receivables credit impaired amounted to SEK 611 M (361), included in tables 15:4 and 15:5 . The remaining exposure was secured by liens on the financed commercial vehicles and equipment and, in certain circumstances, other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees, credit insurance, liens on other property owned by the borrower etc. Collaterals taken in possession that meet the criteria for recognition in the balance sheet amounted to SEK 155 M (278) as of December 31, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECEIVABLES\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nReceivables are recognized at amortized cost. The Volvo Group is applying the simplified expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, under which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The allowance is recorded at  initial recognition and is reassessed during the contract period. Changes to the allowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivables are recognized in other operating income and expense.\n\n- Read more in Note 30 Financial instruments in section derecognition of financial assets, for receivables subject to discounting activities.\n\n## Concentration of credit risk\n\n## Customer concentration\n\nThe ten largest customers within Financial Services account for 5.6% (6.8) of the total asset portfolio. The rest of the portfolio is attributable to a large number of customers and the credit risk is therefore spread across many customers. During 2020 SEK 6.8 billion (11.3) of customer financing receivables were syndicated in order to reduce concentration risks.\n\n## Concentration by geographical market\n\nGraph 15:7 discloses the concentration of Financial Services portfolio divided into geographical markets.\n\n- Read more in Note 4 Goals and policies in financial risk management about credit risks.\n- Read more in the Board of Directors' report about Financial Services' development during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Allowance for expected credit losses\n\nAccounts receivables are short term by nature and consequently the risk assessment horizon is short. A collective assessment is made on accounts receivables not credit impaired. Historical information regarding credit loss experience is used to forecast future losses, adjusted for  current and forecasted  conditions.  An  individual  assessment  is  made  on  credit impaired accounts receivables based on the financial condition of the customer. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the assessment process has been intensified. All Volvo Group entities have revisited their model for expected credit losses, taking into consideration the impact from the many disruptions in the economies around the world due to the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic, as well as from the significant government support measures  implemented,  when  making  allowances.  Due  to  the  significant changes in market conditions, the high level of uncertainty and the variation in impact on different markets and regions, individual assessments have increased.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management practices\n\nCredit risks are managed through active credit monitoring and follow-up routines in accordance with the Volvo Group Credit management directive. This directive includes different steps to perform when an invoice is not paid at due date. When a credit risk is verified, for example through a bankruptcy, or when an allowance has been unchanged for two years and it can be demonstrated that all required steps have been performed the allowance is reversed and the accounts receivables are written off. Apart from certain exceptions the Volvo Group continues to engage in enforcement activity even after a write-off in order to recover the contractual amount not previously received.\n\nDuring the spring of 2020 renegotiated receivables increased, but during the autumn the amounts returned to prior levels and as per December 31, 2020 there is no significant impact on either the credit risk or the income statement. Renegotiated receivables continue to be closely monitored for on-going payment performance and signs of impairment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total allowance for expected credit losses for accounts receivables amounted to 2.12% (2.64) of total accounts receivables.\n\n- Read more in Note 4 Goals and policies in financial risk management,\n\nregarding credit risk.\n\n| Non-current

The standard costs are tested regularly and adjustments are made based on current conditions. Manufacturing costs are based on normal capacity utilization which are allocated to inventory while unabsorbed cost due to changes in production volume are recognized in the income statement as incurred. Costs for research and development, selling, administration and financial expenses are not in cluded.\n\nNet realizable value is calculated as the selling price less costs attributable to the sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Write down of inventories\n\nThe calculation of net realizable value involves estimation of a future sales price, which is dependent on several parameters, such as market demand, model changes and development of used products prices. Due to the Covid-19  pandemic,  a  thorough  analysis  has  been  conducted  during 2020 to consider the uncertainties due to capacity utilization and impact on new and used vehicles estimated net realizable value.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated as income for the period attributable to the owners of AB Volvo, divided by AB Volvo's average number of outstanding shares for the fiscal year. If during the year there were potential shares redeemed or expired, they are also included in the average number of shares used to calculate the earnings per share after dilution.\n\nDue to the extraordinary situation as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic the Annual General Meeting, held on June 18, 2020, resolved that no payment of dividend will be made and that the entire amount available will be carried forward. The Meeting further resolved to adopt the Board of Directors' proposal  to  reduce  the  share  capital  by  way  of  cancellation  of  the com pany's approximately 95 million own shares and an increase of the share capital by way of a bonus issue, without any issue of new shares, in order to restore the share capital.\n\nThe share capital of the Parent company is divided into two series of shares, A and B. Both series carry the same rights, except that each Series A share carries the right to one vote and each Series B share carries the right to one tenth of a vote. The shares' quota value is SEK 1.26 (1.20). During 2020 AB Volvo converted a total of 8,070,990 Series A shares to Series B shares.

The Volvo Group's defined benefit plans relate mainly to subsidiaries in the USA and comprise both pensions and other  benefits,  such  as  healthcare.  Other  large-scale  defined  benefit plans apply to white collar employees in Sweden (mainly through the ITP pension plan) and employees in France, Great Britain and Belgium.\n\nActuarial calculations are made for all defined benefit plans in order to determine the present value of the obligation for benefits vested by its current and former employees. The actuarial calculations are prepared annually and are based upon actuarial assumptions that are determined at the balance sheet date each year. Changes in the present value of obligations due to revised actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments constitute remeasurements.\n\nProvisions for post-employment benefits in the Volvo Group's balance sheet correspond to the present value of obligations at year-end, less fair value of plan assets. All changes in the net defined liability (asset) are recognized when they occur. Service cost and net interest expense (income) are recognized in the income statement, while remeasurements such as actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. Special payroll tax is included in the  pension liability in pension plans in Sweden and  Belgium.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, expenses for premiums are recognized in the income statement as incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\n## Assumptions when calculating post-employment benefits\n\nProvisions and costs for post-employment benefits, mainly pensions and health care benefits, are dependent on actuarial assumptions. The actuarial assumptions and calculations are made separately for each defined benefit plan. The most significant assumptions are discount rate and inflation. Inflation  assumptions  are  based  on  an  evaluation  of  external  market indicators. A sensitivity analysis is included in graph 20:6 and shows the effect on the defined benefit obligations if significant assumptions are changed. There are also other assumptions made such as salary increases, retirement rates, mortality rates, health care cost trends rates and other factors. The salary increase assumptions reflect the historical trend, the near-term and long-term outlook and assumed inflation. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on officially available mortality statistics. Healthcare cost trend assumptions are based on historical data as well as the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The Volvo Group has engaged a global actuary in order to ensure that a professional assessment is made and that assumptions are consistently developed across jurisdictions. The actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually by the Volvo Group and  modified when deemed appropriate.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has indirectly impacted the net financial position of the defined benefit pension plans via movements on the financial markets. Lower discount rates, following Covid-19 measures taken by central banks, have adversely impacted the obligation, in particular for plans in the USA and Great Britain. Return seeking asset classes have been exceptionally volatile during 2020, impacting the net provision by material amounts during the year, mainly in Sweden and Belgium.\n\nThe following tables disclose information about defined benefit plans. The Volvo Group recognizes the difference between the obligations and the plan assets in the balance sheet. The disclosures refer to assumptions applied for actuarial calculations, recognized costs during the financial year and the value of obligations and plan assets at year-end. The tables also include a reconciliation of obligations and plan assets during the year.\n\n| Assumptions applied for   actuarial   calculations              | Dec 31, 2020   | Dec 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Sweden                                                          |                |                |\n| Discount rate, % 1                                              | 1.45           | 1.70           |\n| Inflation, %                                                    | 1.75           | 1.75           |\n| Expected salary increase, %                                     | 2.40           | 2.90           |\n| Assumed life expectancy on   retirement at age 65 (Male/Female) |                |                |\n| Retiring today (member age 65), year                            | 20.9/23.5      | 20.90/23.5     |\n| Retiring in 25 years   (member age 40 today), year              | 22.7/24.6      | 22.70/24.6     |\n| USA                                                             |                |                |\n| Discount rate, % 1,2                                            | 0.53-2.42      | 2.06-3.27      |\n| Inflation, %                                                    | 2.20           | 2.20           |\n| Expected salary increase, %                                     | 3.00-3.50      | 3.00-4.10      |\n| Assumed life expectancy on   retirement at age 65 (Male/Female) |                |                |\n| Retiring today (member age 65), year                            | 20.5/22.2      | 20.67/22.44    |\n| Retiring in 25 years   (member age 40 today), year              | 22.3/24.0      | 22.65/24.44    |\n| France                                                          |                |                |\n| Discount rate, % 1                                              | 0.87           | 0.70-1.20      |\n| Inflation, %                                                    | 1.50           | 1.50           |\n| Expected salary increase, %                                     | 2.50           | 3.00           |\n| Great Britain                                                   |                |                |\n| Discount rate, % 1                                              | 1.40           | 2.05           |\n| Inflation, %                                                    | 2.90           | 2.75           |\n| Expected salary increase, %                                     | 0.00           | 0.00           |\n| Assumed life expectancy on   retirement at age 65 (Male/Female) |                |                |\n| Retiring today (member age 65), year                            | 22.0/23.7      | 21.71/23.51    |\n| Retiring in 25 years   (member age 40 today), year              | 23.8/26.3      | 23.97/26.30    |\n| Belgium                                                         |                |                |\n| Discount rate, % 1                                              | 0.81           | 1.10           |\n| Inflation, %                                                    | 1.50           | 1.50           |\n| Expected salary increase, %                                     | 2.52           | 2.55           |\n\n20:1\n\n- 2  For all plans except three the discount rate used is within the range 1.97-2.42% (2.92-3.27).",

The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assump tion while holding all other assumptions constant.

Depending on specific plan and benefit design, the sensitivity effect on the obligation differs for the respective assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Costs for the period, post-employ- ment  benefits other than pensions   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current year service costs                                              | 86     | 123    |\n| Interest costs                                                          | 142    | 187    |\n| Interest income                                                         | -28    | -25    |\n| Past service costs                                                      | -15    | 6      |\n| Gain/loss on settlements                                                | -      | -      |\n| Remeasurements                                                          | 79     | 30     |\n| Total costs for the period                                              | 265    | 322    |",

The plan is semi-closed, meaning that only new employees born before 1979 enters the ITP2 solution. The Volvo Group's pension foundation in Sweden was formed in 1996 to secure obligations relating to retirement pensions for white collar workers in Sweden in accordance with the ITP plan. Plan assets amounting to SEK 2,456 M were contributed to the foundation at its formation, corresponding to the value of the pension obligations at that time. Since its formation, net contributions of\n\n20:9\n\nSEK 6,332 M, whereof SEK 1,998 M during 2020, have been made to the foundation. The plan assets in the Volvo Group's  Swedish pension foundation are invested in Swedish and foreign stocks and mutual funds, and in interest-bearing securities and alternative assets, in accordance with a strategic allocation that is determined by the foundation's Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the foundation's plan assets amounted to SEK 17,871 M (14,662), of which 45% (47) was invested in equity instruments. At the same date, retirement pension obligations attributable to the ITP plan amounted to SEK 26,048 M (23,492).",

Furthermore, a credit insurance policy must be taken out for the value of the obligations. In addition to benefits relating to retirement pensions, the ITP plan also includes, for example, a collective family pension, which the Volvo Group finances through an insurance policy with the Alecta insurance company. According  to  an  interpretation  from  the  Swedish  Financial  Reporting Board, this is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. For the fiscal year 2020, the Volvo Group did not have access to information from Alecta that would have  enabled this plan to be recognized as a defined benefit plan. Accordingly, the plan has been recognized as a defined contribution plan. The Volvo Group estimates it will pay premiums of about SEK 303 M to Alecta in 2021. The collective consolidation level measures the apportionable assets in relation to the insurance commitment. According to Alecta's consolidation policy for defined benefit pension insurance, the collective consolidation level is  normally allowed to vary between 125% and 175%. Alecta's preliminary consolidation ratio amounts to 148% (148). If the consolidation level falls short or exceeds the normal interval, one measure may be to increase the contract price for new subscription or to introduce premium reductions.\n\nThe Volvo Group's share of the total saving premiums for ITP2 in Alecta as of December 31, 2020 amounted to 0.18% (0.31) and the share of the total number of active policy holders amounted to 1.78% (1.76).\n\nAll employees in Sweden benefit from a jubilee awards plan according to which they receive a certain number of shares after they have rendered 25, 35 and 45 years of services. This plan is accounted for as a sharebased payment program, where the fair value of the equity-settled payments is determined at the grant date. No payment from the jubilee awards plan as of year 2020 have been done due to the circumstances under the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore the allotment of the jubilee shares has been postponed to a future occasion.\n\n## USA\n\nIn the USA, the Volvo Group has tax qualified pension plans, post- retirement medical plans and non-qualified pension plans. The tax qualified pension plans are funded while the other plans are generally unfunded. There are five funded defined benefit plans, whereof three are closed, one is partially closed and one is open to new entrants. All plans are open for future accruals. The Volvo Group's subsidiaries in the USA mainly secure their pension obligations through transfer of funds to pension plans. The US Retirement Trust manages the assets related to the five funded plans. The strategic allocation of plan assets must comply with the investment policy as decided by the Board of Directors of the Trust. All members of the board are nominated by the company although each member is subject to strict regulatory requirements on fiduciary responsibility. At the end of 2020, the total value of pension obligations secured by pension plans of this type amounted to SEK 19,560 M (21,816). At the same point in time, the total value of the plan assets in these plans amounted to SEK 20,917 M (22,301), of which 11% (12) was invested in equity instruments. The  regulations for securing pension obligations  stipulate certain minimum  levels concerning the ratio between the value of the plan assets and the value of the obligations. During 2020, the Volvo Group contributed SEK 0 M (0) to the USA pension plans.\n\n20:10\n\n20:11",

        "page_content": "## France\n\n## Investment strategy and risk management\n\nIn  France,  the  Volvo  Group  has  two  types  of  defined  benefit  plans, Indemnit\u00e9 de Fin de Carri\u00e8re (IFC) and jubilee awards plan. The plans are unfunded. The IFC is compulsory in France. The benefits are based on the Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  applicable  in  the  company,  on  the employee's seniority at retirement date and on the final pay. The benefit payment is due only if employees are working for the company when they retire. The jubilee award plan is an internal agreement and the benefit is based on the employee's seniority career at 20, 30, 35 and 40 years. As of December 31, 2020, the total value of pension obligations amounted to SEK 2,680 M (2,733).\n\n## Great Britain\n\nIn Great Britain, the Volvo Group has five defined benefit pension plans, which are all funded. The pension funds are set up as separate legal entities, which are governed by a professional trustee for all schemes. All plans are closed to new entrants and closed for future accruals to existing members.\n\nThe allocation of plan assets must comply with the investment strategy agreed between the company and the professional trustee. For three of the plans, if a net surplus is recognized in the balance sheet when the pension scheme runs-off, the Volvo Group has an unconditional right to the surplus of that plan or plans. For two plans this is not strictly legally the case and therefore an asset ceiling is applied.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the total value of pension obligations amounted to SEK 7,533M (8,068). The total value of the plan assets in these plans amounted to SEK 7,480M (8,040).\n\nDuring 2020, the Volvo Group has made extra contributions to the pension plans in Great Britain in the amount of SEK 147M (60).\n\n## Belgium\n\nIn Belgium, the Volvo Group has four traditional defined benefit pension plans based on final salary, whereof one is closed to new entrants. All plans are open for future accruals. Two are funded via own pension fund and two are funded via the group insurance product referred to in Belgium as Branch 21. Benefits are paid as a lump sum at retirement. There is also a local profit sharing program whereby any pay-outs are contributed to a defined contribution pension plan managed by the own pension fund or through a group insurance. All defined contribution pension plans in Belgium have a statutory minimum return guarantee and are therefore accounted for as defined benefit plan. The strategic asset allocation of plan assets must comply with the investment policy as decided by the Board of Directors of the pension fund. All board members of the pension fund are nominated by the company. At the end of 2020, the total value of pension obligations amounted to SEK 3,750 M (3,562). At the same point in time the plan assets of these plans amounted to SEK 2,804 M (2,685). During 2020 the Volvo Group contributed SEK 209 M (174) to the Belgium pension plans.\n\nThe Volvo Group manages the allocation and investment of pension plan assets with the purpose of meeting the long term objectives. The main objectives are to meet present and future benefit obligations, provide sufficient liquidity to meet such payment requirements and to provide a total return that maximizes the ratio of the plan assets in relation to the plan liabilities by maximizing return on the assets at an appropriate level of risk. The final investment decision often resides with the local trustee, but the investment policy for all plans ensures that the risks in the investment portfolios are well diversified. The primary risk mitigating activity in the long run is to close defined benefit plans to new entrants or to future accruals for existing members and replace with defined contribution plans when and where possible. The risks related to already accrued pension obligations, e.g. longevity and inflation, as well as buy out premiums and matching strategies are monitored on an ongoing basis in order to further limit the Volvo Group's exposure where and when possible.\n\nIn the last couple of years, some of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants and replaced by defined contribution plans in order to reduce risk for the Volvo Group.\n\nIn Sweden, the minimum funding target is decided by PRI Pensionsgaranti. This is mandatory in order to stay in the system and get insurance for the pension liability. The contributions usually represent one year's new accrued benefits plus any shortfall towards the minimum funding target unless there is a surplus according to local scheme valuation principles.\n\nIn the USA, the minimum funding target is decided by the  company in order to avoid penalties, keep flexibility and avoid extensive filing with the Internal Revenue Service and participants. The minimum contributions usually represent one year's accrued benefits plus a seventh of any deficit unless a scheme is showing a surplus according to local scheme valuation principles.\n\nIn Great Britain, there is no minimum funding ratio. There is a regulatory requirement for each scheme to perform triennial valuations whereby any scheme showing a deficit must develop a recovery plan that returns the scheme to a fully funded basis within a reasonable timeframe. The recovery plan shall be agreed with the company and submitted to the regulator for approval.\n\nIn Belgium, the minimum funding level is regulated by law and monitored by the financial supervisory authority, FSMA. The framework for the minimum funding requirement is based on a discount rate, which is based on the expected return of the plan assets. The pension fund must be fully funded on this basis at all times. The contribution policy of the pension fund is designed to provide stability in contributions over the duration of the plan.\n\nIn 2021, the Volvo Group estimates to transfer an amount of SEK 0.51.5 billion to pension plans.",

When these criteria are not met, a contingent liability may be recognized.\n\n## Provisions for product warranty\n\nProvisions  for  product  warranty  are  recognized  as  cost  of  sales  and include contractual warranty and campaign warranty. Provisions for contractual warranty are recognized when the products are sold. Provision for campaigns in connection with specific quality problems are recognized when the campaign is decided.\n\n## Provisions for technical goodwill\n\nTechnical goodwill is coverage in excess of contractual warranty or campaigns which is accepted as a matter of policy or normal practice in order to maintain a good business relation with the customer. The provisions for technical goodwill are determined based on historical statistics for customers where a constructive obligation exists.\n\n## Provisions for extended coverage\n\nAn extended coverage is a product insurance sold to a customer to cover a product according to specific conditions for an agreed period as an additional  insurance  to  the  factory  contractual  warranty.  The  provision  is intended to cover the risk that the expected cost of providing services under the extended coverage contract exceed the expected revenue.\n\n## Provisions in insurance operations\n\nVolvo Group has a captive insurance company and the provisions in insurance operations are related to third party claims addressed to companies within the Volvo Group. The claims reserve also includes a provision for unreported  losses  based  on  past  experience.  The  unearned  premium reserve is reported as an accrued expense within other current liabilities.\n\n## Provisions for restructuring costs\n\nA provision for decided restructuring measures is recognized when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when this plan is communicated to those who are affected. A provision and costs for termination benefits as a result of a voluntary termination program is recognized when the employee accepts the offer. Normally restructuring costs are included in other operating income and expenses.\n\n## Provisions for residual value risks\n\nResidual value risks are the risks that the Volvo Group in the future would have to dispose used vehicles at a loss if the price development of these products is worse than expected when the contracts were entered. The residual value risks pertain to operating lease contracts and sales transactions with residual value commitments (buybacks and tradebacks) where the Volvo Group has a residual value commitment. The majority of these contracts are recognized as assets under operating leases or as right of return asset in the balance sheet. During the period, the depreciable amount is adjusted through the income statement to correspond to estimated future net realizable value to continuously reflect potential residual value risks at the end of the contract period.\n\nRead more in Note 13 Tangible assets about residual value risks.\n\nResidual value commitments that are independent from the sales transaction are not recognized as assets under operating leases or as right of return in the balance sheet, hence the potential residual value risks related to these contracts are recognized as provisions. To the extent the residual value exposure does not meet the definition of a provision, the gross exposure is reported as a contingent liability.\n\nRead more in Note 24 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets.\n\n## Provisions for service contracts\n\nService contracts offer the customer preventive maintenance according to an agreed service plan. The provision is intended to cover the risk that the expected cost of providing services and repairs under the service contract exceeds the expected revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOURCE OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND CRITICAL JUDGMENTS\n\nThe uncertainties about the amount or timing of outflows vary for different kind of provisions. Regarding provisions for product warranty, technical goodwill, extended coverage, residual value risks and service contracts, the provisions are based on historical statistics and estimated future costs, why the provided amount has a high correlation with the outflow of resources. Regarding provisions for disputes, like tax and legal disputes, the uncertainty is higher.\n\n## Provisions for product warranty\n\nWarranty provisions are estimated with consideration of historical statistics with regard to known changes in warranty claims, warranty periods, the average time-lag between faults occurring until claims are received by the company and anticipated changes in quality indexes. The actual outcome of product warranties may deviate from the expected outcome and materially affect the warranty costs and provisions in future periods. Re funds from suppliers, that decrease the Volvo Group's warranty costs, are recognized to the extent these are considered to be certain.\n\n## Provisions for legal proceedings\n\nThe Volvo Group regularly reviews the development of significant outstanding legal disputes in which the Volvo Group companies are parties, both regarding civil law and tax disputes, in order to assess the need for provisions and contingent liabilities in the financial statements. Among the factors that the Volvo Group considers in making decisions on provisions and contingent liabilities are the nature of the dispute, the amount claimed, the progress of the case, the opinions of legal and other advisers, experience in similar cases, and any decision of the Volvo Group's management as to how the Volvo Group intends to handle the dispute. The actual outcome of a legal dispute may deviate from the expected outcome of the dispute. The difference between actual and expected outcome of a dispute  might  materially  affect  future  financial  statements,  with  an adverse impact upon the Volvo Group's operating income, financial position and liquidity.\n\nProvisions for legal disputes are included within other provisions in table 21:1 .\n\nRead more in Note 24 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For more information see below.\n\nThe Volvo Group has detected that an emissions control component used in certain markets and models, may degrade more quickly than expected, affecting the vehicles emission performance negatively. The Volvo Group made a provision of SEK 7 billion impacting the operating income in 2018, relating to the estimated costs to address the issue. Negative cash flow effects started in 2019 and will gradually ramp up in the coming years. The Volvo Group will continuously assess the size of the provision as the matter develops.\n\nTo adjust its operations to lower demand due to the Covid-19  pandemic, the Volvo Group reduced the white-collar workforce globally during 2020. A provision for restructuring charges of SEK 3,200 M was recognized in the second quarter whereof SEK 992 M was released in the fourth  quarter.\n\nOther provisions mainly includes provisions for  legal disputes, provisions for externally issued credit guarantees and other  provisions, unless separately specified and commented in the table and text.\n\nLong-term provisions as above are expected to be settled within 2 to 3 years.",

A hybrid bond issued by the Volvo Group is classified as debt in the Volvo Group's financial reporting as it constitutes a contractual obligation to make interest payments and repay the nominal amount of the debt to the holder of the instrument.\n\n## Non-current liabilities\n\nThe tables below disclose the Volvo Group's non-current liabilities with the largest loans listed by currency.

Alternatively, there is a present obligation that does not meet the definitions of a provision or a liability as it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.\n\nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events that will be confirmed by uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Volvo Group. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n| Contingent liabilities                              | Dec 31, 2020   | Dec 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Credit guarantees issued for   customers and others | 4,419          | 2,944          |\n| Tax claims                                          | 4,008          | 4,653          |\n| Residual value commitments                          | 795            | 1,118          |\n| Other contingent liabilities                        | 4,610          | 5,017          |\n| Total contingent liabilities                        | 13,832         | 13,732         |\n\n24:1\n\nTotal contingent liabilities at December 31, 2020, amounted to SEK 13,832 M (13,732).\n\nCredit guarantees issued amounted to SEK 4,419 M (2,944). The recognized amount for credit guarantees corresponds to the gross exposure and has not been reduced by the value of counter guarantees received or other collaterals such as the right to repossess the products. The value of counter guarantees and other collaterals reducing the exposure is dependent on the development of used products prices and on the possibility to repossess the products.\n\nA major part of the credit guarantees pertains to the credit guarantees related  to  Chinese  dealers  and  retail  customers  within  Construction Equipment. The increase compared to last year is mainly an effect of higher sales in Construction Equipment in China.\n\nTax claims amounted to SEK 4,008 M (4,653) and pertain to charges against the Volvo Group for which the criteria for recognizing a tax liability or a provision were not met. Global companies such as the Volvo Group are occasionally involved in tax processes of varying scope and in various stages. Volvo Group regularly assesses these tax processes. When it is probable that additional taxes must be paid and the outcome can be reasonably  estimated, the required provision is made. Out of total tax claims, SEK 1.2 billion (1.8) is related to a transfer price audit in Brazil and SEK 1.0 billion (1.2) to a custom duties audit in India. The decrease in Brazil is due to exchange rate effects.\n\nResidual value commitments amounted to SEK 795 M (1,118) and were attributable to sales transactions with residual value commitments (buybacks and tradebacks) that are independent from the sales transaction and therefore not recognized as assets in the balance sheet. The amount corresponds to the gross exposure and has not been reduced by the estimated net selling price of used products taken as collaterals. To the extent the used products pertaining to those transactions are expected to be disposed at a loss, a provision for residual value risk is recognized.\n\nRead more in Note 21 Other  provisions about provisions for residual value risks.\n\nOther contingent liabilities amounted to SEK 4,610 M (5,017) and include for example bid and performance clauses and legal proceedings.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nIn January 2011, the Volvo Group and a number of other companies in the truck industry became part of an investigation by the European Commission regarding a possible violation of EU antitrust rules. The Volvo Group co-operated fully with the European Commission in the investigation. In July 2016, the Volvo Group reached a settlement with the European Commission in the investigation. Following the adoption of the European Commission's settlement decision, the Volvo Group has received and will be defending itself against numerous private damages claims brought by customers and other third parties alleging that they suffered loss by reason of the conduct covered in the decision. The claims are being brought in various countries by claimants either acting individually or as part of a wider group or class of claimants. Further claims are likely to be commenced. At this stage it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of any liability that could arise from any such proceedings. An adverse outcome or outcomes of some or all of the litigation, depending on the nature and extent of such outcomes, may have a material impact on the Volvo Group's financial results.\n\nThe Volvo Group is also involved in a number of legal proceedings other than those described above. The Volvo Group's assessment is that such other legal proceedings in aggregate are not likely to entail any risk of having a material effect on the Volvo Group's financial position.\n\n## Detected premature degradation of emissions control component\n\nThe Volvo Group has detected that an emissions control component used in certain markets and models, may degrade more quickly than expected, affecting the vehicles emission performance negatively. The Volvo Group has made a provision that will be continuously assessed as the matter develops.\n\nRead more in Note 21 Other   provisions.\n\nTotal contingent assets at December 31, 2020 amounted to SEK 1,252 M (0) and is related to a tax credit in Brazil.",

During the vesting period, the incentive program is recognized as an expense and as a short-term liability.\n\n## Policy for remuneration to senior executives, approved by the Annual General Meeting on 18 June 2020\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2020 decided upon the following policy on remuneration and other terms of employment for the members of the Volvo Group Executive Board.\n\nThese guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after the proposed adoption of these guidelines by the 2020 annual general meeting. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting. Any new share-based incentive plans will, where applicable, be resolved by the general meeting, but no such plan is currently proposed.\n\n## The guidelines' promotion of the Volvo Group's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\n\nIt is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Volvo Group's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, that the Group can recruit, retain and develop top executives. These guidelines enable AB Volvo to offer Executives a competitive total remuneration. More information regarding the Volvo Group's business strategy is available in the Volvo Group Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\n## Types of remuneration\n\nVolvo Group remuneration to Executives shall consist of the following components: base salary, short-term and long-term variable incentives, pension benefits and other benefits.\n\nShort-term incentives may, for the President & CEO, amount to a maximum of 100 per cent of the base salary and, for other Executives, a maximum of 80 per cent of the base salary.\n\nLong-term incentives may, for the President & CEO, amount to a maximum of 100 per cent of the base salary and, for other Executives, a maximum of 80 per cent of the base salary. The current long-term incentive plan for the Group's top executives, including the Executives, was introduced in connection with the 2016 annual general meeting. The objective of the program is to align the interests of the top executives with those of the Group shareholders. The program does that by a combination of a performance based award and a requirement to purchase and hold AB Volvo shares. The program is funded on an annual basis by an award, measured  against  performance  criteria  established  by  the  Board  of Directors. The after tax portion of this payment must be immediately invested in AB Volvo shares which must be held for a minimum of three years. In this way, the top executives are rewarded for the performance of the Group each year, and will have a vested interest over the longer term in changes in the value of the shares. At the end of the three year period, top executives may sell their shares, if they meet the requirement for owning shares valued at two years of the pre-tax base salary for the President & CEO and one year of the pre-tax base salary for the other Executives.\n\nFurther cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis, either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining Executives, or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 per cent of the annual base salary. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.\n\nFor the President & CEO, pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan except where law or collective agreement would require a defined benefit pension. The pensionable salary shall include base salary and short-term incentives. The pension contributions for the President & CEO attributable to the annual base salary shall amount to not more than 35 per cent of the base salary, and contributions attributable to short term incentives shall not exceed the corresponding proportion.\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, life insurance, medical and health insurance, and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 3 per cent of the annual base salary for the President & CEO.\n\nFor other Executives, pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution except where law or collective agreement require a defined benefit pension. The pensionable salary shall include base salary and short-term incentives. The pension contributions for other Executives attributable to the annual base salary shall amount to not more than 40 per cent of the base salary and contributions attributable to short term incentives shall not exceed the corresponding proportion.\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, life insurance, medical and health insurance, and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the annual base salary for other Executives.\n\nRemuneration for Executives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\nIn addition to remuneration set out above, Executives who relocate for the purposes of the position or who work in other multiple countries may also receive such remuneration and benefits as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances associated with such arrangements, taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group applicable to cross border work.\n\n## Termination of employment\n\nUpon termination of an Executive's employment, the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Base salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the base salary for two years.\n\nExecutives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be offered notice periods for termination and severance payment as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances, taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group.",

        "page_content": "## Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration, etc.\n\nShort-term and long-term incentives shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria. The criteria - which for example may relate to EBIT, cash flow, return on capital employed or similar ratios, or sustainability targets - shall be devised to promote the Volvo Group's strategy and long-term  value  creation  and  strengthen  the  link  between  achieved performance targets and reward. The criteria for short-term and long-term incentives shall be determined by the Board of Directors annually. The satisfaction of the criteria shall be measured over periods of one year each.\n\nTo which extent the criteria for awarding variable remuneration has been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant measurement period has ended. The Board of Directors is responsible for the determination of variable remuneration to all Executives.\n\n## Claw-back and adjustments\n\nExecutives participating in the Volvo Group's current short-term and longterm incentive plans are obligated, in certain circumstances and for specified periods of time, to repay, partially or in its entirety, variable incentive awards already paid if payments have been made by mistake or been based on intentionally falsified data or in the event of material restatement of the Volvo Group's financial results. Furthermore, the Board of Directors may decide on adjustments of pay-out under the incentive plans (before payment has been made) in case of extraordinary circumstances or to adjust for unforeseen one-timers.\n\n## Salary and employment conditions for employees\n\nIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines, the Board has considered that the various benefits offered to the Executives need to be aligned with the general structures applicable for employees of AB Volvo at levels that are competitive in the market. Thus, salary and employment conditions for other AB Volvo employees have been taken into account by including information thereon in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate.\n\n## The decision-making process to determine,\n\n## review and implement the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Com-\n\nmittee shall also monitor and evaluate plans for variable remuneration for Executives, the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Group. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of AB Volvo and its executive management. The President & CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.\n\n## Derogation from the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Volvo Group's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the Group's financial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.\n\n## Description of material changes to the guidelines\n\nDue to new legislation passed in 2019, the guidelines for executive remuneration decided by the 2020 annual general meeting are more detailed than before. In addition, the short-term and long-term incentives may be linked to EBIT, cash flow, return on capital employed or similar ratios, or sustainability targets, instead of EBIT and cash flow only.\n\n## Fees paid to the Board of Directors\n\nAccording to a resolution adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2020, fees to the Board of Directors appointed at the Annual General Meeting for the period until the close of the Annual General Meeting 2021 remain unchanged meaning that the Chairman of the Board should be awarded SEK  3,600,000  (3,600,000)  and  each  of  the  other  members  SEK 1,060,000 (1,060,000) with exception of the President and CEO of AB Volvo, who does not receive a director's fee. In addition, SEK 380,000 (380,000) should be awarded to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and SEK 175,000 (175,000) to each of the other members of the Audit Committee, and SEK 160,000 (160,000) to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and SEK 115,000 (115,000) to each of the other members  of  the  Remuneration  Committee.

Transaction expenses are included in the assets' fair value, except in cases in which the change in value is recognized in the income statement. The transaction costs that arise in conjunction with the admission of financial liabilities are amortized over the term of the loan as financial cost.\n\nA financial asset is derecognized from the balance sheet at maturity and when all  significant risks and benefits related to the asset have been transferred to a third party.\n\nThe fair value of financial assets is determined based on valid market prices, when available. If market prices are unavailable, the fair value is determined for each asset through the use of various measurement techniques.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is classified based on the degree that market values have been utilized when measuring fair value. The majority of financial instruments measured at fair value held by Volvo Group is classified as level 2. The valuation of level 2 instruments is based on market conditions using quoted market data existing at each balance sheet date. The basis for the interest is the zero-coupon-curve in each currency which is used to calculate the present value of all the estimated future cash flows. For forward exchange contracts the basis is the forward premium based on current spot rate for each currency and future date. The fair value is then discounted based on the forward rates as per the balance sheet date. Shares and participations are classified as level 1 for listed shares and level 3 for non-listed shares. Call options are classified as level 3 and are based on the Black & Scholes option pricing formula.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nCustomer-financing receivables are held as part of a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows. The contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest and are valued at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. In this category the Volvo Group also includes accounts receivables and holding of shares in non-listed companies for which a fair value cannot reasonably be determined. The carrying value for financial assets measured at amortized cost has been analyzed and compared with an estimated fair value. The carrying value is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\n- Read more in Note 5 Investments in joint ventures, associated  companies and other shares and participations.\n- Read more in Note 15 Customer-financing receivables.\n- Read more in Note 16 Receivables.\n\nIn this category the Volvo Group includes holding of shares in listed companies as the shares are not held for trading. Changes in fair value is measured through other comprehensive income and amounted to SEK -8 M (48).\n\n- Read more in Note 5 Investments in joint ventures, associated companies and other shares and participations.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nVolvo Group's financial assets and liabilities held for trading are recognized at fair value through the income statement. As  presented in table 30:1 , these instruments are derivatives, used for hedging interest and currency risks and marketable securities, further presented in note 18 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\nDerivatives used for hedging interest rate exposure in the customerfinancing portfolio within Financial Services as well as the debt portfolio in Industrial Operations are included in this section. Unrealized gains and losses from fluctuations in the fair value of the financial instruments are recognized in other financial income and expenses. The Volvo Group intends to hold these derivatives to maturity, which is why, over time, the market valuation will be offset by the interest-rate fixing on borrowing and lending in Financial Services, and thus not affect net income or cash flow.\n\nFinancial  instruments  used  for  hedging  currency  risks  arising  from future firm commercial cash flows are also recognized in this section. Realized result and unrealized revaluation of derivatives are recognized in other financial income and expenses to be able to net all internal flows before entering into external derivatives to hedge future currency risk. When hedging future cash flows for specific orders the classification in the income statement is decided on a case by case basis. In 2020, gains and losses from derivatives hedging currency risks for specific orders of SEK -47 M (-35) have been recognized in operating income and SEK 63 M (-54) in other financial income and expenses.\n\n- Read more in Note 9 Other financial income and expenses.\n\nHedge Accounting is not applied by the Volvo Group.\n\n## Information regarding carrying amounts and fair values\n\nIn table 30:1 , carrying amounts are compared with fair values for all of the Volvo Group's financial instruments.",

        "page_content": "## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Volvo Group is involved in discounting activities to reduce financial risks. An evaluation is performed to establish whether substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred to an external party when entering into an  agreement.  The  Volvo  Group's  intention  is  not  to  be  involved  in discounting activities if not substantially all the risks and rewards can be transferred to an external party. As of December 31, 2020, there were no transferred financial assets in the Volvo Group that did not fulfill the requirements for derecognition.\n\nFinancial assets for which substantially all risks and rewards have been transferred  are  derecognized  from  the  Volvo  Group's  balance  sheet. Involvement in these assets is reflected in the Volvo Group's  balance sheet as part of the external credit guarantees. They are recognized at fair value as provisions in the balance sheet and amounted to SEK 0.1 billion (0.1).\n\nThe Volvo Group's maximum loss exposure is considered being the total recourse relating to transferred assets that are part of the recognized credit\n\nguarantees, i.e. the total amount the Volvo Group would have to pay in case of default of the customers. The likelihood for all customers going into default at the same time is considered to be low. The gross exposure for the Volvo Group amounted to SEK 4.4 billion (2.9) related to credit guarantees issued for customers and others and is part of the Volvo Group's contingent liabilities. This amount has not been reduced by the value of counter guarantees received or other collateral such as the right to repossess products.\n\n- Read more in Note 21 Other provisions.\n- Read more in Note 24 Contingent Liabilities.\n\n## Gains, losses, interest income and interest expenses from financial instruments\n\nIn the table below outstanding derivatives hedging currency and interest rate risks are presented.\n\n30:2\n\nTable 30:3 shows how gains and losses, as well as interest income and interest expenses have affected income after financial items in the Volvo Group divided by the different categories of financial instruments.\n\n| Outstanding derivative instruments   | Dec 31, 2020   | Dec 31, 2020   | Dec 31, 2019   | Dec 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| SEK M                                | Nominal amount | Carrying value | Nominal amount | Carrying value |\n| I nterest-rate swaps                 |                |                |                |                |\n| - receivable position                | 126,549        | 5,448          | 87,221         | 948            |\n| - payable position                   | 167,422        | -1,214         | 194,399        | -2,329         |\n| Forward and futures                  |                |                |                |                |\n| - receivable position                | 248            | -              | -              | -              |\n| - payable position                   | 666            | -73            | 669            | -19            |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives         |                |                |                |                |\n| - receivable position                | 25,779         | 596            | 27,589         | 1,061          |\n| - payable position                   | 7,255          | -67            | 16,695         | -118           |\n| Options purchased                    |                |                |                |                |\n| - receivable position                | 10,409         | 2              | 428            | 5              |\n| - payable position                   | -              | -              | -              | -              |\n| Options written                      |                |                |                |                |\n| - receivable position                | -              | -              | -              | -              |\n| - payable position                   | 205            | -2             | 405            | -2             |\n| Total                                |                | 4,691          |                | -453           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has caused a shift between the lines in the income statement of the Industrial Operations as well as the Volvo Group, while Financial Services is not affected. As a con-\n\nsequence, Cost of sales has decreased and Selling expenses has increased by the corresponding amount, with no impact on the operating income.\n\nThe reclassification has been done retrospectively and the financial information for 2019 has been restated to facilitate the comparability between the years.\n\n|                                                                           | CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT   | CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT   | CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT   | CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT   | CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT   | CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                                           | Industrial Operations           | Industrial Operations           | Industrial Operations           | Volvo Group                     | Volvo Group                     | Volvo Group                     |\n| SEK M                                                                     | Previously  reported  2019      | Restatement                     | After   restatement  2019       | Previously  reported  2019      | Restatement                     | After   restatement  2019       |\n| Net sales                                                                 | 418,361                         | -

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe amounts within  parentheses refer to the preceding year, 2019.\n\n## 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe parent company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and RFR 2, Accounting for legal entities. According to RFR 2, the parent company shall apply all the International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the EU as far as this is possible within the framework of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.\n\nThe changes in RFR 2 applicable to the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, has not had any significant impact on the parent company.\n\nThere are no announced changes in RFR 2 applicable to the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021 or later.\n\nThe accounting policies applied by the Volvo Group are described in the respective notes in the consolidated financial statements. The main deviations between the accounting policies applied by the Volvo Group and the parent company are described below.\n\nShares and participations in group companies and Investments in joint ventures and associated companies are recognized at cost in the parent company and test for impairment is performed annually. In accordance with RFR 2, the parent company includes costs related to acquisition of a business in the acquisition value. Dividend is recognized in the income statement.\n\nAll holdings of shares were previously recognized as operational and the income was reported in the operating income. As from the financial year 2020 and onwards, all holding of shares are recognized as financial assets and the result is reported in the income from financial items. A  corresponding change has also taken place for the comparison year.\n\nOver the course of the year, the company has also made changes to the classification of certain intra-group transactions in the income statement. This reclassification has no effect on income and no change has taken place in respect of the company's transfer price model. A corresponding change for the comparison year means that an income of SEK 122 M has been reclassified within the operating income, from Income from investments in Group companies to Administration expenses.\n\nAs a consequence of the two above mentioned changes, the operating income for the financial year 2019 has therefore decreased by SEK 6,618 M. Accordingly, the income from financial items has increased by SEK 6,618 M.\n\nThe parent company applies the exception in the application of IFRS 9 which concerns accounting and measurement of financial contracts of guarantee in favor of subsidiaries and associated companies. The parent company recognizes the financial contracts of guarantee as contingent liabilities.\n\nRFR 2 includes an exception in regard to IFRS 16, allowing all lease contracts to be accounted for as operational lease contract when the parent company is a lessee.\n\nReporting of group contributions is recognized in accordance with the alternative rule in RFR 2. Group contributions are reported as appropriations.\n\nAccording to RFR 2, application of the regulations in IAS 19 regarding defined benefit plans is not mandatory for legal entities. However, IAS 19 shall be applied for supplementary disclosures when applicable. RFR 2 refers  to  the  Swedish  law  on  safeguarding  of  pension  commitments ('tryggandelagen') related to recognition of provisions for post-employment benefits in the balance sheet and of plan assets in pension foundations.\n\nVolvo Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits in the consolidated financial statements. This implies differences, which may be significant, in  the  accounting  of  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  well  as  in  the accounting of plan assets invested in the Volvo Pension Foundation.\n\nThe accounting principles for defined benefit plans differ from IAS 19 mainly relating to:\n\n- \u00b7  Pension liability calculated according to Swedish accounting principles does not take into account future salary increases.\n- \u00b7  The discount rate used in the calculations is set by PRI Pensions garanti and Finansinspektionen, respectively.\n- \u00b7  Changes in the discount rate, actual return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions are recognized directly in the income statement and in the balance sheet.\n- \u00b7  Deficit must be either immediately settled in cash or recognized as a liability in the balance sheet.\n- \u00b7  Surplus cannot be recognized as an asset, but may in some cases be refunded to the company to offset pension costs.\n\n## 2 REVENUE AND INTRA-GROUP TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe recognized net sales of SEK 327 M (362) pertain mainly to revenues from sale of services to group companies SEK 288 M (320). Revenue is recognized when the control of the service has been transferred to the customer, which is when the parent company incurs the associated cost to deliver the service and the customer can benefit from the use of the delivered services.\n\nPurchases from group companies amounted to SEK 232 M (468).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n## ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\n## Personnel\n\nWages, salaries and other remunerations amounted to SEK 418 M (471), social costs to SEK 120 M (143) and pension costs to SEK 210 M (193). During 2020 government grants due to the extraordinary situation raised by Covid-19, were received by SEK 23 M (-). Of these, SEK 18 M were recognized in the income statement, and SEK 5 M will be repaid to the authorities in Sweden. Pension cost of SEK 10 M (9) pertained to Board Members and the President. The parent company has outstanding pension obligations of SEK 1 M (1) to these individuals.\n\nThe number of employees at year end was 289 (331).\n\n- Read more in Note 27 Personnel in the consolidated financial statements about the average number of employees, wages, salaries and other remunerations including incentive program as well as Board members and senior executives by gender.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nAdministrative expenses include depreciation of SEK 0 M (0) and pertains to machinery and equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more in Note 28 Fees to the Auditors in the consolidated financial statements for a description of the different categories of fees.\n\n| Fees to the auditors   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deloitte AB            |        |        |\n| - Audit fees           | 17     | 18     |\n| - Audit-related fees   | 3      | 1      |\n| - Other fees           | 0      | 1      |\n| Total                  | 20     | 20     |",

        "page_content": "## 16 PROVISIONS FOR POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\nThe parent company has two types of pension plans, defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans: post-employment benefit plans where the company makes regular payments to separate entities and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. The expenses for defined contribution plans are recognized during the period when the employee provides service.\n\nDefined benefit plans: post-employment benefit plans where the company's undertaking is to provide predetermined benefits that the employee will receive on or after retirement. These benefit plans are secured through balance sheet provisions or pension fund contributions. Furthermore, a credit insurance policy has been taken out for the value of the obligations. The main defined benefit plan is the ITP2 plan which is based on final salary. The plan is semi-closed, meaning that only new employees born before 1979 have the possibility to choose the ITP2 solution. The ITP2 plan for the company is funded in Volvo Pension Foundation. Pension obligations are calculated annually, on the balance sheet date, based on actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe defined benefit obligations are calculated based on the actual salary levels at year-end and based on a discount rate of 3.84% (3.84) for the ITP2 plan and 0.3% (0.7) for other pension obligations. Assumptions for discount rates and mortality rates are determined annually by PRI  Pensionsgaranti for ITP2 and Finansinspektionen for other pension obligations,  respectively.\n\nThe Volvo Pension Foundation was formed in 1996 to secure obligations relating to retirement pensions in accordance with the ITP plan. Since its formation, net contributions of SEK 332 M have been made to the foundation by the parent company.\n\nProvisions  for  post-employment  benefits  in  the  parent  company's balance sheet correspond to the present value of obligations at year end, less fair value of plan assets.\n\n| Obligations in defined   benefit plans   |   Funded |   Unfunded |   Total |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Obligations opening balance 2019         |      663 |        258 |     921 |\n| Service costs                            |       31 |          1 |      32 |\n| Interest costs                           |       27 |          2 |      29 |\n| Benefits paid                            |      -21 |        -13 |     -34 |\n| Obligations as of   December 31, 2019    |      700 |        248 |     948 |\n| Service costs                            |       26 |         19 |      45 |\n| Interest costs                           |       28 |          1 |      29 |\n| Benefits paid                            |      -23 |          0 |     -23 |\n| Obligations as of   December 31, 2020    |      731 |        268 |     999 |\n\n| Fair value of plan assets in funded plans         |       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Plan assets opening balance 2019                  | 788   |\n| Actual return on plan assets                      | 110   |\n| Contributions and compensation   to/from the fund | 33    |\n| Plan assets as of December 31, 2019               | 931   |\n| Actual return on plan assets                      | 126   |\n| Contributions and compensation to/from the fund   | 0     |\n| Plan assets as of December 31, 2020               | 1,057 |\n\n16:2\n\n| Provisions for post-employment  benefits                                                            | Dec 31,  2020   |   Dec 31,  2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Obligations 1                                                                                       | -999            |            -948 |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                                                           | 1,057           |             931 |\n| Funded status                                                                                       | 58              |             -17 |\n| Limitation on assets in accordance with  RFR2 (when plan assets exceed   corresponding obligations) | -326            |            -231 |\n| B/S   Net provisions for   post-employment   benefits 2                                             | -268            |            -248 |\n\n- 1  The ITP2 obligations amount to SEK -714 M (-683).\n- 2 ITP2 obligations, net, amount to SEK 0 M (0).\n\n| Pension costs                                |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Service costs                                |     46 |     32 |\n| Interest costs 1                             |     29 |     29 |\n| Interest income 1                            |     17 |     -2 |\n| Pension costs for defined benefit plans      |     92 |     59 |\n| Pension costs for defined contribution plans |     62 |     62 |\n| Special payroll tax/yield tax 2              |     51 |     67 |\n| Cost for credit insurance FPG                |      5 |      5 |\n| Total costs for the period                   |    210 |    193 |\n\n- 1  Interest income, net of SEK 17 M (-2) is included in financial items.\n- 2  Special payroll tax/yield tax are calculated according to Swedish Tax law and accrued for in current liabilities.",

As sustainability topics are top strategic issues for the Volvo Group, additional sustainability disclosures can be found in other parts of the report, see below.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe overall governance of sustainability is described in the Corporate Governance report on page 175 and 182.\n\n## Strategy and Business model\n\nThe Volvo Group's strategy includes sustainability priorities and are presented on pages 8-39. Our business model is outlined on pages 18-23. With business operations in more than 190 countries whereof many  are  classified  as  high-risk  countries  from  an environmental, human rights or corruption perspective we need to ensure that we pursue our business operations in a responsible manner. Environmental, social and financial sustainability aspects as well as ethical business conduct are  integrated into the Volvo Group overall strategy and business model and also incorporated into our processes and policies.\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Volvo Group Code of Conduct is a Group-wide policy that sets the standards on how we conduct business; ethically and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It applies everywhere we oper-\n\nate, for our employees and everyone else who works on our behalf. In addition to the Code of Conduct, the Volvo Group's policies on competition, data privacy, anti-corruption and export control, tax and environment are complemented with compliance programs and  management  systems  for  effective  policy deployment.  In  line  with  our  decentralized  model each business area is responsible to ensure compliance with the Volvo Group's minimum requirements and standards for sustainable and responsible business conduct. Business areas are also free to complement existing policies and compliance programs with more stringent requirements.\n\n## Risks and mitigation\n\nThe Volvo Group's enterprise risk management process  includes  sustainability-related  risks.  Material sustainability-related risks for the Volvo Group are reported in the overall Risks and uncertainties section, see pages 68-75. These Sustainability Notes include a more detailed overview on risks and mitigation activities.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nKPI's  in  relation  to  the  environment,  employees, social factors, human rights and business ethics are reported for each material topic in these Sustainability notes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting standards referred\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) Standards 'Core' option. GRI is complemented by other relevant frameworks where stated. GRI and UN Global Compact's guide Business Reporting in the SDGs have been used to translate the disclosures herein to a number of the 169 SDG targets.\n\n## Topics related to this report\n\nComplementary information is available on volvogroup.com/asr2020.

In defining the report content, the Volvo Group applies GRI's reporting principles on stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and completeness.\n\n## Strategic framework\n\nDuring 2019 and 2020 Volvo Group updated its strategic framework to drive sustainability and performance, revolving around climate, resources and people. Sustainability priorities have been concluded in dialogue with a network of sustainability professionals and management of all truck divisions, business areas as well as the executive management of the Volvo Group and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Consulting stakeholders\n\nStakeholder perspectives are considered throughout strategy development and deployment. The approach is to have an open dialogue\n\nwith a wide range of stakeholders on sustainable business for the purpose of establishing key sustainability priorities. In this work, input from  stakeholders  are  sought  via  key  functions  within  the  Volvo Group and include views from stakeholders such as customers, investors, employees, supply chain partners and community.\n\nWhile different stakeholder groups raise concerns or ask for specific information on different topics certain sustainability topics are common for most stakeholder groups. During 2020 such topics have revolved mainly around health, climate and human rights. Read more about our main stakeholder groups and their topics of interest, materiality and reporting on volvogroup.com/materiality.\n\nTranslated into GRI topics, material topics are briefly described in the table below. More details are provided under the specific sustainability notes on the following pages and complemented by the risk descriptions on pages 150-170.\n\nAdditional topics are mentioned briefly but not according to GRI, e.g. materials of concern, lobbying, compliance and tax practices.\n\n## Material topics and summary of main impacts\n\n| GRI topic                                      | Supply chain   | Volvo  Group   | Customers  and society   | Comment on the main impacts and boundaries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Economic performance                           | \u00b7              | \u00b7              | \u00b7                        | Risks and opportunities mainly relate to the transitional aspects of  customer  demands, emission regulation, technology development and scarce materials.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Energy and emissions                           | \u00b7              | \u00b7              | \u00b7                        | Reducing environmental impacts from customers' use of our products is a key  business driver.

The below sets forth the Group's disclosures on its overall governance, strategy and management of climate related risks and opportunities, including relevant climate related metrics and targets.\n\n## Governance\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are critical topics of the transport sector today and are integrated parts of the Volvo Group overall strategy and business model. Risk assessment, decision-making and accountability is embedded in the line organization in accordance with the Volvo Group Governance Framework. The AB Volvo Board of Directors and the Executive Board set the strategic direction for the Group's work as further detailed on page 172-182 in the Corporate Governance Report. The strategic work is facilitated by cross-functional working groups that consolidate and prepare information for decision-making at Executive and AB Volvo Board level.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Volvo Group supports the ambitions of the Paris Agreement - to keep the increase of the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial level and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C. In this scenario, emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society's main sectors, including buildings, industry, transport and energy. In the transport sector, there is an increasing need for electrified products and for solutions using technologies that increase resource efficiency. The ongoing transition of the transport sector towards new technologies and new service-based business models bring significant business opportunities as well as transitional risks for the Volvo Group as further described below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPotential pathways to a 1.5\u00b0C or a well below 2\u00b0C scenario include a successive decarbonization of the transport sector and of the energy sector. New technology solutions such as electric vehicles are, in order to deliver their full potential, depending on access to energy sources with low CO 2 intensity.\n\nThe Volvo Group has committed to the business ambition of the Science Based Target initiative to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to reach net-zero by 2050. In working towards this ambition, the Volvo Group has performed CO 2 emission reduction scenarios based on the composition of the annual volume and CO 2 intensity of products forecasted to be put on different markets over time. Each Business Area and Truck Division have made their own scenario analyses, covering factors such as customer demand, regulatory requirements, infrastructure roll-out, access to renewable energy, governmental incentives for clean technologies, removal of governmental subsidies for fossil fuels etc. The analyses are made to set a strategy with the right mix of products for the respective market over time, a mix which may  include  electrified  products  as  well  as  conventional  combustion engine products powered by renewable liquid and gaseous fuels.\n\n## Climate-related opportunities for the Volvo Group\n\nThe transition of the transport sector offers significant business opportunities for the Volvo Group. The Volvo Group strives to lead the development of new technologies and has developed, and is continuing to develop an extensive portfolio of products and services using new technologies to continue to provide high quality products and services to our customers, while at the same time enabling our customers to reduce their environmental impact. The Volvo Group is broadening its offer of products that can be powered by renewable energy through the introduction of electric vehicles as described in the strategy section on pages 13-14. Another example is the electrification of the entire European Volvo Truck range, see page 25. The Group also invests in fuel cell technology with the ambition to have a heavy-duty hydrogen offer available during the second half of this decade. In parallel, the Volvo Group continues to offer products that can be powered by renewable liquid and gaseous fuels like HVO and biogas, see page 26. In addition to new technology products, the Volvo Group has developed a range of service solutions that helps to reduce the number of transports needed by optimizing fill rates, consolidating transports and choosing the most effective routing, see examples on page 33.\n\nCustomer demand for products and solutions with lower environmental impact is increasing. Total cost of ownership is steadily reduced over time as the operational cost of fuel are gradually shifted to capital cost for electric propulsion. The transition to electrification also depends upon external factors such as the existence of a functioning charging infrastructure and access to renewable energy sources to power battery electric and fuel cell electric products. Customer demand in different markets is depending on factors such as availability of the necessary infrastructure and energy, governmental incentives for green technologies and the removal of fossil-fuel subsidies. The Volvo Group strives to have products and solutions available in pace with customer demand using a highly flexible production system.\n\nThe Volvo Group invests in new technologies and new business models. In addition to that, the Volvo Group has issued a Green Financial Framework to get access to additional capital for the development and production of sustainable technologies for the transport sector, see pages 64.",

Because it takes around ten years to renew a running fleet, the aim is to by 2040 offer products exclusively propelled by carbon neutral alternatives. The exact future product mix cannot be foreseen but in this scenario the running fleets in the transportation sector are likely to include different technologies that can be powered by renewable energy. These solutions can be battery-electric, fuel\n\ncell-electric or vehicles propelled with low CO 2 intensity energy sources for combustion engine drivelines. In order to reach the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, this shift needs to happen on a global scale. Some markets are expected to be more progressive in this transition depending on of technology and infrastructure development, emission regulation, market incentives and customer demand.\n\n## Climate-related risks for the Volvo Group\n\nClimate-related risks can be divided into transitional risks and physical risks. Transitional risks include technology-related risks, policy and legal-related risks, market risks and reputational risks. Physical risks are acute physical risks such as extreme weather events and chronic physical risks due to changing weather patterns and rising mean temperature and sea levels. With the ambition to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C, the transitional risks are considered as the most material for the Volvo Group.\n\n## Transitional climate risks\n\nThe Volvo Group has identified a number of climate related transitional risks, which are incorporated into the Volvo Group Enterprise Risk Management process. Transitional risks are considered material for the Volvo Group in the short, medium and long term. These risks, including their potential financial impact, are described in more detail in the Group's overall Risks and uncertainties section on page 68-75 under the following risk categories:\n\n- \u00b7  Extensive governmental regulations, page 69\n- \u00b7  Technology shift and convergence, page 70\n- \u00b7  Customer satisfaction and demand, page 70\n- \u00b7  Reliance on suppliers and scarce materials, page 71\n- \u00b7  Climate related and environmental regulations, page 72\n\n## Physical risks\n\nBased on the main scenario outlined in the Volvo Group's strategy - a 1.5\u00b0C scenario - the physical risks are not identified as material in the short- to medium-term perspective. However, climate-related acute physical risks such as extreme weather events as well as chronic physical risks are likely to increase for the Volvo Group in the long-term perspective if the global warming significantly deviates from a 1.5\u00b0C scenario. Potential physical risks will be closely monitored, reviewed and reported in the Risks and uncertainties disclosures if and when they emerge as material risks.\n\nIn summary, the Volvo Group strives to contribute to the transition of the transport sector and to support our customers in the shift to new and more  sustainable  technologies.  A  successful  positioning  of  the  Volvo Group in this transition may lead to increased revenue streams, whereas an unsuccessful positioning may negatively affect the Volvo Group's earnings and financial standing, as explained in the risks section on pages 69-72. In the transition towards solutions that can to a greater extent be powered by renewable energy, the Volvo Group will utilize its common architecture and shared technology (CAST, read more on page 26), and adapt its production system to develop and produce new products and services in a cost-effective way.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nIn accordance with the decentralized Volvo Group governance model, each Business Area and Truck Division is accountable for its risk management. The Volvo Group works with a Group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, which is a systematic and structured process to consolidate and analyze risks and mitigations as well as to follow up on the risks that might impact the Group's business. Truck Divisions, Business Areas and Group functions report risks in the ERM process using an integrated  multi-disciplinary  approach.  The  ERM  process  includes  all types of risks for the Volvo Group, including climate related risks and other sustainability related risks.\n\nThe ERM risks are divided into five categories, i.e. Macro and market related risks, Operational risks, Climate and society risks, Compliance risks and Financial risks. Climate related risks are mainly reported in the Climate and society risks category, but as the nature of climate risks are overlapping with certain other identified risk categories, some climaterelated risks are also reported under Macro and market related risks and Operational risks.\n\nThe risks identified in the ERM process are considered from a short-, medium- and/or long-term perspective and are further reviewed from a materiality  standpoint.  The  risks  identified  in  the  ERM  process  are assessed through a materiality analysis conducted with internal and external stakeholders and the risks that are classified as material are considered to be the most prominent risk factors for the Volvo Group, see page 68.\n\nCertain climate-related transitional risks have been identified as material to the Volvo Group in connection with the ERM Process, see above and pages 68-75.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nThe Volvo Group uses various metrics and targets to assess climaterelated and environmental risks and opportunities in relation to its products and operations, see Energy and Emissions on pages 155-157 and Waste, Water and Environmental compliance on page 158.\n\n## Index of TCFD recommended disclosures\n\n|

Strategic priorities related to environment and climate are based on product life cycle assessments, to reduce emissions and other climate-related risks where they make the most impact.\n\nEmission metrics, targets and disclosures are based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol corporate standard. In line with this standard, the Volvo Group monitors significant scope 1, 2 and partly scope 3 emissions. When nothing else is stated, CO\u2082 emissions are adjusted for acquisitions and divestments according to the accounting principles of the GHG protocol. Product life cycle assessments show that around 95% of the energy and emissions are connected to the use of sold products. Energy and emissions from production and freight transportation are additional important strategic areas.\n\nThe Volvo Group has reported climate-related information, targets and results since the beginning of the 2000s. The latest target period was developed as part of the WWF Climate Savers program and covered the period 2015-2020, see highlight on page 29. The approach of managing climate-related risks has served the Volvo Group well, both in terms of reducing emissions in line with targets set and in terms of developing new technologies and business plans to meet the transition towards fossil-free transports.\n\nLooking ahead, the Volvo Group is in the process of setting new climaterelated objectives in line with the ambition of the Paris Agreement. In this work the Volvo Group has committed to the Science Based Targets initiative.

This is particularly noticeable for traditional diesel engine drivelines. An electric driveline reduces the total lifecycle emissions, but can also shift parts of the environmental  footprint  to  other  phases  depending  on  access  to renewable energy. The Volvo Group supports customers in finding the most  suitable  solution  for  their  specific  transport  application  and market prerequisites. The main initiatives Volvo Group can utilize to support customers to reduce emissions from the use phase are:\n\n- \u00b7  Reducing fuel and energy consumption in all applications.\n- \u00b7  Enabling the use of alternative carbon-neutral fuels.\n- \u00b7  Increasing electrified solutions where viable.\n\nA science-based approach with pros and cons of using various fuels are available on volvogroup.com/fuels\n\n| SEGMENT                           | Urban delivery: 60,000 km per year     | Urban delivery: 60,000 km per year   | Long range: 185,000 km per year VOLVO FH LNG VOLVO FH   | Long range: 185,000 km per year VOLVO FH LNG VOLVO FH   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| EXAMPLE,  VOLVO TRUCKS            |                                        |                                      |                                                         |                                                         |\n| Life cycle  CO 2 -equivalent      | 36,600                                 | 412,000                              | 360,000                                                 | 1,080,000                                               |\n| Energy/fuel mix Energy per 100 km | Hydropower EU Average 104 KWh / 100 km | Diesel (B0) 41.5 l / 100 km          | Liquefied biogas EUR 6 33 l / 100 km                    | Diesel (B0) EUR 6 33 l / 100 km                         |\n| By source:                        |                                        |                                      |                                                         |                                                         |\n| Energy, MWh                       | 535                                    | 1,570                                | 6,660                                                   | 4,130                                                   |\n| Water, m 3                        | 36,600                                 | 711                                  | 3,300                                                   | 9,050                                                   |\n| NO x , kg                         | 73                                     | 264                                  | 1,310                                                   | 673                                                     |\n| Materials (net), tons             | 3,620                                  | 1,700                                | 6,940                                                   | 3,520                                                   |",

It is based on the principles of life  cycle management and continuous improvement.\n\nThe Group's ISO 14001 certified environmental management system covers approximately 95% of  production facilities and 90% of distribution centers. The management system is used in a hierarchical way to deploy effective environmental work in the Group's divisions and business areas. This means that the business areas and truck divisions are all responsible for their environmental performance in the same way as financial or other performance. Environmental management is also part of supplier assessments, read more on page 167.\n\nMost environmental KPIs, see also previous page, were reduced in 2020 in absolute terms and over time also in relation to net sales. A large part of the absolute reduction in 2020 is explained by the lower production levels during parts of the year due the pandemic. At the same time, efficiency work is continuously on-going.\n\n## Water\n\nWater consumption has also been reduced in absolute terms, although not to the same extent as other environmental indicators in relation to net sales.

It is included in this report due to specific interest and tracking from certain stakeholders.\n\n## Waste and recycling\n\nVolvo Group's sites either have in place or are in the process of developing landfill-free objectives. This work is supported by a directive and guidelines setting out the criteria for when a Volvo Group site can be considered a landfill-free site.\n\nThe reduction of waste sent to landfill is largely due to a reclassification of the foundry sand from the operation Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden. This is from 2020 classified as non-metal recycling.\n\nThe hazardous waste fraction includes waste from a soil remediation project executed at the foundry operation in Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden.\n\n## Waste by type and disposal method\n\n| Metric tons                                 | 2020            | 2019    | 2018    |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| Recycling, metal scrap from  operations     | 84,880          | 107,004 | 97,691  |\n| Recycling, other metal scrap                | 13,322          | 18,634  | 18,868  |\n| Recycling, non-metal                        | 141,620         | 133,297 | 119,358 |\n| % recycling of total                        | 86%             | 76%     | 75%     |\n| Composting                                  | 1,865           | 2,315   | 2,524   |\n| Incineration with energy recovery           | 18,387          | 29,258  | 32,920  |\n| % recycled, composted or   energy recovery  | 93%             | 85%     | 86%     |\n| Incineration without energy   recovery      | 1,644           | 2,222   | 2,598   |\n| Treatment by professional waste  contractor | 9,945           | 19,594  | 15,153  |\n| Landfill                                    | 6,076           | 26,839  | 24,202  |\n| Landfill, only inert material               | 694             | 2,571   | 699     |\n| Total residuals                             | 278,433 341,734 |         | 314,013 |\n| Whereof hazardous wastes                    | 51,806          | 51,024  | 38,601  |\n\n## Materials of concern\n\nSome of the materials used in Volvo Group's products come in scarce supply and some materials and substances are potentially hazardous. The Group works to reduce its dependency on such materials and substances with the aim to protect both people and the environment and to secure sustainable supply. In collaboration with partners, the Volvo Group proactively evaluates alternatives in the design and supply processes to minimize and eliminate use of scarce materials and substances of concern.\n\nScarce materials may lead to a variety of difficulties such as high prices and increased risk for corrupt behavior or adverse human rights impacts when sourced from high risk areas. Volvo Group is implementing a dedicated supplier Sustainable Minerals Program, currently focusing on tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and cobalt, to support sourcing of materials in a responsible way. The program is built on the five step framework of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict- Affected and High-Risk Areas, as well as on the tools of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, to which the Volvo Group is a member.\n\n## Environmental compliance\n\nNo significant environmental incidents or spills were recorded during 2020. In 2020 the Volvo Group had 12 licensed facilities in Swede. For some facilities the environmental permits are under review due to planned changes.",

1   The total employee turnover rate is the proportion of employees who left Volvo Group both voluntary (such as retirements and resignations) and involuntary (including due to redundancy).\n\nThe Volvo Group Code of Conduct is the foundation for responsible business conduct that builds trust with stakeholders in societies where the Group operates. As an integral part of daily operations, the leaders of Business Areas, divisions and functions are accountable for areas such as employment practices, labor relations, people development and diversity. To do this effectively, they are supported by both local and central HR professionals, expertise and leadership. In addition to the topics listed herein, different countries, regions and units may address specific areas in line with the local context and needs.\n\n## EMPLOYMENT\n\nThe Group's employees are its most valuable asset and to provide safe and engaging workplaces where people can grow is an essential focus area for the Volvo Group. The strategy is to invest in people, to grow talent, and to create an inclusive and people centric culture where everyone is encouraged to contribute.\n\nThe collected efforts have resulted in high rankings in global employer branding surveys. In 2020, the Volvo Group was ranked as number 20 of the world's best places to work by Fortune and World's Best Workplaces TM .\n\nDuring 2020, the Volvo Group, like many other companies worldwide, faced an unprecedented situation because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Volvo Group has put in extensive measures to maintain its operations and employment resulting from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. By using short-term-layoff programs or similar schemes the Group tried to avoid the most severe social impacts to individuals and retain employment.\n\n| New hires     | 2020        | 2020   | 2020   | 2019                 | 2019   | 2019   |\n|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|----------------------|--------|--------|\n|               | <40         | 40+    | All    | <40                  | 40+    | All    |\n| Europe        | 1,514       | 621    |        | 2,135  2,820   1,240 |        | 4,060  |\n| Men           | 1,115       | 468    | 1,583  | 2,115                | 957    | 3,072  |\n| Women         | 399         | 153    | 552    | 705                  | 283    | 988    |\n| North America | 1,161       | 750    | 1,911  | 898                  | 543    | 1,441  |\n| Men           | 909         | 558    | 1,467  | 670                  | 412    | 1,082  |\n| Women         | 252         | 192    | 444    | 228                  | 131    | 359    |\n| South America | 640         | 95     | 735    | 885                  | 196    | 1,081  |\n| Men           | 496         | 80     | 576    | 706                  | 170    | 876    |\n| Women         | 144         | 15     | 159    | 179                  | 26     | 205    |\n| Asia/Pacific  | 830         | 89     | 919    | 1,201                | 189    | 1,390  |\n| Men           | 695         | 66     | 761    | 954                  | 142    | 1,096  |\n| Women         | 135         | 23     | 158    | 247                  | 47     | 294    |\n| Africa        | 55          | 9      | 64     | 126                  | 23     | 149    |\n| Men           | 39          | 9      | 48     | 80                   | 12     | 92     |\n| Women         | 16          |        | 16     | 46                   | 11     | 57     |\n| Group total   | 4,200 1,564 |        |        | 5,764  5,930         | 2,191  | 8,121  |\n| Men           | 3,254       | 1,181  |        | 4,435  4,525   1,693 |        | 6,218  |\n| Women         | 946         | 383    | 1,329  | 1,405                | 498    | 1,903  |",

        "page_content": "However, the Group had already started adjusting its activity levels by using its structural flexibility, terminating temporary and consultant contracts during 2019. During the second half of 2020, the Group started to further decrease resources to adjust to lower activity levels. In parallel, the Group is accelerating the competence shift needed for the development of new technologies and business models.\n\nOver time, the Volvo Group has developed pragmatic solutions and ways of working to adjust according to changing demands. The Volvo Group works in close dialogue with employee representatives for the deployment of solutions that help to maintain and strengthen the competence needed for the Volvo Group as well as reducing negative social consequences. This can include utilizing time-banks to reduce labor time, furlough, re-skilling or upskilling for continued employability, early retirement, financial compensation, internal mobility programs and outplacement via third parties.\n\n## LABOR AND MANAGEMENT RELATIONS\n\nThe relations between the company and employees, including employee representatives and unions, is based on honesty, transparency, fairness and creativity. These basic principles were jointly developed with the Global Works Council members and guide how we act together when maneuvering the Volvo Group through necessary business changes. One cornerstone in this relationship is the yearly Volvo Global Dialogue in which about 50 employee representatives from over 20 different countries meet with the CEO and the Volvo Group Management members to discuss  the  current  business  situation  and  strategic  initiatives  of  the Group, but also specific future opportunities in respect of new business areas, digitalization and needed competence shifts.\n\nIn 2020, for the first time, this event was held virtually due to the specific pandemic circumstances. In parallel, the Global Works Council and European Works Council meetings are normally held to facilitate reoccurring social dialogue. Due to travel and meeting restrictions respecting the Covid-19 situation, these meetings were not conducted in 2020. However, several virtual meetings were held between Executive Board Members and the European and Global Works Council to maintain a close dialogue and collaboration.\n\nThree  ordinary  and  two  deputy  members  appointed  by  employee organizations are part of the AB Volvo Board of Directors.\n\n## Process regarding operational changes\n\nPrior to major organizational changes, the employee representatives  and  relevant  authorities  are  informed  and  consulted  in accordance with legal and contractual requirements. In 2020, the Group conducted 13 information meetings with the European Works  Council,  complemented  by  178  meetings  with  local employee representatives and unions in different countries to consult on changes and their specific impact on a local level.\n\nAn estimated 44% of employees around the world are members  of  an  independent  trade  union.  Approximately  75%  of employees in 23 different countries are covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements. This shows a significant higher union density rate or coverage of collective bargaining than the average compared to the International Labor Organization statistics in our major markets like Sweden, the US, Japan, Poland and Brazil.\n\n## TRAINING AND EDUCATION\n\nIndividual and organizational learning is essential for the Volvo Group and for employees. Learning helps the Group to perform current business operations and to transform for the future. From the employees' perspective, learning is also an integral part of development and growth. The Group drives scalable learning and competency development via its own corporate campus - the Volvo Group University (VGU). VGU is responsible for the design, development and delivery of trainings, thereby ensuring that high quality trainings are easily and widely accessible. To create the best learning experience, a wide variety of formats are used, e.g. online, on-site, on stage and face-to-face or virtual classroom training as well as videos and games. All VGU training programs are managed in a personalized and collaborative learning portal that supports competence development and engages employees in their learning journey.\n\n## Programs for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance programs\n\nThe Group offers programs specifically designed for roles that require upgraded skills or that will be transitioned over time. For example, a wide curriculum on electric vehicles targeting engineers, workshop operators and other relevant work roles and several programs on Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been deployed over the last few years.\n\nIn addition to programs facilitated by VGU, the Group's operations manage vocational training in different parts of the world focusing on practical skills for production operators or workshop technicians.\n\n## The Future Industrial Worker\n\nThe ongoing transformation of industry requires new skills, competencies and ways of working. Volvo Group Trucks Operations - employing a significant part of the production staff across the Group - is leading the work to predict future needs for employees and the organization. Three pilot projects have showed that competence development is key, as anticipated, but there is not one single simple solution. The work includes learning about what roles we should have, how we should work with flexibility and what skills are needed for the future industrial workers. Lessons from the pilot areas will be disseminated to other parts of the organization and the Volvo Group works closely with the unions around the Group to spread lessons learnt about competence development, quality instructions, repair and maintenance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKlas Grenabo is one of the employees at the plant in Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden, taking part in establishing the future industrial worker.

        "page_content": "Vocational training is an important factor in driving prosperity. In addition to training for employees and distributors, the Group initiates, supports or runs vocational training programs across the world focusing on practical skills for mechanics, bus or truck drivers and machine operators. Volvo Group specialists can be directly involved as teachers or trainers and in some countries the Group cooperates with technical colleges and universities.\n\nIn several markets, the Volvo Group and its customers have experienced a mismatch between skills and business needs. In many of these markets the Volvo Group therefore works together with national and international aid agencies to provide the education needed for increasing employment and opportunities for people to be self-sufficient.\n\n## Strengthening the employability of Moroccan youth\n\nACCES (Acad\u00e9mie de Conduite de Camions En S\u00e9curit\u00e9) was created  in  2018  in  Casablanca,  Morocco.  Located  within  an existing vocational training center in the industrial hub of Casablanca, ACCES provides specialized training in driving buses and trucks to professional drivers as well as Moroccan youth interested in pursuing a career in the road transport sector. Over four years (2018-2022), ACCES aims to train around 500 professional drivers in a wide range of critical subjects, such as safe and fuel-efficient driving for different types of trucks and buses. As a result, ACCES seeks to contribute to the objectives of the Moroccan government by upgrading the skills of professional drivers while strengthening the employability of Moroccan youth in the transport sector. ACCES is the result of a partnership between the Government of Morocco, the United States Agency for International  Development  (USAID),  Volvo  Group,  and  the  United Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization  (UNIDO).  Volvo Group provides training vehicles, equipment, and teacher training. Volvo Trucks, Volvo Buses and Renault Trucks are all cooperating on the training program.\n\n## DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\nDiversity drives performance by enriching creativity, encouraging innovation and improving decision making. Following the decentralized model within the Volvo Group, the responsibility for promoting diversity belongs to each part of the organization.\n\nThe Volvo Group has been working systematically with diversity and inclusion for over a decade. The work includes a wide range of aspects, such as culture, generations, background and gender. It also includes facilitation and support of networks for employees on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as employees with special needs. The overall ambition is to attract a wide range of people, to grow and develop them and attain the skills and competencies needed for today as well as for the future. The Group has established targets to increase gender diversity in management positions, in graduate programs and training programs. This overall approach also spreads to other areas such as vocational training programs in local communities. One of the overall aims is that management and workforce reasonably reflect the diversity of the regions and businesses of the Volvo Group.\n\nTo maximize the positive effects of diversity and inclusion, the leaders and team members of each business area and function are responsible for making it an integral part of their daily operations. Different countries, regions and units may have different diversity challenges, leading to local and business specific diversity goals and actions.\n\nOn the corporate level, the Volvo Group follows age and gender as key indicators of diversity. The total gender balance is assessed as a total of the workforce, for line management positions and at the senior management level, as described in the gender diversity table below. The Volvo Group's ambition is to reach 35% women employees by 2030, in general and in management positions.\n\n## Diversity of governance bodies and employees\n\n| Age diversity of the Volvo  Group workforce,   %   | 2020 <40 / 40+   | 2019 <40 / 40+   | 2018 <40 / 40+   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Europe                                             | 36 / 64          | 37 / 63          | 38 / 62          |\n| North America                                      | 33 / 67          | 34 / 66          | 34 / 66          |\n| South America                                      | 61 / 39          | 59 / 41          | 60 / 40          |\n| Asia / Pacific                                     | 51 / 49          | 44 / 56          | 45 / 55          |\n| Africa                                             | 54 / 46          | 56 / 44          | 58 / 42          |\n| Group average                                      | 40 / 60          | 40 / 60          | 41 / 59          |\n\n| Gender diversity of the  Volvo Group workforce,   %   | 2020 Women /  Men   | 2019 Women /  Men   | 2018 Women /  Men   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Europe                                                | 21 / 79             | 21 / 79             | 21 / 79             |\n| North America                                         | 21 / 79             | 14 / 86             | 20 / 80             |\n| South America                                         | 17 / 83             | 17 / 83             | 16 / 84             |\n| Asia / Pacific                                        | 14 / 86             | 14 / 86             | 14 / 86             |\n| Africa                                                | 24 / 76             | 24 / 76             | 21 / 79             |\n| Group average                                         | 19 / 81             | 19 / 81             | 19 / 81             |\n\n## Gender diversity over time, share of women, %\n\n|                                          |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |   2016 |   2015 |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| All employees                            |     19 |     19 |     18 |     19 |     18 |     18 |\n| Manager (all levels)                     |     20 |     20 |     19 |     19 |     18 |     18 |\n| Presidents and  other senior  executives |     26 |     26 |     25 |     25 |     24 |     22 |\n| AB Volvo Board  (excluding deputies)     |     36 |     40 |     40 |     36 |     36 |     33 |",

Health and safety are material issues in several aspects of Volvo Group's direct operations as well as in activities that occur along the value chain. The Volvo Group Health and Safety Policy gives direction on how workplace safety, health and wellbeing shall be handled within the Group. The policy covers both direct employees and consultants.\n\nDuring 2020 Volvo Group, similar to all other organizations around the world, had to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. Protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of all our colleagues has been and remains the priority. The Volvo Group took action at sites, across operating countries and at the Group level. Many workplaces and activities were adapted to help colleagues keep safe. Communications and education campaigns about health and wellbeing were introduced across the Group.\n\nSome teams across the Group have progressed further with developing proactive  approaches  towards  mental  health  and  wellbeing,  raising awareness and ensuring adequate support is available. The Group's work in this area will extend well beyond the pandemic. Examples of workplace adaptations  focusing  on  both  mental  and  physical  health  during  the Covid-19 situation are highlighted on page 35.\n\n## Arrangements for health and safety have continued to strengthen across the Group\n\nSafety is one of the centerpieces of the Volvo Group's strategy. During the year the Group has continued safety awareness campaigns and increased focus on safety leadership. There is a clear expectation of being even more proactive in managing risks across our activities, in sharing good practice and recognizing the successes that help create good and productive places to work.\n\nAcross Volvo Group teams investigate accidents leading to lost time. During the year the Group continued to focus on preventing serious and fatal incidents with targeted approaches towards high risk activities.\n\nSafety is the first item on the agenda of business review meetings with all business areas and their units. Throughout 2020, we have emphasized how health, safety and wellbeing is Volvo Group's first priority and communicated this widely by senior leaders across the Group. Within the Group, a global network of over 200 expert practitioners on Occupational Health and Safety - including doctors, nurses, safety engineers, psychologists, and ergonomists collaborate to find and share best practices.\n\n## Occupational health and safety management system\n\nEach business area is accountable and responsible for managing health, safety and wellbeing. Volvo Buses and Volvo Construction Equipment have continued to certify their parts of the management systems according to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001. Others have been developing internal safety management systems with regular assessments and coaching as an integral part the Volvo Group Management System (VGMS) and Volvo Production System (VPS). This helps to ensure that there are written  procedures,  internal  controls,  clear  ownership  and  management review, and that deviations are acted upon. The scope of prevention work includes both physical and psychological health, and workplace safety. It covers all employees working for Volvo Group on- or off-site, as well as the period of time spent commuting to and from work.\n\n## Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation\n\nVolvo Group and its subsidiaries apply tools and processes to manage risk and create productive working environments. Risk assessments are carried out on a regular basis at all levels from shop floor to office. Health and safety professionals ensure the quality of risk assessments and involve line management and union representatives in this work. Potential risks are in focus during internal assessments and external audits, where typically a sample of risk assessments and corrective and preventative actions are reviewed. Managers and employees are reviewed in their knowledge of their own major  risks.  Measures  to  mitigate  or  eliminate  the  identified  risks  are defined and implemented, and risk assessments are reviewed and updated periodically or after any incident has occurred. Recordable accidents are reported and followed up at the unit level and further up in the organization, continuing up to the Group level. Investigations resulting in corrective and preventative actions must be deployed after each recordable accident. In cases where the issue is linked to risks that may be relevant for other units - the causes of the accident and the corrective and preventative measure to avoid a repeat are shared with other relevant units within the global health and safety network. In certain cases, directives are built to be deployed throughout the company as part of a preventative measure.\n\nBased on the risk assessment carried out for a specific machine, process or work area, employees receive training so they understand the risks and how to manage them - through following defined procedures or wearing personal protective equipment, for example. When defining corrective or preventative actions in response to identified risk, the Volvo Group Health and Safety Policy requires that the hierarchy of control measures principles be applied. The first option is hazard elimination. If hazard elimination is not possible, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment are applied. The policy is distributed and made visible on the walls of factories and offices within the company.\n\nEmployees are asked to report accidents, incidents and unsafe acts and conditions - as they are a vital source of improvements and highlight opportunities to better control the associated risk.

In the unlikely event that a manager or colleague acts against the Code of Conduct - a whistle blower process can be used to escalate this.\n\nHealth and safety coordinators are employed to support team leaders and managers in the organization. Periodic training is also organized on health and safety procedures, roles and responsibilities for managers and health and safety coordinators.\n\n## Occupational health services\n\nOccupational health services are provided to employees at most units and vary from one country to another depending on the specific needs of the unit, the level of health service provided and local legislation. In many countries and locations, health services are supported by company doctors and nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists and ergonomists.\n\nIn some countries/organizations such services can be supplied by third parties. If so, they are required to ensure data privacy in accordance with applicable regulations. Occupational health services play a major role in health  promotion.  These  service  providers  manage  confidential  databases and can help to provide anonymized reports about relevant health aspects - diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stress levels, etc. - to implement relevant preventive and corrective actions. They contribute significantly to training and webinars, and provide support to individuals, teams and organizations. They stay current in their fields of knowledge to be on the forefront of new initiatives for the Volvo Group.\n\n## Worker participation, consultation and communication on occupational health and safety\n\nWorker representatives are appointed to health and safety committees by employees. Depending on the type of business area, health and safety committees operate on the factory level, retail office level or unit level. The main objective of the committees is to bring together worker and management representatives, define actions and jointly agree on measures  needed  to  improve  health  and  safety  performance.  Committees meet on a regular basis and decisions taken shall be communicated to the workforce, acted upon and followed up. The committees could also be involved in accident and incident investigations and support in additional corrective or preventative measures.\n\n## Worker training on occupational health and safety\n\nAll employees and consultants are provided health and safety training as well as other Code of Conduct training as part of their induction training.\n\n## Rates of injury and number of work-related fatalities 2013-2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                              | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   | -19% -13% -23% -6% +22% 0% -29%   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Lost time acci- dent rate (LTAR)  per 200,000  worked hours. | 13 1.97                           | 14 1.59                           | 15 1.38                           | 16 1.06                           | 17 1.00                           | 18 1.22                           | 19 1.22                           | 20 0.87                           |\n| Number of  accidents  with  lost time                        | 686                               | 1.109                             | 980                               | 809                               | 789                               | 972                               | 1004                              | 656                               |\n| Number of fatali- ties Employees                             | 1                                 | 3                                 | 0                                 | 0                                 | 3                                 | 1                                 | 0                                 | 0                                 |\n| Number of fatali- ties Contractors                           | 0                                 | 0                                 | 0                                 | 0                                 | 0                                 | 2                                 | 0                                 | 0                                 |\n\nMore specific training is provided depending on the job responsibilities. Specific training for potentially hazardous jobs - such as working with electricity or hazardous substances, at heights and in high heat conditions - is mandatory for employees working in these environments, and needs to be repeated on a regular basis. All trainings are provided during working hours. The effectiveness of these trainings is assessed locally depending on each organization and country.\n\n## Promotion of worker health\n\nThe Volvo Group has for a long time provided various health promoting activities beyond occupational safety. These programs are often provided by external partners. Health promotion programs may cover topics such as preventing communicable diseases, substance abuse, obesity, healthy lifestyle, physical exercise, nutrition, sleep and stress management. The psychological work environment is growing in focus, and many tools are available to support in preventing issues and promoting good mental health. There are various types of tools that can be used depending on specific and individual needs. The confidentiality of individuals is protected in line with general data privacy laws. Throughout the year many countries have used pulse surveys and engagement tools to understand attitudes and feelings in general, and in particular to a shift where work-life is affected by remote work and social distancing. This approach has been useful and actions have been taken in response.\n\n## Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships\n\nIn accordance with the Volvo Group's Supplier Code of Conduct, on-site audits are performed at suppliers on a wide variety of  sustainability topics. Health and safety are central elements to this process. Read more about this on page 167 - Supplier social assessments.\n\nOccupational safety, as well as road safety, are central elements in the Group's offer to end-users. The Volvo Group provides customer solutions and training to increase safe behavior and safe product use. Please read more about customer health and safety on next page.\n\n## Workers covered by an occupational health and safety management system\n\nThe Volvo Group Management System includes health and safety management based on legal requirements and covers all employees and consultants, and these are all included in the safety reporting presented below.\n\nThe percentage of employees and consultants who have been covered by an internal audit cannot be reported for the previous year. The data was not available.\n\nBy December 2020, over 60 sites covering around 30% of Volvo Group's employees have chosen to certify their operations according to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001. Volvo Buses and Volvo Construction Equipment are two business areas that have chosen to certify their entire operations.\n\n## Work-related injuries\n\nVolvo Group measures the accident and accident rates in all locations including plants, workshops and offices in all countries of operations. In 2020, the accident rate was 0.87 per 200,000 worked hours. The reduction in both accidents and improvement of accident rates may partly be linked to the different ways of working and a general lower activity level in production  during  parts  of  the  year.  Consultants  are  not  separately reported but are included in the figures along with all of the Volvo Group's employees. Health and safety data is collected quarterly at the Group level and on a monthly basis by several business areas and truck divisions.\n\nHigh-consequence or serious work-related injuries and related hazards are not consolidated at Group level but are shared in health and safety networks to spread learnings and best practices sharing.",

The Group's business and the products it offers target a wide range of application areas and impact many categories of people, such as drivers and operators, commuters, as well as other traffic system users like cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nThe vision is zero accidents with Volvo Group products, and the offering of world-leading products and solutions for sustainable transports is in important part of getting closer to our vision.\n\nEvery year, 1.35 million people lose their lives in road traffic accidents worldwide, and many million are seriously injured. In addition, there are occupational health and safety risks in and around vehicles and machines, both on the road and in construction and work sites. Issues such as noise and air pollution are also considered in customer health and safety.\n\nA holistic approach means addressing all these concerns in a proactive and systematic way. Volvo Group works systematically with in-depth accident research to understand the context and challenges facing customers  in  their  operations.  This  knowledge  is  then  the  basis  for  the Group's product development. Volvo Group also work with partners in academia and policy makers to gain knowledge and strives to accelerate progress in road traffic safety to enable safer solutions to be brought to the market. Designing the best solutions to address these global health and safety challenges is delivering both on the Volvo Group's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and to offer the most competitive solutions to customers and business partners. The knowledge gained on safety is shared via communication and training programs in many markets where the Group operates to raise awareness of key safety concerns such as speed, seat belts and alcohol.\n\nAll product lines are carefully assessed for health and safety impacts. This is a key competitive advantage of the Volvo Group. Such assessment can include product assessments, audits of different processes in the design, development, production and use phases, as well as research investigations from real accidents.

As part of an ongoing project, one of the bus lanes operating in Bengaluru, India, has been equipped with cameras, sensors, logging equipment capturing the surroundings outside as well as what happens inside the bus. Data is processed to analyze and build insights in order to characterize the Indian traffic conditions as well as driver behavior. In phase two of this project, buses will be further equipped with radar systems and equipment that monitors weather, air quality and various other parameters.\n\nIn October 2020, SITIS held a virtual three-day Vision Zero Academy training program for senior transport and highway officials across India. The program was facilitated by the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) and Automotive Research Association of India.\n\nSITIS is one of the largest collaborations in the road safety arena - involving a range of Swedish and Indian companies such as Autoliv, Ericsson, Manipal Hospitals, Altair, Saab, Tech  Mahindra and Volvo Group, as well as universities and research institutes from both countries.",

Negative human rights impacts may potentially materialize not only within the Group's own organization, but also through the Group's business relationships and in the value chain. This includes colleagues in our operations, people in neighboring  communities,  suppliers,  business  partners  and  others  potentially impacted by the use of our products and solutions. The Group continues to strengthen and align its human rights work with the following international frameworks that we recognize and support:\n\n- \u00b7  UN International Bill of Human Rights.\n- \u00b7  ILO's eight fundamental conventions.\n- \u00b7  UN Global Compact.\n- \u00b7  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n- \u00b7  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- \u00b7  Children's Rights and Business Principles.\n\nThese frameworks provide support and guidance in contexts with elevated human rights risks and where local regulations are sometimes insufficient or inadequately enforced. The Volvo Group reports on its human rights- related work under applicable laws and regulations, including national laws under the EU's non-financial reporting directive and the UK Modern Slavery Act. In 2020, we published Modern Slavery Statements for relevant companies within the Group.\n\nThe year 2020 was marked by Covid-19 and as a result demand and business activity levels were impacted. The Group's primary focus has been to ensure the health, safety and well-being.\n\nThe Group's commitment to respect human rights is an essential part of the Volvo Group's Sustainability Strategy. The Group's human rights governance includes cross-functional governance forums and working groups, steered by a human rights board with relevant members from our Executive Board. In 2020, we initiated work to formalize and strengthen our human rights program and plans.\n\nGroup functions such as Corporate Responsibility, Legal and Compliance and Human Resources, together with the Group's Truck divisions and Business Areas, identify, assess and monitor human rights-related risks within our operating environment through human rights due diligence, our enterprise risk management process, dialogues with unions, inputs from the Volvo Group Whistle mechanism and collaboration with peers and others. Volvo Group's human rights due diligence and mitigation efforts takes into account, country specific human rights risk levels, inherent risks in certain purchasing categories and sales segments and potential concerns brought to our attention by internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Policy commitment\n\nThe Volvo Group Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct and other relevant  Group-level  policies  and  directives  reflect  our  commitment  to respecting human rights. Through these guiding documents, we set and communicate our expectations on mutual respect, non-discrimination, safe and healthy workplaces, freedom of association and collective bargaining, working hours and compensation and zero tolerance for all forms of modern slavery and child labor. We consider these the most relevant human rights issues for the Volvo Group currently and continue to identify any other issues that may become relevant. These topics are also part of the mandatory training for all employees on the Volvo Group Code of Conduct. See page 169 for more information about the Code of Conduct and associated training.\n\n## Human rights reviews in our own operations\n\nWe carry out human rights reviews in our own operations as part of our overall due diligence work along the value chain. These reviews aim to identify actual and potential adverse human rights impacts on employees, consultants and on-site service providers. It typically involves desktop reviews of country and sector human rights risks, self-assessments and in-person workshops with the local management and human resources personnel, in-person discussions with employees, on-site service providers  and  their  employees,  union  representatives  and  also,  if  relevant, potential in-person discussions with other stakeholders. It is adapted to reflect the needs and risks of the country being reviewed. The findings of each country-level human rights review are communicated to relevant members of the Executive Board. Following each human rights review, action plans for identified improvement areas are created with clear ownership and anchoring within the local management. We strive to align our human rights review methodology with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights while also taking into account Volvo Group's global and local operating structures.\n\nOne focus area in 2020 was to clarify human rights review processes and methodology as well as follow up on findings from previous human rights reviews in India (2017), South Africa (2018), and Mexico (2019) with the local management. The Group is planning for remote human rights reviews, taking into account an expected continuation of travel and meeting restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.",

        "page_content": "## Human rights due diligence in the supply chain\n\nThe Volvo Group's Supplier Code of Conduct sets not only the minimum requirements, but also the aspirations for suppliers in the areas of human rights and working conditions, health and safety, responsible sourcing of raw materials, environmental performance and business ethics. Despite the global pandemic affecting our ability to visit suppliers, we continued to develop and implement our Sustainable Minerals program.\n\nMore on this and a summary of findings is available in the Supplier assessment section on the next page.\n\n## Strengthening human rights capacity with strategic business partners\n\nIn addition to our owned manufacturing operations, the Volvo Group collaborates with private business partners to assemble trucks in certain locations in Africa and Asia, and build bus bodies on our chassis in line with customer requirements globally. Our human rights plan for truck assembly partners includes strengthening contractual provisions with human rights requirements, risk assessments including onsite visits, and training and raising awareness on human rights.\n\n## Grievance channels and access to remedy\n\nOur employees and external stakeholders have the possibility, to the extent permitted by local laws, to report any instances of human rights violations in connection with the Volvo Group or breach of our Code of Conduct through internal and third-party hosted publicly available grievance channels. See page 169 for more information on our grievance channels and the types of concerns reported in 2020.\n\n## Specific Global Reporting Initiative topic-related disclosures\n\n## Non-discrimination\n\nThe Volvo Group assesses risks related to discrimination as part of its overall human rights due diligence in its own operations and the supply chain. In 2020, 34 allegations perceived as related to discrimination or harassment were reported via the Volvo Group Whistle, included in the category Workplace Management on page 169. All reports were investigated. Approximately half of the reports were not substantiated. Disciplinary measures were taken in the substantiated cases, supported by trainings or changes to processes and routines.\n\nDepending on the situation, specific actions are designed and applied. The Volvo Group provides awareness trainings to prevent harassment and discrimination. This is done with the Volvo Group Code of Conduct as the core foundation. In addition, special courses about prevention from harassment and discrimination are offered for managers in some jurisdictions, for example the training Civil Treatment for Leaders in the US.\n\n## Freedom of association\n\nLegal compliance is the foundation for Volvo Group's activities globally. Varying country legislation on union independence means the approach to managing freedom of association and collective bargaining may differ from one case to another. The Volvo Group clearly states, in the Code of Conduct, that we respect the right of all employees to form and join an association to represent their interests as employees, to organize, and to bargain collectively or individually, as well as the right to refrain from joining a union.\n\nThe Volvo Group assesses risks related to freedom of association and collective bargaining as part of its overall human rights due diligence in its own operations and in the supply chain. Human and labor rights issues, as\n\nwell as other relevant questions can also be raised in the Volvo Global Dialogue, which is a forum including employee representatives across the globe and Group management. Please refer to page 160 for details on labor management relations.\n\nOur  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  requires  suppliers  to  respect  their employees' right to freedom of association and their right to collective bargaining. It also provides that where local law sets restrictions on the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, the supplier shall allow alternative forms of worker representation, association and bargaining.\n\n## Child labor\n\nThe Volvo Group assesses risks related to child labor as part of its overall human rights due diligence in its own operations and in the supply chain. In 2020, no cases of child labor were identified at own operations or in supplier sustainability audits.\n\n## Forced or compulsory labor\n\nThe Volvo Group assesses risks related to forced and compulsory labor as part of its overall human rights due diligence in its own operations and in the supply chain. In 2020, no cases of forced or compulsory labor were identified at own operations or during supplier sustainability audits.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE SALES\n\nThe Volvo Group has processes and policies in place with the aim to ensure that our business is conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including sanctions and export control regimes. In addition, we assess certain sales deals for risks related to human rights, environmental factors, and business ethics as part of knowing the customer or end-user. These are primarily carried out in connection with direct sales, involving customer finance and support from export credit guarantees. In line with our internal policy on military sales, we make extended assessments of proposed sales. In 2020, we continued our work to improve the methodology and scope of these assessments.\n\nWe identify sustainability risks through credible tools when performing these assessments. Identified findings are assessed, described and escalated to relevant forums within business areas or Group functions. Mitigation actions typically include engagement with our customers on the findings with the aim to support them to mitigate identified risks. If the risks are considered high or difficult to mitigate, we may decide not to proceed with individual sales deals. In our assessments, we consider country risk levels, customer segments, end-users and potential end-use of our products. Our business areas have the responsibility to perform these assessments, with support from Group functions when needed.\n\nIn 2020, Volvo Trucks, Renault Trucks, Volvo Construction Equipment and Volvo Buses assessed approximately 85 sales deals, involving customer financing and sales to certain high-risk markets. Some of these assessments identified issues related to potential adverse impacts on the environment and communities, lack of respect for human and labor rights, poor employment conditions, occupational health and safety, and unethical business behavior. Group functions also assessed approximately 40 potential transactions to selected military and government end-users in various countries in line with our internal policy on military sales. Volvo Construction Equipment and Volvo Buses also continued to raise awareness among its customer finance personnel across all sales regions.",

A global supply chain can mean a range of environmental and social risks. The on-going digitalization, automation and electrification in the transport and infrastructure industries also increases use of new and potentially scarce materials as well as reliance on new suppliers and associated risks.\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the minimum requirements, which suppliers shall comply with in the areas of human rights, working conditions, health and safety, responsible sourcing of raw materials, environmental performance and business ethics. It also includes aspirations through which suppliers are encouraged to go beyond the basic requirements to further advance sustainable performance and impact in the areas covered by the Volvo Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nThe supplier screening and auditing is centrally coordinated by Volvo Group Purchasing and covers tier one suppliers. A risk-based approach is used to prioritize screenings and audits. Prioritization is made by reviewing risks by country or market, commodities, processes or work areas of the suppliers. In addition to this overall risk mapping, environmental, human rights and other social risks can be flagged during any type of supplier audit, training or visit. For this purpose, the Volvo Group carries out most audits and reviews with internal resources with a shared responsibility between procurement staff and specialized auditors, whose tasks it is to ensure that proper actions are taken to resolve identified gaps.\n\nScreenings are done from desktop studies using Volvo Group's internally developed risk tool and external risk heat maps, in combination with supplier self-assessments. Auditing of suppliers is traditionally carried out at suppliers' locations by Volvo Group specialists. The Code of Conduct audit procedure is based on a checklist with questions focusing on a wide range of aspects, such as human rights, working conditions, environment and business ethics. The responsibility of improvements and corrective actions always lies with the suppliers themselves, where non-compliance cases are\n\nmanaged by the responsible buyer together with the auditor until resolved. First and foremost, the work focuses on establishing a strong partnership and developing a sustainable supply base. Those who fail to address critical issues risk having their contracts terminated. All Volvo Group Purchasing employees receive regular mandatory trainings on the concept of Sustainability and on the content of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nIn 2020, 95% of the total Volvo Group spend was to suppliers who were self-assessed on environmental and social criteria, 92% with a recorded approved score. In high risk areas, this percentage was 98%, where 97% have recorded an approved score. Because the population and scope of suppliers changes continuously, and the total number of suppliers can shift over time, the exact percentage of new suppliers that were screened using social and environmental criteria is not available.\n\nIn addition, new suppliers of direct material in high risk countries are subject to due diligence, thorough screening or audit. Indirect material suppliers are audited when the suppliers are located in a high risk country and the annual spend exceeds a certain pre-defined financial threshold.\n\nIn 2020, 38 suppliers were audited in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. 21 of these audits were fully approved without identified non-conformances.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 situation, on-site audits have been difficult to conduct during 2020 and as response, audits have also been trialed via digital connection. On-site sustainability trainings for our suppliers had to be postponed due to Covid-19. Instead, in cooperation with DRIVE Sustainability, a collaboration platform for responsible sourcing within the automotive sector, the Volvo Group has taken part in producing and launching an on-line training for supply chain partners. This training enables commitment  and  communication  around  all  key  sustainability  topics  and serves as a good alternative to previously held face to face training. The training is built on knowledge and experience with on-site face to face training held previous years but reached a wide audience without travelling and avoiding gathering larger groups of participants.\n\n## Social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken\n\nIn 2020, deviations were found within the areas of health and safety, working hours and sustainability communication towards sub-suppliers. In the area of Health and Safety, the deviations related to fire emergency and first aid procedures as well as handling of chemicals and hazardous materials. In the area of working hours, the findings were related to excessive working hours and in the area of supplier communication, the deviations were found around inconsistent sub-supplier Code of Conducts, lack of cascading requirements and information and training to sub-contractors about social, environmental or business ethics requirements. The findings from the audits are communicated back to the suppliers. The suppliers are expected to set up and implement a corrective action plan in a  timely  manner.  Such  corrective  actions  are  then  monitored  by  the responsible buyer in cooperation with the auditor and the Responsible Purchasing Team. All have confirmed corrective actions to be taken.\n\n## Environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken\n\nIn 2020, minor deviations related to hazardous waste management were found. All have confirmed corrective actions to be taken.\n\nAn important environmental focus in the supply chain focuses on the transition to carbon neutrality. This includes both components and solutions used in Volvo Group's products but will increasingly also include emission performance at suppliers. The supply chain ambition follows the Volvo Group's overall ambition to enable customers to go fossil free by 2040.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable Minerals Program\n\nVolvo Group does not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold and cobalt. Regardless, these minerals are part of global supply chains and are used in a variety of materials and components. The Volvo Group's ambition is to support its suppliers to secure sustainable supply chains of such minerals. As part of this work, Volvo Group is a member of RMI (Responsible Minerals Initiative, see information to the right). In 2020, 1,121 tier one companies were invited to take part in the Volvo Group's sustainable minerals program with the aim to create transparency and visibility in the supply chains of minerals. The ultimate aim is to secure an environmentally and socially sound supply chain of components and minerals.\n\nSeveral of the invited companies already collaborate and all invited will be assessed on the parameters of (a) strength of Human Rights Due Diligence program and (b) association to smelters or refiners of concern in their supply chain. The long-term ambition of the Sustainable Minerals program is to drive full transparency by 2025 where all supply chain partners in scope are to be compliant with our Responsible Purchasing standards and requirements.\n\n## The Volvo Group's program for sustainable purchasing can be summarized in these main elements\n\nThe foundation is the Supplier Code of Conduct which creates the right mindset and shall be part of all contracts with suppliers.\n\nA supplier sustainability assessment program requires a basic evaluation of all our supply chain partners through the Sustainability Self-Assessment Questionnaire, a tool developed in collaboration with DRIVE Sustainability. Significant new supply chain partners in high-risk countries are assessed through an on-site audit with focus on working environment and labor practices. Audits of existing suppliers are made of selected suppliers in connection with the Human Rights reviews of our own operations and on an ad hoc basis if a specific need is identified.\n\nDetailed supply chain mapping focus on specific segments and areas. One such focus area is the sustainable minerals program focusing on minerals such as tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold and cobalt.\n\nSuppliers play a key role in implementing innovation in our sustainability processes and tools. Joint innovation programs focus on topics such as circularity and eco-design as well as electrification, automation and connectivity.\n\nIndustry Collaboration drives broader implementation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Examples of industry collaborations for sustainable supply chains\n\nThe Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) is a collaborative platform addressing responsible mineral sourcing issues in global supply chains. Volvo Group is working with RMI with the aim to ensure  responsible  and  sustainable  sourcing  of  tin,  tantalum, tungsten and gold (sometimes referred to as conflict minerals), as well  as  cobalt.  Through  RMI,  participants  develop  and  gain access to tools and resources to ensure regulatory compliance and  support  responsible  sourcing  of  minerals  from  conflictaffected and high-risk areas.\n\nDRIVE Sustainability is a network of eleven leading automotive companies working towards enhancing sustainability throughout the automotive industry by leveraging a common voice and by engaging with our supply chain partners, stakeholders and related sectors on impactful activities. Volvo Group is active in several working groups within the initiative to leverage a circular and sustainable automotive value chain. The Self-Assessment Questionnaire was during 2020 launched in its fourth version and has now been translated and made available in 13 different languages.\n\nThe Global Battery Alliance a public-private collaboration platform under the umbrella of the World Economic Forum. The vision is to create a circular and sustainable battery value chain set on ten guiding principles covering issues from the circular recovery of battery materials, ensuring transparency of greenhouse gas emissions and their progressive reduction, to eliminating child and forced labor.",

It covers many different areas and is guided by people of expertise and knowledge across the Group, and spans across topics such as emissions regulations, competition and anti-corruption laws, export control regulations and data privacy.\n\nOur Code of Conduct states that we shall compete in a fair manner on the merits of our products and services and not participate in or endorse any corrupt practices. These principles of compliance are implemented through dedicated resources and compliance programs, including policies and guidelines, a comprehensive range of e-learning and tailored face-to-face training, counselling and support, as well as auditing and reviews. In addition, the Volvo Group whistle-blower procedures apply to all compliance areas.\n\n## ANTI-CORRUPTION\n\nThe Volvo Group's Code of Conduct and the related anti-corruption policy condemn all forms of corruption. This is based on the conviction that bribery and other forms of corruption distort the market, interfere with free competition,  violate  laws  and  undermine  social  development.  Volvo Group employees may not participate in or endorse any corrupt practices, including offering or accepting kickbacks, bribes, excessive gifts or hospitality, or facilitation payments - directly or indirectly, such as through a third party. Nor will the Volvo Group accept suppliers, vendors or partners that offer or accept bribes.\n\nCorruption  risks  are  primarily  linked  to  the  activities  of  the  Volvo Group's business partners and to the behaviors of employees in situations in relation to public officials and other customer representatives. The overall risk level is also affected by the fact that Volvo Group pursues business operations in many markets that are considered high-risk from a corruption perspective.\n\nThe Volvo Group has established dedicated anti-corruption policies and guidelines to complement the Volvo Group Code of Conduct. Among other things, these include a risk-based mandatory anti-corruption due diligence process for new and existing business partners requiring the use of external screening tools. We also implemented binding rules to ensure appropriate gift and hospitality practices as well as further documents in\n\nadjacent  areas  such  as  commercial  gifts,  charitable  donations,  antimoney laundering and fraud reporting. Corporate Compliance is responsible for designing and developing the Volvo Group anti-corruption compliance program and monitors the implementation across the Group. A network of compliance officers in the business areas and divisions work closely with Corporate Compliance to ensure the implementation in their respective areas.\n\nVolvo Group uses a combination of audits, management control systems and internal controls to ensure adherence to the Code of Conduct. Further, the Code of Conduct encourages all employees to speak up and report suspected violations to their managers or other management representatives. Another way to raise a concern is through the Volvo Group Whistle, available on volvogroup.com.\n\n## Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures\n\nVolvo's top management, Corporate Compliance and other internal stakeholders regularly communicate the importance of anti-corruption compliance in various forms. Training is a central element of the Volvo Group's compliance programs. In 2020, the Volvo Group has revised its compliance training strategy to ensure a risk-based combination of face-to-face training and online courses depending on individual exposure to corruption risk. Due to the impact of Covid-19 and the related furlough or shortterm lay-offs of employees globally, the annual Code of Conduct Training was postponed to December 2020. By year-end, 37,000 employees (86% of the target group) had finalized the training.\n\n## WHISTLE BLOWER REPORTING\n\nIn 2020, 97 cases were reported via Volvo Group's whistle-blower helpline, escalated to Corporate Audit and investigated. We observed a lower input of cases reported correlating with periods of stricter lockdown measures during Q2 and Q4. Six of the reported cases were categorized as suspected corruption or conflict of interest. One was closed substantiated with appropriate disciplinary and remediation actions taken.\n\n## Whistle-blower concerns escalated to Corporate Audit\n\n|                                         | 2020   | 2020    | 2019   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Type of concerns reported               |        |         |        |        |\n| Workplace management                    | 40     | 41%     | 69     | 52%    |\n| Business Ethics and Financial Practices | 33     | 34%     | 42     | 32%    |\n| Corruption and Conflict of Interest     | 6      | 6%      | 7      | 5%     |\n| Other including Inquiries               | 18     | 19%     | 15     | 11%    |\n| Total                                   |        | 97 100% | 133    | 100%   |",

The cancellation was implemented in July 2020 and entailed that the total amount of registered shares in the company decreased by a corresponding amount.\n\nFor  more  information  about  the  Volvo  share  and  its  shareholders, please refer to the Board of Director's Report on pages 66-67 of the Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\n3\n\n## ELECTION COMMITTEE\n\n## Duties\n\nThe Election Committee is elected by the General Meeting.

The main task is to prepare and present proposals to the Annual General Meeting on behalf of the shareholders for the election of Board members, Chairman of the Board and Board remuneration and, when applicable, proposals for auditors and fees to the auditors.\n\nIn addition, the Election Committee presents proposals for members of the Election Committee for the following year, in accordance with prevailing instructions for Volvo's Election Committee.\n\n## Composition\n\nIn accordance with the current instructions for Volvo's Election Committee (adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2019), the Annual General Meeting shall elect five members to serve on the Election Committee, of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GENERAL MEETING\n\n## General\n\nThe General Meeting is Volvo's highest decision-making body. The Annual General Meeting is held within six months of the end of the fiscal year, normally in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nIn addition to what follows from applicable law regarding shareholders' right to participate at General Meetings, under Volvo's Articles of Association shareholders must give notice of their attendance (within the time stated in the convening notice) and, when applicable, notify the company of any intention to bring assistants.\n\nA shareholder who wants the Meeting to consider a particular matter must submit a request to the Board in sufficient time prior to the Meeting to the address provided on Volvo's website, www.volvogroup.com.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2020 resolved to amend the Articles of Association, allowing the Board to collect powers of attorney in accordance with the procedure described in the Companies Act as well as allowing the Board to decide that shareholders shall be able to exercise their right to vote by post before a General Meeting.\n\nAs a consequence of the developments due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board decided by the end of March 2020 to postpone the Annual General Meeting 2020. The Meeting, which was initially planned for April 8, was held on June 18. In order to reduce the risk of spreading the virus and considering the authorities' regulations and advice on avoiding public gatherings, the Meeting was carried out through postal voting, without any physical attendance, pursuant to temporary legislation.

The  Board  is  responsible  for  the Group's long-term development and strategy, for regularly controlling and evaluating the Group's operations and for the other duties set forth in the Swedish Companies Act.\n\n## Composition\n\nDuring the period January 1, 2020 to June 18, 2020, AB Volvo's Board consisted of ten members elected by the Annual General Meeting and three members and two deputy members appointed by employee organizations.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2020 re-elected Matti Alahuhta, Eckhard Cordes, Hanne de Mora, Eric Elzvik, James W. Griffith, Martin Lundstedt, Kathryn V. Marinello, Martina Merz, Helena Stjernholm and Carl-Henric Svanberg as Board members and Kurt Jofs was elected as new Board member. This meant that the total number of members elected by the General Meeting increased from ten to eleven. The Annual General Meeting re-elected Carl-Henric Svanberg as Chairman of the Board. A more detailed presentation of each Board member is set out in the 'Board of Directors' section on pages 178-179.\n\nPrior to the Annual General Meeting 2020, the Election Committee announced that it had applied the provisions of rule 4.1 of the Code as board diversity policy. The aim is that the Board as a collective should possess the required mix in terms of background and knowledge, whereby an even gender distribution is taken into particular account. The result of the Election Committee's application of the diversity policy is a Board that represents a mix of both professional experience and knowledge as well as geographical and cultural backgrounds. 36 percent (four out of eleven) of the Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting are women.\n\n## Independence requirements\n\nThe Board of Directors of AB Volvo is subject to the independence requirements prescribed in the Code.\n\nPrior to the Annual General Meeting 2020, the Nomination Committee presented the following assessment of the independence of Board members elected at the Annual General Meeting 2020.\n\nCarl-Henric  Svanberg,  Matti  Alahuhta,  Eckhard  Cordes,  Hanne  de Mora, Eric Elzvik, James W. Griffith, Kurt Jofs, Kathryn V. Marinello and Martina Merz were all considered independent of the company and company management, as well as the company's major shareholders.\n\nMartin Lundstedt, as President of AB Volvo and CEO of the Volvo Group, was considered independent of the company's major shareholders but not of the company and company management.\n\nHelena Stjernholm was considered independent of the company and company management but not in relation to one of the major shareholders, due to her capacity as President and CEO of AB Industriv\u00e4rden.\n\n## Work procedures\n\nEvery year, the Board adopts work procedures for the Board's work.\n\nThe work procedures outline how the Board's duties should be distributed, including the specific role and duties of the Chairman, instructions for the division of duties between the Board and the President and for the reporting  of  financial  information  to  the  Board.  The  Board  has  also adopted  specific  instructions  for  the  Board's  committees,  which  are linked to the work procedures.\n\nThe Board's work is mainly performed within the framework of formal Board meetings and through meetings in the respective committees of the Board. In addition, regular contact is maintained between the Chairman of the Board and the CEO in order to discuss ongoing business and to ensure that the Board's decisions are executed.\n\nIn 2020, the extraordinary situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Board's work. In 2020, there were nine regular Board meetings and one statutory Board meeting, all included in the Board's initial meeting plan. In addition, the Board has met on a frequent basis during 2020, resulting in a total of 14 extraordinary Board meetings. Most of the Board meetings have been held as video conferences. The attendance of Board members at these meetings is pres ented in the table on page 177. The company's auditor attended one Board meeting during the year.\n\nAn important part of the Board's focus during 2020 has been on managing the immediate challenges and consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic including a focus on the Volvo Group colleagues, customers and business partners and to maintain a tight cost control and focus on cash flow. In addition, the Board has continued its focus on new technologies and the Group's positioning in the transformation of the industry. Product development to meet the Group's own as well as regulators' climate related and other goals is one important part of this work.\n\nOther important parts of the focus on new technologies and industry transformation include the Group's strategic partnerships and other larger transactions. Here, the Volvo Group and Isuzu Motors signed an agreement in October 2020 to form a strategic alliance within commercial vehicles. Further, the Volvo Group and Daimler Truck AG signed an agreement to establish a new joint venture to develop, produce and commercialize fuel-cell systems for use in heavy-duty trucks as the primary focus, as well as other applications.\n\nThe Board is continuously updated about climate and sustainability related issues, for instance as part of the health and safety related issues, product plans, investment plans and talent review. During 2020, the Board has been continuously updated and involved in the development of the Group's sustainability work, including the Group's commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative (for further information, see page 29). Climate related issues are considered mainly in relation to product plans and R&D investments, both of which are critical to meet changing customer demands, new business models, environmental impact and regulatory demands. Climate related and environmental regulations as well as technology shift and convergence are two of the Group's top strategic risks and therefore also opportunities and critical topics to be dealt with at Board level.\n\nDuring 2020, the Board decided on an overall financial plan and investment framework for the Group's operations, including investments in R&D for both electrification and combustion engines to reduce CO 2 emissions. In addition, the Board regularly monitors the Group's earnings and financial position and maintains continuous focus on risk related issues such as overall risk management and ongoing legal disputes and investigations. Further, throughout the year, the Board has devoted time to talent review and succession planning and on the review and follow-up of the Company's quality work.\n\nBy allocating time to business reviews of the Group's various truck divisions and business areas the Board remains continuously up-to-date on",

The Audit Committee also has the task of reviewing and overseeing the Group's legal and taxation matters as well as compliance with laws and regulations that may have a material impact on financial reporting. Furthermore, the Audit Committee has the task of reviewing and overseeing the impartiality and independence of the company's auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for evaluating both internal and external auditors' work and, when applicable, handling the tender process for audit services. In addition, it is the Audit Committee's task to preapprove what other services, beyond auditing, the company may procure from the auditors. The Audit Committee also adopts guidelines for transactions with companies and persons closely associated with Volvo. Further, the Audit Committee evaluates the quality, relevance and effectiveness of the Group's system for internal control over financial reporting, as well as with respect to the internal audit and risk management, and discharge any other duties of an audit committee according to law or its instructions. Finally, the Audit Committee oversees developments within the ESG (Environmental,  Social  and  Governance)  standards,  and  the  Group's reporting in these areas.\n\n## Composition and work in 2020\n\nAt the statutory Board meeting following the Annual General Meeting 2020, the following Board members were appointed members of the Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Hanne de Mora\n- \u00b7 Eric Elzvik\n- \u00b7 Helena Stjernholm.\n\nHanne de Mora was appointed Chairperson of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee met with the external auditors without the presence of management on four occasions in 2020 in connection with Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee regularly met with the Head of Corporate Audit in connection with Audit Committee meetings.\n\nThe  Election  Committee's  assessment  of  independence  of  the  Audit Committee members prior to the Annual General Meeting 2020 is presented above under the 'Independence requirements' section on page 175.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the external auditors, among other tasks, discussed the external audit plan and the view of risk management. The Audit Committee held nine regular meetings during 2020. The attendance of Board members at the committee meetings is presented in the table on page 177. The Audit Committee reports the outcome of its work to all members of the Board on a regular basis and the minutes of the Audit Committee meetings are distributed to all Board members.\n\nthe status and development of the Group's operations. As part of this work, the Board usually makes a yearly visit to the Company's operations throughout the world. In 2020, the Board had to cancel its trip due to the global situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFinally, during 2020, the Board decided to discontinue its Technology and Business Transformation Committee since the technology change and business transformation of the Volvo Group require the full Board's involvement.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board's work\n\nIn 2021, the Board performed its yearly evaluation of the Board's work during  the  previous  year.  The  purpose  of  the  evaluation  is  to  further develop the Board's efficiency and working procedures and to determine the main focus of the Board's coming work. In addition, the evaluation serves as a tool for determining the competence required by the Board and for analyzing the competence that already exists in the current Board. By that, the evaluation also serves as input for the Election Committee's work with proposing Board members.\n\nAs part of the yearly evaluation, Board members were asked to complete a questionnaire and assess various areas related to the Board's work from their own perspective. The areas evaluated for 2020 included the Board's composition, the management and focus of Board meetings, Board support and how the Board addresses issues related to strategy, sustainability, potential risks and succession planning. The areas covered by the evaluation may differ from one year to another to reflect the development of the Board's work and the Volvo Group and in 2020, particular focus was kept on the Board's work during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSeparate evaluations were conducted of the Board as a collective, of the Chairman of the Board, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The results of the evaluations of the Board as a collective and of the Chairman were discussed by the Board. The results of the evaluations of the committees were, or will be, discussed by the relevant committee. In addition, the results of the evaluations of the Board as a collective and of the Chairman are shared with the Election Committee.\n\n## Remuneration of Board Members\n\nThe Annual General Meeting resolves on fees to be paid to the Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting. For information about Board  remuneration  adopted  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  2020, please refer to Note 27 in the Group's notes in the Annual and Sustainability Report. During the year, the Board members decided on a 20 percent reduction of their Board and Committee remuneration from the Annual General Meeting 2020 to the Annual General Meeting 2021.\n\n| Remuneration of Board members, 2020   (from AGM on June 18, 2020, not adjusted   for the 20 percent reduction)   | SEK       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Chairman of the Board                                                                                            | 3,600,000 |\n| Board member 1                                                                                                   | 1,060,000 |\n| Chairman of the Audit Committee                                                                                  | 380,000   |\n| Member of the Audit Committee                                                                                    | 175,000   |\n| Chairman of the Remuneration Committee                                                                           | 160,000   |\n| Member of the Remuneration Committee                                                                             | 115,000   |\n\n- 1  With the exception of the CEO.",

The Volvo Group drive prosperity socially, environmentally and financially, by striving for transport and infrastructure solutions that are safe, fossil-free and productive. The Volvo Group drive the transformation in its industry to shape the world we want to live in. Based on the updated Group's strategic priorities and Volvo Group 2030 ambitions, each Business Area defines its own operational plans. The long term plans, such as the Group's industrial and product plans, are also crucial parts of the Group's strategic direction. For more information about the Volvo Group's strategy, please refer to pages 8-16 of the Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\n## Governance documents\n\nAnother key component of the Group's governance is its policies and directives, such as the Code of Conduct and policies pertaining to investments, financial risks, accounting, financial control and internal audit, which contain Group-wide operating and financial rules for the operations, as well as responsibility and authority structures.\n\n## Organizational structure\n\nDuring 2020, the business of the Volvo Group was organized into ten Business Areas. Of these, four represent brand-specific Business Areas for trucks: Volvo Trucks, Renault Trucks, Mack Trucks and UD Trucks, each with profit and loss and balance sheet responsibility for their respective business. The other Business Areas are Volvo Construction Equipment,  Volvo  Buses,  Volvo  Penta,  ARQUUS,  Volvo  Financial  Services (VFS) and Volvo Autonomous Solution (VAS).\n\nThe Group's Trucks Business is further organized into three divisions: Group Trucks Technology (GTT), Group Trucks Purchasing (GTP) and Group Trucks Operations (GTO).\n\nGTT has overall responsibility for product development of engines, transmissions  and  trucks.  GTP  is  responsible  for  purchasing  for  the Group's trucks, engines and transmissions operations as well as for the Group's purchase of indirect products and services. GTO is responsible for the production of all trucks and the Group's engines and transmissions, as well as for the Group's spare parts supply and logistics operation.\n\nThe five Group Functions: Group Human Resources, Group Finance, Group Communication, Group Legal & Compliance and Group IT, are tasked with supporting the entire organization with expertise within each Group Function area, developing standards through policies, directives and guidelines and providing services and/or products for the entire Group.\n\nWith this governance model, Volvo can utilize the synergies of having global organizations for product development, purchasing and manufacturing,  while  maintaining  clear  leadership  and  responsibility  for  each brand to make sure that customer needs are met. The aim of the governance model is that all Business Areas are driven according to the same distinct business principles, whereby each Business Area can follow and optimize its own earnings performance and cash flow generation in the short and long term.\n\nOn January 28, 2021 the Volvo Group announced that it creates a new business area dedicated to accelerating electrification. The business area, Volvo Energy, will strengthen the Volvo Group's business flow of batteries over the life cycle as well as the customer offer for charging infrastructure. Starting in February 2021, Joachim Rosenberg, member of the Volvo Group Executive Board and Chairman of UD Trucks, will head the new business area.\n\n## Volvo Group organization\n\n<!-- image -->",

The members of the Group Executive Board report directly to the CEO.\n\nThe  Presidents  of  the  Business  Areas  Volvo  Buses,  Volvo  Penta, ARQUUS, VFS and VAS also report directly to the CEO and are part of an extended Group Management Team together with the members of the Group Executive Board.\n\nThe CEO is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the Volvo Group and is authorized to make decisions on matters that do not require Board approval. The CEO leads the operations of the Group mainly through the Group Executive Board and the extended Group Management Team.\n\nKey decisions related to the Group's offering and technology portfolio are made by the Product Board.\n\nQuality-related matters are addressed in the Quality Board in order to support fast decision-making, coordination and customer focus in this area. At special meetings for Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP), decisions are made regarding a production plan aimed at optimizing the Volvo Group's overall profitability. The purpose of the meetings is to balance demand with supply chain capabilities, drive capacity management and provide directions for the Group's sales and operations activities.\n\nEach Business Area has quarterly business review meetings where key decisions for the respective Truck Division and Business Area are made.\n\nAll of the above bodies affect control and monitoring of the Group's financial development, strategies and targets, and make decisions regarding investments and other matters.\n\n## Remuneration of the Group Executive Board\n\nAB  Volvo's  Annual  General  Meeting  shall,  at  least  every  fourth  year, resolve on a remuneration policy for remuneration for the members of the Group Executive Board, based on a proposal from the Board. For information about the remuneration policy adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020, please refer to Note 27 'Personnel' in the Group's notes in the Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\n## Changes to the Group Executive Board and Group Management\n\nOn January 1, 2020 Scott Rafkin assumed the position as Executive Vice President and Chief Digital Officer and joined the Group Executive Board.

Finally, Anna Westerberg replaced H\u00e5kan Agnevall as President of Volvo Buses on February 1, 2021, when she also joined the Group Management Team.\n\n## Sustainability and climate related matters\n\nThe  organizational  structure  described  in  this  Corporate  Governance Report applies to all strategic topics within the Volvo Group, including climate and sustainability matters. The Volvo Group relies on an integrated approach to ensure that sustainability topics are considered in all relevant decision making. Opportunities and risks are identified in the business  areas  primarily  through  government  regulation,  technology development, customer satisfaction and physical risks integrated with other risk perspectives.\n\nCross-functional working groups, such as the Product Board, Human Rights Board, People Board and Environmental Committee, prepare and coordinate topics for decision at the Group Executive Board and AB Volvo Board  level.  These  groups  include  relevant  Business  Area  and  Truck Division representatives depending on the topic. Climate related opportunities and risks are discussed e.g. in the Product Board, primarily as part of the transition toward fossil-free transportation.",

        "page_content": "The foundation of the internal control process relating to the financial reporting is based on the Group's directives, policies and instructions, as well as the organization's responsibility and authority structure. The principles for Volvo's internal controls and directives and policies for the financial reporting are contained in the Volvo Group Management System, a group  wide  management  system  comprising,  among  other  things, instructions, rules and principles.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisks relating to financial reporting are evaluated and monitored by the Board through the Audit Committee inter alia through identifying risks that could be considered as material, and through the mitigating control objectives. The risk assessment is based on a number of criteria, such as the  complexity  of  the  accounting  principles,  revaluation  principles  of assets or liabilities, complex and/or changing business circumstances, etc. The risks together with mitigating control objectives are collected in a framework for internal control over financial reporting, Volvo Internal Control Standard (VICS).\n\n## Control activities\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Board  and  its  Audit  Committee,  the  management groups and other decision-making bodies in the Group constitute overall supervisory  bodies.  Business  processes  are  designed  to  ensure  that potential errors or deviations in the financial reporting are prevented, discovered and corrected by implementing control activities that correspond to the control objectives defined in the VICS framework. Control activities range from review of outcome results against earlier periods and forecasts  in  management  group  meetings  to  specific  reconciliation  of accounts and analyses of the ongoing processes for financial reporting.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nPolicies and instructions relating to the financial reporting are updated and communicated on a regular basis from management to all affected employees. The Group's financial reporting function has direct operating responsibility for the daily financial reporting and works to ensure a uniform application of the Group's policies, principles and instructions for the financial reporting and to identify and communicate shortcomings and areas of improvement in the processes for financial reporting.\n\n## AUDITOR'S REPORT ON THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders of AB Volvo, corporate identity number 556012-5790\n\n## Engagement and responsibility\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for that the corporate governance statement on pages 172-187 has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\n## The scope of the audit\n\nOur examination of the corporate governance statement is conducted in accordance with FAR's auditing standard RevU 16 The auditor's examination of the corporate governance statement. This means that our examination of the corporate governance statement is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards  on  Auditing  and  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  in Sweden. We believe that the examination has provided us with sufficient basis for our opinions.\n\n## Follow-up\n\nOngoing  responsibility  for  follow-up  rests  with  the  Group's  financial reporting function. In addition, the Corporate Audit and the Internal Control function conduct review and follow-up activities in accordance with what is described in the introduction of this report. More specifically, the Internal  Control  function  runs  and  coordinates  evaluation  activities through the 'Volvo Group Internal Control Programme', with the purpose of systematically evaluating the quality of the internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. An annual evaluation plan is established and presented to the Audit Committee. This evaluation program comprises three main areas:\n\n- 1.  Group-wide controls: Self-assessment procedure carried out by management teams at business area, Group Function and company levels. The main areas evaluated are compliance with the Group's financial directives and policies and the Group's Code of Conduct.\n- 2.  Process controls at transaction level: Processes related to the financial reporting are evaluated by testing procedures/controls based on the framework for internal control over financial reporting, Volvo Internal Control Standards (VICS).\n- 3.  General  IT  controls:  Processes  for  maintenance,  development  and access management of financial applications are evaluated by testing procedures and controls.\n\nThe results of the evaluation activities are reported to Group management and the Audit Committee. During 2020, the Internal Control function reported two times 1 to the Audit Committee regarding the annual evaluation plan, status on outstanding issues and final assessment of the control environment.\n\nG\u00f6teborg, February 25, 2021\n\nAB Volvo (publ) The Board of Directors\n\n- 1   In 2020 the Internal Control function reported only twice to the Audit Committee, depending on a changed frequency and content in the reporting.\n\n## Opinion\n\nA  corporate  governance  statement  has  been  prepared.  Disclosures  in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the second paragraph points 2-6 of the Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 the second paragraph the same law are consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and are in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\nG\u00f6teborg, February 25, 2021\n\nDeloitte AB\n\nJan Nilsson\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant",

        "page_content": "## PROPOSED POLICY FOR REMUNERATION TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES\n\n## The Board of Directors' of AB Volvo (publ) proposal for guidelines for remuneration to the Volvo Group Executive Board\n\n## (remuneration policy)\n\nThese guidelines (AB Volvo's remuneration policy) concern the remuneration and other terms of employment for the members of the Volvo Group Executive Board ('Executives').\n\nThe guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after the proposed adoption of these guidelines by the 2021 annual general meeting.  These  guidelines  do  not  apply  to  any  remuneration  decided  or approved by the general meeting. Any new share-based incentive plans will, where applicable, be resolved by the general meeting, but no such plan is currently proposed.\n\n## The guidelines' promotion of the Volvo Group's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\n\nIt is a prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Volvo Group's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, that the Group can recruit, retain and develop senior management. These guidelines enable AB Volvo to offer Executives a competitive total remuneration. More information regarding the Volvo Group's business strategy is available in the Volvo Group Annual and Sustainability Report.\n\n## Types of remuneration\n\nVolvo Group remuneration to Executives shall consist of the following components: base salary, short-term and long-term variable incentives, pension benefits and other benefits.\n\nShort-term incentives may, for the President and CEO, amount to a maximum of 100 per cent of the base salary and, for other Executives, a maximum of 80 per cent of the base salary.\n\nLong-term incentives may, for the President and CEO, amount to a maximum of 100 per cent of the base salary and, for other Executives, a maximum of 80 per cent of the base salary. The current long-term incentive plan for the Group's senior management, including the Executives, was introduced in connection with the 2016 annual general meeting. The objective of the program is to drive long-term value creation and align the interests of the senior management with those of shareholders. To achieve this, the program operates on a four year cycle; with a performance based annual award, which is invested in Volvo shares with a mandatory lock-in period of three years. There will be no payout under the long-term incentive program if the Annual General Meeting that is held in the year following the performance year, decides not to distribute any dividends to the shareholders. The program is funded on an annual basis by an award, measured against performance criteria established by the Board of Directors. The after tax portion of this payment must be immediately invested in AB Volvo shares which must be held for a minimum of three years. In this way, the Executives will build up a shareholding in the company and\n\nhave a vested interest over the longer term development in the value of the shares. At the end of the three year period, the Executives may sell their shares, if they meet the requirement for owning shares valued at two years of the pre-tax base salary for the President and CEO and one year of the pre-tax base salary for the other Executives. The holding requirements for the Executives shall cease upon termination of an Executive's employment, and the Board of Directors may grant such other exceptions to the requirements as the Board deems appropriate.\n\nFurther cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis, either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining Executives, or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 per cent of the annual base salary. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.\n\nFor the President and CEO, pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan. The pensionable salary shall include base salary only. The pension contributions for the President and CEO attributable to the annual base salary shall amount to not more than 35 per cent of the base salary.\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, life insurance, medical and health insurance, and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 3 per cent of the annual base salary for the President and CEO.\n\nFor other Executives, pension benefits shall be granted on the basis of a defined contribution plan except where law or collective agreement require a defined benefit pension. The pensionable salary shall include base salary and where required by law or collective agreement, shortterm incentives. The total pension contributions for other Executives shall amount to not more than 35 per cent of base salary, unless a higher percentage results from the application of law or collective agreement.\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, life insurance, medical and health insurance, and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the annual base salary for other Executives.\n\nRemuneration for Executives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\nIn addition to remuneration set out above, Executives who relocate for the purposes of the position or who work in other multiple countries may also receive such remuneration and benefits as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances associated with such arrangements, taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group applicable to cross border work.",

        "page_content": "## Termination of employment\n\n## The decision-making process to determine,\n\nUpon termination of an Executive's employment, the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Base salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the base salary for two years.\n\nExecutives that reside outside Sweden or reside in Sweden but having a material connection to or having been residing in a country other than Sweden may be offered notice periods for termination and severance payment as are reasonable to reflect the special circumstances, taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines and alignment with the general policies and practices within the Volvo Group.\n\n## Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration, etc.\n\nShort-term and long-term incentives shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria. The criteria - which for example may relate to EBIT, cash flow, return on capital employed or similar ratios, or sustainability targets - shall be devised to promote the Volvo Group's strategy and longterm value creation and strengthen the link between achieved performance  targets  and  reward.  The  criteria  for  short-term  and  long-term incentives shall be determined by the Board of Directors annually. The satisfaction of the criteria shall be measured over periods of one year each.\n\nTo which extent the criteria for awarding variable remuneration has been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant measurement period has ended. The Board of Directors is responsible for the determination of variable remuneration to all Executives.\n\n## Claw-back and adjustments\n\nExecutives participating in the Volvo Group's current short-term and longterm incentive plans are obligated, in certain circumstances and for specified periods of time, to repay, partially or in its entirety, variable incentive awards already paid if payments have been made by mistake or been based on intentionally falsified data or in the event of material restatement of the Volvo Group's financial results. Furthermore, the Board of Directors may decide on adjustments of pay-out under the incentive plans (before payment has been made) in case of extraordinary circumstances or to adjust for unforeseen one-timers.\n\n## Salary and employment conditions for employees\n\nIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines, the Board has considered that the various benefits offered to the Executives need to be aligned with the general structures applicable for employees of AB Volvo at levels that are competitive in the market. Thus, salary and employment conditions for other AB Volvo employees have been taken into account by including information thereon in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate.\n\n## review and implement the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate plans for variable remuneration for Executives, the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Group. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of AB Volvo and its executive management. The President and CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.\n\n## Derogation from the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Volvo Group's longterm interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the Group's financial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing  the  Board  of  Directors'  resolutions  in  remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.\n\n## Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders' have been taken into consideration\n\nDuring 2020, the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors have consulted with shareholders individually and collectively and have followed up on comments and questions received from shareholders in connection with the annual general meeting in June 2020 and otherwise during the year. For further information, please refer to the section Consideration of shareholder views in the Remuneration Report 2020. The Remuneration Committee and the Board have for 2021 and onwards decided to propose a change to the company's pension commitments to its President and CEO, Deputy CEO and other Executives employed in Sweden, aiming to simplify the pension commitments and bring them more in line with the prevailing pension schemes for similar individuals in the Swedish market, without materially altering the remuneration from an economical perspective. Due to the forward-looking nature of the remuneration policy, the amendments apply to new employment contracts entered into after approval of the amended policy by the annual general meeting  2021  and  for  existing  employment  contracts  if  changes  are agreed to by the Executives in scope.\n\nAdditional information regarding executive remuneration in the Volvo Group is available in the Volvo Group Annual and Sustainability Report.",

The Board further concludes that the proposed dividend is justifiable in view of the parameters set out in Chapter 17, Section 3, second and third paragraphs of the Swedish Companies Act. In connection herewith, the Board wishes to point out the following:\n\nThe proposed dividend reduces the Company's solvency from 78.0% to 65.2% and the Group's solvency from 29.0% to 24.5%, calculated as per year end 2020. The Board of Directors considers this solvency to be satisfactory with regard to the business in which the Group is active.\n\nAccording to the Board of Directors' opinion, the proposed dividend will not affect the Company's or the Group's ability to fulfill their payment obligations and the Company and the Group are well prepared to handle both changes in the liquidity and unexpected events.\n\nThe Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Company and the Group have capacity to assume future business risks as well as to bear contingent losses. The proposed dividend is not expected to adversely affect the Company's and the Group's ability to make further commercially justified investments in accordance with the Board of Directors' plans.\n\nIn addition to what has been stated above, the Board of Directors has considered other known circumstances which may be of importance for the Company's and the Group's financial position. In doing so, no circumstance has appeared that does not justify the proposed dividend.\n\nIf the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of  Directors'  proposal,  SEK  24,298,934,337.67  will  remain  of  the Company's non-restricted equity, calculated as per year end 2020.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  the  view  that  the  Company's  and  the Group's shareholders' equity will, after the proposed dividend, be sufficient in relation to the nature, scope and risks of the business.\n\nThe Board of Directors and the President certify that the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the international set of accounting standards referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards, and give a true and fair view of the position and profit or loss of the Company and the Group, and that the management report for the Company and for the Group gives a fair review of the development and performance of the business, position and profit or loss of the Company and the Group, and describes the principal risks and uncertainties that the Company and the companies in the Group face.\n\n## G\u00f6teborg, February 25, 2021\n\nCarl-Henric Svanberg Board Chairman\n\nMatti Alahuhta Board member James W.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 40-149, 188-190 and 194-196 in this document.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2020 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2020 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not include the sustainability report on page 76. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.\n\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company's audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Impairment risk for vehicles sold with residual value commitment Risk description\n\nWhen the sale of the vehicle is combined with a residual value commitment and it is concluded that control with respect to the vehicle sold has not been transferred, the sales transaction is recognized as an operating lease transaction and an asset is recognised in the balance sheet. These assets carry a risk that the ultimate disposal of the used vehicles could lead to a loss if the price development of these vehicles is worse than what was expected when the contracts were entered. The assessment of the risk is based on the estimation of the used vehicle's future fair market value. The accounting principles for vehicles sold with residual value commitment and management's  significant  judgments  applied  in  relation  thereto  are  further described in Note 13 'Tangible Assets' to the annual report.\n\nFair market values are dependent on the situation in the used vehicle markets prevailing when the vehicles are expected to be returned. The future-oriented valuation is based on a number of assumptions and involves high degree of estimation for example on conditions of the vehicles returned and expected repair costs, future price developments due to change of market conditions  and  distribution channels used for ultimate disposal of the vehicles. The Covid-19 pandemic created a demand and supply gap which impacted the prices of used vehicles negatively during parts of 2020 and also the used vehicles fair market value expectations for future years.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluating the design and implementation of relevant internal controls implemented within the determination of fair market value process;\n- \u00b7  assessing the reasonableness of the methodology used in determination of fair market value including reviewing management's written policies, procedures and accounting position papers;\n- \u00b7  performing audit procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data and information used by management in determining the fair market value;\n- \u00b7  assessing and challenging the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions in relation to fair market values of used vehicles based on current market trends and future market developments, expected repair costs and distribution channels. Management's assessment was evaluated based on enquiries and inspection of documentation supporting key assumptions and considerations taken by management.\n\n## Allowance for Expected Credit Losses for Customer- Financing Receivables\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe  Volvo  Group  applies  a  simplified  expected  credit  loss  model  for customer-financing receivables, under which the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The allowance is recorded at initial recognition and is reassessed during the contract period. The accounting principles for expected credit losses and management's significant judgments applied in relation thereto are further described in Note 15 'Customer-Financing Receivables' to the annual report.",

        "page_content": "The determination of the allowance for expected credit losses for the customer-financing receivables requires management to make significant qualitative judgments, including assumptions regarding current and forecasted  market  conditions  and  individual  assessment  of  the  largest customers and business segments. Due to uncertainty caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, historical credit loss information used within the expected credit loss model to forecast future credit losses may not adequately reflect the current economic environment. This leads to a higher  risk  related  to  management's  assumptions  to  estimate  the expected frequency and severity of defaults and other qualitative management overlays due to the high degree of uncertainty and subjectivity of the severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on customer and business segments. Additionally, modifications made to customer contracts during the year in response to the Covid-19 pandemic changing payment terms increases risk in management's monitoring of on-going payment performance and identification of signs of customer default as part of the individual assessment of the financial condition of customers.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluating the design and implementation of relevant internal controls implemented within the allowance for expected credit loss process;\n- \u00b7  assessing the reasonableness of the expected credit loss model and methodology used including reviewing management's written policies, procedures and accounting position papers around the model;\n- \u00b7  involving our financial service industry valuation experts with specific knowledge and expertise who assisted in evaluating the reasonableness of the methodology used;\n- \u00b7  performing audit procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data and information used in management's expected credit loss model and management overlays;\n- \u00b7  independently reperformed the calculations within the model to ensure the output is accurate and carried out retrospective review to assess the reliability of model's historical ability to estimate future credit losses;\n- \u00b7  assessing and challenging the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions in relation to severity of default, frequency of default and management overlays, including inspection of documentation supporting key assumptions and considerations taken by management.\n\n## Provisions for losses from claims from customers and other third parties - EC Antitrust  Settlement\n\n## Risk description\n\nIn July 2016, the European Commission and Volvo Group reached a settlement with regards to antitrust allegations made by the European Commission in relation to Volvo Group and other companies in the truck manufacturing  industry.  Following  the  adoption  of  the  European  Commission's settlement decision, the Company has received and may continue to receive numerous third-party damages claims from customers and other third parties alleging that they suffered loss by reason of the conduct covered in the decision. The accounting principles for provisions for legal disputes is further described in Note 21 'Other Provisions' to the annual report.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of any provisions recorded for such legal disputes is complicated, requires expert legal input, and involves consideration of potential future outcomes of the claims which at this stage are uncertain. Due to these complexities, the valuation of any such provisions is significantly impacted by management's ultimate judgments\n\nand best estimates. At December 31, 2020, the Company has not been able to make a reliable estimate of the amount of any liability that could arise from these claims. Further information is disclosed in Note 24 'Contingent Liabilities' to the annual report.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7  holding discussions with management and audit the relevant documentation and conclude how management and the board assessed the claims.\n- \u00b7  holding discussions with internal legal department and with Volvo Group's external legal advisors in order to obtain an understanding of matters relevant to the claims.\n- \u00b7  reviewing internal minutes and relevant assessments prepared for management to corroborate the consistency of information received.\n- \u00b7  evaluating the appropriateness of the Company's final conclusions.\n- \u00b7 assessing the adequacy of the disclosures around the legal proceedings.\n\n## Other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for other information. The other information includes the Remuneration report, and the pages 1-39, 150-171 and 197-206 in this document which does not include the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or our Auditors report.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President\n\nThe Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.  The Board of Directors and the President are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the President intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company's financial reporting process.",

We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the company's organization and the administration of the company's affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial\n\nsituation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the President in any material respect:\n\n- \u00b7  has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or\n- \u00b7  in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the management's administration is located at the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar.
