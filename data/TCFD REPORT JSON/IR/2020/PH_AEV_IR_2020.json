Paulino Aboitiz embarked on his journey through the Suez Canal to reach Philippine shores and arrived in Ormoc in the southern province of Leyte in 1870.\n\nPaulino ventured in the trading of abaca, which, at that time, was the booming product for export. Hard work and ambition drove him to become a well-established merchant, transporting and distributing abaca and other commodities to Cebu. He was supported by his son Ramon,who pushed for the purchase of the company's first boat, the Picket, bought in 1907 for PHP7,500 at a government auction. This signaled the start of the Aboitiz shipping business. Ramon also oversaw the establishment of an office in Cebu, then already a bustling port town and central business district, which allowed them to diversify and expand their markets.\n\nThe brothers'  efforts led to ACO's incorporation in 1920. Unfortunately, a few months later, World War I broke out. The market prices of abaca plummeted due to decreased demand. Business trading, in general, was in shambles. ACO teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, and Ramon was pushed by colleagues to declare it in order to escape their debts and to save what was left. But Ramon resisted, and instead, borrowed money from former business associates and a few friends. It took many years to repay all the loans, but Ramon's palabra de honor lifted the company from near dissolution.\n\n'The biggest fortune I have is my word and reputation. Money can be lost and can be recovered, but once your name and reputation are lost, one's word is worthless, and one is truly finished.'\n\nDon Ramon Aboitiz\n\nIn the decades following ACO's incorporation, the astute leader Ramon - and the presidents who succeeded him - involved the company in other interests. They moved from distributing abaca, copra, and other agricultural produce to selling chemicals, construction materials, industrial equipment, and car parts in the mid1900s. One of the widely-known investments of the Aboitiz Group was shipping, which was formally incorporated in 1952 through Aboitiz Shipping Corporation. It ventured into sea, land, and air travel, and pioneered containerization in the country. ACO also tapped into businesses that would complement its existing ones: sugar milling and plantations, electricity distribution, financial services, oxygen production, cold storage facilities, and wood preservation, among many others.\n\nIn 1994, ACO publicly listed its holding and management company Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. (AEV) at the Philippine Stock Exchange. In 2007, Aboitiz Power Corporation also went public. In 2010, AEV divested its shipping business and focused on its other core businesses. Today, the Aboitiz Group continues to evolve, with our time-honored core values of Integrity, Teamwork, Innovation, and Responsibility continuing to compel us to seek ways to translate economic development into the greater good, resonating in actions and decisions to help uplift the lives of the people we serve. What started as Paulino's small family business in Leyte is now a major conglomerate expanding its footprint across Southeast Asia.\n\nACO marked its 100th year as a corporation in 2020, and we look back to reflect and appreciate the learnings that the previous generations of A-People have put forth to bring us to where we are today. As we energize communities, fulfill the dreams of many, connect ideas, design experiences, or take on evolving challenges, our inclusive understanding of societal needs sustains our purpose and promise to drive change for a better world by advancing business and communities. We look back with fondness on our small-town beginnings in the Visayas while making major strides towards our shared future for our country and region.\n\nMoving on to the next hundred years, we will continue to think long-term and brace for new beginnings, beyond borders, and transcending generations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

More importantly, we will share with you our best assessment of the year and years to come.\n\nThe timely adaptation to change, as a broad philosophical guide for both our thinking and behavior, are ingredients of the culture we are enriching in everything we do, everywhere and always. Adaptation could not have been underlined and placed in bold letters more than by COVID-19. We still see unintended consequences as our most serious threat. COVID-19 reminded us vividly.\n\nThe continuous challenge we mentioned to you last year of getting all our fundamentals right as we innovate precisely for the timely adaptation to change is generally being met. The highlight is that our plants are running better. COVID-19, on the other hand, has delayed the entrance into the operation of our single largest investment in a very long time and maybe in our history, our GN Power Dinginin. That is another fundamental that we will get right this year.\n\nCOVID-19 will force all of us to operate smarter disruptively and digitally. We were a little ahead of the game here and this enabled us to adapt very quickly. As part of our digital transformation strategy very early on, we dedicated a significant amount of energy and resources into preparing our team for remote working alongside vigilance to cybersecurity risks. These became top concerns in the business world last year but Aboitiz has already put this into practice, which has\n\n<!-- image -->",

For a few months, we devoted much discussion on preparing for the worst by monitoring, with management, more of the company more often than usual. We are back to our normal governance schedule but must take the opportunity to applaud the government, particularly Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas whose quick action ensured the banking system remained liquid and open to lending.\n\nLooking back, our first imperative was the safety of our people. Your management team, particularly at HR, did what it needed to do to ensure the safety of our team members and their families as we moved into working from wherever. Limitations and constraints enhanced the challenge that we met but we kept a holistic approach to protect our people physically, emotionally, and mentally.\n\nAs the nationwide lockdown was imposed, we aimed to ensure peace of mind among all team members by releasing their mid-year pay and Christmas bonuses ahead of schedule. Our non-stop information campaign tackled proper health and safety protocols, virtual updates from our technical working group, consultations with experts, to name a few - all to help the Group better understand the dynamics of COVID-19. Aboitiz Academy used the time to train and educate. Vaccination is high on our agenda for both protection and evolution to a newer, better, and smarter way of doing things with caution yet more freedom.\n\nThe next imperative was to help our communities through direct interventions and in cooperation with the government and other members of the private sector as the surprise micro-beast that attacked us was one that needed all hands on deck.  The disasters of typhoons in the past prepared the private sector to react and help, together with the government. We invite you to read through the COVID-19 section of this report, which provides details on our groupwide initiatives to support\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we have for the last 100 years, our purpose is to advance business and communities. We continue to do so as we have for a very long time. Being contributing neighbors is the right thing to do and it is through our business - our products and services - where we can make the biggest positive impact on our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n102-14\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour communities and all our stakeholders through this health crisis.\n\nPressure and difficulty are wonderful wakeup calls. COVID-19 sent up flares in numerous areas from small matters like DocuSign - that we should have executed earlier - to, more seriously, innovative digital solutions to ensure continued availability of our services and the acceleration of more sophisticated cybersecurity controls.\n\nFortunately, while some of our businesses were affected by the economic slow down caused by the community quarantine, our businesses proved resilient with most back to pre-pandemic levels. We do not have businesses that will take a long time to come back to where they were, if they ever do. We refer to the tourism, hospitality, and transportation businesses that are particularly difficult.\n\nOverall, all sectors are working with profits and positive cash flows for an ever firmer balance\n\nsheet. Our president will give you more details in his report. The system to monitor all operations tighter and more frequently were set up at the governance and management levels. We are lightening the load of the center to evolve into higher levels of openness, agility, and innovation.\n\nThe vaccine is upon us and igniting optimism but it is not yet here. Prudence tells us to continue on red alert and never leave it so we are ready for the next surprise.\n\nAboitiz, as a corporation, enters its second century in a wake-up call year.

We face the challenge to build our renewable portfolio because it is the right thing to do for our country and for the long-term sustainability of our business.\n\nMost importantly, increased attention is being given to what is beyond the balance sheet - the value produced by our intangibles, particularly our culture. Too much attention was given by the world, and us by osmosis, to compliance and process. While this is important, there is much to get done and we are re-balancing how we invest our time and energy into getting things done better and smarter to remain super competitive.\n\nWe are on red alert today. The main 'beyond the balance sheet' initiative we have learned and are ingraining into our DNA is that red alert is\n\nthe 'new normal'. We know a new surprise is coming. In what form and from where we are not sure, but we do know it is in its bacterial stage. Complacency and overconfidence are our enemy.\n\nAs we have for the last 100 years, our purpose is to advance business and communities.  We continue to do so as we have for a very long time. Being contributing neighbors is the right thing to do and it is through our business - our products and services - where we can make the biggest positive impact on our stakeholders.\n\nWe are not going to be a company that rides on to a fad of having a purpose. We had this purpose since we can remember. Ramon Aboitiz built the Cebu Boys' Town to take care of and train orphans. We modernized the shipping business with our SuperFerries. We brought in one of the first modern sugar mills to Ormoc a little under 100 years ago. In Davao, we did not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\njust put up more poles to serve more people, we also set up free street lights, the city's 911 emergency service, the Aboitiz Cleanergy Park for the pawikan, and, in December 2020, launched BEST Bus, its first free electric bus service in the central business district.

In banking and financial services, we are leveraging digital technology to elevate lives by promoting greater financial inclusion. We are likewise helping to ensure food security and availability, for example, by training displaced Maranao yellow corn farmers in entrepreneurship and by linking them to potential buyers. Service to our communities and our country goes hand in hand with better business - it always has.\n\nWe have always put people first because success is about better people serving our customers in better and smarter ways. Good returns follow happy and returning customers. Aboitiz has always acted understanding the above clearly. It is probably the single most important reason that we have, as a family, been in business all over these islands way before we began life as a corporation. COVID-19 reminded us against any talent management complacency.\n\nThere is a fear that our economy will take longer than most to recover. We are hoping that the unmeasured resilience of our people will make up for the deficit of traditional international measures. We are a unique people that have been isolated and insulated in our own little part of Southeast Asia.\n\nWe may not be the best at the pro-active but we are quite good at the reactive. We have faith in the capacity of our people to work together in crisis even some of our more formal institutions fail.  Our overseas workers, the heroes of our economy are all firmly there - everywhere they are first to hire and last to fire.  Some have\n\ncome back, like the cruise ship farers, but far more are still out there helping their families and our economy. We are a spiritual culture that helps each other. That matters in ways few international institutions can measure. We have surprised ourselves before. We will surprise ourselves again.\n\nNot everything that counts, can be counted. we have shown the world this often.\n\nWe are optimistic that the economy will recover and reach pre-pandemic levels. Whether that recovery comes this year, the next, or the one after - we are ready! One thing we are positive about is we will come out of this crisis stronger as a business and as a country.\n\n#OneAboitiz!\n\nEnrique M.

It was clear early on that we needed to put aside many pre-planned projects, cut down 2020 CAPEX, and conserve cash to protect the goose that is Aboitiz. In trying to see around corners, our focus has been to make decisions that translate to equitable and values-driven action while keeping optimism intact on the path towards recovery.\n\n## Aboitiz Group's Pandemic Response\n\nIn January 2020, Aboitiz Foundation was in the midst of leading our Taal relief operations when we began to keep a close eye on news coming out of Wuhan in Central China. By the time the World Health Organization had given a name to the virus, our technical working group had already rolled out minimum health standards, preventive measures, travel advisories, and procedures for handling cases. Our business continuity plans - designed to further minimize disruption - were set in motion as the entire country went into enhanced community quarantine or ECQ.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Power accounted for the largest share of the total income contribution from AEV's SBUs. It turned in 52% , followed by the Banking and Financial Services, which increased its contribution to 32%. Our Food SBU contributed 12% while the remainder was covered by Infrastructure and Land SBUs with 2% each.\n\nAboitiz Power Corporation's (AboitizPower) net income contribution decreased by 27% year-onyear (YoY) to PHP9.7 billion from the previous year's PHP13.3 billion.\n\nUnion Bank of the Philippines' (UnionBank) income contribution for 2020 dipped to PHP5.9 billion from PHP7.2 billion in 2019. The decline was due to higher provisions for loan losses in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAEV's non-listed food subsidiaries reported an income contribution of PHP2.2 billion for 2020, up from PHP1.6 billion in 2019. Strong gains from the Food Group's overseas units were able to offset local declines.\n\nRepublic Cement & Building Materials posted an income contribution to AEV of PHP590 million, a 4% decrease from the PHP612 million recorded in 2019. This was due to lower demand for cement due to the decline in construction activities in 2020, particularly during the enforcement of COVID-related community quarantines.\n\nAboitizLand and its subsidiaries reported a consolidated net income of PHP338 million in 2020, 64% lower than the PHP943 million recorded in 2019. The decrease was brought about by fair valuation gains on investment properties recognized in 2019.\n\nWe provide more information on these and a review of each SBU's operations in the Results of Operations sections of this report.",

Instead, we need to continue learning from this big room for improvement that continues to expand before us. This is why, for the second year in a row, Innovation is our 'Value of the Year''. We need to instill this in our teams but achieving that requires consistency and clarity over an extended period of time. It is a slow-and-steady approach, something we truly need to devote time and energy to until it eventually becomes second nature to our everyday thought process. This becomes even more vital as we work to achieve our strategic growth objectives in the post-COVID world.\n\nIt is said that innovation is often borne out of disruption but, more and more, we are seeing innovation coming from a sense of urgency. Not surprisingly, the information age reveals the glaring disconnect between the speed of innovation in improving the quality of life and the almost crippling inability of companies,\n\nleaders in business, to adapt them. Obviously, change needs to start with us.\n\nAt the core, whatever and however we innovate through our products and services should lead to creating a positive impact on our communities. By embracing Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI), we open up to new and bigger opportunities to accelerate our productivity, drive business value, and generate new revenue streams. In 2021, we further harness its full potential with the launch of Aboitiz Data Innovation, our new subsidiary under AEV International that will consolidate the #OneAboitiz DSAI operating model across the Group. This company functions as our key enabler of data strategy through its dual role as a service provider and governance center to support the organization.\n\nWe envision DSAI to be a permanent aspect of each SBU's business landscape, including the development and support of our business models and decision-making capabilities. Ultimately, it will be instrumental towards achieving our environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThough we rely on the government to lead us in finding effective solutions that improve people's lives, it is also imperative for businesses to do our part in helping alleviate the situation and contribute to the global sustainability goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Organizational Resilience\n\nMany aspects of our organizational practice have been much help in navigating the pandemic but at the center of our story are our A-People. The silver lining in 2020 is our team members pulling us through with unparalleled work ethic, agility, and commitment to our stakeholders. They went above and beyond in the past year and it is because of their resilience that we are able to face the future with hope and optimism. Truly, they are the lifeblood of our organization and my confidence rests completely in them.\n\nOne stellar example we will not get tired of repeating is how our experience moving operations from a physical environment to the cloud was like flipping a switch.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, we were already either telecommuting or working from home and had corresponding guidelines and tools in place to support its success. This allowed us to continue to engage with our stakeholders despite the constricting effects of the initial lockdown. Last year, we were among a few publicly listed companies in the Philippines that held their annual stockholders' meetings on time and on a virtual platform.\n\nWe also used digital channels in promoting physical and mental wellness for our team members through 24x7 access to teleconsult services, virtual engagement activities, HR pulse checks, and online learning, which had a surge in uptake throughout last year. In 2021, we have added data science, artificial intelligence,",

We ensure that environmental concerns such as GHG emissions are managed and minimized, waste generation reduced, and the potential recovery of a circular economy and responsible water consumption maximized. We also recognize the equal rights of our team members to a safe working environment and opportunities for learning and development. The Group advances communities' concerns by implementing strategies and programs that help contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nOur Group's 10-year ESG Roadmap is part of our sustainability impact journey. AEV and AboitizPower achieved significant improvements in their S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment in 2020; UnionBank had its maiden assessment last year, ranking well among local peers. As we account for our impacts on our stakeholders, we aim to further improve our ESG performance for long-term value creation and aspire for greater contribution to the global sustainability goals.\n\nIn 2020, the Aboitiz Group, through AEV, was the first Philippine company to signify support for the  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

This is 69% higher than the PHP29 billion used in 2020. Of this amount, PHP23 billion was earmarked by our Power SBU for the completion of GNPower Dinginin as well as the battery energy storage projects. In the same manner, our Infrastructure arm set aside most of the PHP15 billion it had budgeted for the construction of its water businesses and its foray into the tower and airport businesses. The Food Group is expecting to utilize PHP4 billion mainly for feedmill expansion. Rounding out the balance are the provisions of the other SBUs: the Banking group will sustain its investment efforts in its digital and branch transformation endeavors while our Land business has allocated capital expenditure for the completion of its residential projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

While he had conjured this thought from a different perspective, it lends itself to a broader application.\n\nWhat existing mindsets helped us cope from the disruption caused by the pandemic? Four mindsets appear to be: (1) Risk management ('It's everyone's job, regardless of function,' our risk managers often say); (2) Health and safety (fundamentally a way of life, AP achieved a 0.43 injury rate for every 1 million manhours worked in 2020, an exceptional improvement of 69% from its 2015 level when the 1AP Safety Culture program was launched); (3) Innovation (which drove larger scale experimentation on today's technologies as early as 2016); and (4) Corporate social responsibility (which planted the seeds of the ESG roadmap we have today).\n\nRisk management is run enterprise-wide and strong business continuity plans are in place across the organization. Financial risk management is under the purview of the Office of the CFO. Last year, your finance team was focused on ensuring that your company had sufficient cash to sustain its operations and commitments despite a prolonged lockdown. This entailed cost cutting across our operating and capital budgets, constantly revisiting our assumptions, increasing the frequency of our reforecasting, and, most importantly, creative supplier and customer engagement. We also secured access to cash and made sure we had lines to tap should needs arise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We cut about a third of our original budget, but with careful consideration for the impact it might have on our future growth. To fund the remaining projects, we were able to leverage on our strong balance sheet,  the unwavering support of our partner banks, and our century old reputation built on our founder's timeless story of paying back all his debts despite great odds.\n\nA number of major financing transactions were completed in 2020.\n\nJanuary saw the completion of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.'s (AEV or Aboitiz Equity Ventures) US$400 million maiden foreign denominated bond issuance, the first out of Asia for 2020. Soon after that, however, the pandemic escalated, and the quarantines began. And while the markets were tumultuous for the remainder of the year, we found ourselves steadily able to pursue and complete the fundraising initiatives we had planned even pre-pandemic.  Aboitiz Power Corporation (AP or AboitizPower) issued the P9.6 billion bond remaining on its shelf registration with the SEC in July, one of the first two bonds filed and issued during the lockdown. AEV also tapped the market in November for P7.5 Bln, completing the refinancing program for its bond maturity.  Together with these bond issuances, we tapped the banks for parent-level financing as well as project-level financing and refinancing for other members of the group, such as Hedcor Bukidnon, Inc., and Aboitiz Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\nAs a result, AboitizPower's consolidated net debt-to-equity ratio at year end was at 1.4x, unchanged from the previous year's ratio of\n\n1.4x.  For AEV, its consolidated net-debt-toequity at year end 2020 was at 1.1x, compared to the previous year's ratio of 1.2x.  Our overall consolidated debt maturity profile remained within the parameters set by the companies to mitigate liquidity and refinancing risk. Furthermore, as a result of our financial planning, our balance sheets continue to be healthy, and our capacity to raise money through the debt markets, strong.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nA strong innovation mindset planted the seeds of digital transformation early on in our organization. The resulting digital infrastructure allowed us to continue operations and deliver on our stakeholder commitments.\n\nOffice, branch, and plant operations across the portfolio were run through combinations of work shifts, remote via computers, skeletal workforces, work-from-home, and various flexible work arrangements, while observing COVID health protocols. Throughout all this, our first instinct was to protect the health and safety of our team members. Video-conferencing, being a part of our work arsenal for years up to the board level, became the main mode of communication, including for engaging our team members. Our investments in digital initiatives paid off. Your company was one of the very few who were able to immediately shift the processing of transactions to a purely remote environment from the very first day of the community quarantines. A lot evolved along the way, but we were ready from day one.\n\nNow more than ever, our country needed our energy, financial instruments, food, housing, and water to make it through the difficult times. We were challenged, we rose to the occasion, and thrived.\n\nIn 2020, Aboitiz Equity Ventures' consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) dipped by 4% year-on-year (YoY) to PHP57.7 billion. This was primarily due to the challenges that the group faced resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Beneficial EBITDA, which represents AEV's proportional share of the EBITDAs of the companies it has investments in, was 3% lower than the previous year at PHP49.2 billion. Accounting for interest, tax and depreciation expenses, consolidated core net income amounted to PHP15.9 billion, 26% lower than last year. This core income resulted in an earnings per share of PHP2.83.\n\nDuring the year, AEV recognized non-recurring losses, which brought net income to PHP15.4 billion, or 30% lower YoY. This resulted in a return on shareholders' equity of 9%.\n\nPower continued to account for the largest share in earnings contributions to AEV at 52%. The financial services and food SBUs contributed 32% and 12%, respectively, while contributions\n\nfrom the infrastructure and real estate SBUs stood at 2% and 2%, respectively.\n\nUpon the conclusion of 2020, AEV's consolidated cash balance stood at PHP66.9 billion. This leaves the organization with sufficient liquidity to sustain prolonged community quarantines.\n\nIn March 2021, the AEV Board approved a cash dividend of PHP0.91 per share. This accounted for 33% of 2020's consolidated net income and resulted in a dividend yield of 2.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, AboitizPower's recorded consolidated EBITDA amounted to PHP44.7 billion, 1% lower YoY. This was due to AP achieving its target availability for 2020, which offset the reduction in demand resulting from the COVID-related community quarantines. Beneficial EBITDA was 1% higher than last year at PHP43.5 billion. The income tax holidays of several AP business units expired in 2020; taking into account interest, tax and depreciation expenses, consolidated core net income amounted to PHP12.5 billion, or 25% lower than\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to explore new insurance markets to lessen placement difficulty, study the viability of non-traditional risk transfer programs to mitigate identified risks, and optimize our captive participation to manage the increase in risk transfer costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

AboitizPower recorded a net income of PHP12.6 billion, 27% lower than the previous year.\n\nIn March 2021, the AboitizPower Board approved a cash dividend of PHP0.85 per share.

Last year too, our Virtual Annual Stockholders Meeting, a first for us, was one of the few stockholders meetings to be conducted on schedule among publicly listed companies in the Philippines. We also held our first ever Virtual Asset Tours last year, where audiences were able to see first hand the dayto-day operations of the various Aboitiz business units. Across the group, we used our digital platforms to continue to engage our stakeholders\n\n- - from our team members to our customers.\n\nWhile too many to mention, and it will likewise be mentioned in other sections of this report, our finance teams worked extra hours to make sure we provided the various financial assistance needed by our team members, suppliers, customers, and communities.\n\nDespite the pressing issues, we also managed to allocate time on projects to help promote the long-term investability of your company. Here are updates on the three commitments we mentioned in our message last year:\n\n- \u00b7 To improve our ESG ratings and be investment grade over the medium to long\n- term - As mentioned in our CEO's message as well in the AboitizPower segment of this report, we achieved significant improvements in our SAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment results percentile rankings for both AEV and AP; while UnionBank has been assessed for the very first time;\n- \u00b7 To explore how we can adopt the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) over the next three years within the context of our overall strategy - With the help of MSCI, we have done a first run of our data sets and still carefully vetting the methodologies of this very complex report;\n- \u00b7 To refresh our assessment of material sustainability issues, their supporting programs and metrics; and extend our targets to 10-years, which includes our plan to achieve a 50/50 thermal/ renewable mix by the end of the decade\n- - We commenced our re-assessment last year and target completion in 2021. In parallel, work continues on developing and communicating our energy transition plan, of which the details you will see in other parts of this report.\n\n## Risk Finance In A Hardening Insurance Environment\n\nIn 2020, the insurance industry saw a steady increase in premium rates, difficulty in placing\n\n100% of risks, and reductions in policy covers or terms. We expect this situation to carry on for the next couple of years and be further aggravated by the impact of the pandemic as insurers try to recover losses incurred across their portfolio.\n\nCompared to 2019, the Aboitiz Group had lower insurance claims losses which is a testament of its improved risk management processes. Though  insurance premium rates continued to increase, mitigations on preventing insurance losses resulted in the improvement of the Group's Total Cost of Insurable Risk (TCOIR), thereby decreasing from 1.30% to 1.27% against revenue.  This was driven primarily by lower retained losses incurred in 2020.\n\nIn response to this challenging environment, we focused on improving the Group's risk profile through the review of our risk exposures adapted to the current needs of the business and addressed areas for improvement identified in our risk engineering surveys. Despite the\n\n## Capital Expenditure (with partners)\n\nlimitation in conducting a physical engineering survey due to the pandemic, we were able to design a two-phased implementation plan that was agreed with our insurers.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to explore new insurance markets to lessen placement difficulty, study viability of non-traditional risk transfer programs to  mitigate identified risks and optimize our captive participation to manage the increase in risk transfer costs.\n\n## Addressing The Needs Of Today and Tomorrow\n\nAchieving harmony between sustainability and economic prosperity has been ingrained in the way we do things in Aboitiz. This is evident in how AboitizPower manages the balance between energy security, energy equity and environmental sustainability to ensure sustainable energy systems. In the Office of the CFO, we strive to take part in driving the company's growth by making sure there is ample support for the company's aspirations here and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From this, PHP23.4 billion was set aside by our Power SBU for the completion of GN Power Dinginin as well as the Battery Energy Storage Projects. Similarly, our Infrastructure arm appropriated most of its PHP14.7 billion budget for the completion of Apo Agua and its entry into the telecommunications tower business. To the same extent, our food business is expecting to employ PHP4.5 billion mainly for feedmill expansions.\n\nMaking up the balance are the allotments of the other SBUs. Our real estate business has allocated capital expenditure for land banking and the completion of its residential projects  while our Banking business will sustain its investment efforts in the continued enhancement of its digital touchpoints.\n\nIn terms of capital raising, the group started 2021 strong. In March, AboitizPower issued P8.0 billion worth of bonds, representing the first tranche of its newly established P30.0 billion shelf registration. The proceeds will be used to refinance maturing debt and prepay existing higher-cost debt, which will be an ongoing\n\ntheme for the year. AEV and AP are exploring potentially returning to the bond markets in the second half of the year for more refinancing activities.\n\nIn the area of project finance, AP is focused on funding in the renewables space - pursuing the refinancing of various hydro and solar entities.\n\nFor food, we are raising capital to fund various domestic and overseas expansion activities to address food security in the region. With regard to our infrastructure business, we are engaging with potential partners to explore and develop bespoke financing for our towers and airports initiatives. Finally, for our real estate arm, we are focused on terming out our existing loans, to take advantage of relatively low long term rates.\n\nThis is our commitment as proactive participants in the path to economic recovery as the country rises from the shadow of the pandemic.\n\n## Sustainable Finance And The Next 100 Years\n\nIn May last year, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines), issued a circular outlining its plan to promote sustainable finance in the Philippine banking system. This aligns the country with the global effort to use the financial system as a vehicle to address ESGrisks and advance the sustainable development goals. As a first step, we are delighted that UnionBank is among the first banks in the country to put in place its Sustainable Finance Framework, which identifies what projects it aspires to fund under ICMA's Green, Social, and Sustainability Bond Principles (and all its variants, including for loans). In a direct way, it will now be funding projects that are certified to be promoting environmental sustainability or addressing a social issue.\n\nAs the market for sustainable investments gains momentum and scale in the world, we will continue to build our capability to attract and capture funding for our own contributions to solve the world's most pressing issues.\n\nHeading into the future, our drive to capitalize on new opportunities for growth and expansion, not just for the company, but for the countries we operate in, is at its highest. Under the Office of the CFO, we are committed to learning from the past century in order to thrust the organization steadily into the next.\n\nWith your continued support, we know we can build the foundations for the next one hundred years of Aboitiz.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManuel R.

AEV also received a rating of BBB in the MSCI ESG Ratings assessment in 2020 while, in March 2021, its Sustainalytics ESG risk rating also improved, lowering  its  risk  rating  by  5.1  point  momentum  compared to the previous year. This placed AEV in the 13th percentile (also  ranking  14th  out  of  104  companies  in  the  Industrial Conglomerate Sector) of the rater's Industrial Conglomerate Universe. AEV also looks into the CDP reporting framework by including it in the company assessments of its ESG initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAboitizPower's 2020 ESG performance rating S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment rose by 74%, bringing its global  peer  group  percentile  ranking  up  to  54th percentile from 25th percentile in 2019.

Also in 2020, AboitizPower retained its BB rating from MSCI's ESG Ratings assessment and gained a Sustainalytics ESG risk rating of 33.9 as result of lowered risk exposure by 3.5 point momentum.\n\nThe use by Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. of any MSCI ESG research LLC or its a/ffiliates ('MSCI') data, and the use of MSCI logos, trademarks, service marks or index names herein, do not constitute a sponsorship, endorsement, recommendation, or promotion of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. by MSCI.

Half of the vaccines purchased will be donations for government frontline workers, while the other half will be for private-sector employees both regular and contractual - provided they follow the government's priority sectors for distribution.\n\nThrough its commitment to A Dose of Hope, the Aboitiz Group will be able to cover the inoculation of all its team members and subcontractors. AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines will be offered to more than 30,000 regular employees and subcontractors, to help build the community's immunity against the virus. Each Business Unit will work directly with their respective subcontractor partners on the details of the vaccine rollout.\n\nAvailing Aboitiz team members and subcontractors shall be vaccinated in batches, prioritizing frontliners, senior citizens, and those with comorbidities, then the rest of the population.

Our experiences and learnings from the past year made us stronger and more resilient than ever, ready to conquer greater heights in the next decade and beyond. '\n\nEmmanuel V. Rubio President and CEO AboitizPower\n\n## Powering through\n\n2020 marked the achievement of AboitizPower's strategic goal of 4,000-megawatts (MW) of net attributable capacity, setting the benchmark for bolder and greater goals in the next decade, to continue Advancing Business and Communities for many more years. By the end of the year, AboitizPower already owns 4,429 MW of net attributable capacity with the addition of GNPower Dinginin to our portfolio.\n\nThen came the COVID-19 pandemic, severely impacting the global economy and posing unprecedented challenges even to well established organizations like AboitizPower. Thanks to our business continuity strategy, we were able to quickly adapt to the situation, ensuring uninterrupted service to our customers\n\n'\n\nand continued support for our stakeholders, all while securing the safety and health of our team members.\n\nDespite the setbacks brought about by a global health crisis, the company remained resilient and committed to fulfilling its mission of providing energy supply that is reliable, affordable, and sustainable. This endeavor is backed by our strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and practices, enabling us to operate while managing our impact to create long-term value for all our stakeholders.\n\nFor our Generation business, we were able to successfully rehabilitate the Naga Power Plant Complex, operated and managed by our business unit Therma Power Visayas, Inc. (TPVI). The rehabilitation increased the net sellable capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the power plant to 39 MW, almost twice its previous output. In the second quarter of 2020, TPVI obtained a Provisional Authority to Operate (PAO) from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), allowing it to proceed with the commercial operations.\n\nThe pilot floating solar project of our joint venture, SN Aboitiz Power (SNAP), had proven its viability and had secured approval from the SNAP Board to proceed with the engineering design for 67 MW. While the construction timeline of our GNPower Dinginin project continues to be challenged by the imposition of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the commissioning of Unit 1 is ongoing and is targeted for commercial operations in August 2021. For Unit 2, the completion and commercial operations dates remain uncertain as of the first week of\n\n## Metrics That Matter\n\n## AP DU Systems Loss:\n\n| Distribution Unit                      | 2020                                   | 2019                                   | 2018                                   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Visayan Electric                       | 6.84%                                  | 6.00%                                  | 6.73%                                  |\n| Davao Light                            | 7.88%                                  | 7.32%                                  | 7.10%                                  |\n| Cotabato Light                         | 8.88%                                  | 8.08%                                  | 8.46%                                  |\n| Subic EnerZone                         | 3.20%                                  | 2.96%                                  | 2.71%                                  |\n| Mactan EnerZone                        | 0.93%                                  | 0.96%                                  | 1.01%                                  |\n| Balamban EnerZone                      | 0.47%                                  | 0.42%                                  | 0.41%                                  |\n| LiMA EnerZone                          | 5.37%                                  | 5.24%                                  | 4.58%                                  |\n| SFELAPCO                               | 4.86%                                  | 4.86%                                  | 4.78%                                  |\n| Government-mandated Cap in 2020: 6.50% | Government-mandated Cap in 2020: 6.50% | Government-mandated Cap in 2020: 6.50% | Government-mandated Cap in 2020: 6.50% |\n\nApril 2021 due to the ongoing community quarantines and travel restrictions, thus limiting the mobilization of foreign technical experts required to commission certain equipment and systems, and subsequently impacting our construction timeline.

Even with the quarantine measures in place, efforts were made to do meter readings for the majority of our customers and various initiatives were implemented to make bills payment safer and more convenient amid challenging times. All our distribution units have complied with the applicable guidelines and advisories from the Department of Energy (DOE) and ERC despite its impact on our collection efficiency and cashflow.\n\nAmong the key achievements of our Distribution Group in 2020 was the franchise renewal of Davao Light and Power Company. RA 11515 was signed into law effective December 26, 2020 to renew the Davao Light franchise for another 25 years once it expires in September 2025.\n\nAs part of our commitment to continuously improving our services, Davao Light also launched its new Calinan substation, Davao City's first digital substation located within the district. Cotabato Light and Power Company also upgraded its Malagapas substation. These upgrades provide our distribution utilities with an increased energy capacity, ensuring the reliability and better delivery of power supply across our franchise areas.\n\nThe two 50-MW transformers of Malvar Enerzone Corporation were successfully energized and started supplying the energy needs of the various locators of the 212-hectare Light Industry & Science Park IV (LISP IV) in Malvar, Batangas.\n\nThese operational developments, both in our Generation and Distribution businesses, are well aligned with our availability and reliability targets to ensure the continued delivery of our energy products and services to the customers and communities we serve.\n\n## Positive energy\n\nAt the core of AboitizPower's 2020 milestones was the positive energy that gave our 1AP team a boost up, along with our 1AP culture of high performance, owner's mindset, learning and growth, atmosphere, and our values of integrity, teamwork, innovation, responsibility, and service excellence.\n\nWith this positive energy, all our team members - onsite, in the field, and working from home - contributed to our strategic objectives and helped ensure that these remain relevant to our stakeholders. Even while grappling with the impact of the pandemic themselves, our 1AP team went the extra mile to support one another and worked together to fulfil our ABC.\n\nHedcor's FLS Hydro (6.4 MW, gross capacity) located in Bakun, Benguet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe were able to sustain our corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts for our customers and host communities.

We remained steadfast and always ready to lend a helping hand to typhoon-stricken areas, as well as communities that needed support in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nIn 2020, AboitizPower was also not short of accomplishments in terms of our ESG performance. AboitizPower has continued to be recognized as a constituent company in the FTSE4Good Index Series for three years in a row, affirming our long-standing commitment to sustainability. We have also seen an improvement in our score in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), from 69th place in 2019, we now rank 47th in this global benchmarking index.\n\nWith our invaluable experiences and learnings from 2020, AboitizPower is well positioned to carry out our growth strategy in the next 10 years and support the country's economic growth and recovery.\n\nOur key strategy remains the same, which is to aggressively expand our Cleanergy portfolio, aiming for a 50:50 balance between our Cleanergy\n\nAboitizPower is a pioneer of renewable energy in the Philippines and today, together with our partners, we are the country's largest owner and operator of renewable energy based on installed capacity.\n\nWhile we continue to help address the country's energy trilemma of energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability, we will also pursue our international aspirations, focusing on wind, hydro, and solar projects. We will also explore gas as an addition to our portfolio in an effort to serve our ever-increasing baseload energy demand.\n\nWe are bullish about the future of AboitizPower and of the country as the economy is slowly getting back on track and with the government's well thought out roadmap for the power sector. With the unwavering support of our 1AP team and our strong partnerships with our stakeholders, we trust that AboitizPower will be able to sustain the positive energy and continue to add value to the Aboitiz Group's 100 years of Advancing Business and Communities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Businesses are still reeling from the repercussions of extended lockdowns and the staggered rollout of vaccines has left communities in developing countries vulnerable.\n\nThe Aboitiz Group's power arm, AboitizPower, had its share of organizational challenges brought about by the pandemic in 2020, but these did not hinder the company from fulfilling its promise of advancing business and communities.\n\nAt the onset of local quarantines in the country, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a circular allowing communities that host power generation projects to use their revenue shares from these facilities under the Energy Regulations No. 1-94 (ER 1-94) program to help combat the effects of COVID-19.\n\n'Given the severity of the COVID-19 crisis, we at the DOE came up with the necessary circular that would enable host LGUs to use their available ER 1-94 funds to augment their COVID-19 response funding,' DOE Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi said.\n\n'We are pleased to learn that our vision is being fully realized. Malayo ang nararating ng bawat tulong sa panahon nitong pandemya (Every help goes a long way during this pandemic),' he added.\n\nAboitizPower's #PositiveEnergy spreads to public and private sector partners in helping our host communities combat the impact of COVID-19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAboitizPower President and Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel V. Rubio welcomed this move, saying this development was a push in the right direction as it was expected to aid in strengthening local government response to the ongoing health crisis.\n\n'This is our contribution to the government's efforts to ensure that all LGUs have enough resources to help contain, mitigate, and eventually eliminate the spread of COVID-19 in their areas,' Rubio added.\n\nAs of December 2020, the AboitizPower group and the DOE have remitted a total of P671 million in direct benefits to around 130 host communities all over the Philippines, helping them stay afloat during these trying times.\n\nThe ER 1-94 Program is a policy under the DOE Act of 1992 and the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA), which stipulates that host communities will get a share of one centavo for every kilowatt-hour (P0.01/kWh) generated by power plants operating in its area.\n\nThe fund can be used by host beneficiaries for the electrification of areas or households that have no access to power, development and livelihood programs, as well as reforestation, watershed management, health, and environmental enhancement initiatives.\n\nThe circular covering ER 1-94 funds allows host LGUs to use their shares to help manage their COVID-19 response in accordance with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\n\nInitiatives that were implemented by AboitizPower's host LGUs include holding areas or distribution centers, medical and PPE supplies, facility decontamination, and relief goods to feed low-income households during the prolonged quarantine period.\n\nAboitizPower has been at the forefront of social development in its host communities throughout the years and will even be more so as the nation continues to face this health crisis.\n\nIn strategic collaboration with our partner organizations and local governments, we will pursue our brand promise of advancing business and communities even more implicitly as the nation continues to face this global health crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget 3.3 End epidemics of communicable disease (COVID-19)\n\n7.1 Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services\n\n<!-- image -->",

The industry's net income also declined by 33%, mainly due to the 4.2 times increase in credit reserves set aside by most banks as loan quality deteriorated similar to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.\n\nIn response to the effects of the pandemic, UnionBank also increased loan loss reserves by 4.5 times to PHP8.4 billion. But despite the\n\n'\n\nunusually high provisions, the Bank recorded a net income of PHP11.6 billion and posted a return on equity of 11.5%, higher than the industry's 6.6%.\n\nUnionBank's topline revenues remained strong. Net revenues were at an all-time high at PHP42.1 billion. Net interest income increased by 29% to PHP28.7 billion as margins increased by 76 basis points (bps) to 4.7%. Our higher margins were due to: the record-high current account and savings account (CASA) deposit growth of 24% to PHP258.7 billion; continued expansion of highyielding consumer, SME, and commercial loans; and reduced funding cost amid the low interest rate environment in 2020. Strong trading gains amounting to PHP8.9 billion also gave topline revenues a boost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnet income in 2020 Return on Equity PHP11.6 billion 11.5%\n\nUnionBank Online App users corporates in The Portal and more than Registered 2.2 million-plus 17,000\n\nSigned up close to                    MSMEs across UBX' platforms i2i, BUX, Sentro, SeekCap 150,000\n\nUpskilled public school teachers through HEROES 2021 program supporting DepEd's blended learning initiative for 22 million students 80,000\n\nMoreover, growth in our operating expenses was kept at single digit as increases in volumerelated expenses were partially offset by lower controllable costs.\n\nOur capital ratios also remained above regulatory requirements with common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio at 15.0% and capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 17.0%. Overall, we were able to withstand the impacts of the crisis while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\n\n## UnionBank: 2nd Most Helpful Bank in the Asia Pacific\n\nIn June, UnionBank was recognized as the 2nd Most Helpful Bank in Asia Pacific during the COVID-19 crisis - and the only Philippine bank to place in the list's top 20 - according to the BankQuality\u2122 Consumer Survey and Rankings. This not only affirmed our commitment to\n\ndeliver superior service to customers but also demonstrated our capability to operate smoothly despite various pandemic-related restrictions.\n\nOn Day 1 of the enhanced community quarantine, all critical functions remained operational despite having 80% of head office employees working from home. Our teams, equipped with the necessary digital tools, have on-demand access to the bank's cloud-based systems and applications.\n\nMajority of UnionBank's branches remained open with full banking services and ATMs were constantly loaded to support our customers' liquidity needs. Our 5G-enabled Bank-onWheels banking kiosks served distant areas with large transaction requirements while our call center also continued to provide 24/7 customer assistance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through Bayanihan Acts 1 and 2, we extended loan payments without penalties or additional fees. We were also among the first to waive online fund transfer fees and extended this well into 2021 . Most importantly, we continued to extend credit to sectors that needed them the most, such as MSMEs and our mass market customers.\n\nWith a culture that is agile and adaptive, we were quick to introduce new features in our UnionBank Online app to promote safe and secure banking from home. For instance, we were able to launch the app's 'send money to remittance centers' feature after only three weeks from the time our project squad decided to add it. We also rolled out our online check deposit functionality, expanded our list of billers, introduced foreign exchange capabilities, and enabled subscriptions to investment products. Moreover, our customers could already deposit to their accounts via the 11,000 ECPay partners, which include 7-11, LCC, RD Pawnshop, Tambunting, and Czarina Money Exchange - all with outlets nationwide.\n\nUnionBank also collaborated with the public sector to assist in relief efforts and fulfill shared goals. We partnered with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for the distribution of Social Amelioration Program funds to the 1.3 million-plus beneficiaries allocated to us. EON, our digital mass market brand, was also tapped by several LGUs such as Para\u00f1aque City and Imus City, and institutions like LIGHT Microfinance and Public Safety Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (PSSLAI), which needed assistance in disbursing cash and loans to constituents.\n\nLastly, UnionBank launched an app-based blockchainenabled distribution system for the Bureau of the Treasury's (BTr) retail treasury bonds called Bonds.ph with digital KYC (Know Your Customer) identity check\n\ncapabilities. A first in Asia, Bonds.ph is not only a convenient way of investing without needing to go to a bank branch, it has also, ultimately, helped the country in raising additional funds for the national government's pandemic response.\n\n## Digital Gaining Traction; Time for Acceleration\n\nPhilippine digital banking certainly took flight as a result of COVID-19. By end2020, PESONet and InstaPay have recorded triple-digit increases -  at 376% and 460%, respectively - in terms of volume of electronic fund transfers compared to end-2019. The banking industry also ramped up digital transformation plans while the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), as a testament to the role of digital in achieving\n\nfinancial inclusion, laid out its 3-year digital payments transformation roadmap and its framework for setting up pure digital banks.\n\nIn the same manner, UnionBank experienced impressive digital traction during the pandemic. As of February 2021, UnionBank Online app users breached 2.2 million-level while the number of corporate customers in The Portal has topped 17,000, majority of them onboarded during the pandemic. Of this, 25% or more than 560,000, opened their accounts digitally, 23x times higher than the figures in 2019. Digital transactions such as fund transfers, bills payments, and online check deposits were also at all-time highs with monthly volume reaching 5.5 million in February 2021, 4.1 times higher than in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, we will be complementing Agile Ways of Working with DevSecOps. This aims to shorten the timeframe between testing and deployment of applications, providing continuous delivery without compromising quality, as we move towards addressing customer needs at the exact moment of truth.\n\nThe Bank also intends to keep its lead in the space of innovation. With the emergence of the new regulations on open banking and digital banking, UnionBank is already gearing up to keep up with the entry of purely digital banks and shift towards an open finance environment for when adoption intensifies.\n\nMoreover, we will continue to explore and experiment on new technologies, keeping a close watch on how banking will evolve in the future. One such area is in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), where we pioneered bond tokenization for the issuance of retail bonds on a blockchain platform co-created with SC Ventures. We also aim to increase participation in the trade finance market via a blockchain platform, being one of the processes that are most relevant for blockchain disruption. Furthermore, UBX will continue to test emerging business models via building its own startups or investment in fintechs or strategic partners.\n\nNow, more than ever, UnionBank shall boost its 'Tech Up Pilipinas' efforts focused on promoting digital transformation. As we co-create innovations and empower more individuals and organizations with digital capabilities, we shall emerge more resilient from this crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Leveraging UnionBank's digital transformation for social good\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe intersection of newer financial tools and technology is creating an enormous impact that can help unleash a sustainable development revolution. Among the country's pioneers in banking innovation is UnionBank and we are stepping up our efforts for Tech Up Pilipinas.\n\nTech Up Pilipinas is the natural result of the bank's digital transformation over the years. From a 'brick-and-mortar' model, we are moving into the 'tech-firm-with-bankingcapabilities' model, which is the building block of our own brand of sustainability. It is driven by investments and partnerships that enable and empower people to co-create innovations for a better world.\n\n## Financial technology for Filipinos\n\nPandemic or not, we have always envisioned a bank that will allow more Filipinos, especially the unbanked and marginalized, to adopt digital banking services and enable them to become active partners of our Tech Up Pilipinas mission.\n\nLaunching UBX as our tech arm is just the beginning. We are activating units that are geared towards financial inclusion and social empowerment. Our SME business banking unit has intensified the campaign to onboard more Filipino entrepreneurs into the GlobalLinker. This is a digital platform designed for the 350,000 members globally so they are connected and provided with the right knowledge and tools to accelerate the growth of their businesses. One such tool is the recently launched SME Business Banking App, focused on providing online banking services and marketplace solutions with speed, ease, and trustworthiness as our key competitive advantage.\n\nMoreover, to help MSMEs convert to the online platform, UBX offers the payment gateway BUX and digital shop builder Sentro. BUX can be integrated into an online\n\nseller's platform while Sentro helps entrepreneurs set their online shops. Sentro has built-in protections for both the sellers and buyers, as well as logistics services. There are more than 95,000 users of BUX and close to 30,000 sign-ups for Sentro.\n\nMeanwhile, SeekCap, the Philippines' first same-day approval lending marketplace, supports MSMEs by providing them with sources of credit without having to fill in lengthy loan applications. To date, we have recorded more than 23,000 sign-ups and disbursed loans over PHP100 million.\n\n## Redefining sustainability, the UnionBank way\n\nWe have set in place UnionBank's sustainable finance framework in order to facilitate issuances of green bonds, social bonds, and even tech bonds. In line with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we recognize that our  main contribution to sustainable development and social good is in ensuring that financial capital is invested in responsible organizations and customers whose businesses aim to improve quality of life and the planet. We believe that by supporting the development of people's digital and innovation capabilities, we can collectively improve products and services that will have less toll on our planet.\n\nIn UnionBank's case, we envision our sustainable financing program to enable our clients and partners to co-design with us innovative solutions and technology that create better products and services while contributing to sustainability targets. These targets include socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, access to essential services, employment generation, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and pollution prevention technology, among others.\n\nWe already have products and platforms in place that promote socio economic advancement and empowerment as evidenced by UBX and its various financially-inclusive initiatives developed in just a year. Meanwhile, our mass market arm and subsidiary City Savings Bank is also in a sweet spot\n\nto carry out sustainable financing activities as its portfolio is aligned to social sustainability.\n\nOur corporate social responsibility (CSR) is serving as an incubator of ideas with a pointed focus towards sustainability. Through this new kind of CSR, we have  the ability to  create more, reach more, and make a bigger impact by doing what we do best - innovate and accelerate.\n\nFor instance, one of our CSR initiatives led to the nationwide campaign to build the digital skills of 800,000 public school teachers through the timely and innovative idea of our employee volunteers to design on-demand, easy-to-use, and engaging learning modules. This has been adopted by the national government and is being implemented by the Department of Education across the country.\n\n## The ABC story goes on\n\nWith the same spirit of Ubuntu - that sense of being part of a community - and a compassion for others in need, we at UnionBank can leverage our DNA of innovation and digital tools to make a difference. Whether using digital platforms like Sentro and Bux to build online presence, SeekCap to raise funds, or mobile apps like Bonds.ph, technology can be used by a bank to truly create social good. Our goal is to fully align our digital transformation strategy with sustainable value creation. This is an opportunity for us to join the very clear call of advancing business and communities and we will do this by co-creating innovations for a better world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget 9.2 Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances\n\nTarget 8.2 Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors\n\n<!-- image -->",

We were the first to introduce an agile workplace, telecommuting, harnessing the digital space to enhance customer experience, and many more. Those same investments in systems and people have brought gains for the Food Group in 2020 through our utilization of data dashboards in decision making, e-commerce to increase customer reach, and virtual platforms to shift support services online.\n\nStrengthening customer relationships through digitalization\n\nWe took full advantage of digital channels and social media in order to continue consultations and customer visits with partners in the Philippines. These same channels carried our learning cascades and webinars, which turned out to be much more beneficial as more participants were able to join each session.\n\nConcentrate Plus, a similar initiative in Indonesia, provided online solutions to customers including group chat consultations with veterinary experts. Through it, the Indonesia team strengthened customer relationships and even created new markets.\n\nOur supply chain management remained intact through the implementation of flexible collection and payment methods while some essential CAPEX pushed through to protect the bottom line.\n\nThe pocket innovations led by our team members are key to our continued market management and have paved the way for building more meaningful relationships with our customers despite the physical limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Food Group targets growth for its Pet Food business in Southeast Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The shift to e-commerce\n\nWith the changes in retail consumers' buying behavior and in available dining options, we launched our e-commerce initiatives to bring our Maxime premium dog food brand and The Good Meat top-quality farm products directly to homes via Lazada and Shopee.\n\nWe will further support our long-term outlook in the Food and Agri space by activating more dynamic brand and marketing strategies to increase market presence and awareness.\n\n## Advancing business and communities through values\n\nThe twin pandemics of African swine fever and COVID-19 would have been insurmountable if not for the resilience and agile response of our\n\npeople.

They, along with fish cage owners, gained technical knowledge about fish feeds ratios, proper use and scheduling of feeds variants, and fish cage specifications to promote a better fish-growing environment.\n\n## Additional earnings, faster and better growth\n\nFrom February to October 2020, the beneficiaries have been earning an additional PHP10 to PHP15 per kilo - thanks to increased fish growth and performance - and avoiding additional losses from inefficient feeding practices. Compared to other brands, Pilmico's aqua feeds result in faster and better growth, with an average of 15 to 20 days earlier harvesting time. The Bangon Capiznon beneficiaries have harvested 15 tons of fish or approximately 13,607 kilograms.\n\n'I'd say it was the right timing to receive assistance from their team. The business partnership with Pilmico helped small-time fishermen and fish cage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nowners (Nasa tamang timing talaga kasi yung business partnership na yan kay Pilmico, natulungan yung mga small-time na fisherman dito at ang mga fish cage owners din),' said Moreno Gonzaga, a fisherman and beneficiary of Bangon Capiznon.\n\nPilmico's flexible feed payment terms is helping to speed up business recovery while the Pilmico Aqua Feeds team is helping to close technical knowledge gaps in proper fish cage management and aqua feeds ratios. The team's consistent technical support and regular, almost-daily visits - according to Gonzaga have greatly helped in proper fish growth monitoring.\n\n## Reliability of supplies and services\n\nGonzaga shares that what sets Pilmico apart is reliability, which helped them with feed efficiency.\n\n'Before we started using Pilmico feeds, other brands always ran out of stock. When that happens, we had to switch to a different feed brand mid-season. When we change fish feeds, what happens is their growth is affected. This is because they are not used to the new brand introduced (Dati [nung hindi pa Pilmico], palaging nauubusan ng supply yung ibang feeds brand. Kaya ang nangyayari, kalagitnaan ng season ng isda, nagpapalit kami ng brand ng feeds. Kapag ganun\n\nna nag-iiba ng pakain, hindi sanay ang isda, ang nangyayari ay naapektuhan ang paglaki nila),' he said.\n\nHe regards Pilmico as a reliable brand because of its uninterrupted supply of feeds and services.\n\nRichard Rafio, Pilmico Feeds Category Manager for Aqua, confirmed that amid the pandemic restrictions, their team has been consistent in delivering services to Bangon Capiznon beneficiaries.\n\n'In the last few months since we launched this initiative, our team has been working with the Roxas City government and we also got endorsements from the BFAR [Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources],' shared Rafio. 'We acknowledge the hard work that our team members on site have been putting in, and this was complemented by essential support from the government.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget 8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value\n\n<!-- image -->",

Canilao\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresident and CEO Aboitiz InfraCapital\n\nIn 2020, Aboitiz InfraCapital (InfraCap) was set to harvest the seeds it planted in previous years with a number of projects expected to either launch operations or receive final approval from the government. However, like much of the Aboitiz Group and many other companies, we faced a number of headwinds largely caused by COVID-19.\n\nAmid the challenging period for economies and businesses around the world, we remained true to our commitment to uplift lives by continuing to push for enabling infrastructure. We quickly shifted gears by activating the Business Continuity Plans of our operating business units and reviewing our project proposals to ensure viability in the next few years. Leveraging existing Aboitiz Group assets, we also launched a new business unit to support telecommunication companies (telcos) and\n\nThe spirit of the Aboitiz Group's enduring 100-year legacy resonates in the tremendous resilience of Aboitiz InfraCapital and Republic Cement in 2020. We stand ready to support the government by investing in the development of sustainable infrastructure projects and growing our industrial estates. We believe public and private sector collaboration will be crucial in helping rebuild our economy from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'\n\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) at a time when people rely on the internet the most.\n\nToday, we continue to pursue key initiatives to support the government in implementing strategic infrastructure programs and deliver on projects that provide value-adding facilities and services to Filipinos.\n\n## Keeping the water flowing\n\nAlong with other Aboitiz business units in Southern Luzon, Lima Water Corporation (LWC) experienced disruption at the onset of 2020 with the eruption of the Taal Volcano in January. Operations at the LIMA Technology Center (LTC) were limited during the immediate aftermath as the Aboitiz teams worked together to clear the industrial park of ash fall and offer assistance to the affected communities. Less than two\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof pipes laid for Apo Agua's Davao City Bulk Water Supply Project 15,360 meters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1,000 hectares\n\nof industrial business parks currently being operated\n\nmonths later, the national government imposed Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon, which further impacted operations at LTC. LWC continued to operate during this period to ensure continuous water supply for all the skeleton workforce at LTC.\n\nWhile LWC's average billed volume dipped in the first half of 2020, it has since posted pre-ECQ levels by the third quarter as locators recovered losses from the first half of the year. To offer relief and convenience to locators, we extended initial payment due dates and introduced new alternative payment channels during the lockdown.\n\nIn June 2020, LWC was officially accredited by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) as one of its Recognized Environmental Laboratories and the first and only industrial park water services provider to become such. This license allowed us to extend laboratory services to locators in LTC in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n100,000 sqm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGross Leasable Area of commercial retail spaces in Cebu and Batangas\n\n## 90,000 jobs\n\ngenerated across Central Visayas and Southern Luzon through Aboitiz Integrated Economic Centers\n\ntotal man-hours for Republic Cement 16,947,914\n\nSeptember and, later, to locators from nearby industrial parks. During the lockdown, we also took the opportunity to implement production efficiency programs to improve power usage in our deepwell facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the lockdown in Davao City meant Apo Agua Infrastructura, Inc. (Apo Agua) had to temporarily suspend construction activities for the Davao City Bulk Water Supply Project (DCBWSP), our joint venture with J.V. Angeles Construction Corporation (JVACC).\n\nConstruction eventually resumed in mid-May, with JVACC working on the Raw Water Facility, Water Treatment Plant, and Treated Water Pipeline. Our focus centered on ensuring workers' health and well-being amidst the pandemic as JVACC imposed work clustering, social distancing protocols, and other safety measures in accordance with government guidelines. To mitigate dire impact, JVACC has been implementing an aggressive manpower\n\n<!-- image -->",

Round-the-clock pipe fabrication supplements all these efforts to fast-track the project. While we are continuously reassessing how COVID-19 affects our construction program, we remain focused on achieving first drop of water by December this year.\n\nInfraCap maintains its minority stake of 15.94% in Balibago Waterworks Systems, Inc. (BWSI), allowing us to further participate in serving the water needs of over 235,000 households spanning 11 regions.\n\n## Enhancing PH's digital infrastructure\n\nOur mission to help improve the country's digital infrastructure continues especially with the pandemic underscoring the increased demand for cellular and internet access.\n\nWe have ongoing discussions with mobile network operators Globe Telecom, DITO Telecommunity, and PLDT-Smart for the lease of build-to-suit tower sites and other passive telecommunications infrastructure. Onsite surveys and acquisitions restarted following the lifting of ECQ. In September 2020, we were granted our provisional registration as an Independent Tower Company by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).\n\nHeeding the government's urgent call to help improve the country's information and communications technology infrastructure by the end of the year, we started to offer our existing small cell sites in key urban cities to telcos and ISPs, officially launching it as InfraCap's newest business unit. We soon entered into partnership agreements with Globe Telecom and DITO Telecommunity for the deployment of their small cell attachments in Cebu and Davao.\n\nA small cell network is a series of small low-powered, short-ranged antennas that provide coverage and capacity, meant to work in conjunction with macro cell towers. Small cells are expected to play a key role in the deployment of 5G, which requires antenna density to deliver larger quantities of data at higher speeds.\n\nWe are looking at growing our small cell sites footprint as we anticipate increasing demand within the next two years. We are most keen on expanding in other key cities in Visayas and Mindanao where network congestion is a primary issue that hampers service quality.\n\n## A gateway to recovery\n\nIn the face of the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on the air travel and airport business, we remain committed to pursuing our\n\nunsolicited proposals for the Bohol Panglao International Airport and Laguindingan Airport. We believe that these projects are vital to reviving the economy and are aligned with our objective to support regional growth centers outside of the National Capital Region. InfraCap's discussions with the government continue to take place, both parties assessing the most prudent way to move forward with the projects.\n\n## Harnessing natural synergies\n\nWith great challenges also came new opportunities. In September 2020, AEV made a strategic decision for InfraCap to take over the industrial and commercial business units (ICBU) of AboitizLand. Apart from allowing AboitizLand to focus on its residential portfolio, this move supports InfraCap's approach in expanding the various businesses and projects around the Group's existing assets and resources, thereby harnessing inherent synergies seamlessly.\n\nThe resilient financial performance of ICBU or the Aboitiz Integrated Economic Centers\n\nthroughout the year was driven by the recognition of 36 hectares of industrial lots. The industrial business' performance tempered the decrease in revenue contribution from the commercial business, despite rental concessions extended to tenants throughout the pandemic.\n\nWe are fortunate that disruption to industrial operations last year was kept to a minimum with a majority of our locators remaining operational through the Taal Volcano eruption and the strictest periods of the lockdown. To ensure continuous operations during the ECQ, we quickly implemented strict COVID-19 protocols at all facilities. We also hold regular virtual meetings with locators and tenants regarding procedures on reporting systems, contact tracing, infection control, and other COVID-19-related matters.\n\nAs expected, the local shopping mall industry has been severely challenged by the ongoing pandemic. To support our tenants, we have provided rental concessions in The Outlets at Lipa and Pueblo Verde. We have also instituted programs that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These programs include providing alternative purchasing channels, allowing the use of alfresco areas free of charge, and providing safe events for the community, such as outdoor movies, drive thru markets, and a drive-in mass. While foot traffic and tenant sales have begun to do better, we foresee that shopping malls will continue to face challenges in 2021.\n\nTo ensure the safety of our mall visitors, strict COVID-19 measures are enforced such as social distancing, hand sanitization, wearing masks and face shields, and technology-aided contact tracing.\n\nDespite the pandemic, exciting things are in store for the Aboitiz Integrated Economic Centers. Capitalizing on the demand for industrial spaces in Batangas and Cebu, we will expand and transform our three economic zones into smart integrated economic centers, supported by a complete ecosystem of infrastructure and the latest digital technology.\n\n## Testing cement's resilience\n\nConstruction was among the industries heavily affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Coming from a strong start in early 2020, construction activities in Luzon and parts of Visayas and Mindanao stopped for two months during the ECQ. Stricter health protocols and limited transportation availability also contributed to the slowdown. In response, Republic Cement has put in place rigid procedures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. These include health screening, social distancing, sanitation of work areas, and strict observance of PPE.\n\nDespite the challenges brought by COVID-19, Republic Cement completed and commissioned new mills, adding 2 million tons of capacity to its existing 7.5 MTPA (million tons per annum) capacity. We have also benefited from the kiln debottlenecking done in 2019, which improved cost competitiveness and reduced dependency on imported clinker.\n\nTo address challenges in waste management, we officially launched\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Left) The Outlets at Lipa leverages its open-air shopping format in support of health and safety protocols; (Right) Nestl\u00e9 Philippines Chairman & CEO Kais Marzouki and Republic Cement President & CEO Nabil Francis at the signing ceremony of the expanded Plastic Neutrality initiative partnership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\necoloop , Republic's resource recovery group. To date, ecoloop has partnered with more than 30 LGUs and FMCG companies, with a common goal towards promoting plastic neutrality in the Philippines.\n\nRepublic Cement remains focused on serving its key markets throughout the country with high-quality products, while improving efficiencies and reducing costs. Production costs remained in control following the implementation of operational excellence initiatives. In addition, Republic Cement has put in place several cost-cutting and cash optimization measures.\n\nLooking forward, the construction outlook for 2021 is positive. The government is allotting a sizable chunk of the 2021 national budget for infrastructure. Various economists are also projecting the economy to bounce back and grow by over 6%. The economic recovery would drive demand for residential and non-residential segments. Downside risk pertains to the lingering effects of the pandemic on the economic activities, which would also impact construction demand.\n\nDespite this, we will continue our record-breaking performance at Republic Cement in line with our commitment to meet the demands of the local building and construction industry. We will also continue to staunchly support the Philippine government's Buy Lokal, Go Lokal! programs, as an industry leader and proud manufacturer of the country's best quality cement used in building a safer, greener, and stronger Republic.\n\n## The next 10 years\n\nAboitiz InfraCapital has a clearer path forward as we head into 2021. While the pandemic impacted mobility and key industries including transport and retail, it presents a huge opportunity for digital infrastructure initiatives and the integrated economic centers to play key roles in the country's economic recovery and sustainability. Water also remains a vital need for growing communities all over the country.\n\nOur sights are set for the next 10 years. We will build on our water portfolio, further explore the exciting opportunities in digital infrastructure, pursue our transport projects, including our airport proposals, and expand our IECs. With our renewed focus and the support of our team members, we are confident that Aboitiz InfraCapital can steadily grow in 2021 and beyond.\n\n<!-- image -->",

While we were focused on quickly resuming normal operations, LIMA Land coordinated relief efforts for affected team members and communities.\n\nIn partnership with Aboitiz Foundation and its locators, LIMA Land donated relief goods, alcohol, and N95 masks to our eight host barangays in Lipa and Malvar who also received evacuees from other towns (i.e San Lucas, Plaridel, Bugtong na Pulo, San Andres, San Fernando, Bagong Pook, Santiago, and Luta Sur.)\n\nWe also rolled out the Co-Host Evacuees and Adopt a Colleague Programs, a donation drive at The Outlets at Lipa, and a KINDer fundraising campaign.\n\nThe bayanihan spirit moves our team members to step up as #OneAboitiz to help LIMA Land's neighboring communities affected by the Taal eruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the true spirit of #OneAboitiz, our Cebu team members donated cash to fellow employees who were impacted by the calamity.

Apart from our numerous Corporate Social Responsibility programs that include Scholarship Programs, Donations, and our Watershed Rehabilitation Partnership with the Davao City Water District, our business operations also result in indirect positive benefits. Most especially for Purok Maligatong in Barangay Tawantawan, the area where our intake weir is located.\n\nIn 2019, the road leading to the intake weir was improved and widened by our contractor, JVACC, to allow heavy equipment to access the area. Since then, it has been easier for the purok's residents and visitors to travel to and from the main road.\n\nAdditionally, to be able to use electricity during our construction and operations phase, we also needed to connect the intake weir to Davao Light. As a result, in July 2020, electric poles were erected to reach Purok Maligatong. The electric poles were paid for by Davao Light as part of their energization program, while Apo Agua facilitated to manage the\n\nConstruction continues for Apo Agua and JVACC's bulk water supply project; above photo shows the intake weir being built at Barangay Tawantawan, Davao City\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimpacts to the communities in the activities carried out by Davao Light.

Through co-processing and the use of waste, such as plastic or rice husk, as alternative fuels, Republic can manufacture cement with reduced dependence on fossil fuels, such as coal.\n\nCo-processing continues to be a sustainable solution to the rise in the country's waste generation, which remains a major challenge even with the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (RA No. 9003) in place. The country has observed a steady increase in daily waste generated over the years, from over 37,000 tons in 2012 to 40,000 tons in 2016. In 2018, Metro Manila recorded an average of over 9,000 tons of waste per day. Whereas 85 percent of the total solid wastes were collected, 15 percent ended up in waterways and bodies of water.\n\nAn alternative waste management system is of utmost priority and as such, we have taken the opportunity to share the technology and innovation it has been using since the early 2000s for wider scope and greater nationwide impact. 'Co-processing is a vital alternative that manufacturing industries can and should take toward the long-term goals of waste management as well as ultimately building our nation's resilience against climate change challenges through sustainable practices,' said Angela Edralin-Valencia, ecoloop Director.\n\nRepublic Cement's co-processing arm, ecoloop, aims to tackle the pervasive problem of plastic waste in the country\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith ecoloop , residual wastes can effectively be diverted away from landfills and waterways, and the plastic pollution crisis can also be addressed by capturing pre- and post-consumer waste in direct partnership with manufacturers including fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies as well as local government units (LGUs). At present, ecoloop counts more than 30 public and private partnerships across the country. 'As long as these wastes are deemed acceptable for co-processing and acceptable under the guidelines issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) through DAO 2010-6, co-processing should be prioritized over other unsustainable disposal methods that are more harmful to the environment in the long run,' adds Valencia.\n\nWhile co-processing involves the application of heat to destroy waste, it is distinct from the traditional waste management practice of incineration according to Valencia. ecoloop utilizes the cement kiln co-processing method, where emissions are contained and managed within the kiln and any ash produced fully integrated into the stable microstructure of clinker, a key ingredient of cement. On the other hand, some forms of incineration are purely for waste disposal without any energy or material recovery aspects. 'There is a higher chance of noxious gases being released into the atmosphere and the ash byproduct usually still ends up in landfills,' explains Valencia.\n\nFurther, co-processing promotes the conservation of non-renewable energy sources and raw materials. The recovered heat content from the qualified wastes partially replaces the heat from traditional fossil fuels such as coal and petcoke. Recovered minerals similar to the chemical composition of sand and clay also replace raw materials used in cement production.\n\n'In the waste management hierarchy, methods such as prevention, minimization, and recovery of materials through recycling and reusing are still preferred over co-processing. However, when these options are no longer available, co-processing remains preferred over unsustainable methods such as incineration, chemical and physical treatment of waste, and landfilling,' adds Valencia.\n\n'Republic is proud to do its part in providing a viable waste management solution while continuously working towards a greener and more sustainable cement manufacturing process. Through this initiative, we are confident that we are on the right path in moving towards a greener, stronger Republic,' said Nabil Francis, Republic Cement CEO.\n\nTarget 12.5 Substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rafael President and CEO AboitizLand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor AboitizLand and many other companies in all industries across the globe, 2020 was a year of disruptions. We began the year facing the challenges brought about by the eruption of Taal Volcano and managing its impact on LIMA, our integrated economic center located in LipaMalvar, Batangas, and its residential component, The Villages at Lipa.\n\nThe rest of the year would be riddled with more challenges, such as the series of typhoons, which battered and flooded the country in the last quarter of the year, with our developments in Batangas and Central Luzon along the storm path.  But no calamity had a bigger and more damaging impact than the health and economic crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAboitizLand's story in 2020 has been that of resilience and innovation. We weathered the harshest impact of the pandemic to the business by maintaining an agile, innovative mindset and staying attuned to the evolving needs of the market and our vecinos. This focus on innovation is the same spirit that will see us through as, together with #OneAboitiz, we recover from the COVID-19 crisis and bring AboitizLand to better heights in 2021 and beyond. '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'\n\nThe enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), which began in March 2020 forced the lockdown of businesses across the country, severely impacting all aspects of AboitizLand's operations. OFW remittances, long since one of the key drivers for the property industry, drastically dipped as thousands of overseas workers lost their jobs and had to be repatriated. Unemployed and out-of-business Filipinos struggled to make their loan payments, even after several rounds of moratoriums extended by businesses, and the impact was immediately felt, as our revenue collections took a dip. Overall consumer confidence was extremely low and the business outlook was bleak.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsolidated revenues of from the residential business unit with PHP1.1 billion coming PHP3.6 billion\n\nAchieved booked sales, surpassing pre-pandemic performance of PHP2.2B billion in 2019 PHP3 billion\n\nAchieved a reservation-to-booked an 18% improvement from 2019 sales conversion rate of 78% ,\n\nGenerated qualified leads from digital marketing efforts, directly resulting to PHP735 million in sales 27,153\n\nTurned over to new vecinos despite pandemic restrictions 160 homes\n\n## 1,200 sales partners\n\nempowered through our training programs on digital selling, ensuring they have livelihood even during the pandemic\n\n## Managing the pandemic impact through a quick pivot to digitalization\n\nAs the rest of the country was reeling from the sudden halt of business, AboitizLand began mobilizing towards a quick pivot to innovative measures to ensure business continuity.\n\nAboitizLand introduced its contactless homebuying service just a few weeks after the enhanced community quarantine was enforced in March. Sensing Filipinos' urgent need for a good home to serve as a sanctuary for themselves and their family during the pandemic, we were one of the first developers to respond by taking our sales and marketing operations online and offering end-to-end, digital-based homebuying.\n\nAchieved a increase in overall customer satisfaction score vs. 2019 36%\n\nFrom property viewing to unit reservation, we made the entire home acquisition process possible through our digital platforms.\n\nAside from providing our customers with safer options to conduct their home buying journey, we also made sure our sales force embraced the digital approach to selling through innovative tools, training programs, and incentives. As a result, we began to see our reservation sales levels recover and even exceed pre-pandemic levels in July of 2020. We were able to sustain the sales momentum towards the end of the year, posting 130% gross reservation sales versus budget, with our conversion-to-booked sales rate also surpassing expectations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAwarded\n\n500%\n\nmore housing units to contractors in 2020 vs the previous year\n\nOnboarded more contractors in 2020 vs. the previous year 540%\n\nConstructed ready for vecinos to move in, achieving 98% of house construction targets even with pandemic restrictions 357 homes\n\n<!-- image -->",

For a few critical weeks, operations completely halted as supply chain challenges also mounted.\n\nAs authorities began loosening their restrictions, we quickly adapted to the new normal through the strict implementation of the return-towork playbook, as we also ensured compliance with DOLE and DOH safety protocols as early as April 2020. We aggressively implemented plans to compensate for weeks of lost hours of operations by ramping up house awards through enhanced standard procurement procedures. The construction teams made full use of Agora, the internal digital communications tool in the Aboitiz Group, which became an effective platform to manage progress and performance in our project sites across Luzon and Cebu.\n\nWe also turned to digital platforms to ensure our targets for collections were met. The house turnovers were initially hampered by our vecinos' inability to personally accept their units, whether through travel restrictions or due to concerns for their safety. We worked around these limitations by offering virtual house acceptance sessions. With a 96% acceptance rate at the first meeting, our new homeowners appreciated how we have turned a traditionally in-person milestone into a virtual, safe, and efficient experience for them.\n\nAmidst continuously evolving and mounting operational limitations and low consumer confidence at a time of a raging pandemic, AboitizLand showed how an organization's agile and innovative mindset is key to its survival and success in the face of challenges.\n\n## A closer focus on the residential business\n\nAgility and innovation played a hand in the strategic decision to integrate our industrial and commercial business units into Aboitiz InfraCapital in the third quarter of 2020. The move supports the Aboitiz Group's vision of ramping up the growth of our integrated economic centers, while at the same time putting a more focused approach to the residential business.\n\nEven in the face of an unprecedented health and economic crisis, the property market remains resilient, with the large unmet demand for housing as its main driver.  It also continues to be highly competitive, as Filipinos grow more discerning about what they need and want for their homes. In addition, AboitizLand sits on approximately PHP4 billion in collectible value, as well as PHP24 billion worth of unlocked value in unlaunched inventories and landbank.\n\nThis renewed focus on the residential business enables us to deliver maximum value and growth, as we navigate the uncertain postpandemic market landscape. AboitizLand will continue to improve\n\noperational efficiency in constant pursuit to be a stronger residential developer brand.\n\n## Shifting market preferences\n\nBefore the pandemic, people in the suburbs and provinces naturally flock to the major urban centers with their high concentration of career and business opportunities. However, COVID-19 has made these megacities highly vulnerable, as social distancing and health protocols brought to light an urgent need for better living spaces.\n\nAfter a few months of complying with shelter-in-place protocols, Filipinos have developed a renewed appreciation for a good home. Property industry watchers reported a growing shift in homeseekers' preferences towards houses and lots in next-wave cities, as bigger living areas, open spaces, and amenities take priority. Online modes of working, conducting business, and learning have made it possible to choose to live in locations far away from central business districts.\n\nAboitizLand's residential developments, located in emerging growth centers in Central Luzon, Batangas, and Cebu, are far enough from the congestion and noise of the metropolis yet close enough to be able to drive to the familiar sights and sounds of\n\nthe city. Our master planned developments, boasting of less density and more open spaces and amenities also answer the market's renewed need for developments that offer better work-life balance and access to creature comforts. In the third quarter of 2020, we ramped up our sales and marketing efforts in order to capitalize on these trends that are now favoring our developments, harnessing our digital tools and platforms to reach as many of our potential customers as possible.\n\nAs the real estate market moves into recovery, experts say these new property trends are here to stay. Buoyed by the government's moves to decongest the city centers and funnel growth into the countryside, as well as the continued infrastructure developments connecting these centers with new-wave cities in the provinces, the outlook for AboitizLand's properties is rosy. We have full confidence that our mission to create better ways to live through our thoughtfully planned communities is resonating more and more with an increasingly discerning market.\n\n## A bullish outlook for 2021 and beyond\n\nThough 2021 still presents as much uncertainty as the past year, AboitizLand enters its next 25 years with a hopeful\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From the onset of project planning, our sites and lot cuts are made flexible so that our product mix and portfolio remain diverse and responsive to market needs. As a result, target velocity is achieved or even exceeded, margins are protected, and capital risk is reduced.\n\nWith renewed focus, and with the spirit of innovation buoying forward a cohesive AboitizLand team, we look ahead to fulfilling our promise of creating better ways to live for more Filipino families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Milestones\n\n- Contributed a consolidated revenue of PHP3.6 billion to AEV \u00b7\n- Executed a quick pivot to digital-based selling early on in the pandemic, resulting to a strong post-ECQ rebound in reservations sales that was sustained until end of 2020 \u00b7\n- Embarked on a more focused and concentrated management of the residential business with the industrial and commercial business moving into Aboitiz InfraCapital's portfolio \u00b7\n- Advanced the organization's digital transformation through digitization programs in major aspects of operations - in sales and marketing, construction, and collections \u00b7\n- Completed construction of 357 homes even with operational restrictions caused by the pandemic. \u00b7\n- Completed 160 house turnovers with a rate of 96% acceptance at first meeting, with the help of virtual meetings \u00b7\n- Launched model houses in Ajoya Cabanatuan and Ajoya Capas and inaugurated  sales offices for Seafront and The Villages at Lipa \u00b7\n- Achieve a positive bottom line in 2021 with double digit growth seen in revenue, gross profit, and net operating profit versus 2020, largely driven by stronger house completion from previous years and the robust sales generated in 2020 \u00b7\n- Provide capital for the Aboitiz Group through the monetization of landbank assets \u00b7\n- De-risk the business by revisiting our inventory mix to ensure it is attuned to market demand \u00b7\n- Expand our customer base in Luzon as we continue building a bustling community in Seafront Residences and start the turnover of houses to vecinos in Ajoya Cabanatuan and Ajoya Capas \u00b7\n- Start reaping the rewards of our investments in digitization, through new systems that support sales and marketing, construction, and collections, which help us achieve operational excellence and provide better customer experience \u00b7\n- Continue to capitalize on opportunities to synergize with other Aboitiz business units, and collaborate with top property developers \u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It strained our healthcare system, exposing decades-old problems in service delivery, manpower and funding. But beyond the case numbers, the impact of COVID-19 rippled across the everyday life of Filipinos.\n\nToday, we are humbled and grateful to celebrate 100 years of hard-earned wins - only this time, we are celebrating free of formalities and fancies and with a renewed sense of purpose to drive change for a better world. The call to do good has never been greater than it is today. For us in the Aboitiz Foundation, the last 32 years prepared us for a time such as this.  While we are grateful to have been given the privilege to help thousands of individuals and communities, there is much work to be done. Filipinos will always wear a smile come rain or shine, mask or no mask. But we would rather see them smiling confidently because they are prepared to overcome challenges. This is why we remain committed to co-creating safe, empowered and sustainable communities. It is always about progress achieved not by one, but many - not in a day, but throughout generations to come.

Aside from the financial assistance, scholars and other education stakeholders also need to be guided on how to navigate in the new normal. To attain holistic support, Aboitiz Beyond Classrooms (ABC) was put into place. ABC is a virtual learning series which serves as a platform that combines all virtual learning activities targeting various education stakeholders. The learning sessions keep the scholars informed of topics that are relevant to them, and keep them engaged through conversations with guest speakers and the Aboitiz Foundation project team. \u00b7\n- As we fully embrace digital transformation in the new normal, the Aboitiz Scholarship Application Portal was launched. It is an online application system which moves the annual recruitment process from manual to online. The system allowed applicants to apply for the scholarship in just a few clicks, and significantly reduced man hours in terms of screening and reviewing the applications. \u00b7",

Supporting cooperatives and MSMEs is vital for preserving jobs and productivity. This also includes helping them take advantage of the use of digital tools to continue operating their businesses and providing services to cooperative members.\n\n- Implemented Digital Coops in partnership with UnionBank's GlobalLinker and DTI, transforming our coop-partners into digital coops so they can take advantage of emerging opportunities in e-commerce. The project assisted cooperatives and MSMEs to utilize digital technology for their businesses, specifically for banking transactions, member transactions, e-commerce and e-learning. These were conducted through online training and mentoring sessions, assistance in applying for and utilizing banking products, e-commerce platforms and e-learning portals. \u00b7\n- Provided [re]start support to help communities recover their livelihoods that were affected by COVID-19. Our partner cooperatives/MSMEs received 're-starter' kits such as farm inputs, bakery package and egg laying machine that will help their organization to recover from economic loss and can provide employment opportunities to the community members. The project was implemented in close partnership with the different Aboitiz Business Units where partner cooperatives are located and in collaboration with different government agencies, NGOs, and private entities. The framework of the Restart Program is aligned with the recovery plan of the government which includes financial or capital assistance, supply chain and market linkages for new business, business diversification or reinvention and skills development, and retooling. At the end of the project, partner cooperatives have used the restarter packages to restart their businesses. They have also accessed financing or acquired new skills and suppliers/buyers to help recover their businesses. \u00b7\n- Launched the Community Marketplace Microsite which supported the cooperatives in marketing their products online. This is a one-stop shop where Aboitiz team members can access or avail the products and services of our supported communities nationwide. \u00b7\n- Conducted E-learning Seminars on Cooperative Strengthening, and Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Risk Reduction, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Cooperative Development Authority, and Go Negosyo which benefited 264 participants in 9 organizations nationwide. The training conducted aims to strengthen and enhance the management leadership skills of our partner organizations/communities. \u00b7\n\nsite, nursery, and botanical garden for the propagation of 29 natives tree species and is home to 100 species of birds. Since 2014, the park has already released more than 4,939 hawksbill hatchlings, planted 13,992 mangrove propagules, and rescued 16 pawikans (sea turtles).\n\n## Balabag Wetland Park (Wetland 4).\n\nEven with the onset of the pandemic, rehabilitation efforts continued for the Balabag Wetland Park (Wetland 4) in Boracay, Aklan. The turnover was set for 2021 which saw the conversion of the whole area to an urban linear park, along with these enhancements:\n\n- Installed 5 aerators to improve the water quality. \u00b7\n- Installed 3D Boracay signage which tourists and locals can use for social media photo-ops. \u00b7\n- Completed the community center which serves as an activity area (in front of D'Mall). \u00b7\n- Completed the perimeter landscaping and pavers in  the whole area for visitors to walk around and interact with nature. \u00b7\n- Completed the parking area for visitors' proper loading and unloading area. \u00b7\n\n## Environment\n\nOur Environment program ensures that projects undertaken directly or through partnerships will maintain and enhance the benefits of ecosystem services, build resilient communities, and promote an environmentfriendly transport system.\n\nA-Park. In line with the extension of the DENR's Enhanced National Greening Program to 2028, which aims to revitalize what it cited as 'the remaining unproductive, denuded, and degraded forestlands nationwide through reforestation initiatives,' Aboitiz Group has transcended its target to plant 9-million trees by 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there were 11.73-million trees planted, in partnership with the tree growing project of Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc., the Philippine Business for Social Progress, and the Carbon Sink Management Program of Therma South, Inc. and Therma Visayas, Inc.\n\nAboitiz Cleanergy Park. In 2020, Aboitiz Cleanergy Park was cited as a birdwatching haven according to a local expert, with its wide variety of animal habitat types combined with the area's relative isolation and secure environment. The eight-hectare park showcases a mangrove reforestation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Part of the pipelined activities with the community is the ecohub, the purchase of trash traps, and a small boat to clear areas and sections of the river.\n\n## Calubcub II: Pawikan Conservation\n\n(Year 3). AboitizLand, in partnership with UP Diliman-Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology, achieved the company's goals in setting up the facilities for the Pawikan Conservation in Brgy. Calubcub, Batangas. The group continues to research and monitor environmental impacts, conduct conservation operations, capacitybuilding, and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities within the supported locality. And as of end-2020, a total of 1,181 pawikan hatchlings were released in Seafront, Batangas.\n\nThe first fully electric, free ride shuttle service in Mindanao was launched in Davao City on December 11, 2020. The BEST Bus (Business for Environmentally Sustainable Transformation) has a seating capacity of 30 persons but can only accommodate 15 passengers, in observance of the physical distancing, to curb the coronavirus transmission. The BEST bus would provide a safer and more convenient transport experience and bring Davao City closer to a more sustainable future.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused an upheaval in social and economic life across the country and the most severely affected are the MSMEs. For these businesses to survive, they must be able to adapt their operations to the new environment. As such, we conducted a blended e-learning program on DRRM and Business Continuity Planning for the 99 participants of the Department of Agriculture - Philippine Rural Development Project. Business continuity planning is a component of building business resilience in normal times and is especially critical in cases of large disasters like the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating resilient, empowered, and sustainable communities\n\nAs the pandemic left no community unaffected, our focus on resilience is anchored on the need to find solutions that will protect the communities we serve from the crippling impact of disasters. The United Nations expounds on this: 'Resilience is about anticipating, planning and reducing disaster risk to effectively protect persons, communities and countries, their livelihoods, health, cultural heritage, socio-economic assets, and ecosystems.'\n\nAboitiz Foundation's long term vision and aspiration is aligned with the government's Ambisyon Natin 2040 - which envisions families that thrive in vibrant, culturally diverse, and resilient communities. While that may still be a long way to go, we commit to begin the work now. For 2021, we direct our focus on these four key strategies:\n\n- Integrate resiliency as a goal and framework. \u00b7\n- We will consider all the dimensions where we can help prepare and equip individuals and communities we work with; in facing social and economic disruptions.\n- Use digital technology in CSR programming. \u00b7\n- We will help bridge the gap for individuals and communities struggling with access and use of technology. Our programs will help accelerate technology adoption for students, educators, and other members of the community; and assist micro and small businesses to use e-commerce platforms to keep their livelihood thriving.\n- Increase core business interventions. \u00b7\n- Our work in the past three decades in the education, environment, and enterprise development sectors helped establish the portfolio of competencies that we have today as a foundation. We have also created trusted relationships in the communities we work with, and strong ties with partners in the public and private sectors. There is no greater time than now to ramp up our core work in these sectors, and sustain the momentum of the programs we've built.\n- Scale up social impact. \u00b7\n- Our core value of teamwork will always guide how we collaborate in projects with the many business units across the Aboitiz Group. Our people on the ground know best - and as a team, we will create and scale up smart, localized solutions that will yield immediate positive results, where it matters.\n\nWe are writing this report at such a time when Filipinos eagerly await for vaccination to begin. A remarkable year has taught us to review the path we charted ourselves to conquer, both as individuals and as an organization. 2020 is also a year that cemented the Foundation's mission to enable more communities to be resilient - bouncing back from adversities because they can; empowered - leveraging technology to create opportunities to thrive; and sustainable - conscious of the finite yet accessible natural resources, and embracing environment-friendly practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In collaboration with Hedcor and Pilmico, we provided financial assistance, capacity-building, as well as livelihood skills training for its members such as dressmaking and baking, among others.\n\nThe restrictions of the health crisis saw TMPC's loan applications and payments decline as cooperative members opted not to apply due to payment uncertainties as the majority of them were unable to work upon the imposition of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the area.\n\nHowever, these restrictions soon became opportunities as the ECQ prevented other bread suppliers from entering their community. As the only bakery operating in the area, the TMPC bakery operates day and night to meet the demands of the community. This has brought their income to a 117% increase in terms of sales from the month of March and April, compared to  January and February of the same year. Their grocery store also saw a 50% sales increase despite the ECQ.\n\nThrough Aboitiz Foundation's enterprise development program, the Thanksgiving Multi-purpose Cooperative was able to grow their dressmaking and bakery businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Thank you for donating our starter kits for our dressmaking and bakery business which we now enjoy and very much in demand in this time of the pandemic. Again, the officers and members of the Thanksgiving Multi-Purpose Cooperative are very much privileged to be one of your chosen partners in fulfilling your Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Without the support extended to us by Aboitiz Foundation, HEDCOR, and Pilmico, we will not be able to reach our status today, a large cooperative with an asset of over Php100M,' said  Emma Golocan, General Manager of TMPC.\n\n## Giving back to the community\n\nWith the success of TMPC, the cooperative pays it forward by giving back to the communities it serves. Recently, the cooperative conducted a relief operation in the affected areas of COVID-19.\n\n'What sets us apart from other cooperatives is perhaps our belief that 'in giving, you shall receive'. TMPC donates 10% of its annual net income to the church since the beginning of its operation in 1993. This is a true testament to our faith in the Almighty and with all the unending support of our partner agencies, the officers, and the members, I can say that we made it all possible for TMPC to be where we are now,' Golocan added.\n\nTMPC also conducts regular medical and dental missions, participates in community clean-up drives, implements tree planting activities, initiates Brigada Eskwela every start of the school year, and other similar initiatives.\n\n'With all of us working together, we can make more self-reliant organizations like TMPC - able to firmly stand on their own, grow their businesses, and in their own inspiring ways, contribute to co-creating safe, empowered, and sustainable communities,' said Maribeth L. Marasigan, Aboitiz Foundation President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThrough our enterprise development program, we empower cooperative members with effective organizational management and technical skills, financial and infrastructure support, and access to the market to help grow and expand their business. Since its inception, this program has benefited over 53 cooperatives with nearly 16,000 members as of 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget 10.2  Empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are committed to a mindset that views sustainability not as a cost of doing business, but as a way of doing good business. Sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy. We focus on three key areas where the ESG dimensions are present - our triple bottom line approach of people, planet, and profit. This framework is used to set targets, improve performance, and extend the scope of the value it\n\ncreates. Our ESG performance targets are included in each group's accountability and responsibility. In 2020, team members' performance appraisals included a portion for ESG compliance and delivery. We communicate our Sustainability Policy and Framework to our shareholders, employees, vendors, and customers through our various communication platforms.

Our business units adapt best practices in supply chain management and provide opportunities to local suppliers whenever possible. Operational and management plans help us integrate resource efficiency in our supply chain to be more prudent in the volume of materials used in the operations.\n\nGenerally, our supply chain management processes look into product/ service innovation, delivering excellent quality, and fulfilling the demands of our customers. ESG risks that are critical in the supply chain are being reviewed based on supplier compliance requirements that may vary depending on the industry sector where our strategic business units belong to.\n\nSignificant improvements and innovations in our supply chain\n\nThere are ongoing initiatives that promote the local supply chain, such as Food Group PH's partnership with DAR for the local corn sourcing. This would help local farmers for additional revenue and help the company have a more secure supply chain by purchasing locally.\n\nSeveral digital innovations are undertaken by our supply chain teams in terms of online accreditation and supply chain management process through the use of procurement and supplier accreditation software systems. These innovations help us adapt to the impacts of the pandemic in terms of delivery of supplies and reducing face-to-face meetings with suppliers.\n\n## Innovation Management\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call for most businesses in terms of digital transformation. The concept of a 'new normal' was borne out of regulations for reduced close-contact interactions and strict travel and hygiene restrictions. This new normal has given rise to new individual behavior and habits, and has pushed businesses to adapt quickly by bringing many of their processes online.\n\nThe Aboitiz Group's early investments in digital transformation equipped us well in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. We started this in 2016, recognizing that digital disruption is happening at an accelerated pace globally. This prompted us to establish one of our first major projects, our internal engagement platform called AGORA, powered by Facebook's Workplace platform. AGORA connects Aboitiz Group team members in one single platform for unified communication and collaboration. Apart from this, many other digital transformation initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhave been rolled out over the last four years under the following imperatives: improve our revenue streams; embed emerging and relevant technologies, data, and analytics to improve operational efficiencies and decision-making process; create an agile workplace to improve collaboration and productivity of our A-People; and, equip our team members with the right tools to continuously deliver value to our stakeholders.\n\n## 2020 Innovation Programs\n\n- AEV and AboitizPower successfully held their first ever Virtual Annual Stockholders' Meeting, which included the capability of having shareholders vote online and participate in its live proceedings. \u00b7\n- Integrating a data-driven approach in its operation, Therma South, Inc. embedded IoT technology - Digital Twin - into its power plant assets. This allows engineers to predict and accurately diagnose issues, and respond before these negatively impact its assets. This improved balance between reliability, availability, performance, and cost against risks to maximize asset value. \u00b7\n- UnionBank continues to pioneer out-of-the-box solutions in the Group as digital banking became even more relevant as the ECQ was imposed. These solutions include its Bank on Wheels, fully digital bank account opening, and pioneering online check encashments - highlighting how bank branches are becoming less transactional and, instead, more as interactional spaces for today's customers. \u00b7\n- Pilmico launched The Good Meat Shop online, which brings its farm products within easy and convenient reach of its customers. The company also migrated stakeholder engagement discussions to online platforms, including workshops, interest groups, live demos, and consultation sessions. \u00b7\n- Aboitiz InfraCapital launched its corporate website and social media accounts that gave way to enriching online interaction with its customers. The company is also instrumental to enabling innovation with its entry into telecommunications infrastructure. Taking advantage of data science and artificial intelligence, Republic Cement is able to optimize concentrations of raw materials resulting in better resource management and increased operational efficiency. \u00b7\n- \u00b7 AboitizLand introduced contactless homebuying using digital options to help promote staying safe at home. Potential homebuyers are offered a view of numerous projects through 360-degree virtual tours.\n- \u00b7 Contactless entry in offices was explored and implemented through the help of different identification technologies such as facial recognition and QR codes.\n\n## Enterprise Architecture\n\nIn 2020, AEV and AboitizPower ventured into an Enterprise Architecture (EA) program, which aims to lay the foundations of people, processes, and technology needed to achieve business goals and aspirations. Through EA, we will effectively adopt emerging technologies in exploring business opportunities and leverage data and analytics to sharpen our competitive edge towards becoming a more dynamic and resilient organization.\n\nOnce established, the EA program will serve as the master plan to accelerate our business capabilities and innovate our products and services as part of the Aboitiz Group's continuing digital transformation journey. The program is expected to produce initial output this 2021.\n\n## Embracing a data-driven approach to a sustainable future\n\nEven prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Aboitiz Group had already mapped out a strategy for harnessing the full potential of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) in advancing business and communities. As we embrace innovation further, DSAI will inform every decision, guide every interaction, and drive every process to deliver optimal business outcomes. DSAI will be at the center of every successful Aboitiz business, where our team members are equipped  to turn insight into action and deliver data science solutions that would create the best experience for all our stakeholders.\n\nAcross the Group, we are seeing gains from our data-driven approach to our sustainability, efficiency, and business objectives. We will continue to build on these gains through demonstration, awareness, enablement, and ecosystem partnership in order to deliver data science solutions that empower our communities towards achieving optimal business outcomes that will drive change for a better world.",

Our subsidiaries and business units abide by extensive and increasingly stringent safety, health, and environmental laws and regulations. We have designated pollution control officers in our different business units to monitor compliance with these regulations. Upholding the well-being of our team members at all times, we adhere to strict standards and constantly improve the conduct of our operations to ensure a safe workplace.\n\nIn the midst of a global pandemic, our strict implementation of COVID-19 safety protocols are aligned with governmentmandated minimum health standards. A Return-to-Work playbook has been put together by our COVID-19 Technical Working Group, which consolidates protocols and guidelines that need to be followed in order to protect all our team members across the Group. This playbook is consistently updated and communicated to all team members via existing digital communication platforms.\n\nThe Aboitiz Integrated Management System (AIMS) represents our commitment to implement our Information Security Management System (ISMS) and our Quality Management System (QMS). The ISMS safeguards the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company information, while the QMS makes certain that systems are always updated and improved across our corporate service units.\n\nWe, likewise, subscribe to the Department of Energy's Energy Regulation 1-94 that requires power generation companies to allocate funds for their host communities to protect both the natural environment and the people living in the area.\n\nUnionBank is keeping its promise to integrate environmental sustainability into its operations with 21 of its branches now LEED-certified. LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is an internationally recognized standard for green buildings that promote healthy, durable, affordable, and environmental practices in building and construction.\n\nFor the Food Group, the Pilmico Integrated Management System (IMS) ensures that all team members are guided in their decisions and activities pertaining to quality, information security, halal assurance, as well as HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) food safety and good manufacturing practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Develop and deliver training and awareness eLearning modules for office safety as well as acts as Disaster Preparedness Committee during calamities such as typhoons and earthquakes.\n\nIn 2020, our strategic business units launched different OSH programs, including AboitizPower's WATCHApp (Behavior Based Safety Mobile Application Program) used by team members, contractors, and visitors to report safety-related observations. This tool allows the company to monitor and quickly address safety concerns in the workplace. Pilmico, in encouraging and promoting safe workplace behavior, launched its Safety Reward System: Safety Ambassador of the Month program wherein good safety performance and behaviors of employees are recognized on a monthly basis.\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety (OSH)\n\nAs we have emphasized, the health and safety of the team members remains our top priority to ensure a sustainable work environment. The Group is guided by applicable Occupational Health and Safety Standards set by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Part of our IMS is to recognize and identify health and safety risks, and to set out policies and processes to mitigate and address risks.\n\nAEV and its subsidiaries' occupational health and safety guidelines cover both organic and contracted employees working in our facilities. Contractors may have no employer-employee relationship but are, nonetheless, covered by the company's 'prevailing influence'. 'Prevailing Influence' is when contracted employees are required to adhere to safety rules and regulations laid down by the company or to use methods, processes, or other techniques provided by the company.\n\nAboitiz employs a process of hazard aspect identification, risk assessment, and setting out of controls (HAIRADC process) through the different Safety and Health, Environment, and Security Teams in the Group. Results of these processes are evaluated and included in our Operational Risk Management Plans.\n\nHealth services are made available to our team members whether they are in a work-from-home set-up, reporting to the office, or staying at operations facilities. These are prepared with careful consideration of the impacts of the pandemic in the work conditions. Medical teleconsultations are made available for team members working from home while designated clinics are setup at our operations facilities. Services covered by the company's external medical insurance providers are also being utilized and recommended.\n\nThe Group ensures continued OSH awareness for its team members by conducting trainings and drill exercises. The Mandatory Eight-hour Safety and Health webinar (MESH) is a DOLE requirement for employers to provide to all of its employees. Topics covered are introduction and understanding of OSH, administrative, statutory and legal requirements, basic safety rules and measures on workplace hazards, HAIRADC, and emergency response. This provides the needed training and increases the awareness of employees on safety, increasing employee engagement as well. Prior to the pandemic, this training was conducted face-to-face, typically at our corporate offices. Converting it to a webinar allowed the course to be taken by more team members across the Group and from all our locations. The training material continues to\n\nbe available on-demand for future team members' training and awareness.\n\nTeam member inclusion in OSH discussions is also an important practice. The Aboitiz Safety Committees organized in the corporate headquarters and strategic business units deliver the following:\n\n- Ensure that the occupational safety and health program in the workplace is observed and enforced \u00b7\n- Create avenues to discuss OSH operational guidelines \u00b7\n- Promote and maintain an atmosphere of open and harmonious discussion of safety issues for the prevention of accidents and injuries and control of hazard \u00b7\n- Deliver the OSH trainings, drill exercises and OSH audits \u00b7\n- Conduct monthly office/facility safety inspections \u00b7\n\n## Certifications\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|             | Power Distribution ISO 9001 - Quality Management System Visayan Electric Company, Inc.; Davao Light and Power Company, Inc.; Cotabato Light and Power Company; Subic  Enerzone Corporation; Balamban Enerzone Corporation; Mactan Enerzone Corporation; Lima Enerzone Corporation ISO 45001 - Occupational Health and Safety Visayan Electric Company, Inc.; Davao Light and Power Company, Inc.; Cotabato Light and Power Company; Subic  Enerzone Corporation; Balamban Enerzone Corporation; Mactan Enerzone Corporation; Lima Enerzone Corporation ISO 14000 - Environmental Management Visayan Electric Company, Inc.; Davao Light and Power Company, Inc.; Cotabato Light and Power Company; Subic  Enerzone Corporation; Balamban Enerzone Corporation; Mactan Enerzone Corporation; Lima Enerzone Corporation Power Generation   |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Power       | Hedcor, Inc.; Hedcor Sabangan, Inc.; Luzon Hydro Corporation; Hedcor Sibulan, Inc.; Hedcor Tudaya, Inc.; Therma  Mobile Inc, Cebu Private Power Corporation; East Asia Utilities Corporation; Therma Marine, Inc.

By aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we implement and strengthen our sustainability programs that aim to minimize and address the impact of climate change on the environment and society.\n\n## Resource Efficiency and Waste Management\n\nOur Race to Reduce (R2R) programs at our strategic business units have paved the way for addressing concerns related to biodiversity, resource efficiency, and waste management.\n\nIn 2020, our team member engagement campaigns continued to promote lifestyle changes that reduce carbon emission and water consumption in daily routines. This includes the Global Goals awareness campaign of the United Nations on UN Day, cascaded through the Aboitiz Academy.\n\n## Wealth Out of Waste Framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEducation and awareness Evaluation and solution Implementation Idea generation\n\nReuse/Repurpose BU waste Enterprise development Partnerships with host communities\n\nResource efficiency Mindset change Auditing and inventory\n\nSegregation Clean recovery Proper disposal\n\nOur unified waste management framework called Wealth Out of Waste (WOW) is designed to increase efficiency, engagement, and even revenue. In support of RA 9003 (Solid Waste Management Act) and RA 6969 (Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990), our strategic business units identify waste management plans, develop policies, and implement and audit processes for the management of hazardous solid waste and effluent. Through WOW, we are able to identify gaps and consolidate our existing waste management efforts into a single direction that maximizes positive impact both internally and externally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate-related Action and Programs\n\n## A-PARK Program\n\nThe Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) extended its National Greening Program to 2028 to revitalize what it cited as the remaining unproductive, denuded, and degraded forestlands in the country through reforestation initiatives. The Aboitiz Group participated in this program and has even transcended its target to plant 9 million trees by 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the group has planted 11.73 million trees in partnership with the tree-growing project of Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc., Philippine Business for Social Progress, and the carbon sink program of Therma South, Inc. and Therma Visayas Inc. Collectively, this is the Group's contribution to help mitigate climate change, making PHP474,494 million in total investments.\n\nLocal Climate Change Action Planning (LCCAP) Program\n\nWe partnered with the Climate Change Commission in conducting training on Local Climate Change Action Planning to increase capacities of local municipalities. Communities learn to become climate-resilient by identifying risks and vulnerabilities and developing long-term strategies to reduce risk and future losses on livelihood, human settlements, and resources. Coastal Ecosystems.\n\n## Ecosystem-based Biodiversity Management\n\nLed by its different strategic business units, the Aboitiz Group initiated programs to manage our impact on Life on Water (SDG 14) and Life on Land (SDG 15). Initial environmental impact assessments for business projects have led to management of different flora and fauna species in different ecosystems adjacent to where our business units operate.\n\n## Coastal Ecosystems\n\nIn 2020, the Aboitiz Cleanergy Park was cited by a local expert as a birdwatching haven, with its wide variety of animal habitat types combined with the area's relative isolation and secure environment.\n\nThe eight-hectare park is home to a mangrove reforestation site, nursery, botanical garden for the propagation of 29 natives tree species, and 100 species of birds. Since 2014, the park has nurtured and released more than 4,939 hawksbill turtle hatchlings, planted 13,992 mangroves, and rescued 16 pawikans (sea turtles).\n\nWe also have the Calubcub 2: Pawikan Conservation at AboitizLand's Seafront Residences residential development project in San Juan, Batangas. It was launched to protect local biodiversity, lessen the environmental impact, and create a sustainable and eco-friendly seaside community. The partnership between AboitizLand and UP Diliman-Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology paved the way towards achieving the company's goals in conducting research, setting up standard facilities for the pawikan, and monitoring & evaluation of environmental impact. It also espoused conservation operations, capacity building, and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities within the community of the vecinos, including the barangay. Now in its third year, the program has recorded a total of 1,181 pawikan hatchlings released.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The program also serves as our contribution to the government's greening efforts in partnership with the DENR.\n\nIn 2010, AboitizPower adopted Pangarap, one of the country's few remaining female Philippine eagles. The company allocates funding for food, veterinary care, and shelter maintenance for the 22-year-old eagle, which was captivebred and raised through a combination of hand- and puppetrearing. Pangarap remains in the care of the Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) in Davao City and continues to symbolize the Aboitiz Group's hopes and dreams both in wildlife conservation and for the Philippines as a country to take flight. Since she was first adopted, Pangarap remains in good health and is one of the few eagles still eligible to reproduce and regrow her species' population.\n\n## Wetlands and Rivers\n\nBalabag Wetland Park (Wetland 4)\n\nThe pandemic did not halt our continued efforts for the rehabilitation of Balabag Wetland Park in Boracay, Aklan. Set for turnover in 2021, the entire wetland area is being converted to an urban linear park with these enhancements:\n\n- Five aerators to improve the water quality \u00b7\n- A 3D 'Boracay' letter signage as a design feature and point of interest \u00b7\n- Community center in front of D'Mall; to also serve as an activity area \u00b7\n- Perimeter landscaping and pavers covering its entire surrounding \u00b7\n- Parking area for proper loading and unloading of visitors \u00b7\n\nAmong the key upcoming features are a plaza and a boardwalk lined with trees and plants endemic to Boracay to help rebuild the area's biodiversity. These will be constructed by the partner government agency in 2021.\n\n## San Juan River Rehabilitation\n\nThe partnership between Aboitiz and the DENR for #WOWSanJuanRiver or the San Juan River (Manila Bay) Rehabilitation Project is continuously being implemented through stakeholder engagements involving different government agencies. This involves the development of a working framework and creating a model for other Manila Bay tributaries. Included in the pipeline are 'eco-hubs', trash traps, and a small boat to clear areas and sections of the river.\n\n## Sustainability Education\n\nCleanergy Center, AboitizPower's first energy educational facility, is located in the Admin Compound of MakBan Geothermal Power Plant in Brgy. Bitin, Bay, Laguna. It features basic tools used in power generation, educational videos about the different types of energy sources, a tour of a working geothermal power plant, and an interactive room where visitors can experience simulation activities like making their own wind turbine, charging phones by biking, among others. A total of 56,000 visitors have toured the Center to learn how AboitizPower produces renewable energy and provides energy solutions that leave a lighter impact on our environment and host communities.\n\nIn Davao, AboitizPower's Energy Education Center (EEC) was opened in 2016 and is located inside Therma South's baseload power plant complex. It features interactive and informative displays on the Philippine energy sector and various powergenerating technologies. As of 2020, the center has welcomed about 3,500 visitors.\n\n## Other Projects\n\nIn partnership with the City Government of Davao, the Aboitiz Group through Davao Light & Power Company (Davao Light) and Aboitiz Foundation, GET Philippines, and QEV Technologies launched the BEST Bus project - the first fully electric, free shuttle service in Mindanao. Likewise, Davao City holds the distinction of being among the project's first pilot locations.\n\nBEST stands for Business for Environmentally Sustainable Transformation and is an initiative advocating to 'be green, be digital, and be kind' for the betterment of the community. In significantly reducing harmful emissions, maximizing available new technologies, and encouraging inclusive benefits for all, the BEST Bus project aims to leave a lasting impact on environmental sustainability. A total of seven new fully air-conditioned electric buses that feature an electric ramp and reserved space for PWDs have been made available to the public. The BEST Bus operates daily on two downtown routes that pass through Davao City's major activity centers and with bus stops every 400 meters along the way.\n\n## The Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction\n\nand Management program is a customized approach that promotes localized decision-making and implementation to reduce vulnerabilities and promote zero casualties in disaster situations.\n\n## Through the Cooperative Business Continuity\n\nPlan , micro, small and medium enterprises conducted business continuity planning to strengthen community enterprise and to reduce their vulnerability to the impacts of unforeseen events, including major emergencies and disasters. In 2020, in lieu of in-person trainings discontinued in the pandemic, e-learning seminars were conducted by Aboitiz Foundation in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Cooperative Development Authority, and Go Negosyo.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The AEV Risk Management Team supports the Group's sustainability efforts by ensuring that we have an Enterprise Risk Management program that helps manage sustainability issues and create shared value for our communities. We are able to accomplish this by utilizing a robust risk management process, creating awareness, and building team member capabilities while maximizing available resources and technologies.\n\nThe year 2020 underscored the importance of Risk Management in organizations. Our well-established Enterprise Risk Management program, with its Level 4 Risk Maturity rating, backed the Group's resilience during the unprecedented pandemic. Risk Management will continue to take a full organizational approach, integrating with other business functions to drive a clearer understanding of our risks.\n\n## Managing Top Risks\n\nTo ensure that we are managing risks that are relevant to our business goals, we regularly review\n\nthe Risk Management Plans of all Aboitiz Group business units and discuss these with senior management and the Board.\n\n## Pandemic Risk\n\nIn 2020, one of the major risks that we closely monitored was the Pandemic Risk, which covers communicable diseases such as COVID-19. The virus outbreak triggered a shift in our organization's risk profile. The imposition of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the Philippines caused limitations in the people's movements, disruptions in project operations, and customers' changing priorities. All these resulted in:\n\n- A decline in the demand and consumption of goods and services. \u00b7\n- Some customers were unable to meet their financial obligations because of the closure of many businesses and increased unemployment. \u00b7\n- Getting project funding was also affected since the decreased economic activity and the anticipated downgrade in credit ratings of companies caused tight market conditions that resulted in lower credit appetite of lenders. \u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The shift to a work-from-home setup increased the risk of information security and may have had possible negative effects on the well-being of some team members.\n- \u00b7 New regulations and legislations were issued by the government that we had to constantly align to and comply with.\n\nTo manage these risks, we put in place different treatment plans and controls such as, but not limited to the:\n\n- \u00b7 Continuous review and update of plans and processes to align with the changing environment and requirements\n- \u00b7 Launch of awareness campaigns\n- \u00b7 Maximization of digital platforms\n- \u00b7 Strict enforcement of health and safety protocols in sites and facilities\n- \u00b7 Health and wellness initiatives to protect the psychological and mental health of employees\n\nApart from the risks enumerated above, we recognized the opportunities that emerged from this pandemic. The disruption in the supply chain accelerated the shift to a hybrid workplace that was already being implemented in some business units. While it has some challenges, this current set-up enabled us to test the effectiveness of our IT capabilities that we had started to develop and roll out pre-pandemic. The delays in project execution and the decline in market demand drove the accelerated planning and implementation of initiatives with minimal or no investment required. We continued nonstop in extending help to communities, re-channeling our resources to align with helping the medical communities and local governments in their COVID-19 response efforts.\n\n## Project Risk\n\nProject Risk remains to be one of the Group's top risks. COVID-19 travel restrictions and mandated community quarantines caused delays in the completion of existing projects. While the pandemic affected the operations timeline of some of the Group's projects, it also opened an opportunity for us to explore other initiatives that could be more effective and efficient.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk management is the practice of ensuring the stability and success of a project. We carefully evaluate each significant and potential project to gain a more rigorous understanding of the risks involved. Lessons-learned sessions are part of our process for each major milestone, enabling the team to celebrate quick wins, learn from past or current challenges, and seize emerging opportunities from the project. This practice enhances the company's ability to capture opportunities that help define the organization's future.\n\n## Regulatory Risk\n\nWe give a significant amount of attention to regulatory risks, as the Group is engaged in highly-regulated industries such as power, banking, food, infrastructure, and construction. Each industry has specific regulatory risks, but what is common among them is that regulations are usually challenging and constantly changing. It is therefore imperative for us to keep up with the demands of regulatory compliance, as failure to do so will have negative consequences on both the Group's net income and reputation.\n\nTo mitigate regulatory risk, we forecast how regulations and legislation will affect our various",

We work closely with the Corporate External Relations and Legal teams in monitoring any changes in laws and regulations. We also participate in consultative processes for more public discussions on the necessity or propriety of specific regulations; their relevance to current business practices; and technology changes that could lead to the development of new regulations and policies that will be beneficial to the Group.\n\nIn our efforts to innovate regulatory risk management, we are rolling out the Aboitiz Unified Compliance Management System, based on the Governance, Risk, and Compliance methodology. This system enables us to have better compliance management and oversight because of the availability of more data and information.\n\n## Information Security Risk\n\nInformation security risk remains as one of the top risks managed by the Group, due to the increasing number of information security breach events happening globally, both for Information Technology (IT) and Operations Technology (OT). The COVID-19 pandemic increased this risk as people work from home and conduct various transactions online.\n\nThe Group was able to avoid breaches in 2020, as a result of our efforts in building an information security risk-aware culture that strengthens the prevention, detection, and comprehensive response process of team members. We also continue to strengthen our security and resilience through our Information Security Management System (ISMS) and Operational Technology (OT) Security Governance. It is imperative to enforce these security measures as breaches can have catastrophic implications on the organization's bottom line and reputation.\n\nThe Group continues its journey to achieve Level 4 in Cyber Security Maturity, which means having a formal cybersecurity policy that covers all critical systems as well as the means to measure and monitor cybersecurity activities and behavior.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDifferent IT and OT Teams across the Group together built a roadmap geared towards strengthening our technology, people, and processes.\n\n## Talent Risk\n\nTalent risk encompasses the acquisition, retention, and optimization of team members across the Group. In 2020, we revisited the context of this risk as well as the identified treatments to ensure their alignment with the Group's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We acknowledge that the pandemic has strongly affected the day-to-day life of our team members and will require their adapting to new competencies to support the agility, resilience, and psychological engagement they need to thrive.\n\nThe inability to prepare and manage the impact of this risk may cause potential delays in executing various deliverables, which could eventually lead to missed business opportunities. The current situation may also negatively affect the team members' mental, physical, and psychological well-being.\n\nAs a response, engagement programs across the different business units were enhanced, and plans for digital learning and development were accelerated to ensure that the ongoing work-fromhome set-up will not halt the development of all our team members and leaders.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)\n\nTo adapt to the changing environment, we revisited the Financial and Supply Chain Risk Management Frameworks and the Group Risk Management Competencies in 2020. In light of the pandemic, we incorporated many revisions and the enhancements in our risk treatment plans. We also started to formalize the Pandemic Risk Management Framework as a guide for current and future occurrences. In collaboration with our external partners, we continued to build the risk management capability of the organization through e-learnings and other knowledge-sharing sessions on risk topics.\n\nWe will continue to collaborate with the Strategy and Reputation Teams for the sustainability and climate risk-related initiatives of the Group; the output will eventually be integrated into the Risk Management Framework. In 2021, apart from our ERM operational activities, we will start setting up our Risk Management and Risk Finance systems. We will also enhance our existing Risk Framework to better support the management of the Group's top risks and material sustainability issues, including climate-related risks.\n\n## Risk Finance in a Hardening Insurance Market\n\nIn 2020, the insurance market continued to harden, resulting in a steady increase in premium rates, difficulty to place 100% of risks, and reductions in policy covers or terms. We expect this situation to be aggravated by the impact of the pandemic and will carry on for the next couple of years. Thus, we focused on continuously improving the Group's risk profile through a regular review of risk treatment and business continuity plans, the implementation of asset management (ISO 55001), and addressing areas for improvement identified in our risk engineering surveys.\n\nIn 2021, in aiming to minimize the impact of the hardened insurance market, we will continue to explore new insurance markets to lessen placement difficulty, study the viability of non-traditional risk transfer programs to mitigate identified risks, and optimize our captive participation to manage the increase in risk transfer costs.\n\n## Business Continuity Management (BCM)\n\nThe successive disruptive events in 2020 - the COVID-19 outbreak, the Taal eruption, and other natural disasters - put to the test not only our existing business continuity plans but also the responsiveness of our organization. We formed Technical Working Groups (TWGs) to actively monitor situations and we activated applicable Business Continuity Plans. Various guidelines, protocols, and initiatives were developed and",

Despite the ongoing disruptions, we were able to carry on with our BCM maintenance activities. These included completing the Groupwide Incident Management Guidelines, updating our Business Impact Analysis (which aims to allocate and use recovery resources more efficiently), and improving our capability building activities by developing new tools and instructional guides.\n\nIn 2021, we will pursue our COVID-19 response initiatives and strengthen our operational resilience through the continuous enhancement of our BCM capabilities. Our frameworks and guidelines will help in the Group's integrated efforts in prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. We will also look into new scenarios that may develop as a result of climate change.\n\nPart of our business continuity plan review will include a reassessment of the natural catastrophe scenarios that each site is exposed to, their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npotential increase in frequency and magnitude and the sufficiency of the current plans in addressing the scenarios. We will continue to educate our people and generate awareness through training, industry benchmarking, and leveraging best practices.\n\n## Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) Awareness and Capability Building\n\nIn 2020, we strengthened the Group's ISMS Program by improving processes, technology, and most importantly, our people.\n\nPeople - We rolled out four eLearning modules, including topics such as making our suppliers our partners in securing our information assets, and managing information security incidents. These completed our 24-month roll-out of our ISMS eLearning for the Group.  Despite the work-fromhome set-up, we were able to push through with activities for the Information and CyberSecurity Awareness Month in November. In partnership with the IT Security Team, we held a series of learning sessions for the whole month. In 2021, we will continue working closely with our partners to ensure a holistic approach to managing information security risks. We will also pursue capability-building activities focusing on information security where there are recorded non-compliances and incidents.\n\nProcess - We were able to complete the gap assessment on cybersecurity across the Group in collaboration with AEV IT Security. We enhanced our cyber risk incident management processes by conducting various simulation exercises and we will continue these activities in 2021. We also intensified our compliance efforts for the Data Privacy Act by integrating the monitoring of our Information Security controls with Pillar 4 of Data Privacy.\n\nTechnology - Together with the IT Security team, we improved the Group's detection and monitoring systems by using more fit-for-purpose technologies. We also partnered with key vendors who will assist us in global threat intelligence and digital forensics investigation.\n\n## Internal Audit in the history of Aboitiz\n\nOn February 4, 1920, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry approved the corporation papers of Aboitiz y Compania Incorporada, capitalized at PHP1.25 million and PHP500,000 in paid-up capital. A hundred years later, in 2020, Aboitiz had a capitalization of Php10 billion with PHP5.7 billion paid-up. This is a growth of 8,000%  for a company that started over a century ago as a trading business partnership between Paulino Aboitiz and Jose Muertegui.\n\nAboitiz and Company (ACO) survived many difficult situations, including near bankruptcy and war devastation. Resilience, business acumen, a sense of timing, and the 'palabra de honor' of Aboitiz patriarch Don Ramon, steered the business to a path of continued growth and success. This is the Aboitiz Way.\n\nAround thirty years before ACO took Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. (AEV) public in 1994, the internal audit function was already recognized as an integral part of the company's operations. Team leaders were committed to implementing effective internal controls, and had placed great importance on the internal audit function. They did these not only because a governing body like the Securities and Exchange Commission required it, but they also recognized the immense value of having an\n\nindependent assurance to ensure that the company's risk management, governance, and internal controls are operating effectively.\n\n## A quick lookback\n\n- \u00b7 1960s: The Internal Audit Team was established as a line function of ACO's Accounting Department.\n- \u00b7 1970s: The Internal Audit Team became a separate, independent unit.\n- \u00b7 1980s: Erramon Aboitiz took over the reins of the department.\n- \u00b7 1990s: The Corporate Audit Team (CAT) implemented many process changes and improvements such as adoption of the Peter's matrix format in audit reporting, acquisition of the first version of the Audit Command Language data analytics tool, and introduction of the audit Customer Satisfaction Survey.\n- \u00b7 Early 2000s: Process enhancements continued in the next few years with the formalization of the Internal Audit charters, implementation of the Issues Monitoring matrix, introduction of the COSO-based audit rating, and intensified trainings for new auditors;\n- \u00b7 2012: The CAT was rebranded as the Group Internal Audit (GIA). Resident internal audit teams were formed in key business units to expand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur internal audit team acts as an independent unit that ensures the company's functions and controls in management and governance are operating effectively.",

The team provides general oversight to the internal audit function across the Aboitiz Group.\n\nAs the Aboitiz Group continues to grow as one of the largest and most respected conglomerates in the country, our challenge is to ensure that the audit team is in step with this increasing level of excellence.\n\nIt is important to look at audit from the perspective that it is a long-term investment for a good night's rest and peace of mind. Internal audit works for the good of the organization - its people, its processes, and all its stakeholders. Each of them relies on auditors and compliance professionals to ensure that the company will maximize the utility expected of them without waste, inefficiency, or fraud. Internal audit's primary roles are:\n\n- \u00b7 To provide assurance to management and the  Board about the efficiency and effectiveness of company  policies and operations, and the status of compliance with legal and statutory obligations;\n- \u00b7 To  provide oversight, assess existing controls, and recommend actions on identified  gaps and weaknesses;  and ultimately,\n- \u00b7 To be a business partner and advisor to stakeholders.\n\n## The Role of Auditors\n\nAs auditors, we do not claim to be experts in everything but our aim is to always add value and venture outside what is comfortable by continuously learning about the different businesses and the external factors that affect them. We fully support the achievement of our organization's business objectives, goals, and mission whether for-profit or non-profit. We do our checks and balances. We ensure that a fair process is followed. We work towards being auditors that are risk-focused, skilled, and business-savvy. In\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## VISION\n\nTo be the most trusted partner in bridging value creation through meaningful and objective insights\n\n## MISSION\n\n## To P A R T N E R\n\nP ro-active A dd value R eliable T eam-player N eutral E mpowered R elevant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthis ever-changing business landscape, we need to be able to constantly adapt and work towards accelerated competence building.  Only then can we be able to truly add and contribute significantly to achieving sustainable shareholder value.   Our vision is to be the most trusted partner in value creation in the management of governance, risk, and controls while living our corporate values of integrity, teamwork, innovation, and responsibility.\n\n- \u00b7 Courageous authenticity. Our core value of integrity allows us to do what we do best-take tough stands, discuss the 'undiscussables', and openly deal with problems. Practicing courageous authenticity is instrumental for our stakeholders to see how well audit can be trusted to walk the talk.\n- \u00b7 Combined assurance. Our core value of teamwork allows us to rely on the work of non-auditors. As internal auditors, we cannot claim to be the sole assurance providers in the organization because we have the  ISO team, the quality auditors, the ISMS team, our security personnel, and subject-matter experts. They are the first and second line of defense. All contribute to providing assurance to management. Yet, we always fall into the trap of working in silos - to each his own. We need to combine and coordinate in reporting the output of these various assurance providers to create greater efficiencies and enhance transparency in the organization. Combined assurance, or drawing from the expertise of other assurance providers in the organization, will bring us to a higher level of maturity in risk management and assurance.\n- \u00b7 Continuous auditing. The seeds have long been planted for us auditors to live our corporate value of innovation . We have the tools that allow auditors to leverage technology and perform real-time, continuous monitoring rather than just perform periodic reviews.\n- \u00b7 Source of talent. Living the value of responsibility is to adhere to good corporate governance, advocate sustainability, and care for all our stakeholders. We ensure that they\n\ntake a fair share of the value creation that we auditors seek to provide as a trusted partner. A measure of success of a responsible auditor is when one becomes a first-pick, top-of-mind for frontline functions in the business units and departments that have been audited. When the internal audit department becomes a key source of talent, it is a testament to how well we lived the value of responsibility.  It is worth noting that many key executives in the Aboitiz Group were once upon a time,  auditors.\n\nOur audit road map has been set but it is also fluid. Designed to thrive on change,  it allows learning as we go along.  We try to bring out the best in the team and to push for changing the organizational mindset to look at and accept audit as a trusted partner. We are not an opponent to be feared or a policeman who will accost and punish you for wrongdoings. We are a partner who supports and works towards improving the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the organization's objectives, programs, and activities. All these we do to help reduce the incidence of institutional fraud and overall operational gaps and weaknesses.\n\nThe events that are shaping our world, our personal lives and the way we do business today are unprecedented. Today, it is not about auditors being just objective but being objective with a sense of purpose. It is not about auditors being just independent but being interdependent and finding the best synergies in working with stakeholders. It is living the depth of this role that we play in Aboitiz that translates to helping society. After all, we have to model and live our sustainability mindset of doing well by doing good.\n\nWhy do we audit?  Why are we in audit? One answer: auditors want to make a positive contribution to the organization-to have a sense of mission about the work we do. As the Aboitiz Group Internal Audit Team, we are poised to do our part in creating a  new and future organization by developing a team that is highly visible, proactive, agile, driven, passionate, and ultimately, world-class. Audit has been that way for decades.  Aboitiz has been that way for a hundred years.  It will be like that for the next hundred.  It is simply the Aboitiz way.",

'\n\nthe Aboitiz Group, the pandemic emphasized what should always be our top priority: our people.\n\nCOVID-19 also made us re-look at our talent management framework and strategy.  Our strategic goal to attract, retain, optimize, and deliver a seamless talent experience through technology remains relevant. However, we refocused talent strategy to building organizational resiliency and capability to support the Group's long term strategy through resilient people and agile systems. We define resiliency as the demonstration of agility and flexibility to adapt quickly to the changing requirements of the job. It also entails effective execution at an accelerated speed, where needed.\n\n## Talent Attraction\n\n## Employer Brand\n\nWe continue to live our Employer Value Proposition (EVP) which are the key attributes that differentiate the Aboitiz Group as an employer. Despite the physical limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked on increasing awareness of our EVP by communicating EVP stories on various social media platforms. Stories about how we are supporting team members' health and safety and how we are helping the community during the pandemic have gained much attention from our target audience on different platforms. Our engagement activities with academic institutions such as AIM and universities also continued albeit virtually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAboitiz considers Building Human Capital as one of our four strategic pillars.

Access to the talent database is given to Aboitiz Group Talent Attraction teams so they may match open positions with team members providing opportunities for 'bugsay' or self-driven development within the Group.\n\n## Talent Optimization\n\nDigital Learning & Development Despite the challenges we faced in 2020, we were steadfast in ensuring that learning and development continue to thrive across the Group.\n\nIn March 2020, when most team members were deployed to work from home, the Aboitiz Academy\n\nquickly pivoted to digital learning to make sure that there is no disruption in the learning and development of team members.\n\nThe Aboitiz Group subscription to LinkedIn Learning, an online educational platform that provides a wide variety of courses from different experts on topics such as leadership, creativity, and technology, started with 100 pilot users at the beginning of 2020. In June 2020, subscribers increased to 305 as business units and more team members started to adapt to online, on-demand learning. LinkedIn Learning users in the Group recorded a total of 3,780 learning hours, which is beyond the 75th percentile benchmark among the companies using the same platform in the Philippines. At the end of 2020, 1,700+ licenses are ready to be activated, signifying that more team members are embracing digital learning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAside from LinkedIn Learning, we also developed our own e-learning content. E-learning versions of core and compliance courses were developed by internal experts. All other instructor-led training sessions were done virtually using Zoom or Google Meet as platforms. Our learning and development initiatives such as Learning Lunes, Lunch and\n\nLearn, Community Learning Sessions, and Leaders Connect continued and even gained more participation across the Group. The digital execution of these initiatives allowed us to scale up our offerings and invite team members and leaders outside Metro Manila and even in other countries.\n\n| e-Learning Course                   | Number of TMs who completed the course   | Total Leaning Hours       |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                     | 1,489                                    | The Aboitiz Way 527 hours |\n| Code of Ethics and Business Conduct | 3,964                                    | 2,444 hours               |\n| BCM 101                             | 527                                      | 79 hours                  |\n| Basics of Risk Management           | 461                                      | 55 hours                  |\n| Data Privacy Act 101                | 295                                      | 49 hours                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Team Leaders must remain culturally and emotionally connected with the 'new normal' of engaging a hybrid workforce. The following were identified as necessary to prepare the organization for the future:\n\n- The right attitude and defined core values \u00b7\n- Strong work ethic \u00b7\n- Strength of character to rise above difficult situations \u00b7\n- Resiliency - agility, flexibility, adaptability \u00b7\n- Technology/digital skills, creativity, innovative mindset \u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Interpersonal skills - effective communication, emotional intelligence, empathy\n\nWe align our core and elective course offerings to these competencies and ascertain that we support reskilling & upskilling of our workforce. A leadership development program focused on Strategic Thinking and Innovation, Resilience and Leading Change is being developed to accelerate the development of future leaders in the organization.\n\n## Succession Management\n\nThrough the years, we have continuously improved our succession management processes, focusing on our critical talents across the Group.\n\nThe rigorous strategic workforce planning led to a more robust succession plan that helps us identify the leaders and successors that we need to develop and prepare for future roles in the organization. We have set the criteria to map talents and identify the high potentials and high performers across the Group. We have also established metrics to measure if we have a healthy succession plan and leadership pipeline. The two important metrics in succession are (1) Overall Sourcing Ratio, which means counting the number of positions that we fill internally versus positions that are filled by external sources; and (2) Succession Readiness, which is the number of 'Ready Now' successors versus the number of positions with identified successors. Using a benchmark of 75% internal vs. 25% external sourcing ratio, we are currently at 76% internal vs. 24% external which is slightly above the benchmark. On succession readiness, the Aboitiz Group is at a satisfactory level based on external standards. By continuously identifying highpotential and high-performing talents, we are able to prepare them for future roles.\n\n## Talent Retention\n\nEmployee Engagement Employee engagement is one of the most\n\nimportant goals in Aboitiz Talent Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n404-2\n\nWe want to cultivate a culture of values and engage the right talents in the organization to help in talent retention.\n\nAboitiz Group President and CEO Sabin Aboitiz is at the forefront of building a culture of values and engaging people at all levels. Since the start of his leadership in January 2020, he has communicated to all team members of the Group through a town hall meeting entitled SuperDuperCon (a revamped, group-wide version of SuperCon, which was conducted when he was CEO of Pilmico). SuperDuperCon serves as an opportunity for team leaders to listen to the questions of our team members, give answers, and provide clarity on matters that are unclear yet important to them. During the pandemic, this event was scaled up and live-streamed to different locations in the Philippines and Asia, allowing more team members to participate. We were able to complete a total of 17 episodes with a total of more than 47,000 views.\n\nAside from SuperDuperCon, our CEO also welcomes new team members through an onboarding activity called Welcome A-Board.\n\nThis engagement activity is highly appreciated by new team members and helps elevate their overall employee experience. In addition, small group discussions called UpClose with the CEO were organized to give team members and leaders a venue to get to know the Aboitiz Group CEO, ask him questions, learn more about values and culture, and also ask about company performance and direction. In 2020, there were a total of 14 sessions, participated by 145 team leaders and members across the Group.\n\n## Group Team Awards\n\nThe Aboitiz Way Group Team Awards was extra meaningful and valuable to team members as it allowed us to celebrate successes despite the challenges of 2020. A total of 43 nominations were received from across all the units in the group, all exemplifying the time-tested Aboitiz values. More than the award and recognition given to the chosen winners, it is the impact that they create that matters - not only to the team members and the organization but also to the communities that we serve.",

Some team members experienced anxiety because of the virus, some are adjusting to their work arrangements which are sometimes not ideal - with limited or intermittent connection, distractions, inadequate workspace, etc.  There is also a perceived increase in workload, increasing time pressure, and more need for leadership support.\n\nTo address these issues, all business units implemented mental health and wellness\n\nprograms, designed based on the needs of their respective team members:\n\n- Regularly conducted pulse surveys and check-ins with team members \u00b7\n- Communications at different levels and venues (i.e. Teleconsultations, counseling sessions, 24/7 chat lines) were made available so that team member concerns are heard and addressed \u00b7\n- Medical benefits covering mental health and wellness \u00b7\n- Health-related learning sessions through LinkedIn Learning, speakers, newsletters, \u00b7\n\nand other learning materials\n\n- \u00b7 Online fitness activities such as exercise classes and yoga\n- \u00b7 Continuous review and updating of our company guidelines and processes for work from home, hybrid work arrangements, and team member benefits\n- \u00b7 The C-Focused Fridays program was introduced in 2020 to provide team members a specific, uniform time block during the week to enhance employee experience and support well-being and development.\n\n## HR Service Delivery\n\nHR service delivery is about ensuring that we provide an engaging talent experience. In 2020, we were able to fully implement the HR information system and  MyTX Phase 1 in AEV. It covered the automation of core HR, benefits administration, recruitment, onboarding, and talent relations management.\n\nMyTX Phase 2, which includes strategic HR processes such as performance management, succession management, learning and development, workforce compensation, and people analytics, will be implemented in AEV in 2021.\n\nApart from MyTX, in 2020, AEV and Aboitiz Infracap also planned and developed the Flexible Benefits (Flexben) program, following the design and system implemented in Pilmico. Flexben allows team members to choose benefits according to their specific needs. This program shall be fully implemented in 2021.\n\nAll SBUs will plan the digitization of HR end-to-end processes to ensure continuous improvement of talent experience. A data lake of all people records will enable us to use data analytics to provide us future insights that will be helpful in designing more effective talent management programs.",

Independent from management, they are committed to provide each company a strategic roadmap towards long-term growth, competitiveness, and building a sustainable business that, it is hoped, will thrive  for another 100 years. Each Board performs the crucial role of articulating and reviewing each company's purpose, vision and mission, and strategies to carry out its goals. They ensure that the strategic direction of each company's businesses are well defined, properly managed, and are aligned with the overall strategic goals of the Aboitiz Group.\n\nThe Boards of AEV and AboitizPower each have nine members, all of whom come from diverse professional backgrounds. They are composed of\n\nlegal and finance professionals, engineers, former or current CEO/COOs, auditors, and accountants. Many of them have management experience in the private and government sectors, as well as in multilateral agencies. AboitizPower has three Independent Directors, three Non-Executive Directors, and three Executive Directors.  AEV has three Independent Directors, five Non-Executive Directors, and one Executive Director. The Chairmen of the AEV and AboitizPower Boards are highly experienced, NonExecutive Directors who are not involved in the Group's day-to-day operations. They therefore remain focused on refining each company's longterm strategy. The Lead Independent Directors are highly qualified professionals who are familiar with the operations of each company, and the industries it does business in.\n\nIn 2020, the members of the AEV and AboitizPower Boards of Directors were the following:\n\n## ABOITIZ EQUITY VENTURES INC.'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n| Director (Age, Nationality)                 | Designation/ Directorship    | Year First  Elected   |   Number of  Years Served as  Director | Board and Committee  Memberships and % of  Attendance for 2020                  | Directorships in Other Listed  Companies Outside the  Aboitiz Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ENRIQUE M.

The Board's role for each company is to represent and protect the interests of its shareholders - the owners of the business - and other key external stakeholders. Guided by the Aboitiz Group's purpose, brand promise, mission, and vision, the members of each Board, together with key officers and heads of the Strategic Business Units, participate in an Annual Board Retreat and Strategy Refresh. They review and align the corporate initiatives and strategic roadmaps of the Group's core businesses with contemporary market\n\nand economic trends, both locally and worldwide. In 2020, this annual engagement was held in a series of online sessions that began on October 29, 2020.\n\n## Board Independence\n\nBy virtue of the Manuals and their respective Committee charters, the AEV and AboitizPower ESCG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) Committees were tasked to develop and recommend a set of corporate governance principles, aimed to promote the independence of their respective Boards, including standards and guidelines applicable to the selection, contribution, and conduct of Board members.\n\nIn 2020, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards were\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "composed of a majority of Non-Executive  Directors. AEV has three qualified Independent Directors and five Non-Executive Directors out of its nine Board members. Meanwhile, AboitizPower has three qualified Independent Directors and three NonExecutive Directors out of its nine Board members. In addition, both Boards have each appointed a Lead Independent Director who serves as an intermediary between the Chairman and the other directors whenever necessary.\n\n## Diversity\n\n405-1\n\nThe diversity  in professional and personal backgrounds (age, ethnicity, culture, skills, competence, gender, knowledge, and expertise) of Board members ensures that no director or group of directors can dominate the deliberation and decision-making process.  AEV and AboitizPower can also benefit from the diverse perspectives in  formulating sound corporate strategies and advancing towards long-term success. The annual selection process of directors is intended to appoint a diverse mix of highly-competent directors and officers with in-depth knowledge and experience in the core industries where AEV and AboitizPower are involved. Other factors considered are independent-mindedness, ethical behavior, and value contribution.\n\nRecognizing that a sustainable enterprise goes beyond the current generations of leaders, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards appointed Ms. Ana Maria A. Delgado and Mr. Danel C. Aboitiz, respectively, as Directors in 2018. Ana and Danel are part of a new generation of homegrown leaders who add fresh perspectives to each Board's deliberation. Ana is also the first female member of AEV's Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2020, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards initiated a process to review the profiles of the current Board members, in relation to an ideal profile, to determine their  subjective and objective qualifications that are aligned with the long-term strategic direction of the Group. This initiative is meant to identify areas in which each Board can improve in terms of ensuring its members have complementary competencies and skill sets, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto assess the qualifications of potential future candidates to each Board.\n\nTerm Limits of Independent Directors\n\nAEV and AboitizPower both comply with the requirements of SEC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 2016, prescribing a maximum term of nine years for independent directors, starting from 2012. In the nomination, selection, and election of the members of its Boards, AEV and AboitizPower recognize  and respect  the inviolable statutory right of each shareholder to vote and be voted as a director. If either AEV or  AboitizPower intends to retain an independent director who has served  the maximum of nine consecutive years, the shareholders of the relevant company shall be advised and provided with meritorious justifications during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting (ASM) for which the election will take place.\n\nDirectorships in Other Listed Companies\n\nThe ESCG Committee of AEV and AboitizPower, respectively, selects qualified nominees for election as directors. One consideration is the number of directorships a nominee has in other corporations or organizations. As a corporate practice, AEV  and AboitizPower  directors, including Independent Directors, are discouraged from sitting as directors in more than five publicly-listed companies (PLCs).\n\nExecutive Directors of AEV and AboitizPower do not generally sit on other boards of PLCs outside the Group, unless they have substantial interests in those PLCs or have been elected as independent directors. Both the AEV and AboitizPower Manuals require that the CEO and other executive directors shall submit themselves to a low active limit on membership in other corporate boards. In 2020, none of the AEV and AboitizPower directors sat in more than five PLCs.\n\nNomination, Selection, and Election of Directors 102-24\n\nThe Aboitiz Group believes that the nomination, selection, and election of directors are the fundamental elements of a well-functioning\n\ncorporate governance system. AEV and AboitizPower both follow a formal and transparent board nomination, selection, and election process to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are protected.  Any shareholder may nominate a director and independent director. The ESCG Committees of AEV and AboitizPower act as the nomination committees and oversee the selection of candidates for their respective independent, executive, and non-executive directors. In determining the right candidates for directors, both AEV and AboitizPower may use professional search firms and external sources of candidates, including director databases and professional organizations in the Philippines or abroad.\n\nThe members of the Boards of AEV and AboitizPower comply with the qualifications for directors found in the Revised Corporation Code, Securities and Regulation Code and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, related SEC issuances, and best practices in corporate governance. Considering that AEV and AboitizPower are involved in complex and highly regulated businesses, Board members are identified and nominated based on their wealth of experience, in-depth knowledge, wisdom, and capability to contribute to the long-term success of each company. The ESCG Committees of both companies, after rigorous screening of the candidates,  provide the final list of candidates for directors to each company's Corporate Secretary, for inclusion in the ASM agenda. This gives the stockholders the opportunity to assess the background and qualifications of the nominees before the actual ASM.\n\nEvery year during the ASMs, AEV and AboitizPower shareholders elect their representatives to the Boards by voting in person, by proxy, and - for the first time in 2020 - by voting in absentia . Proxy votes received by the Corporate Secretary of AEV and AboitizPower before the ASM are validated by each of the company's Proxy Validation Committee. The members of the AEV and AboitizPower Proxy Validation Committees include each of the company's compliance officer, its principal\n\naccounting officer, and the head of its internal audit team.\n\nAEV and AboitizPower both follow the rule of One-Share, One-Vote. Under this rule, any minority shareholder can influence the  Board composition by individual nomination and by the power of cumulative voting rights. The right to cumulative voting is a statutory right granted by the Revised Corporation Code. A director holds office for one year until his successor is elected at the next ASM, in accordance with the Revised Corporation Code, each company's by-laws, and the relevant SEC guidelines.\n\nVirtual Annual Stockholders Meeting\n\nThe year 2020 brought with it the challenge of an unprecedented global pandemic. Business activities worldwide ground to a near standstill as governments imposed tight restrictions on travel and social gatherings to control the spread of COVID-19. Faced with these challenges, AEV and AboitizPower each held - for the first time ever - a Virtual ASM. Despite the difficulties posed by the community quarantine restrictions, both ASMs were held on schedule, and in a business-as-usual manner, without needing to avail  of the ASM extension period granted by the SEC to Philippine Companies. The notices for the 2020 ASM, information statements, and the annual reports were also distributed on time to stockholders, through all available channels, including via quick response (QR) code, electronic mail,  publication in newspapers of general circulation, and through each company's respective websites.\n\nDriven by its commitment to practice sound corporate governance and guided by its core value of innovation, AEV and AboitizPower were able to provide an accessible and convenient venue for its shareholders to exercise their basic and inviolable right to elect their representatives to the Boards of Directors while remaining in the comfort and safety of their homes.",

In addition, QR codes for the AEV and AboitizPower  Information Statements were published on April 2, 2020 in three newspapers of general circulation.\n\n## Minutes of the ASM\n\nThe approved shareholders' resolutions with a summary of votes, the results of the organizational meetings, and the minutes of the ASM of AEV and AboitizPower were disclosed and posted  on their respective websites the next day, or on April 28, 2020. The minutes can be accessed in the Investor Relations Section of www.aboitiz.com and www. aboitizpower.com.\n\nConduct and Attendance at Board and Board Committee Meetings\n\nThe AEV and AboitizPower Board of Directors are expected to serve with diligence. In order to facilitate their attendance in meetings, the schedule\n\nfor the regular Board and committee meetings for the upcoming year is approved and circulated to members before the start of the year. Directors  are not only expected to attend meetings but to actively participate by providing valuable professional counsel, strategic guidance, and constructive feedback. The  timely distribution of meeting materials within five days before  each Board or committee meeting ensures the directors' active participation.\n\nDespite COVID-related travel restrictions in 2020, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards continued to discharge their  duties and responsibilities. Board and committee activities remained business as usual. Meetings were conducted through a secure videoconferencing platform that allowed  each member to interact and participate remotely. Like in previous years, meeting materials were circulated to Board members through a secure digital platform at least five days before the meeting. Meeting protocols were  regularly reviewed and modified for more efficient virtual Board and committee meetings.\n\nAttendance at Board and Committee Meetings:\n\nThe table below shows the attendance record of AEV and AboitizPower directors for the Board and Board Committee meetings in 2020:\n\n## ABOITIZ EQUITY VENTURES INC.\n\n|                      | ASM    | Board of  Directors   | Executive  Committee   | ESCG Committee   | Risk &  Reputation  Management  Committee   | Audit Committee   | RPT  Committee   |\n|----------------------|--------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Number of Meetings   | 1      | 7                     | 5                      | 2                | 2                                           | 5                 | 2                |\n| Enrique M.

It is equally important that all directors are aware of their duties and responsibilities, and provided with all the information needed to discharge their functions.\n\nThe AEV and AboitizPower Revised Manuals require every director to (i) undergo an initial onboarding session upon first appointment to the Board, and (ii) commit to a continuing professional training program (formal and informal) to be kept updated on recent developments in internal policies, relevant laws and regulations, and various business risks relevant to the Group. The Chairmen of both  Boards, with the assistance of their respective Compliance Officer,\n\nensure that directors and key officers comply with these requirements.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, the Aboitiz Group conducted, as scheduled, its Annual In-House Corporate Governance Seminar. The seminar was held virtually  for the first time  and the online platform provided a safe and convenient venue for the Group's directors and key officers, to listen to and interact with experts from different parts of the globe regarding current and relevant corporate governance issues. The webinar was accredited and the proceedings monitored by representatives from the SEC. In 2020, all of the AEV and AboitizPower directors and officers attended a corporate governance seminar in compliance with the SEC's Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nIn 2020, the directors and officers attended the following seminars and learning sessions:\n\n| 2020 In-house Provided Trainings / Online Learning Sessions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Date                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 Virtual Annual In-house Corporate Governance Seminar 1.

Each director conducts a self-assessment on the individual and the collective performance of each member of the Board and Board committees. In addition, each director evaluates the performance of their  respective Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Internal Audit Head, Risk Officer, and Compliance Officer. In turn, select key officers of AEV and AboitizPower are anonymously asked to evaluate the performance of each of their respective companies' Board directors.\n\nThe assessment forms are prepared and regularly reviewed by the Compliance Officers  to elicit relevant and valuable insights on the following assessment criteria: (1) compliance with best governance practices and principles; (2) participation and contribution\n\nto the Board and committee meetings; and (3) performance of their duties and responsibilities as provided in the company's Revised Manuals, Charters, Amended Articles, and Amended By Laws.\n\nIn addition, AEV and AboitizPower directors are evaluated by their respective key officers based on the following criteria: (1) business acumen, (2) independent judgment, (3) familiarity with the business, (4) active participation and effective challenge, (5) professional expertise and network, (6) value contribution, (7) embodiment of Aboitiz core values, and (8) reputation. Assessment results are presented to the respective ESCG Committees as part of the nomination and selection process of incumbent Board members.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code and the Revised Manuals requires that at least once in every three years, the conduct of the Board performance",

In 2020, AEV and AboitizPower engaged the Good Governance Advocates and Practitioners of the Philippines (GGAPP), an independent association of corporate governance practitioners, to support their  Board performance assessment exercise. The results of the assessment, as well as the recommendations from GGAPP, were presented and discussed at the ESCG Committee meetings on February 16, 2021.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n102-35, 102-36, 102-37, 102-38, 102,39\n\nThe ESCG Committees of AEV and AboitizPower ensure that the remuneration for directors and key executives is consistent with the Group's culture, strategy, and business policies. Remuneration rates are also maintained at a level sufficient to attract and retain directors and officers who are needed to successfully run their respective companies. The Group engages the services of independent remuneration consultants to determine the compensation, as well as any annual salary increases, for directors, officers, and team members. Guided by the Aboitiz Compensation Philosophy, factors such as individual and organizational performance, and inflation, among others, are taken into account to ensure that the compensation structure will attract, retain, and engage the best talents to contribute to the success of the business. Each year, the results of the study are presented and discussed during the first meeting of the ESCG Committees of AEV and AboitizPower.\n\nAEV and AboitizPower directors receive a monthly allowance of PHP150,000.00 each, while the Chairman of the Board receives a monthly allowance of PHP200,000.00. In addition, the directors receive a per diem for every Board or Board Committee meeting attended based on the following compensation structure:\n\n| Type of Meeting    | Directors          | Chairman of the Board      |\n|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Board Meeting      | PHP150,000.00      | PHP200,000.00              |\n| Type of Meeting    | Committee  Members | Chairman of the  Committee |\n| Committee  Meeting | PHP100,000.00      | PHP130,000.00              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn no case has each Board's 's total yearly compensation exceeded 10% of their respective company's net income before income tax of the preceding year.

The ESCG Committees also perform the functions of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees. In carrying out their  duties and responsibilities, the ESCG Committee is supported by the company's Compliance Officer, Chief External Relations Officer, as well as the Group Chief Human Resources Officer. These officers regularly attend committee meetings to act as resource persons. The chairmen of the ESCG Committees are the Lead Independent Directors.\n\nIn 2020, the Board ESCG continued to (1) review and monitor AEV and AboitizPower compliance with new laws and regulations (the Revised Corporation Code, various SEC and BIR issuances, among others); (2) review and update the Revised Manual to align with the best practices in the Integrated Annual Corporate Governance Report and the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard; and (3) ensure that the nomination, selection, election, remuneration, and assessment of each company's directors and officers are aligned with the Revised Manual. In the same year, the committees amended their respective Revised Manuals and Charters to establish a Board oversight and governance framework to promote and integrate the sustainability and corporate governance initiatives of AEV and AboitizPower.\n\nThe Audit Committees continued to provide oversight over AEV and AboitizPower financial reporting policies, practices and controls, and over the internal and external audit functions necessary for making good audit-related decisions. In 2020, the Audit Committee updated its Charter to improve the Company's control performance by having an adequate and effective control system.\n\nChaired by independent directors, the Audit Committees are composed of all three independent directors and two non-executive directors. Each company's Chief Financial Officer and Internal Audit Head, who performs the functions of a Chief\n\nAudit Executive, are regular attendees and resource persons at committee meetings.\n\nSufficiency of Internal Control and Compliance System\n\nThe AEV and AboitizPower Audit Committees assist their respective Boards in fulfilling  oversight responsibilities over their company's system of internal control. They are  responsible for monitoring, overseeing, and evaluating the duties and responsibilities of management, the internal audit activity, and the external auditors as those duties and responsibilities relate to the organization's processes for controlling its operations. In 2020, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Internal Audit Head of AEV and AboitizPower attested to the sufficient  internal control and compliance system of their respective companies.\n\n## Audit and Non-Audit Fees\n\nThe Independent External Auditor of AEV and AboitizPower is the accounting firm of SyCip Gorres Velayo & Co.

The Committee also reviewed the extent and nature of these services to ensure that the independence of the external auditors is preserved. The breakdown of the audit and non-audit fees paid by AEV and AboitizPower to their respective auditors are found in the companies' Information Statements and Annual Reports.\n\n## The Risk and Reputation Committees exercise\n\noversight functions over each company's (i) enterprise risk management and (ii) reputation management, including their respective corporate brands and communication strategies.

        "page_content": "## The Related Party Transactions (RPT) Committees\n\nof AEV and AboitizPower are composed entirely of independent directors. In 2020, these committees approved the Revised RPT Policy and Charter of each company in compliance with the SEC memorandum circular on Material RPTs. In addition, they continued to review and approve each company's CFO Guidelines on the Implementation of the RPT Policy, which requires all directors and officers to execute a certification to identify their related parties to be able to identify potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn 2020, AEV and AboitizPower updated the RPT Certification for Directors and Officers in compliance with  the Bureau of Internal Revenue Regulation No. 19-2020 on the reporting guidelines for the transactions of individuals and juridical entities with related parties. The RPT Committees continued to ensure that related party transactions are taken on an arm's-length basis and within market rates, with sufficient documentation, and coursed through the appropriate levels of approval. Except for the presence of the AEV and AboitizPower CFOs as resource persons, management is not invited to and has no participation in the RPT Committee.\n\nThe Executive Committees of AEV and AboitizPower were organized in May 2018 and are composed of five regular members, with at least two   nonexecutive directors. The committees were  formed to assist the Board in the management and oversight of each company's day-to-day operations and strategic decision-making during the intervening period\n\nbetween full Board meetings. The President and CEO of  AEV and AboitizPower are the chairmen of their respective Executive Committees.\n\n## GOVERNANCE PRACTICES\n\n## Disclosure and Transparency\n\nThe Governance and Compliance Team, as well as the  Board Secretariat,  of AEV and AboitizPower monitor and timely disclose any changes in the share ownership of their respective directors, executives, and key officers.  They also  ensure that trading blackouts are implemented at the right time and to appropriate individuals.\n\nEvery quarter, AEV and AboitizPower disclose a public ownership report detailing the extent of ownership of their respective controlling shareholders, including the shareholdings of subsidiaries and affiliates, and of directors and key officers. In addition, the two  companies disclose a list of their top 100 shareholders every quarter. They also disclose their top 20 shareholders, including record and beneficial shareholders owning more than five percent of their respective outstanding capital stock. Both companies, however, have no control over external shareholders who opt to put their shares under nominee holding companies such as the PCD Nominee Corporation, and are thus unable to make any disclosure on the details of beneficial ownership.\n\n## Shareholders with at least 5% Beneficial Ownership of AEV as of December 31, 2020\n\n| Shareholder                        | Number of Shares Owned (Record  and/or Beneficial)   | % Ownership   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Aboitiz & Company, Inc.            | 2,735,600,915                                        | 48.59%        |\n| PCD Nominee Corporation (Filipino) | 964,280,966                                          | 17.13%        |\n| Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc.     | 426,804,093                                          | 7.58%         |\n| PCD Nominee Corporation (Foreign)  | 370,452,359                                          | 6.58%         |\n| Others                             | 1,135,654,224                                        | 20.13%        |\n| TOTAL                              | 5,630,225,457                                        | 100%          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders with at least 5% Beneficial Ownership of AboitizPower as of December 31, 2020\n\n| Shareholder                        | Number of Shares Owned (Record  and/or Beneficial)   | % Ownership   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.

To ensure the strict compliance with this requirement, directors and officers are advised of their disclosure obligations during their onboarding with the Group. The Compliance Officer also sends out a monthly reminder to directors and officers to disclose their transactions.\n\nThe trading policies of AEV and AboitizPower prohibit any misuse of insider information. All team members are mandated to exercise prudence in handling material non-public information in the course of their work, and in relation to the trading or dealing with AEV and AP securities. Both companies strictly enforce their trading blackout and insider trading policy to curtail opportunistic dealings in company shares. Violations should be reported to the Compliance Officer and the Board ESCG. Since the last amendment of the Trading Policies in 2017, there has been no reported investigation of violation and conviction of insider trading, as well as abusive self-dealing by directors, management, and employees.\n\nIn 2020, there was no reported incident of non-compliance with the General Trading Policies.\n\nIn October 2019, the AEV and AboitizPower Boards approved the RPT Policy in compliance with the SEC Memorandum Circular No. 10 series of 2019. The new rule focuses and regulates only material RPTs or RPTs amounting to 10% or higher of a company's total assets. The new rule also specified an approval process for material RPTs and mandated publicly-listed companies to notify the SEC of their RPTs that breach the threshold. AEV and AboitizPower RPT Committees have the mandate to ensure that RPTs are taken on an arms'-length basis and within market rates, with sufficient documentation, and coursed through all appropriate levels of necessary approvals. Each company's current revised RPT Policy continues to  ensure that RPTs are conducted at arm's length and at market prices, and underwent the appropriate approval process.\n\nIn 2020, AEV and AboitizPower did not enter into any material RPTs  and there was no reported case of non-compliance with the laws, rules and regulations pertaining to significant or material RPTs.\n\n| Conflict of Interest  Policy AEV and AboitizPower believe that it is the duty of the Board of Directors to advance  the Group's interests and those of the companies' stakeholders. To this end, the two  companies  have each adopted a Policy on Conflict of Interest, which promotes an ethical  corporate culture and prohibits directors, officers, team leaders, and team members from  taking advantage of access to corporate property and proprietary information for personal  gain. The policy  requires the disclosure of relationships, actions, or transactions that may  give rise to a conflict of interest. In addition, AEV and AboitizPower directors are required  to abstain or inhibit themselves from any Board discussion or decision that affects or has  relevance or relation to their personal, business, or professional interests. The companies'  directors are also prohibited from engaging in any business that competes with or is  antagonistic to the Group. They must notify the Board, through their respective Corporate  Secretaries, before accepting any directorship outside the Aboitiz Group during their term. In 2017, the AEV launched its data privacy compliance program, which includes the   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Privacy  Policy In 2020, AEV initiated the integrated approach to information security incident  management, which brought together experts in such subject matters as  Data Privacy,  Information Security, IT Security, Business Continuity, Human Resources, and Legal.

In 2020, there were no reported  cases of non-compliance with the disclosure rules of the SEC, the PSE, and the PDEx. In                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The concept of balance between planet, people, and profit is not a new  concept on how the Aboitiz Group operates its businesses. Advocacy and adherence to environmental sustainability and care for stakeholders have always been part of the Aboitiz Way - living the core value of Responsibility. In 2020, AEV and AboitizPower officially established an ESG governance structure to integrate existing corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, and environmental sustainability programs. The  goal is  to create  an integrated approach in developing, implementing, monitoring, and communicating initiatives and results to the Group's  internal and external stakeholders.\n\nThe Aboitiz  Integrated Sustainability Report outlines the coordinated efforts of the Group's sustainability stewards and  applying  ESG principles to improve the Group's performance on team member engagement and development, corporate social responsibility, customer focus, disaster resilience, carbon emissions reduction, resource efficiency, renewable energy, waste management, financial growth, and financial returns. The Sustainability Reports of AEV and AboitizPower are available for viewing and downloading at www.aboitiz. com/sustainability and www.aboitizpower. com/ sustainability.\n\n## Transparency, Communication, and Sustainability Reporting\n\n102-32\n\nThe Aboitiz Group's governance framework includes the timely, complete, and accurate disclosure of all material information regarding AEV and AboitizPower. Information includes earnings results, acquisitions or disposals of assets, Board changes, RPTs, shareholdings of directors, and changes in ownership. In addition, the Group's Consolidated Annual and Sustainability Report, which is based on GRI Sustainability Reporting standards, sets out its values and governance model. The integrated report links the Group's strategy and its commitment to a sustainable global economy. Through the report, the Group is able to measure, understand, and communicate its economic, environmental, social\n\nand governance performance. From these, goals can then be set, and change managed more effectively. In 2020, the Board of Directors of AEV and AboitizPower approved the proposed governance framework needed to organize, cascade, manage, and communicate the Group's  ESG initiatives to its internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Rights of Shareholders\n\n102-21, 102-29\n\nShareholder rights are of paramount importance in the AEV and AboitizPower By-laws, Codes, and Revised Manuals. The goal is to ensure the protection of shareholder interests and concerns through the free exercise of shareholder rights. Among the rights of shareholders, regardless of the number of shares they own, are: to receive notices of and to attend shareholders' meetings; to participate and vote on the basis of the oneshare, one-vote policy; nominate and elect Board members (including via cumulative voting); inspect corporate books and records; vote in person or in absentia through proxy; receive dividends; and ratify corporate action.\n\nAEV and AboitizPower  believe that the rights and interests of minority shareholders are aligned with those of the controlling shareholders, not only in terms of returns on their investments, but also in the sustainability of the Group's businesses. Both companies ensure the timely disclosure to shareholders regarding their respective businesses, and that shareholders receive dividends in accordance with established dividend policies. The Board Secretariat has adopted certified Board protocols and procedures under the ISO 9001:2015 Management Board and System to ensure the effectiveness of Board and shareholders' commitments. This includes coordination with stock transfer agents to ensure appropriate responses and the timely resolution of shareholders' queries and requests.\n\n## Right to Dividends\n\nEvery year, AEV and AboitizPower pay dividends in an equitable and timely manner. All shareholders are treated equally, receiving an amount of dividends per share that is proportionate to their shareholdings. The period for payment of dividends is based on trading requirements or constraints of the SEC and PSE.\n\nIn the last five years, AEV has paid the following dividends:\n\n|      | Declaration  Date   | Record Date    | Payment Date   | Dividends per share   | Total Dividends  Declared (Final Amount)   |\n|------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 | March 6, 2020       | March 20, 2020 | April 3, 2020  | PHP1.30  (Regular)    | PHP7.32bn                                  |\n| 2019 | March 7, 2019       | March 21, 2019 | April 5, 2019  | PHP1.32 (Regular)     | PHP7.44bn                                  |\n| 2018 | March 8, 2018       | March 22, 2018 | April 12, 2018 | PHP1.28 (Regular)     | PHP7.21bn                                  |\n| 2017 | March 7, 2017       | March 21, 2017 | April 10, 2017 | PHP1.33 (Regular)     | PHP7.49bn                                  |\n| 2016 | March 8, 2016       | March 22, 2016 | April 19, 2016 | PHP1.06 (Regular)     | PHP5.89bn                                  |\n\nIn the last five years, AboitizPower has paid the following dividends:\n\n|      | Declaration  Date   | Record Date    | Payment Date   | Dividends per share                | Total Dividends  Declared (Final Amount)   |\n|------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 | March 6, 2020       | March 20, 2020 | April 3, 2020  | PHP1.18 (Regular)                  | PHP7.32bn                                  |\n| 2019 | March 7, 2019       | March 21, 2019 | April 5, 2019  | PHP1.47 (Regular)                  | PHP7.44bn                                  |\n| 2018 | March 8, 2018       | March 22, 2018 | April 12, 2018 | PHP1.39 (Regular)                  | PHP7.21bn                                  |\n| 2017 | March 7, 2017       | March 21, 2017 | April 10, 2017 | PHP1.36 (Regular)                  | PHP7.49bn                                  |\n| 2016 | March 8, 2016       | March 22, 2016 | April 19, 2016 | PHP1.20 (Regular) PHP0.46 (Special | PHP8.83bn PHP3.38bn                        |\n\nRight to Participate in Fundamental Corporate Changes\n\nAs a matter of policy, AEV and AboitizPower encourage the active participation of  shareholders in corporate decisions, such as amendments to  the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, appointment of auditors, and the approval of audited financial statements, among others.\n\nAt the ASM, the Board of Directors present and submit to the shareholders the proposed actions for approval. The shareholders are also given an opportunity to ask questions regarding the proposed actions during the meeting. Only upon receipt of the affirmative vote of shareholders representing at least 2/3 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each company, will such action be considered as duly approved by the shareholders.\n\nIn 2020, AEV and AboitizPower amended their\n\nArticles of Incorporation to (1) Article Two: include in the primary purpose the power to act as guarantor or surety for the loans and obligations of its affiliates and associates; (2) Article Four: amend the corporate term to perpetual existence, and (3) Article Seven: amend the features of the preferred shares. The amendment to Article Four was proposed to align with the provisions of the Revised Corporation Code on the perpetual existence of corporations. Meanwhile, the amendments to Articles Two and Seven were proposed to give AEV and AboitizPower the additional flexibility in their  capital- and fund-raising activities. The proposals received the affirmative vote of shareholders representing at least 2/3 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each company.\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the SEC approved the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation of AEV and AboitizPower.",

The  Committee  endorsed  for  approval  by  the  full  Board  the  2020  annual  audited financial  statements  of  Aboitiz  Equity  Ventures  Inc.,  its  subsidiaries  and  alliances.  Included  in  the  review  were  the Management  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  following  prior  review  and discussion with management, accounting, and the company's independent external auditor, SyCip Gorres Velayo & Co. (SGV)-member practice of Ernst & Young (EY) in the Philippines.\n\nThe activities of the Audit Committee are performed in the context-\n\n- \u00b7 That management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the financial reporting process; and\n- \u00b7 That  the  company's  independent  external  auditor  is  responsible  for  expressing  an  unqualified  opinion  on the conformity and consistency of application of the Company's audited financial statements with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards.\n\n## External Auditors\n\nUpon the endorsement of the Audit Committee to the Board which, in turn, sought the approval of the shareholders of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., during its Annual General Stockholders Meeting held last April 27, 2020, SyCip Gorres Velayo & Co. (SGV) was re-appointed as the independent external auditor for 2020 with Maria Veronica Andresa R.

The Committee further confirms that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the auditors have no personal or other impediments that would prevent them from objectively planning, conducting, reporting, or otherwise participating and reaching independent conclusions in their audit assignments in 2020.

        "page_content": "The Board Audit Committee is satisfied with the content and quality of reports prepared and issued by the internal auditors during the year under review.\n\nThe Group Internal Audit (GIA) remains to be the single-point-of-contact for the Audit Committee. It takes the lead in setting the standards, initiatives and overall direction of the group audit teams which, in turn, focus their reviews on the  top  risks  of  their  respective  business  units.  Except  for  the  banks  and  other  financial  business  units,  information systems and technology-related risks however, still remain to be an area covered by the Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. group information systems auditors.\n\nBased on audit reports and highlights presented to the Committee and with the contribution provided by management and other key leaders on the issues raised to their attention, the Committee concurs with internal audit's assessment that,  generally,  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the  existing  system  of  internal  controls,  risk  management  and governance allowfor a generally adequate management of identified risks and effectively supports the improvement of the management of the Company as a whole. There is a need, however, to improve and further strengthen governance and controls over the implementation of security standards for information systems and related technologies particularly in relation to cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn its meeting held March 3, 2021, the Committee brought to the attention of the board the seriousness of cybersecurity risks to the group. The Committee discussed the performance of a full independent external cybersecurity review for AEV in 2021. This was endorsed to the full board and approved in its meeting held March 5, 2021. Relatedly, learning sessions with management and the board on cybersecurity will be conducted to further complement initiatives of the company in this area.\n\n## External Quality Assessment\n\nThe Internal Audit team of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., after undergoing an External Quality Assessment (EQA) review by the authorized validators of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Philippines that are duly accredited by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International, received the official EQAR results in 2017.\n\nIt is the opinion of the IIA that on the overall, the internal audit team of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc., 'Generally Conforms' to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and the Code of Ethics for internal audit practitioners. Generally Conforms is the highest rating awarded in connection with an EQA and the internal audit team has been commended for this achievement.\n\nThe EQA, much like any global certification is not required. Acquiring it helps build the reputation not just of internal audit but of Aboitiz as a company that not only conforms, complies and follows but adopts and implements the Standards and best practices of the internal audit function. The EQA certification is valid for 5 years till 2022. Until then, internal audit will ensure that it continually works on its Quality Assurance Improvement Program and apply it across the group.\n\n## Review of the Audit Charters\n\nAnnual  review  and  updating  of  the  Board  Audit  Committee  charter  was  conducted.  Changes  were  discussed  by  the Committee in its October 28, 2020 quarterly meeting. The Committee endorsed the revised charter for full Board approval. The AEV Board approved the revised Board Audit Committee charter in its meeting held on November 4, 2020. The changes reinforced the oversight responsibilities of the Board Audit Committee in helping ensure excellence in control performance by having an adequate and effective internal control system, governance and risk management processes. It likewise include among its oversight duties and responsibilities the establishment of a fraud response plan.\n\nAdditionally, these changes are in compliance with the latest governmental issuances. The review and updating of the charters are done at least once a year, endorsed by the Audit Committee, approved by the Board and included in the report to the stockholders.\n\n## Self-Assessment\n\nThe Committee conducted its annual self-assessment in accordance with the guidelines of SEC Memo Cir. No. 4, series of 2012. The assessment result showed that it fully complied with the requirements set forth in the Audit Charter and met the necessary and most important requirements set by global standards and best practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe partnership between the functions of risk management and internal audit has remained solid. In order to continuously provide objective assurance to the board on the effectiveness of risk management, a joint audit and risk committee meeting is held at least once a year.\n\nPresented in the October 26, 2020 joint meeting are the top strategic risks, emerging risks and project risks that present a significant impact to the Company's ability to execute its plans, strategies and business objectives for the following year. These top risks serve as an input for the preparation of internal audit's master plan for the following year.\n\nThe joint meeting between the Board Audit and Risk Committees also provide an avenue to present the annual results of the Risk Management Plan validation reviews conducted by the internal audit teams across the group. The reviews give an assurance to management and the Board on the status of the risk treatments planned to address the identified risks for the year.\n\nAfter considering, analyzing and reviewing all pertinent information on the integrity of financial reporting, effectiveness of internal controls, risk management, governance and compliance within the Aboitiz group of companies, the Committee is of the view that, in all material aspects, the duties and responsibilities as so outlined in its Charter have been satisfactorily performed.\n\nOn behalf of the Board Audit Committee,\n\n(SGD) Jose C.

With the challenges we will face in the next 100 years, perseverance will be a necessary ingredient.\n\n'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNewton's First Law of Motion: An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. Old ways won't open up new doors.\n\n'\n\nSecond Law of Motion: F=MA. If you want to get an object accelerating in a particular direction, then the size of the force you apply and the direction of that force will both make a difference. Focus on the key drivers of growth and what matters for long-term growth and resiliency. Practice Polite Persistence. 'Transform values into actions, visions into realities, obstacles into innovations, separateness into solidarity, and risks into rewards.'\n\nThird Law of Motion: When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

It is the only thing.' - Albert Schweitzer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMikel Aboitiz\n\n'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur past 200 years have taught me that there is only one value that covers all, and that is trust. Trust is achieved with clarity. There is only one skill that really matters-the timely adaptation to change. In escalating disruption, they both matter more than ever.

Integrity, teamwork, innovation, and responsibility are embedded in us. Be aware that things will not remain the same as they are now. We must innovate, change and adapt to the times; doing things better, doing things differently. No one moves forward by staying in the same place.\n\n'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlance back, be inspired, and move forward.\n\n'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' Erramon Aboitiz\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo thrive consistently over time, we need to be at the forefront of driving change. As leaders, this requires us to get comfortable in the uncomfortable and the uncertain. It is from this place of uncertainty and discomfort that the ideas that will lead us into the future will be birthed. ' '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Fire is the test of gold; adversity, of strong men.'-Seneca\n\n## Ana Delgado-Aboitiz\n\nBe open to change even if it is uncomfortable. It is unnerving because things will definitely change: how we work, our businesses, our society. Always keep a level head as we, as a team, continue to learn, adapt, adjust, innovate, and execute properly. There will certainly be missteps and failures. Learn from it and move on. Remember to always celebrate the wins, even the small ones. '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' Jim Aboitiz\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRomeo Bernardo\n\n'\n\nAlways keep learning. Always keep innovating.

We will never know what the future holds, but as long as we keep an open mind and remain ready to evolve with the times, we will not only survive, but thrive and continue the Aboitiz legacy of advancing business and communities for the next 100, or even 200 years. ' '\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are not in a hundred-meter sprint but in a 100-year marathon, and this marathon will be run in relays. Each generation builds and strengthens the Organization.
