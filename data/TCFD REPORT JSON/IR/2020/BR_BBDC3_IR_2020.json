The focus on managing environmental, social and governance factors, along with a true contribution to sustainable development, has grown to make elements even more relevant and integral in our decisions not only as a matter of responsibility, but also as a business belief and strategy.\n\nThis was the year we revised our corporate strategy by establishing positive agendas associated with all of our businesses and focusing on the roots of our origins: client centricity. We have invested even more in technology to not only improve our communications, but to also expedite shifts in the way people interact with Bradesco to make it much easier.\n\nDespite the uncertainties in 2020, we also delivered strong results for the Organization, including a growth in our quarterly net income throughout the year, an expanded loan portfolio and a significant increase in the number of transactions through our digital channels - a situation that emphasizes the importance of providing the most convenient, modern, fast and secure banking experience for the client.\n\nWhile we already worked in a committed and responsible manner before, now we strive to be leaders of change in the coming 'Decade of Action', as the United Nations (UN) has been referring to these next 10 years. Over the following pages, you will learn how we put this strategy into practice. It's what makes us unique, and we have been working in this manner for almost eight decades through an ecosystem that is continuously improving.\n\nEnjoy the reading!",

But even within such a difficult landscape, we were able to find opportunities that, once again, made us reinvent ourselves through the perspective of innovation and evolution.\n\nWe reinforced our core mission - 100% focus on the client remaining always at their side during this time filled with considerable uncertainties. We believe in Brazil and in the ability of its people to overcome challenges and to create wealth. I can truly state that we are optimistic about the future.\n\nWe have paid close attention to social responsibility since the beginning of our activities, and the prime example is Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Bradesco. We care deeply about people's lives and the continuity of companies, and this has not changed during the pandemic. We continue to be mindful of the health and safety of our workers, employees and clients. We have intensified the use and availability of digital solutions in an effort to make sure that everyone can continue their activities in the midst of the restrictions imposed by this ongoing situation.\n\nIn 2020, companies and investors around the world stepped up their commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. At Bradesco, sustainability is a key component of our strategy and it has gained even more momentum over the last year. We have amplified our activities in sustainable finance and now exclusively use renewable energy and carbon neutralization in our business.\n\nIn 2021, we will take further measures to ensure that Bradesco's businesses generate even more long-term value for our various stakeholders and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as steering the force of innovation towards sustainability, improving the management of climatic factors in our business decisions, and enhancing transparency about our practices and performance.\n\nThe longevity of our business is also based on principles that are embedded in our daily performance, including prudent asset and liability management of the bank and the insurance company, as well as the pursuit of appropriate returns on capital for shareholders.\n\nWe believe in the power of the digital world and in the extensive use of data to optimize the customer experience without overlooking the traditional parameters: quality service and transparent relationships. The daily goal is to effect transformations and strive to adapt to a world in which paradigms are continually shattered. Today, we have a complete platform for all stages of our clients' lives with nationwide coverage and strategic points abroad, ensuring a physical and digital presence designed to support every type of client.\n\nOur goal for 2021 and the coming years is to use the power of innovation in traditional processes. It involves observing what we have done thus far and understanding clients' needs right now, but with a view towards the future. We have seen the evolution of humanity and we are committed to adapting our performance to grow along with it, thereby fulfilling our mission in the best possible way, while remaining within the ethics and transparency that have guided us thus far.\n\nLuiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "This year, surrounded by so much uncertainty, we came across new opportunities. We have evolved greatly and have learned many lessons, remaining close to our clients and continuing to play a role in the development of the country. We act quickly to ensure that our service is delivered while making sure to comply at all times with procedures prescribed for the health of employees and clients.\n\nThe client is at the center of our strategy, and this is embedded in our DNA. Based on our clients' needs, stages in life and dreams, we adapt and shape our growth. They are what motivate us. Each and every client is unique, and understanding their essence and their demands is essential in ensuring an effective and trusting relationship in terms of our product offerings, as well as the continuity of the business.\n\nThroughout the year, we provided financial and logistical support to a number of initiatives; postponed and renegotiated loan operations; and invested in using data to more accurately address specific needs while shifting towards using modeling by personas - mapping groups of client with similar characteristics. We work side by side with people and companies to minimize impacts during the most difficult periods. We continue on together, whether to reach our goals or to rise above challenges.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated trends that have already been taking place, like new developments in the use of digital channels. In 2020, 98% of transactions were done digitally, most notably through cell phones and the internet. This represents a 14% growth over the previous year. We have also made progress in credit collection and recovery through our digitalization.\n\nAccordingly, we have continued to pursue our strategy of innovation by driving 'next', our 100% digital bank; Bitz, the Group's new company that is active within the Brazilian market of digital wallets and payment accounts; and \u00c1gora Investimentos, which serves in a complementary and essential way in our portfolio. In addition, BIA (Bradesco Intelig\u00eancia Artificial or Bradesco Artificial Intelligence) is becoming a bigger part of the lives of users, the result of investments in technologies, algorithms and information.\n\nWe were also able to announce in 2020 that, for the 15 th time, Bradesco was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index - taking part of the World and Emerging Markets portfolios in the 20202021 cycle. Out of the 250 banks assessed globally, we ranked in fifth place with the best performance in Brazil for the sector.\n\nWe finished off the year with a recurring net income of R$19.5 billion. We posted a strong operational performance and we set aside provisions for loan losses throughout the year, thereby allowing our balance sheet to remain resilient in facing potential defaults generated by the pandemic.\n\nFor 2021, we will continue with the goal of combining environmental preservation, social actions and corporate governance in all our businesses - secure in the knowledge that we are on the right track. It will be a challenging year, especially given the uncertainties that still prevail in relation to the pandemic, as well as the economic and fiscal conditions of the country. But we are optimistic as to the opportunities that the future will hold and we will continue to watch over the financial health of individuals and business owners with an eye towards economic responsibility, a focus on business continuity, and the satisfaction of shareholders and our clients.\n\nOctavio de Lazari Junior\n\nPresident and CEO",

The review process listed the relevant topics according to our stakeholders' expectations. The methodology adopted covered Bradesco's strategic pillars; the analysis of national and international competition as well as of sector studies - such as S&P's Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Sustainability Accounting Standard (SASB Standard) for Commercial Banks and Investment and The Global Risks Report 2020 of the World Economic Forum -; and alignment with the 2030 Agenda.\n\nAs a result of this initial analysis, the list of topics and their respective sub-themes related to Bradesco's business had been revised. At the same time, with input from the business managers and a study of the sector, a mapping of the stakeholders who were queried to prioritize the listed topics was made. The guidelines in the AA1000 Standard of stakeholder engagement were used for this process. In total, there were around 400 interactions with the following stakeholders:\n\n- Senior management\n- Clients\n- Suppliers\n- Employees\n- Investors\n- Regulatory bodies and industry associations\n- Society\n\nThe survey was conducted between the months of November and December through interviews with the Organization's senior management, investors and regulators; and an online survey was used with the other stakeholders.\n\nIt should be noted that members of the Board of Directors and investors were also active participants in this process, demonstrating their full commitment and understanding of the challenges faced by the Organization. This alignment defines the pathways in the search for solutions that encompass all stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, we are active throughout the country.\n\nWe reach even more remote regions through correspondent bank network and the PAs. For example, our floating branch Voyager has been in the Amazon since 2009 and, traversing the Solim\u00f5es River (1,600 km round trip), it serves people who live in remote regions of Northern Brazil. Previously, these people had to travel to larger cities to make withdrawals and perform other banking transactions.\n\nThrough micro-credit, we provide information, training and loan access to encourage local development and entrepreneurship. We started offering this product in 2014.\n\nSeveral communities in the Amazon are involved in financial education and entrepreneurship incentive initiatives, conducted in partnership with community leaders and the Bradesco Corporate University (Unibrad). In 2014, we started with lectures and, in 2016, we introduced personal finance workshops for community leaders.\n\nIn the midst of the pandemic in 2020, new challenges emerged for the riverside communities in the Amazon. Nevertheless, Unibrad took on the Financial Well-being in Times of Crisis - FAS Leaders Project. Content is shared at the lectures on how to deal with the pains and complexity of the times; to make the right choices; plan and control accounts; and tips and information channels.\n\n## Amazon Plan\n\nBradesco, Ita\u00fa and Santander have formed an unprecedented partnership to draft the Amazon Plan, a set of 10 measures focused on promoting environmental conservation and the development of the bioeconomy in the biome, investments in sustainable infrastructure, and to guarantee the basic rights of the Amazonian population.\n\nThe experience of coping with Covid-19 served as the inspiration for developing this broader and longer-term agenda. The pandemic has revealed the enormous potential that banks and the overall business sector have in working jointly to solve problems that are bigger than their day-today business schedule.\n\nComing up with solutions for a region with so many contrasts and such complexity will only be achieved from coordinated actions between companies, civil society and government agencies.

Moreover, the code also now includes the guidelines that are intended to apply to the relationship with the different stakeholders, public agents and politically exposed people.\n\nIn order to safeguard and reinforce the importance of the issue at the Organization, we are equipped with the Grupo Bradesco Seguros' Code of Ethical Conduct, the Purchasing Professional, the Auditors and Inspectors and the Bradesco Organization's Financial and Capital Markets Professional.

These guidelines define the global objectives related to the topic, which are broken down into goals and limits that need to be fulfilled by the risk management business units, which lends support to management on monitoring these risks.\n\nOur governance model also includes policies, standards and procedures that establish the basic operational guidelines determined by senior management in accordance with our standards of integrity and ethical values; and according to the nature of our operations and the complexity of products and services. They are also reviewed at least once a year by the Board of Directors and made available to all employees and related companies through the corporate intranet.\n\nIn addition, we employ consistent processes (methodologies, models and tools for measurement and control) to proactively identify, measure, track and report risks so that they are prevented or mitigated.\n\nThe Organization monitors and controls the sufficiency of capital and liquidity in order to comply with both the minimum regulatory levels (established by the Central Bank of Brazil and disclosed quarterly in the Risk Management Report Pillar 3, available at: banco.bradesco/ri) and the Risk Appetite levels (buffers) defined and approved by the Board of Directors. This process relies on the use of stress test scenarios to help calibrate and define the buffers.\n\nIn addition to enhancing and promoting knowledge about the Organization's risk profile, the stress tests play a role in anticipating potential weaknesses, mitigating stressful situations and assessing their impacts on the business. We also offer a Business Continuity Management (GCN) program, which provides guidance to departments on the ongoing planning of responses to incidents that may cause a disruption in our activities, thereby mitigating possible impacts.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nThe Organization strives to continuously improve the process for managing emerging risks - which includes identifying, assessing and monitoring themes - seeking to properly manage risks and permitting preventive measures to be taken to prevent them from occurring, minimizing their adverse effects and maximizing opportunities.",

Included in this context is the solvency ratio, which includes regulatory risks, such as underwriting, operational, market and credit risks, in addition to the calculation of minimum required capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of this process, a calculation of capital buffer is conducted annually through the stress test in each capital installment through deviations noted in the key insurance and economic variables. There are also capital supplementation scenarios included, such as losses arising from catastrophic risks of the companies Bradesco Auto/RE (Vehicle/P&C); Bradesco Sa\u00fade (Health); and Bradesco Vida e Previd\u00eancia (Life and Pension Plans), cyber risk, strategic margin and other nonregulated risk scenarios. This exercise is meant to ensure a capital surplus to the regulatory amount that is consistent with the Organization's risk appetite.\n\nGrupo Bradesco Seguros includes an Underwriting Risk Management Policy, which, among other guidelines, ensures that the underwriting risk exposure inherent to new activities, products and processes is previously identified and properly assessed.\n\n## Socio-Environmental Risk in Insurance\n\nThe Risk Area includes a guideline for Socio-Environmental Risk that is intended to establish processes for managing socioenvironmental risks and climate change, incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria within the sphere of its activities in developing and offering its products and services and in managing real estate projects through identification, assessment, classification, control and mitigation of these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We understand that our negotiations only endure when there is trust in the business and when we know exactly who we are talking to. Remaining client focused is a requisite, an essential decision in all of Bradesco's strategies.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to always provide the best experience - whether in person or online - and ensure the highest level of satisfaction within our Organization. This is why we have a targeted and customized structure for our Individual and Corporate clients, while offering digital solutions that make everyday interactions between clients and the bank even more user-friendly.\n\n## Focus on the client since inception\n\nIt is worth pointing out that, at Bradesco, the focus on the client does not just begin with customer service, but also in the creation of products. Our mission is to further understand our clients' needs and offer products that properly suit each profile. For example, we decided in 2020 that it was not just necessary to offer national services, but that regional services at Bradesco Seguros were also fundamental. This led us to create unique products that are based on demand. Another example is the creation of a fun financial education package targeted at children and teenagers in nextJoy. Our idea is to offer a product that is tailored to a segment that is already a digital native.\n\nWe believe that keeping the client central means considering all the stages of their journey with the Bank. Starting from the creation and sale of products, a relationship emerges focused on their continuity and satisfaction. All processes increasingly use technology and are oriented towards understanding, supporting, maintaining and satisfying the client - ensuring they are always provided the best experience.",

As such, we provide selection and training processes and work with a number of affirmative actions, giving everyone a chance to follow their own path of professional growth.\n\nBecause of its importance within the Organization, the topic is incorporated into the Code of Ethical Conduct, the Human Resources Management Policy and the Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\nWe have established a robust governance for diversity and inclusion at the corporate level, helping to maintain the topic as a strategic pillar for our Company. The Sustainability and Diversity Committee is represented by senior executives at the Organization, including the President and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Diversity and Inclusion Working Group is made up of selected employees and focuses on strengthening the topic within activities and businesses. Sustaining the pyramid, Groups involved in Gender Affinity, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, People with Disabilities, and Ethnic-racial issues are composed of employees who volunteer to discuss, propose actions and advise on their respective topics, reporting to the Diversity and Inclusion Working Group that also include their coordinators.\n\nBrought together for the same purpose, Bradesco's HR Department has an area dedicated exclusively to managing Diversity and Inclusion. The Diversity Management team is responsible for making sure that groups who are underrepresented in the labor market can enjoy greater representation on our staff and are able to evolve in an environment that values real inclusion. The team operates primarily on four pillars: People with Disabilities, Gender, LGBTI+ and Race/Ethnicity.",

In 2012, Treinet Diversidade introduced our learning solutions that specifically address the topic. Currently, solutions such as Unconscious Biases, Growth through Differences and Diversity as a Leadership Strategy provide its participants with the opportunity to reflect on the topics. The latter is part of the Leadership Trail, an initiative that leaders go through at the time they assume their first management role so that they are able to make the best decisions when managing their teams.\n\nEven more, the commitment to transformation allows Bradesco to expand its operations, providing information, reflection and practical guidance to partners as well.\n\nThrough the English school Education First, we offer 1,000 scholarships to partner institutions for studying the English language in an effort to promote diversity and inclusion. The idea is to leverage the employability of minority groups and\n\nthose who are usually under-represented in the labor market. This includes people of color, people with disabilities, people in social vulnerability, trans-gender people and women in the technology field, an area commonly associated with males.\n\nThrough the FIA Employee Experience survey in 2020, we were named as one of the 100 Incredible Places to Work thanks to the quality of our people management practices, the excellent work environment, inspiring leadership and the sound management of our CEO. Among more than 300 companies that participated in the project, we were recognized in the category of Most Incredible Company in Diversity and Inclusion.\n\nThe excellence of our practices has also earned us acclaim in the Diversity Exam Guide, which evaluates and recognizes the best diversity and inclusion initiatives adopted by Brazilian companies. Our practices were deemed to be above average in the overall ranking and in specific initiatives for gender, race, people with disabilities and the LGBTI+ population.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through this program, we hire interns to work in different business areas. The Bradesco Corporate University (Unibrad) also takes part in the initiative, helping to develop young people's skills.\n\nSince its implementation, more than 450 young people have been assisted. Upon completion of the internship period, whenever there are open opportunities, the Organization recognizes those who performed well by integrating them into the staff. The effectiveness rates are excellent, reaching 80% in some classes.\n\nAnother significant project is Somamos - Diversity Inclusion Network. Resulting from a partnership between Bradesco, INFI-Febraban, The Ministry of Labor, Ambima, Faculdade Zumbi dos Palmares, Business Initiative for Racial Equality and others, the program is intended to provide free professional training for young people of color, expanding opportunities in the labor market.\n\nIn 2020, we participated in the FAZP Professions Fair. The fair promotes, provides and expands the social and intellectual training of students and participants. At our stand, visitors were able to obtain information on how to take part in our selection process and learn about career opportunities at the Organization.\n\nWe were also supporters of the AfroPresen\u00e7a movement and conference this year, a virtual meeting between public authorities, the private sector and national and international organizations to promote empowerment and further job opportunities for young people of color. We were present at all three days of the event! Our professionals inspired participants through panels on self-knowledge, career, leadership, technology, finance, accessibility and more.\n\nAt Virada da Consci\u00eancia 2020, an event that combines a variety of initiatives to promote and appreciate racial diversity, we took part in the Black Tek Fest - a tradeshow involving Technological Experiences, Innovation, AfroEntrepreneurship and Business, with lectures such as IT as an Opportunity for People of Color and Presentations on the Online Universe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In keeping with Bradesco's commitment to promote inclusion, all filmed advertising campaigns include versions with translation, subtitles and Libras (Brazilian sign language), in addition to audio description, in an exclusive playlist on Bradesco's YouTube channel. This ensures that the Bank democratizes access to the content of the brand for this demographic.\n\nThe Bradesco Qualification Program for People with Disabilities has run in partnership with Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Bradesco since 2010 and promotes inclusion, equal opportunities, economic emancipation and entry into and permanence in the labor market. Immediately after being hired, new employees begin the Banking Management course. Over a six-month period, they are trained in theoretical and behavioral elements, including practical activities within the network of branches. Throughout this period, they already receive compensation and benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn March 2020, we began a new class in the Bradesco Training Program for People with Disabilities in an integrated effort to learn more about the various areas they can join during their career at the Organization, such as Unibrad and the Affinity Group and Volunteering. In addition, new employees were given a tour of Cidade de Deus and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Bradesco so they could find out more about their stories and activities.\n\nWe also used the occasion to take new employees for a visit to the Brazilian Paralympic Center. The tour included a guide who showed off the facility and the sports activities, and connected employees in conversations with coaches and athletes. Later on at Unibrad, employees were able to share a pleasant conversation with a former Paralympic table tennis athlete, reflecting on the athlete's role in his training and competitions and the professional's role in the corporate world.\n\nMindful of the social distancing requirements due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our course was adapted to operate virtually.\n\nIn observance of the National Day of Struggle for Persons with Disabilities, Bradesco held the Eu Somo event, an initiative by the Affinity Group for People with Disabilities, Somar. The meeting\n\nfeatured a discussion with three AG member employees, educating the over 300 participants on how they can all build a more inclusive and diverse company together.\n\nWe also sponsor and exhibit at the International Expo of Technologies in Rehabilitation, Inclusion and Accessibility (Reatech), held biannually and regarded to be the top Expo for the sector in Latin America. In 2019 at our stand, we sponsored a space for inclusion, transformation, empathy and connection through chats with employees and attendees.\n\nTo aid our employees who communicate in Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) and are working from home, we provide interpreters to support meetings with managers. Interpretation using Libras also appears in relevant topics discussed on live streams. As a way to ensure inclusion, our marketing emails are sent with a link at the end of the communication that provides access to the content in Libras.\n\nSince 2019, we have been part of The Valuable 500, a global movement that encourages inclusion for people with disabilities in the corporate leadership agenda. In 2020, we received the People with Disabilities Distinction from the GPTW Institute as a result of our recruitment practices, assistive technology and accessible work environment.",

In addition, Daycare and Nanny Assistance can help to ease the double shift women need to work. Some of our main administrative centers have begun to include breastfeeding support rooms.\n\nCommemorated throughout the world, we are part of Pink October.

We invited all our employees to a virtual event called Being LGBTI+: From Stonewall to 2020, which discussed the most significant achievements and challenges of the LGBTI+ community over the past 50 years.\n\nOn that date, the launch of the online course LGBTI+ Community Inclusion and Career in the Labor Market was announced. It is available to all employees, and is intended to promote an understanding of the topic and raise public awareness of their role as a collaborator and citizen in relation to LGBTI+ issues, whether or not they are part of that community.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, we took part in the DiverS/A Event, formerly Reaching Out Brasil. Adapted for the virtual environment, the event featured lectures with experts and professionals, along with development workshops and mentoring sessions, often with the companies that hold a prominent role in the appreciation of diversity and the inclusion of LGBTI+ professionals.\n\nWe also remain supporters of the OUTStand movement, made up of companies in the financial market that encourage and engage in reflections on the LGBTI+ theme at their work environments, promoting diversity and inclusion.",

This is done to identify and offer our workforce a menu of diversified solutions that address each of these abilities, thereby encouraging activities for our employees' professional improvement and fulfilling the needs listed in the IDP.\n\nDURING THE PANDEMIC, WE OFFERED NEW DIGITAL CONTENT OPTIONS, ALL FREELY ACCESSIBLE TO EMPLOYEES AND AVAILABLE ON AN EXTERNAL PLATFORM.

In addition, it points out profiles that match strategic positions.\n\nThrough specific methodologies, processes are conducted based on a detailed analysis of the competencies and performance of the professionals who make up our workforce. We use a flexible career structure containing career axes, and the employee can obtain information on feedback with the manager and apply for a selection process for internal recruitment.\n\nBased on this information, the Human Resources Department and staff management establish actions focused on improving potential and enhancing individual and collective performance. These inputs are also applied in the succession process, in defining Learning Solutions, in the ongoing practice of feedback - when establishing individual development plans that both drive and guide new challenges - and in the actions directed towards engaging talent.\n\nOUR HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT, ALONGSIDE TEAM LEADERS, DEFINES ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON ENHANCING AND IMPROVING THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES\n\nThe competency mapping process includes all employees at the Organization, using personal interviews, group dynamics or an electronic tool. Implemented in 2017, management evaluates employees through a behavioral assessment, and the employees assess themselves. The evaluations provide reflection on their own competencies and, for those in leadership roles, an analysis of their subordinates as well. Annually, we make Competency and Performance evaluations available to 100% of the staff. Over 76 thousand Competency evaluations and more than 73 thousand Performance evaluations were completed. This ensured that the most recent employee data was available, helping to align the objectives and the direction of the teams' efforts.\n\nOur integra rh online platform has been available since 2019, allowing our employees to take charge of their own careers. The tool combines learning solutions that help prepare professionals to reach their goal and provides experiences and a repository for employees to tackle the challenges on the path they choose to take.\n\nThe platform contains concepts that are related to performance and competence assessments. Employees can include indicators for expected deliverables during the current cycle and the manager can view the team members' profiles and assign Unibrad content and courses to their team. Feedback can also be submitted to colleagues at any time, and users can participate in knowledge communities, search for job openings and apply for them through an in-house process.",

In its 40 self-owned schools located in all states and the Federal District, it served over 46 thousand students last year divided into basic education (early childhood education and high school vocational education), professional education, and youth and adult education.\n\nThe 2020 budget was R$680.3 million, applied to conducting and maintaining the institution's operations. The amount was also used for school supplies, uniforms,\n\nfood and medical and dental assistance for around 41 thousand students in basic education.\n\nAdapting on-site activities to the remote model, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Bradesco received support and partnered with Banco Bradesco and the four largest telecoms in the Country. This alliance provided free internet service to Foundation students so they could access the Education portal, the virtual rooms and the Virtual School.
