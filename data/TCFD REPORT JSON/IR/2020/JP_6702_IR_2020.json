        "page_content": "## Fujitsu Update: Current Status of Changes Targeting Value Creation\n\nThrough the transformation of its business model, the Fujitsu Group has taken bold steps to evolve considerably from the company it was just several years ago.\n\nRecent results demonstrate the success of these efforts to date, with Fujitsu achieving operating profit of more than \u00a5200 billion for two consecutive years and record-high operating profit and net profit attributable to owners of the parent in fiscal 2020 (the year ended March 31, 2021). We will continue to accelerate our transformation efforts to achieve medium- to long-term growth.\n\n## Reorganizing Group formation to accelerate transformation\n\n## Revising the Fujitsu Way with Our Purpose as its pillar\n\nIn 2020, we clarified Fujitsu's Purpose and revised the Fujitsu Way, which defines the principles of behavior of all Fujitsu Group employees, for the first time in 12 years. We are pursuing value creation unique to the Fujitsu Group by addressing the challenges of global society and enhancing empathy with the voices of global citizens.\n\nTo accelerate business model transformation and strengthen competitiveness, we have established new subsidiaries including Fujitsu Japan and Ridgelinez, streamlined system integration subsidiaries and research centers, and consolidated the Fujitsu Group's delivery functions. We are rebuilding our global business strategy around a six-region structure comprising Japan, Asia, Northern & Western Europe (NWE), Central & Eastern Europe (CEE), the Americas, and Oceania.\n\n## Transforming the business model from an electronic equipment and IT company to a DX company\n\nWe have spun off or sold our PC, smartphone, and semiconductor businesses to concentrate management resources on our IT services business. We are shifting our business model to reinforce our position as a leading DX company that supports the digital transformation of our customers.\n\n## Pursuing a new organization and human resources to create new value\n\nTo promote shifts in the Group's employee mindsets and organizational culture, we are building a new human resources and organizational management framework appropriate for this 'new normal' era. We will lead the transformation of our customers through example, further promoting DX internally with data-driven management and strengthening the ranks of people who can spearhead our DX initiatives, making our own transformation a guiding light for others.\n\n## Continuously strengthening governance structure to enhance corporate value\n\nWe are working to constantly strengthen our structure to promote effective governance that meets the expectations of our shareholders. Measures we have taken included ensuring diversity on the Board of Directors, appointing an independent director as chairman of the Board of Directors, and forming the Board of Directors with independent directors as a majority.\n\n## Earning the trust of stakeholders by acting as a responsible global company\n\nThrough Global Responsible Business (GRB), a platform for promoting sustainability activities, we are striving to earn the trust of our stakeholders by fulfilling our responsibilities as a global company and promoting initiatives that contribute to solving social issues.",

Our starting point is to work with our customers and other stakeholders to find ways to overcome the challenges that society faces. However, in order to build a relationship of trust with our stakeholders through the challenge of solving problems, we must have true empathy for the problems that society faces and for the demands for their solutions. I believe that repeating the cycle of Aspiration, Trust, and Empathy will lead to the provision of new value and our own sustainable growth.\n\nThe world faces wide-ranging challenges, including economic disparities between countries that have come to light as a result of the race to secure sufficient supplies of vaccines, climate change that is causing increasingly severe natural disasters around the world, the emergence of geopolitical risks including the economic decoupling between the United States and China, and the disruption of supply chains globally. Underlying my emphasis on the cycle of Aspiration, Trust, and Empathy is a sense of crisis-unless each and every one of us asks themselves how they can contribute to solving social issues and achieving the outcomes outlined by initiatives like the SDGs through our business, and seeks to take on these challenges, not only will the Group struggle to continue creating value in the future, but more importantly, the world will face increasingly dire challenges in the years ahead.\n\nThis sense of crisis really hit home with the outbreak of COVID-19. Our group has been providing services to local governments and the healthcare sector for many years, but",

This caused us to reevaluate our approach to date and was a moment of deep self-reflection.\n\n## Pursuit of the Fujitsu Group's Unique Value Creation\n\nTurning this sense of regret and crisis into constructive en-\n\nergy, we are focusing on\n\ndelivering value to customers in the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntwo business domains of 'For Growth' and 'For Stability.' With 'For Growth,' which represents the domain in which we contribute to the transformation and growth of our customers' businesses, we are promoting digital transformation (DX) to create new businesses using data, and 'modernization,' which involves replacing and upgrading conventional IT systems by shifting them to cloud-based services. In the 'For Stability' domain, we contribute to the stable operation of our customers' IT infrastructure through the maintenance and operation of conventional IT systems and the provision of related products.\n\nIn April 2021, as we entered the second year of our 'For Growth' and 'For Stability' business strategy, we also identified seven Key Focus Areas that will drive the 'For Growth' business domain. Of the seven areas, we defined three Horizontal Areas-Digital Shifts, Business Applications, and Hybrid IT-as the foundations of the digital technologies and\n\nservices that are essential to supporting our customers' DX. Based on this foundation, we provide services that generate high added value in the four Vertical Areas of Sustainable Manufacturing, Consumer Experience, Healthy Living, and Trusted Society, pursuing a cross-industry approach based on the ideal state of society and the issues that need to be addressed to realize it.\n\nThe examination of the Key Focus Areas began with a vision of the world in 2030, and we imagined the future of society and the activities of companies and local governments in that society. Next, we focused on the markets that are expected to show high growth by 2030. Based on this analysis, we examined from various angles how we can utilize the management resources of our group and whether we can gain a strong competitive advantage in the future as the markets grow.\n\nDuring this process, we thoroughly discussed what kind of value creation Fujitsu is uniquely capable of. As an IT services and software business with a large share of the Japanese market, the Fujitsu Group has provided services to customers in all industries, including manufacturing, finance, retail, telecommunications, and healthcare, as well as to the public sector, from the central government to local governments. Will we remain able to deliver competitive services in all of these areas in the future? Is there a way to make more effective and efficient use of limited management resources? What initiatives should be prioritized to realize Our Purpose? These four Vertical Areas are the result of such in-depth questions and discussions.\n\nDelivering value to customers in the two business domains of 'For Growth' and 'For Stability'\n\nKey Focus Areas\n\nP22-23\n\nP19-28",

        "page_content": "The 'purpose-driven organization' that I am aiming for represents new value creation aligned with Our Purpose that exceeds the existing business frameworks or 'silos' that have emerged in different teams' areas of work and surroundings. It is an organization that has a pervasive culture of creating new value. In other words, completely breaking free of thinking in 'silos' empowers us to create a purpose-driven organization.\n\n## New Services That Break the Bounds of 'Silos'\n\nBehind the setting of the Key Focus Areas is my belief that new value creation requires a new business vision. For example, simply expanding the options for purchasing locations such as physical stores and online stores does not mean that we have realized the vision of Consumer Experience as a valuable experience for consumers. Rather, to create value that goes beyond simple purchasing and creates a new experience that excites consumers, we must integrate diverse industries, such as supply chain management encompassing procurement, manufacturing, and the distribution of products right through to store displays, with finance, spanning such areas as cashless payments and point exchanges. To achieve this, we must first remove the conventional frameworks of industries, pursue value for customers and society, and envision the services that realize that value.\n\nThe 'purpose-driven organization' that I am aiming for represents new value creation aligned with Our Purpose that exceeds the existing business frameworks or 'silos' that have emerged in different teams' areas of work and surroundings. It is an organization that has a pervasive culture of creating new value. In other words, completely breaking free of thinking in 'silos' empowers us to create a purpose-driven organization.\n\nOne of the characteristics of our group is that we have a strong 'frontline capability,' which means that our business tends to operate in a bottom-up manner, driven by our industry-specific business divisions armed with highly skilled employees. However, if there is too much of a bottom-up tilt, it can create a situation where thinking that transcends\n\nboundaries and silos becomes blocked. By combining bottomup, frontline capabilities with Key Focus Areas identified from the perspective of Our Purpose, we can trigger a chain reaction and take on the challenge of creating new value.\n\n## Demonstrating Competitiveness through the Integration of Technology and Services\n\nA few years ago, when I was based in the UK, one of our customers commented rather frankly to me that 'Fujitsu's technology consists of different pieces. These pieces don't show all that Fujitsu can actually do.' If we compare technology to language, for example, I see this customer's criticism as, in effect, saying, 'Fujitsu may have the vocabulary, but I don't know what you are trying to say.'\n\nTo answer the question of what we're 'trying to say,' let's consider the example of the hardware business. This business represents an important asset for us to achieve growth as a technology group. This is because the technological capabilities we have developed through the development and manufacture of hardware are the source of our competitive advantage and differentiation from our competitors. That being said, the business of making products according to the specifications given by the customer as we've done in the past is just one piece of the puzzle. Only by envisioning the kind of value that we can provide to our customers and to society, and offering it as a service, can our hardware business and advanced technological capabilities remain a competitive advantage.\n\nThe recent launch of the 5G business, which vertically integrates telecommunication technology and services,",

Rather than delivering communication devices that meet the customer's specifications as 'pieces,' we first envision the services that are needed in the world, develop the hardware necessary for those services, and then provide them in an integrated manner with software and services. We will strengthen businesses that are born out of this kind of social issue-driven thinking.\n\n## New Domestic Business Structure in Full Swing as Management Policy Progresses\n\nThe Key Focus Areas define the future direction of the Fujitsu Group's business, but specific initiatives are still in their infancy. I will now touch on some initiatives that are already moving forward under our Management Direction, aiming to create value in the 'For Growth' and 'For Stability' business domains.\n\n## Rebuilding Our Global Business Strategy\n\nAside from Japan, in each of the international regions structural reforms to streamline the product-centered business portfolio, which consists mainly of the sale of hardware and its maintenance and operation, have largely been completed. However, the transition to a growth trajectory by shifting to the services business has been delayed compared to the initial plan due to the impact of the strict lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Europe, which accounts for approximately 70% of our international regions' sales revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, we are getting a good sense of the way forward, having started the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 in the black, and having seen gradual growth in services business deals in the Central & Eastern\n\nEurope (CEE) and Northern & Western Europe (NWE) regions. This is due in part to determined efforts being made in each region to implement the four measures-common global portfolio, account plan, offerings, and alliancesthat are the preconditions for the shift to the services business.\n\n## Strengthening Issue Resolution Capability in Japan\n\nApril 2021 marked the full-scale launch of our structure designed to strengthen our domestic business, which we had been preparing since the fall of 2020. Fujitsu Japan is a new company that brings together the technological capabilities and know-how of the Fujitsu Group to make proposals that will contribute to solving the social issues facing Japan.\n\nJapan's Digital Agency was established in September 2021 and is moving forward with plans to standardize the information systems used by local governments to handle basic administrative tasks. In addition, many Japanese companies are under pressure to review their internal operations and processes to make effective use of data and to address the risks associated with aging core systems. That makes DX, including the migration of on-premise systems to the cloud, an urgent issue. Fujitsu Japan aims to become a leader in DX in Japan by responding to the needs of local governments as they standardize their information systems and by providing solutions for corporate management issues.\n\n## Contributing to Greater Business Stability\n\nAs a counterpart to Fujitsu Japan, which makes proposals to customers, Japan Global Gateway, which also started fullscale operations in April 2021, facilitates 'delivery' of the contents of proposals through software development and\n\nWe first envision the services that are needed in the world, develop the hardware necessary for those services, and then provide them in an integrated manner with software and services. We will strengthen businesses that are born out of this kind of social issue-driven thinking.\n\nGlobal Business Strategy\n\nP20-21, 28\n\nFujitsu Japan\n\nP24-25",

This organization is the key both to improving the quality and speed of services provided to customers and to increasing the profitability of the Group's existing IT services businesses.\n\nIt has already been several years since the Group set the standardization of delivery and the utilization of global delivery centers as a management issue. The foremost mission of Japan Global Gateway is to break through the barriers of business practices and culture that have hindered standardization and the effective use of global delivery capabilities. With the determination to establish a model for service delivery, we have assembled a team of skilled and experienced system engineers (SEs), including managers who can bring about change.\n\nCoinciding with the full-scale launch of Fujitsu Japan and Japan Global Gateway, we transferred related divisions of Fujitsu headquarters to Fujitsu Japan and consolidated system integration subsidiaries into Fujitsu headquarters and Fujitsu Japan. We are strengthening our delivery capabilities by optimally allocating management resources across the Fujitsu Group toward 'For Growth' and 'For Stability.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are also focusing on strengthening risk management\n\nto prevent system failures and unauthorized access, which is a prerequisite for the stable operation of IT infrastructure. Based on sincere reflection on system issues that have come to light, I am directly leading a close Groupwide inspection to see if there are any internal management systems that have deteriorated over time, or if there are any practices that have not been integrated in formal procedures.\n\n## Becoming Our Customers' DX Partner of Choice\n\nRather than providing stand-alone technologies, products, or services, the DX that the Group aims to achieve means solving customers' management issues and envisioning the creation of completely new value together with customers. Our 'business producers' are tasked to lead the way in solving problems and creating value. We are fundamentally reviewing the sales activities of Fujitsu itself and Fujitsu Japan and encouraging employees in conventional sales positions to become business producers through reskilling.\n\nRidgelinez, a subsidiary that began operations in April 2020, already provides consulting services to about 300 customers to help them realize DX. For a consulting service that identifies and analyzes business issues through discussions with management, the spread of COVID-19 has created a very challenging environment, but the company is expanding its customer base while utilizing seminars conducted online and other online forums. Some of the projects linked to the company's services have led to business deals with the Company, and we look forward to medium- to long-term business expansion.\n\n## Achievement of Our Management Goals\n\nBy focusing on the seven Key Focus Areas, we will further accelerate our investment in growth and do our utmost to achieve our financial targets of revenue of \u00a53.5 trillion and an operating profit margin of 10% in the Technology Solutions business in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. In particular, we expect the operating profit margin to contribute to strengthening profitability once Japan Global Gateway gets",

We are now focusing on accelerating our initiatives toward the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.\n\nAs for non-financial indicators, we have recently set quantitative targets for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 for employee engagement and DX Promotion Indices. For the remaining indicator, the Net Promoter Score SM (NPS \u00ae ),* we are currently discussing within the Group with a view to setting a target value that is convincing from a global perspective.\n\n- *  Net Promoter \u00ae and NPS Prism \u00ae are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld, and Net Promoter System SM and Net Promoter Score SM are service marks of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld.\n\n## Transformation Is Never Complete\n\nTo achieve a breakthrough in delivering business growth, we need to eliminate various barriers that stand in the way, one by one. When we look at the future of society and pursue the ideal state of our group, many challenges still lie ahead. As the One ERP+ Project progresses, we would like to clarify the results of data-driven management and use them as a reference for proposals to customers and also establish causal links between financial indicators and non-financial indicators. With regard to Global Responsible Business (GRB) -our priority issues for sustainability-we would like to clarify the relationship with financial indicators more logically. In the area of climate change, we would also like to provide new services, including solutions to support our customers' climate change responses, as well as reducing\n\nthe Group's own greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, as a group we will need to support the sustainable transformation of our customers and society in order to realize Our Purpose of making society more sustainable. Acutely aware that transformation is never complete, I am becoming more and more motivated to promote it. Transformation that delivers sustainability will only become possible once our own transformation is realized.\n\nI see growing expectations for change within the Fujitsu Group and increasing motivation to promote change among employees. It is demonstrated in the high application numbers for the internal job posting system that we introduced to encourage staff to take on challenges and grow, and gradually improving employee engagement. The Group's DX project 'Fujitra,' which is spearheading the Group's own transformation, is also promoting a project called 'Purpose Carving \u00ae ,' in which employees are asked to identify and express their personal purposes. In such ways, moves toward the realization of Our Purpose are steadily spreading within the Group, with the starting point of empathy for social issues.\n\nTo achieve truly 'purpose-driven' management and medium- to long-term growth, we will continue to push forward with reforms. Expect more changes to come with the Fujitsu Group!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTakahito Tokita Representative Director CEO, CDXO\n\n| Employee engagement               | P35           |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|\n| DX Promotion Indices              | P36           |\n| Net Promoter Score SM  (NPS \u00ae )   | P35           |\n| One ERP+ Project                  | P34           |\n| Global Responsible Business (GRB) | P44-45, 49-50 |\n| Social Innovation through DX      | P37-40        |\n| Internal job posting system       | P32           |\n| Fujitra                           | P34           |\n| Purpose Carving \u00ae                 | P14           |",

Against this backdrop, the Fujitsu Group has defined its Purpose-'to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.' This statement reaffirms Fujitsu's commitment to providing even greater value to its customers through technology and proactively contributing to the transformation of society.\n\nTo realize Fujitsu's Purpose, we need to mobilize the thoughts and feelings of each and every employee to generate greater power and momentum. To this end, the Fujitsu Group is rolling out a Groupwide program called Purpose Carving \u00ae , an initiative that encourages employees to engage in dialogue and express their personal purpose in words. Through Purpose Carving \u00ae , we aim to reevaluate the meaning of work and life, carve out an individual's purpose, and at the same time, find where they overlap with Fujitsu's Purpose, providing the driving force for future change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to Promote the Fujitsu Way and Our Purpose throughout the Group\n\nTo promote the Fujitsu Way among Group employees, we are implementing various communication activities, offering a variety of briefings across different venues and media for all employees. To help steadily spread awareness of the Fujitsu Way, we have appointed Fujitsu Way promotion leaders at Fujitsu Group companies both in Japan and internationally. We have established a governance system in which the Fujitsu Way promotion leaders take the lead in promoting the Fujitsu Way throughout the year.\n\nFujitsu Way Meetings are held every six months by the CEO and Fujitsu Way promotion leaders representing each division as a venue for directly communicating the thoughts of Fujitsu's leadership, ensuring the uptake of the Fujitsu Way, and motivating Fujitsu Way promotion leaders. We are working to spread the Fujitsu Way throughout the world, including holding town hall meetings with the CEO and sharing best practices from frontline departments.\n\nCurrently, the management team is pioneering the implementation of this program and is in the process of rolling it out to all departments. In addition, we have implemented Purpose Carving \u00ae as part of the training program for approximately 1,600 new employees in Japan in fiscal 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability Contribution Award\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has expanded the Environmental Contribution Award, which was launched in 1995, to the more relevant 'Sustainability Contribution Award,' to commend projects at all Group companies involved in activities that make society more sustainable and for fostering mindsets and change in organizational culture to achieve this, aimed at realizing the Group's Purpose. Based on the criteria of 'Aspiration,' 'Trust,' and 'Empathy,' which are the foundational values of the Fujitsu Way, the Fujitsu Way promotion leaders and departments related to Global Responsible Business (GRB) promotion conduct the screening, and finally the CEO\n\nand the COO approve the projects to be awarded.\n\nIn 2020, the inaugural year of the competition, we received 127 submissions from Fujitsu Group companies around the world, with the Grand Awards going to 'Achieved the highest level of speed in the machine learning processing benchmark MLPerf HPC' and 'Faster than anyone else. COVID-19 Infection Control Team' while six excellence awards and 13 special awards were also given. These awards and good practices are shared widely within the Group to provide an opportunity to expand the promotion of sustainability.\n\nGlobal Responsible Business (GRB)\n\nP44-45, 49-50",

The operating profit margin improved 0.4 of a percentage point from the previous fiscal year, to 6.2%.\n\nWe are steadily expanding our earning power as we make progress toward achieving our financial targets of revenue of \u00a53.5 trillion and an operating profit margin of 10% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, the final year of our medium-term plan. Achieving these targets remains an ambitious goal, but we believe we can do so by steadily pushing forward with the measures we have already launched into motion.\n\nWith regard to the financial position, free cash flow (FCF) increased \u00a53.3 billion year on year, to \u00a5236.3 billion. As a result of profit growth, EPS increased 28.1% year on year, to \u00a51,013.8, while enhancing capital efficiency, as exemplified by the improvement in ROE of 1.6 percentage points year on year, to 15.1%. For EPS, we are targeting a compounded annual growth rate of 12% for the five fiscal years starting from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\n\n## Accelerating Strategic Growth Investments\n\nIn Technology Solutions, we are promoting business under the two domains of 'For Growth,' where we contribute to the transformation and growth of our customers' businesses, and 'For Stability,' where we contribute to the stable operation and quality improvement of our customers' IT infrastructure. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, we will step up strategic growth investments more than ever before to expand the scale of our 'For Growth' and 'For Stability' businesses and improve profitability. As for investments for value creation, we are promoting the development of global offerings that will drive the expansion of the services business and reinforcing Japan Global Gateway (JGG) to establish a service delivery model. With an eye toward the Group's internal transformation, we are investing in human resources development and the realization of data-driven management. We plan in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 to increase our overall investment for growth in the two domains by approximately \u00a560 billion from the previous fiscal year, to \u00a5100 billion.\n\n## Overview of Financial Performance in the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021\n\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, consolidated revenue was \u00a53,589.7 billion, a decrease of \u00a5268.0 billion from the previous fiscal year that reflected the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of one-off demand for PCs in the previous fiscal year. In contrast, consolidated operating profit and profit attributable to owners of the parent reached respective record highs of \u00a5266.3 billion, up \u00a554.8 billion year on year, and \u00a5202.7 billion, up \u00a542.6 billion year on year. This was owing mainly to steady progress in improving profitability in the domestic services business, as well as gains on business sales and lower business model transformation expenses than in the previous fiscal year. As a result, the operating profit margin improved 1.9 percentage points from the previous fiscal year, to 7.4%.\n\nIn the Technology Solutions business, a business segment for which financial targets are set in our medium-term plan, revenue decreased \u00a5169.2 billion year on year, to \u00a53,043.6 billion, due to the significant impact of COVID-19.

A typical example is JGG, which became fully operational in April 2021. This is an initiative to improve both quality and profitability by promoting standardization and in-house development and maintenance work and expanding development of software and systems at overseas sites. Similarly, one of the main objectives of the reorganization of Fujitsu Japan and SI subsidiaries, which also began full-scale sales activities in April, is to improve business efficiency.\n\nAs for investments for our own transformation, we are promoting our Work Life Shift initiative and human resources development to realize employee wellbeing, and we are continuing to invest in the One ERP+ Project to standardize and integrate the Fujitsu Group's global IT systems as a foundation for data-driven management. As data-driven management becomes more sophisticated, we expect it to provide great benefits for financial management.

Those targets are a crucial milestone as a promise to our shareholders and investors, but they represent an intermediate waypoint in the sustainable growth of our Group, and not the final goal. In addition to steadily implementing the measures we have already set forth to achieve our medium-term targets, we have also started initiatives that will shape the Group in 2030, such as the development of offerings in the seven Key Focus Areas that will drive our ongoing 'For Growth' initiative. We will continue to pursue rational financial strategies from a long-term perspective to ensure the sustainable growth of the Fujitsu Group.",

This shift is the Group's answer to the so-called '2025 Digital Cliff,' an expression used by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry that highlights the risk of a delay in DX due to serious problems including shortages of IT talent and the obsolescence of core systems that many Japanese companies are facing.\n\nAs partners realizing DX with our customers, we technology companies have two missions. The first one is to make valuable proposals that contribute to solving the problems our customer companies and society are facing. The second one is to build a new service delivery model to replace the multiple contractor structure* in the software and service industry that is distinctive to the Japanese market.\n\nFujitsu Japan addresses the first one of these missions.

In addition, we have established six area headquarters across Japan, and are developing offerings tailored to regional characteristics by leveraging the knowledge of the reorganized and integrated subsidiaries.\n\nJGG is addressing the second mission, the building of a new service delivery model to replace the multiple contractor structure. JGG is the core of this new service delivery model to standardize services and expand shared services. Under this model, JGG will promote the standardization of systems and software development operations, and will also be involved in the design, development, and testing of shared services in collaboration with the Global Delivery Centers (GDCs), the Group's overseas development locations. Collaboration between JGG and the GDCs will enable a speedier and more stable delivery of high-quality services than ever before and will also contribute to strengthening the mediumto long-term profitability of the Group's overall services business through improved productivity.

This pursuit is also the foundation and driving force in our 'For Stability' business domain, which contributes to the stable operation of our customers' IT infrastructure. The system failure of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's trading system in October 2020 was a regrettable incident that shook this foundation, and we would like to apologize again for any inconvenience caused to the concerned parties.\n\nThe OEM products that caused the system failure were quickly inspected after the cause was identified, and the review of the incident has already been completed. We are also reviewing the systems delivered to our other customers by verifying whether there are any risks or issues that have not been covered by previous inspections. In addition, we have established a quality assurance organization directly reporting to the CEO and are making Groupwide efforts to strengthen our framework for improving the quality of our products and services.\n\nPreventing recurrence of system failures\n\nP80\n\n## Region-specific Growth Scenarios\n\nWe are also making progress in restructuring our global business to achieve the financial targets for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, set out in our Management Direction. By the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we completed structural reforms to avoid losses in our global business. Currently, we are developing region-specific growth scenarios, incorporating the seven Key Focus Areas we set out in 2021.\n\nIn each region, we have almost completed the establishment of an organizational stance for deploying the four key elements of our global business strategy-a globally uniform portfolio, global account plans, global delivery, and global\n\nalliances. Our global offerings , for example, already include nine solutions. Together with the head of each region, the business units responsible for the development of these solutions set sales targets and investment plans, and review progress every month. Global accounts currently include 132 strategic global customers. Here, we are promoting the standardization of service plans we offer to our customers and are consolidating pipeline information for future orders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Achieving Management Goals and Setting a Course for the Future\n\nThe initiatives described so far will contribute to the domains 'For Stability,' aimed at the stable operation of our customers' IT infrastructure, and 'For Growth,' aimed at the transformation and growth of our customers' businesses, as set forth in our Management Direction. These initiatives are also a stepping stone toward the Group's growth in 2030 and beyond.\n\nIn 2021, we realized a new structure for R&D with the aim to leverage the development capabilities of cutting-edge technologies-as exemplified by Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer-in the seven Key Focus Areas and global offerings that will drive 'For Growth' and lead to mediumto long-term growth of the Fujitsu Group.\n\nWe will steadily proceed with medium- to long-term efforts aimed at achieving Our Purpose, while constantly monitoring the progress and results of initiatives such as Fujitsu Japan and JGG to achieve the goals of our Management Direction.",

The Fujitsu Group's growth strategy remains inseparable from imagining a better future for the world and thinking about the role we should play in realizing it. The needs and expectations of customers and society seeking change for the better will also offer new markets and growth opportunities. Based on this idea, we are now aiming for growth, focusing on social issues as a point of departure, and have specified seven Key Focus Areas that will drive business in the 'For Growth' domain under the new business brand 'Fujitsu Uvance.'\n\n- *1 Source: UN, World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision\n- *2 Source: IPCC, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis\n\n## Seven Key Focus Areas: Horizontal Areas and Vertical Areas\n\nThe seven Key Focus Areas are divided into two categories: Horizontal Areas, which are the foundation to support the offering of diverse services to our customers, and Vertical Areas, which are cross-industry business areas that relate to solving different issues confronting society.\n\nThe Horizontal Areas include three fields: 'Digital Shifts,' which support data-driven decision making, operations, and workstyle innovation; 'Business Applications,' which provide cloud integration and applications; and 'Hybrid IT,' which provides cloud computing and security services for customers' core systems. Within the three fields that compose the Horizontal Areas, we will make full use of the development and technological capabilities we have built up over the years to convert digital technology into value.\n\n## Significance of Social Issues as a Starting Point for Growth\n\nThe world in 2030 is expected to be a very different place from now. The United Nations estimates that the world's population will increase from 7.7 billion in 2019 to about 8.5 billion in 2030.* 1\n\nThe latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report predicts that global average temperatures will rise faster than previously expected.* 2 On the other hand, there is no doubt that the evolution of digital technology is going to make possible the impossible. The year 2030 is also the time frame for the attainment of the 17 goals and 169 targets set out in the 'Sustainable Development Agenda' of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

        "page_content": "The Vertical Areas consist of the following four fields: 'Sustainable Manufacturing,' which realizes circular, traceable manufacturing focused on the environment and people; 'Consumer Experience,' which enables payment, retail, and logistics to deliver diverse experiences to consumers; 'Healthy Living,' which supports the wellbeing of all people; and 'Trusted Society,' which contributes to the creation of a safe, secure, and resilient society.\n\n## The Value We Provide and the Technology That Supports It\n\nIn the following section, we want to introduce the value we provide to stakeholders and the technology that makes it a reality, taking Trusted Society as an example. Natural disasters pose an increasingly serious threat in many parts of the world, and pandemics present another urgent, ongoing challenge to humanity. The Group will contribute to mitigating and minimizing the impact of such threats through predictions made possible by digital technology. The solutions used for risk prediction include technologies to process real-time data sent from sensors installed in various facilities and equipment with ultra-high speed and large-capacity computing infrastructure, as well as technologies to visualize the dynamics of society as a whole as a 'digital twin.' In this way, we aim to grow by combining computing with our various other proprietary technologies and 'building new possibilities by connecting people, technology, and ideas.'\n\n## Accelerating Transformation Based on Key Focus Areas\n\nOne reason for adopting terms like 'Sustainable' and 'Trusted' in the names of two of our Vertical Areas was to present the value we offer to our customers. Another reason was to clarify the value we offer and to carefully select services and solutions that match that value. In order for the Group to remain competitive and grow together with our customers in an ever-changing market, it would be meaningless if we were to just refresh the outer package and keep all the same services we have been offering.\n\nTo demonstrate Uvance's presence as a driving force behind the expansion of the 'For Growth' sector as soon as possible, we are currently working rapidly to develop specific services, solutions, and service delivery systems organized and systematized for each Key Focus Area. We are also considering an organizational restructuring of the Group in order to achieve a better alignment between the Key Focus Areas and the organization and its human resources. To realize Our Purpose 'to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation,' we seek to provide real value to our customers and society at large by addressing social issues and seizing opportunities for growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, the need to create cities with strong child-rearing support, in order to encourage the younger population to move to local areas and settle down can be traced back to this decrease in population. FJJ will offer solutions to respond to such needs of local governments. For example, we proposed to use AI-based solutions in daycare centers to efficiently match applicants with centers where vacancies are available, in order to avoid inconvenient cases where siblings are separated and assigned to different daycare centers. Currently, there is also a need for systems that enable online medical care and online learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\nA\n\nThe Japanese government established a new Digital Agency in September 2021, and there are plans to establish and provide a 'government cloud' in the future. Business systems of local governments are also expected to be migrated to standardized core operating systems by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. How will FJJ respond to these plans?\n\nWe see this as a unique opportunity to make a significant change in regional businesses and propose solutions 'beyond standardization.' As a Fujitsu Group company with the largest market share in municipal business solutions, we will of course support standardization itself. But we will not stop there. We will propose DX using the resources generated by the cost savings through standardization. Solutions for basic resident registration operations and the childcare solutions mentioned earlier are possible candidates to start with.\n\nFrom a medium- to long-term perspective, we aim to solve social issues and create new value in areas such as 'smart cities,' which are often referred to as cross- or inter-industry markets. What is needed here is the formation of an ecosystem through collaboration with the government and partners from areas such as mobility, energy, and healthcare. By developing an infrastructure that connects the data in each of the domains handled by partners, we will support the provision of data-based services including transport on-demand and the expansion",

Although there are differences among companies, many medium-sized companies are painfully aware of the fact that they need DX to survive. We want to produce results with such medium-sized companies at an early stage, before focusing on municipalities, where it may take a little longer for demand to materialize.\n\nWe understand that it is not realistic to provide comprehensive solutions for all industries.

This is not surprising since the former Fujitsu business unit in charge of municipalities, education and healthcare, and eight former Fujitsu subsidiaries have been united under the umbrella of FJJ. I believe that my mission as president is to create an organization where our 12,000 employees with different backgrounds can feel comfortable as a member of FJJ. To achieve this, FJJ must create and present its own vision.

To share this vision with our employees, we introduced an evaluation system based on their contribution to problem solving. We also classified both business producers and system engineers as profit centers, and designed our management system accordingly. Customer relationship management (CRM) data also shows that employees are changing their mindsets and are more active in making proposals to solve problems rather than just acquiring immediate orders from customers.\n\n## What are FJJ's goals?\n\nAchieving the Fujitsu Group's financial targets will require us to aim for an operating profit margin of 10% for FJJ on a non-consolidated basis in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. However, this is not our final goal. Our mission and final goal is to solve the problems of Japan's local communities and to be a leader in DX for FJJ's tens of thousands of customers.

In cooperation with the Global Delivery Centers (GDCs), these specialists function as the execution force for the design, manufacturing, and testing of IT services, as well as the operation and maintenance of systems.\n\nThe initial goal of JGG was to expand the use of the GDCs in software development and system integration work. It had a relatively limited role as an intermediary responsible for the standardization of tasks between Japanese engineers and the GDCs. However, JGG now has the much larger mission to build a new service delivery model, and the scope is expanding.\n\nCan you tell us more about the enlarged scope? What do you mean by 'building a new service delivery model'?\n\nThe Group's domestic business has traditionally been centered on the development and operation of custom-made IT systems for each customer company. This means, for example, that the architecture selection processes, the quality assurance system, the system for training and enhancing the skills of engineers, and the management structure have been developed in accordance with the conventional business model. Establishing a service delivery\n\nmodel means structurally reforming the existing system to fit the new delivery model.\n\nWhen we delve into the domestic business strategy of expanding shared services, we find that not only do we need to unify the 'what,' the content of the service, but we also need to unify the 'how,' the structure that enables the service. Based on this recognition, structural reform of service delivery was also brought within JGG's scope.\n\nThe structural reform of service delivery involves the consolidation of human resources as well as the consolidation and standardization of services. Up to now, services were provided in a vertical structure by each business group, but with this structural reform, organizational barriers have been removed and the services have been consolidated into JGG.\n\n## What is the current state of progress with the role assigned to JGG?\n\nFirst, we are steadily expanding the use of the GDCs. As of July 2021, the number of GDC employees engaged in IT services for the Japanese market had already doubled compared with the same period last year. The number of engineers working on services for Japan at the GDCs is also expected to expand to approximately 9,000 by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, compared with an annual average of 3,000 until last year.\n\nSecond, we are building a new service delivery model, working on specific initiatives in accordance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The top-down approach to promoting change is fostering an energy that is clearly dif ferent from that of our reforms in the past.'\n\nKatsuhiro Uramoto\n\nCorporate Executive Officer Head of Japan Global Gateway",

As of October 2021, we had 3,800 engineers, including engineers who belonged to the business groups of Fujitsu's head office and engineers from system integration subsidiaries that were integrated into Fujitsu's head office as a result of the strategic group formation reorganization. The number of employees is expected to increase to approximately 7,000 by April 2022.\n\nIf the scope of JGG changes and the domestic structure is enhanced to such an extent, is there not a possibility that the initial objective of expanding the use of the GDCs will be given less priority?\n\nI don't mean to diminish the use of the GDCs at all. Contributing to improving productivity in the services business is a priority for JGG, and we are currently increasing our hiring, especially in India and the Philippines, to achieve our goal of having 9,000 employees at the GDCs by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. In terms of profit contribution,\n\nwe have set a target of raising profits by \u00a520 billion from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, by combining JGG, FJJ, and the reorganization of the overall Group formation.\n\n## The standardization of services the Fujitsu Group has been working on over the past few years is growing rapidly under JGG. What are the reasons for this?\n\nI think the biggest factor is the commitment of the management team to this reform. The management has directly shared the message within the Group that this structural reform is an indispensable measure for creating the future of Fujitsu. As a result, senior managers with the same aspirations and awareness are gathering at JGG. This top-down approach to promoting change is fostering an energy that is clearly different from that of our reforms in the past.\n\nIn addition, I would like to mention two points regarding the perspective of these measures. First, we have standardized design, development, and testing operations to a different level than before. Second, we have created a pool of talent around a system that we have named the 'shared service model.'\n\nRegarding the first point, we subdivided the series of tasks into smaller ones and thoroughly clarified them. If we eliminate ambiguity in the tasks, the members of the GDCs who are not familiar with the culture of Japanese IT services, and therefore not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\nA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\nA\n\nproficient in 'reading between the lines' of IT development, would be able to clearly understand what needs to be done and to what extent. This is also helping us to visualize project progress management. As for the second point, the 'shared service model,' Japanese engineers from JGG and engineers from the GDCs are pooled together in pairs within the team to deliver services for SAP systems, for example, and to provide the same service to different customers. Compared to the traditional way of assigning GDC engineers to a specific customer or project, we become able to deliver service with great speed. From the customer's point of view, the advantage is that skilled members are assigned to the project, and the customer can always receive speedy service at a stable quality.\n\n## Please tell us about JGG's future challenges and vision.\n\nI am proud to say that JGG is a unit that is at the forefront of diversity and inclusion (D&I) in the Fujitsu Group. Japan is expected to face a shortage of IT talent by 2025, so promoting D&I is of the utmost importance. In addition to contributing to the growth of the Group, I want to pave the way for new practices in the IT sector by shaking up the old structure in which Japanese men were responsible for most of the IT service delivery in Japan, and accumulate best practices originating in Japan as a standard bearer of a new delivery model.",

We are currently developing the final details around the services that will make up our global portfolio and their deployment in each region, under Enterprise Infrastructure Services Solutions (EISS) and Enterprise Business Applications (EBAS), and we plan to start providing specific service offerings for customers from autumn 2021.\n\nEISS will focus on services around Hybrid IT, Work Life Shift, Enterprise Cyber Security, and our Microsoft alliance to meet our customers' needs, including the migration from on-premise to cloud. In the area of Hybrid IT, for example, we are unifying the content and methods of services, while\n\nWe will provide a global portfolio that integrates the most outstanding technologies and know-how of the Fujitsu Group globally to drive sustainable growth in the services business.\n\nTim White\n\nCorporate Executive Officer\n\nHead of Global Services Business Group, Global Solutions Business\n\nleveraging the experience each region has in providing cloud solutions as well as expanding the use of our Global Delivery Centers (GDCs) in delivery. In addition, with our cybersecurityrelated services, which have established a strong position in the Australian, Japanese, and UK markets, we are consolidating our know-how in our 'Centers of Excellence' and strengthening reference functions in each region.\n\nEBAS provides services related to the implementation and integration of SAP, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Fujitsu applications, helping customers to enhance their workflow and data analysis while flexibly incorporating the partner ecosystem. With SAP, for example, we have an extensive track record of service in Japan, as well as in Asia and in parts of Europe, namely Finland. We also have a particularly strong client base in the manufacturing sector. Looking ahead, EBAS will focus on strengthening our service capabilities and developing our global portfolio by leveraging the experience and knowledge from our Japanese business, looking to expand to other regions\n\nand across other industry sectors. With ServiceNow, which is achieving impressive results as a pillar of Fujitsu's IT service management in Northern & Western Europe (NWE), we plan to apply the know-how we have in Europe to Japan, anticipating the growth of this area in the Japanese market. We are also expanding ServiceNow to be a platform beyond IT service management and to address both employee and customer experience workflows.\n\nI believe the development of global offerings will allow an increasingly efficient investment in service development, and will also help the Fujitsu Group enhance its competitive advantage. We will also review our go-to market and business approach accordingly with a view to increase shared services, contributing to Fujitsu's Groupwide transformation under Project Fujitra.

Digital transformation will be the growth driver of the Fujitsu Group. In other words, we will grow by helping customers transform and grow their businesses. To build the necessary capabilities, we need personnel who can identify issues and think and act independently. The development of such personnel is the objective of the human resources strategy that we are currently pursuing.\n\nOur previous business model was based on madeto-order construction of IT systems for our customers, which called for the provision of services in accordance with given specifications. Although indispensable for the construction of stable systems, I think this role put us in a slightly passive position. Therefore, we believe that our human resources strategy must change to reflect the Group's future business model.\n\nWhat specific measures are you taking to encourage employees to think and act independently?\n\nIn 2020, we launched a series of measures aimed at realizing new workstyles and reforming organizational and human resources management, which we\n\nreferred to as our 'Work Life Shift' initiative. In particular, the expansion of our internal job posting system and the introduction of job-based human have emerged as important factors in encouraging\n\nresources management to underpin the system employees to independently add to their skill sets and take on new challenges.\n\nThe introduction of job-based human resources management means a shift from the conventional approach of membership-based human resources management-in which the emphasis is on how to utilize the talent currently available-to a strategic approach to talent and organizational design in which the focus is on the type of human resources needed to execute business strategies.\n\nExpanding and enhancing the internal job posting system has also markedly changed the relationship between the Group and its employees. Employees have far more opportunities to take the initiative in searching for and selecting positions advertised in-house, acquiring new skills as needed, and pursuing ambitious goals. Rather than management unilaterally deciding on the training and assignment of employees, the employees can now learn and build their careers proactively.\n\nInternal job posting system\n\nP32\n\nJob-based human resources management\n\nP32\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The introduction of job-based human resources management means a shift to an approach focused on talent and organizational design.'",

For example, more than 1,350 employees from across the Fujitsu Group responded to a recruitment drive for new managers in October 2020, and approximately 750 of the applicants received promotions to managerial positions. In addition, as of June 2021, nearly 2,900 employees had applied for open inhouse positions, with more than 750 employees assuming new positions as a consequence.\n\nIn total, at least 1,500 personnel have transferred, demonstrating that employees have taken the management's seriousness about change on board. Moreover, those who have not yet applied for the advertised positions have expressed an interest in taking up the challenge in the future and developing their skills to this end. Overseas, Group company employees have asked for more information so that they can pursue their ambitions by applying for in-house positions. Through 'Fujitsu VOICE' , a program for collecting employee feedback, we are able to receive employees' frank evaluations of measures in a timely manner and utilize the information to improve the systems that we have introduced.\n\nThe internal recruitment system is invigorating not only individual employees but the organization as a whole. To attract talent through the system, divisions must make themselves more appealing. Naturally, the engagement of existing division members will\n\nalso come under scrutiny. If managers want to attract personnel or retain existing personnel, they have to create environments where employees can take on challenges. To encourage the creation of such environments, one-on-one dialogues between managers and their subordinates are held Groupwide. Also, we are creating systems to ensure highquality communication even when the participants are in different locations.\n\n'Fujitsu VOICE'\n\nP36\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\nAs well as the personnel assignment system, you have changed the personnel evaluation system. How exactly has it changed?\n\nWe have emphasized linking personnel evaluation and Our Purpose. Creating an organization that is strongly focused on Our Purpose cannot be accomplished simply by the senior management team taking the lead in setting a direction for the Group. We believe the establishment of a vision that both managers and personnel from each division and Group company can relate to and endeavor to realize is also necessary. With this in mind, we have introduced a system that evaluates employees' contribution to the realization of our vision.\n\nSpecifically, for senior officers worldwide, we have adopted a common 'balanced scorecard'* to evaluate beneficial impact on Our Purpose, the tackling of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\nGRB\n\nP44-45, 49-50\n\ntransformation tasks, contribution to financial and non-financial indicators, initiatives under the Global Responsible Business (GRB) platform, and performance in relation to indicators. For the management rank below senior officers, targets are broken down into numerical values, and beneficial impacts rather than the degrees of achievement are evaluated.\n\nThe Fujitsu Group is promoting diversity, inclusion, and wellbeing under the GRB platform. What is the relationship between this platform and the Work Life Shift initiative?\n\nSince the Work Life Shift initiative contributes to employee wellbeing and promotes diversity and inclusion within the Group, we are of course seeking synergies between this initiative and the GRB platform. The platform represents the Fujitsu Group's commitment as a global company and forms the basis of business management. Meanwhile, as Work Life Shift is part of efforts by the Group to transform itself, the initiative occupies a different position and is linked to business strategies. However, the common goal of the initiative and platform is to realize Our Purpose.",

        "page_content": "## Progress in Human Resources and Organizational Transformation\n\n## Work Life Shift\n\n## Expansion of the Internal Job Posting System\n\nIn 2020, the Fujitsu Group launched its Work Life Shift initiative, which aims to realize employee wellbeing in the 'new normal' era by transitioning from a focus solely on work to a view of work and lifestyle as part of an integrated whole. We are promoting this initiative based on three key approaches. The first one, 'Smart Working,' enables employees to choose flexible workstyles fitted to particular types of work, objectives, or lifestyles. The second approach, which we call 'Borderless Office,' encourages location-flexible workstyles and the development of comfortable office environments that are conducive to creativity. The third one, 'Culture Change,' will transform our corporate culture through human resources management based on high degrees of employee autonomy and mutual trust.\n\nIn 2020, Fujitsu launched an internal job posting system by expanding the existing in-house recruitment system. Within the system, any Group employee can apply via a Groupwide intranet site for vacant in-house positions. The system encourages employees who want to seek new challenges in a new work environment by providing valuable information on positions and results of employee engagement surveys for each division on the intranet. The system is encouraging healthy competition of talent among the Fujitsu Group, with some divisions adding videos or presentation slides to their job offerings to give overviews of their divisions and illustrate the rewards and growth opportunities that they offer. The internal job posting system has revitalized the entire Fujitsu Group as the increase in transfers and personnel mobility is strengthening cross-divisional exchanges, which in turn generates collaboration among different business divisions.\n\n## Introduction of Job-based Human Resources System\n\nEmployee engagement\n\nP35\n\n## Better Communication through One-on-One Dialogues\n\nFujitsu employs Groupwide one-on-one meetings between managers and their subordinates in order to encourage in-house communication. We realize how important it is for employees to be able to consult with their superiors about growth opportunities and future careers, receive appropriate advice, and gain an understanding of the mission of their division and the role they are expected to play over the medium and long term in order to realize their full potential. In addition, these dialogues have a highly positive impact on employee engagement and on the clarification of Fujitsu's Purpose as they give the supervisors and their subordinates the opportunity to take a step back from their daily reporting and consultation routine in order to discuss and clarify common visions.\n\nAmong the three approaches mentioned above, the 'Culture Change' approach seeks to align Fujitsu's human resources strategy and organizational design with its business strategy and also to innovate the current human resources system to promote a diversification of career options. The driver of 'Culture Change' is a job-based human resources system that assigns the right people to the right jobs. To achieve such a system, it is important to determine clear job descriptions in terms of responsibilities, skills, and activities based on globally unified standards and rankings. Fujitsu introduced a job-based human resources system for managers in Japan in 2020, and plans to establish a common Groupwide global system by applying this system to all Group employees.",

The Fujitsu Learning Experience, an on-demand platform in cooperation with Udemy, one of the world's largest online video learning platforms, offers employees a lineup of approximately 8,800 courses-accessible at any time and any place. Using this new platform, employees can register for their aspired positions and then receive recommendations on suitable e-learning courses. In this way, employees can acquire necessary skills and knowledge in order to prepare for challenging, new positions. The platform also provides content that aims to inspire employees' ambitions like 'Edge Talk,' where experts from inside and outside the Fujitsu Group talk about learning and their experiences.\n\n## Strengthening Human Resources to Lead Digital Transformation\n\nAs part of the digital transformation project 'Fujitra,' we are training all 130,000 Group employees with the skills and knowledge required to be a driver of digital transformation. Fujitsu has defined common skills and knowledge in three areas as 'digital transformation (DX) literacy': 'Agile Methodology,' 'Data Sciences,' and 'Design Thinking.' Based on this system, Fujitsu is developing training courses where employees can acquire the necessary practical skills to nurture human resources able to drive digital transformation. By focusing on these three areas-'Agile Methodology,' used for the development of systems and software, 'Data Sciences,' related to digital technologies, and 'Design Thinking,' an approach used by designers to develop new services and create innovation-we aim to expand our business in order to create new value and realize Our Purpose.\n\nThe Fujitsu Group aims to create value in the two business domains 'For Growth' and 'For Stability.' To this end, Fujitsu has revised conventional practices where sales personnel were assigned to specific industries and accounts in our domestic business and redefined the staff's role as 'business producers' who will be leaders to provide new value to our customers. Currently, we are promoting the reskilling and education of business producers so that they can fulfill their role and create value in future markets.\n\nThe goal of reskilling is to acquire techniques necessary to drive digital transformation to become a leader in the 'value creation process,' which we have defined in the form of model activities for business producers. Introductory courses include lectures on market analysis, how to prepare digital transformation concepts, and design thinking. Trainees then acquire practical skills by participating in customers' digital transformation projects. After finishing both the introductory training course and the practical skills phase, participants are evaluated based on their practical skills to drive the 'value creation process' as well as their knowledge and understanding of their own role as business producers.\n\nAccording to a survey, 97.0% of the reskilled personnel understood the need for and endorsed the change in their roles, and graduates of the course are enthusiastically using the skills they have acquired to address social issues and contribute to customers' digital transformation projects. In addition, as some system engineers have expressed their wish to participate in this training, we are considering to offer the course to a wider range of employees.",

The goals of the Fujitra project are to analyze, test, and implement a digital transformation project integrating the whole organization as well as a 'Japan-style' digital transformation project that will serve as a model for our domestic customers.\n\nThe project is led by a steering committee, comprising CEO and CDXO Takahito Tokita; CIO and Deputy CDXO Yuzuru Fukuda; COO and CDPO Hidenori Furuta; CFO Takeshi Isobe; CHRO Hiroki Hiramatsu; and CMO Taeko Yamamoto. Digital transformation officers, selected from 22 divisions, four Group companies in Japan, and five overseas regions report to the steering committee. These digital transformation officers are responsible for promoting reforms across divisions, advancing Companywide measures in each division and region, and leading digital transformation at each division level by gathering insights from frontline operations on a rolling basis.\n\nThe Fujitra project is focused on breaking down rigid corporate cultures such as vertically siloed systems and over-planning that have developed among business and corporate divisions. As a 'Companywide DX model,' the project focuses on initiatives based on approaches from five areas: the growth of strategic business, the creation of new business, mutually beneficial systems and environments, process re-designing, and the enhancement of profitability of existing businesses. The senior management team and the Group's approximately 130,000 employees will unite and realize digital transformation that takes maximum advantage of digital technologies with the aim to become an organization that is strongly focused on Our Purpose and to establish a corporate culture that aims to continuously adapt to the constant changes in society.\n\nFujitsu is currently promoting the 'One Fujitsu' program as part of the Fujitra project, a program to reform its data infrastructure to make data-driven management possible.\n\nThe purpose of the program is to optimize decision making, actions, management, and operations at all levels of the organization from senior executives through to frontline personnel by enabling real-time analysis and the prediction of management and operations based on the latest data.\n\n'One Fujitsu' is a management and operation reform program to standardize the data and business processes of the Fujitsu Group worldwide on a single system. The renewal of our IT systems is one step toward achieving this goal.\n\nAs the first step of the program, we are currently promoting the One ERP+ Project as part of our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) program, which aims to maximize value from limited resources like human resources, goods, money, and time.\n\nThe key to this project, which involves fundamental reform of existing operations, is the Group employees' participation in and commitment to the reforms. We have assigned a data & process owner who directly reports on the progress of the project to the CEO for each significant business process, such as business negotiation management, accounting, and procurement. Under this system, we are promoting standardization and digitalization across businesses and regions.\n\nWith ERP as a starting point, we will ultimately extend the 'One Fujitsu' program to encompass all operations. Globally, the program will standardize Fujitsu's Groupwide management, business processes, data, and IT to realize management and operations that are based on a data-driven, predictive model.",

        "page_content": "## Non-Financial Indicators\n\nTo realize Our Purpose, we are taking financial and non-financial measures. With regard to non-financial measures, the Group is promoting organizational transformation while focusing on seven priority issues within its Global Responsible Business (GRB) platform: Human Rights and Diversity & Inclusion, Wellbeing, Environment, Compliance, Supply Chain, Occupational Health and Safety, and Community. We believe that conducting business in a way that meets our responsibilities to all our stakeholders earns the trust of customers and society and increases employee engagement. To measure our performance in these areas, we have established the customer Net Promoter Score SM (NPS \u00ae ), employee engagement, and DX Promotion Indices, which show progress in advancing our organizational culture as non-financial indicators.\n\nEmployees with high engagement levels can provide customers with high-quality services, while positive evaluation from customers further increases the motivation of employees. Setting the customer NPS \u00ae , employee engagement, and DX Promotion Indices as non-financial indicators enables us to monitor our transformation into a business organization that is strongly focused on Our Purpose and value creation for our customers.\n\nOver the medium to long term, we will analyze and clarify the relationship between performance data based on financial and non-financial indicators as well as between performance data based on Global Responsible Business initiatives and non-financial indicators with the goals of demonstrating our dynamism as a data-driven organization and creating innovative value.\n\nGlobal Responsible Business (GRB)\n\nP44-45, 49-50\n\n## Net Promoter Score SM (NPS \u00ae )\n\nNPS \u00ae is a metric to measure 'customer loyalty' (the customers' levels of trust and attachment toward a company, product, or service) and is used for analyzing the level of customer experience and its improvement. While conventional customer satisfaction surveys ask about current levels of satisfaction, customer NPS \u00ae is calculated based on a single question concerning the probability of recommendation to another person: 'How likely are you to recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague?' The resulting score is then used to predict changes in\n\ncustomer behavior. The customer NPS \u00ae will help us to gain honest responses from our customers regarding their expectations toward our company as well as outstanding tasks. We will incorporate the insights gained from these responses in our management, operations, and products, in order to create new value and use this feedback to continuously improve our business.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a survey that mainly targeted strategically important customers in 30 countries. We have furthermore established the CX Steering Board, a project headed by the CEO where senior management team members and customer experience leaders responsible for customer experience initiatives in each region examine business strategies and measures based on customer NPS \u00ae analysis. Internal discussions are also currently underway to set a Groupwide common global target for customer NPS \u00ae for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has set 'Employee Engagement' as a non-financial indicator and a management goal. Employee Engagement shows the level of employees' empathy toward Our Purpose and the overall direction of our company. It furthermore measures their degree of loyalty toward the organization and gives better understanding about how autonomous and self-directed employees work and contribute to the Company. We aim to achieve an Employee Engagement score* of 75 by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. In 2020, the Group conducted a global Employee Engagement survey to clarify goals for Fujitsu as a group and for workstyles with the aim to speedily incorporate the employees' feedback and changes in awareness in our business management.\n\nFujitsu is currently promoting 'Fujitsu VOICE' as one of its internal digital transformation initiatives. The aim of the program is to collect feedback from customers and employees (including the Employee Engagement survey) and incorporate it into our business management. The engagement survey results are available to all Fujitsu Group employees and incorporated into the daily management of workplaces. Each business, division, and Group company is continuously reshaping its culture to improve employee engagement.\n\n- * An average score calculated by assigning scores between 0 and 100 to each of the five answer options of survey questions\n\n'Fujitsu VOICE'\n\nP36",

The indices have been established by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) with the aim of encouraging companies to promote digital management reforms. To this end, the indices provide opportunities for senior executives; personnel engaged in business operations, digital transformation, and IT; and other stakeholders to share their awareness of current situations and challenges in the promotion of digital transformation and to utilize the resulting insights for further actions. Based on 35 qualitative and other indices, companies conduct self-diagnoses and submit the results to the Information-technology Promotion Agency, a neutral organization that comprehensively analyzes the diagnosis results and benchmarks them against those of other participating companies.\n\nThe Fujitsu Group will use the DX Promotion Indices to regularly measure the Fujitra project's progress in renewing in-house processes and information infrastructure, realizing data-driven management, and revamping human resources and organizations. We will furthermore use the indices to set targets to improve our digital transformation initiatives. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, when Fujitra officially started, the Group's performance based on the indices improved from the previous fiscal year's 1.9 points to 2.4 points. Fujitsu is accelerating its transformation initiatives with the aim to raise performance to 3.5 points in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.\n\nIn 2020, we were selected by METI and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as one of the 'DX Stock' companies for our digital transformation initiatives. In 2021, the Group was named a 'Noteworthy DX Company,' a designation given to companies with high overall evaluations or that engage in initiatives meriting particular attention.

The program uses AI and analytics to digitally collect and analyze data on the emotions, experiences, and opinions of customers and Group employees. This helps us to understand the backgrounds to and reasons for specific events and reactions and enables us to incorporate these findings into our business management.\n\nWork Life Shift is a good example of how the use of 'Fujitsu VOICE' has initiated transformation. In May 2020, we conducted a two-week survey of all Group employees. The approximately 37,000 responses delivered us insights regarding the design of specific systems as well as the prioritization of measures to be incorporated into the Work Life Shift initiative. As the data-based visualization of employees' opinions allowed for faster decisions and reforms, we were able to shorten the planning process and accelerate the launch of this system. As a Companywide initiative, 'Fujitsu VOICE' is also helping us to flexibly improve our structures based on the employees' feedback.\n\nBy collecting and analyzing not only employee opinions but also feedback from customers on their expectations, requests, and service evaluations, the Group will utilize data to enhance customer experience and deliver value to our customers.\n\nWork Life Shift\n\nP32",

The Fujitsu Group is contributing to the fight against COVID-19 through innovations in drug discovery and novel medical treatments, realized through digital transformation (DX).\n\n## Computing Power to Support the Fight against COVID-19\n\n## Transforming the Development Process of Middle-Molecule Drug Discovery\n\nThe fight against COVID-19 has demonstrated the possibilities and importance of digital technology to our society. AI and machine learning technologies have enabled the development of vaccines at unprecedented speeds. People worldwide anticipate the promising, transformational potential of digital technologies to contribute to the development of new therapeutic drugs and the expansion of telemedicine services, to not only help us fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but to make our society more resilient in the years ahead.\n\nWith Healthy Living as one of its Key Focus Areas, the Fujitsu Group is drawing on digital technologies to mitigate the spread and damage of COVID-19 while driving research and development in the search to find new treatments.\n\nThe supercomputer Fugaku, for example, represents one of the most powerful platforms in the global fight against COVID-19, and was jointly developed by the research institute RIKEN and Fujitsu. The computing power of Fugaku has been utilized in exciting research projects that have fundamentally changed our understanding of the virus, conducted by institutions like RIKEN, including for projects to discover therapeutic drug candidates, the prediction of virus droplet infection in indoor environments and countermeasures, and evaluation models to measure the impact of the spread of the disease and city lockdowns on socioeconomic activities.\n\nFujitsu proved its exceptional hardware development capabilities with its driving role in the development of the world's most advanced computing technology for the supercomputer Fugaku.* However, Fujitsu's strength is not limited to hardware. Fujitsu's competitive advantage also lies in its ability to combine computing technologies with software development and system integration to provide customers with services that realize innovation and create social value that the Fujitsu Group aims to achieve.\n\nOne of our latest initiatives to combine technology and service is a joint project with a venture company to innovate drug discovery processes. Together with our partner PeptiDream Inc., which has unique technologies in the field of middle-molecule (peptide) drug discovery, we take on new challenges for innovation. Through our joint research, we have succeeded in the rapid and accurate calculation of the stable structure of middle-molecule compounds, which had been extremely difficult using conventional simulation technology.\n\nIn this joint research, Fujitsu successfully proposed mechanisms to improve efficiency in the drug discovery process based on high-performance computing and its quantuminspired Digital Annealer technology, which allows users to rapidly solve combinatorial optimization problems that prove difficult to solve using current conventional computers.\n\nBased on the results of this joint research, we are also working on the development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19. In November 2020, the five companies PeptiDream, Fujitsu, Mizuho Capital Co., Ltd., Takenaka Corporation, and Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. established the joint venture PeptiAID, aimed at the development of therapeutics to treat coronavirus diseases. Fujitsu provides its knowledge in computing technology and will also take up the challenge of establishing a new foundation for the drug discovery process through digital transformation, by utilizing AI-based prediction of activities and physical properties, and creating a drug discovery IT infrastructure that helps researchers to share knowledge and utilize research data.\n\n- *  Press release on June 28, 2021: 'Japan's Fugaku Retains Title as World's Fastest Supercomputer for Three Consecutive Terms.'\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2021/0628-01.html\n\nFor more information about PeptiAID, please visit the following website.\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/pressreleases/2020/1112-01.html",

Fujitsu aims to contribute to a carbon-neutral society by addressing climate change through 'mitigation measures,' which focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as 'adaptation measures,' which aim to prevent and reduce damage inflicted by natural disasters.\n\n## Improving the Efficiency of Large-Scale Logistics Services Using the Digital Annealer\n\nIn recent years, the importance of logistics as part of the social infrastructure underpinning people's lifestyles and industrial competitiveness is steadily increasing. At the same time, however, we are facing issues like shortages of drivers and a rapid increase in logistics costs in Japan due to small-lot and high-frequency deliveries amid the rapid growth of the e-commerce (EC) market. Measures to improve efficiency and reduce costs are also required in traditional areas like the logistics management of components in the manufacturing industry as a fundamental part of the supply chain. Increasing logistics and traffic density are factors that further increase CO2 emissions, which may negatively impact climate change and lead to more severe and frequent weather disasters. In order to contribute to solving such challenges of the logistics\n\nindustry, Toyota Systems and Fujitsu have conducted joint trials to optimize the distribution network of automobile components by utilizing Fujitsu's quantum-inspired Digital Annealer technology.\n\nWhen planning logistics in automobile manufacturing, there are countless possible route options for purchasing parts from various suppliers, which must pass through relay warehouses and deliver parts to several suppliers. To optimize logistics in automobile manufacturing, it is necessary to identify routes with the lowest logistics costs out of a huge number of potential candidates. To find the optimal solution, one must take into account the maximum load capacity of vehicles, cargo volumes, designated delivery times, travel distances and times between destinations, as well as the time required to load and unload cargo. However, with a growing number of vehicles and destinations, the number of combinations increases exponentially, making it extremely\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndifficult for people to calculate the best answer. Fujitsu's quantum-inspired Digital Annealer is able to deliver optimal solutions to such problems at high speed.\n\n## Contributing to the Reduction of CO2 Emissions\n\nWithin the trials, we succeeded in calculating new routes from a wide number of possible options within 30 minutes, contributing to a material reduction in overall logistics costs. Trials showed that customers can achieve cost reductions of approximately 2% to 5% compared to conventional methods by applying our technology to optimize their logistics routes. We also confirmed that optimizing logistics routes can reduce CO2 emissions from trucks by 8.9% compared to conventional methods (based on research by Fujitsu*).\n\nMoving forward, we aim to optimize the entire supply chain by applying technologies like the Digital Annealer to actual logistics operations, while simultaneously promoting further verification and practical applications to expand the scope of real-world use to contribute to the mitigation of climate change.\n\n- *  Fujitsu developed the web estimation tool EcoCALC, to measure the reduction of environmental impact achieved through the use of the Digital Annealer by comparing CO2 emissions levels before and after deployment. The calculation method is based on the International Telecommunication Union-Telecom (ITU-T) recommendation L.1410 for the methodology for environmental life cycle assessments of information and communication technology goods, networks and services (2012).\n\nFor more information about EcoCALC, please visit the following website.\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/environment/ sustainability-contribution-certification/",

As damages caused by climate change are expected to further increase in the future, the Fujitsu Group is promoting DX-based innovation to reduce the risk of flood damage and to ensure the safety of people. Through 'adaptation measures,' Fujitsu will contribute to creating resilient communities and combating climate change.\n\n## AI Water Management Prediction System for Flooding Countermeasures\n\nThe number of disasters caused by floods globally has been on the rise since 1980, while the trend is increasing in recent years. In Japan, economic losses due to flood damage caused by Typhoon No. 19 in 2019 were approximately \u00a51.65 trillion, the largest in the world. Damage caused by climate change, including flood damage, is becoming more frequent and severe. As rivers often overflow in a short period of time during floods, it is difficult to take precautions in advance. In addition to weather forecast information, local governments thus increasingly require real-time data to predict the influence of further rainfalls on the water level of rivers when issuing evacuation advisories to local residents.\n\nFujitsu's AI Water Management Prediction System, launched in March 2021, meets these challenges by utilizing a model that incorporates insights from hydrology. The system can be used to predict water levels in smaller and mediumscale rivers with limited measurement data or for areas where water level sensors have been newly installed and have yet to accumulate sufficient data. These predictions will offer authorities a tool for delivering faster response times and mitigating flood damage in the event of a natural disaster, including dispatching personnel to affected areas and supporting appropriate decision making in issuing evacuation advisories. Such support also contributes to 'adaptation' to the progressing effects of climate change, by protecting people from weather-related disasters such as river floods caused by heavy rains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ensuring Evacuation Lead Times Based on Forecasts\n\nUsing this system, AI predicts water levels based on collected observation data, enabling predictions of water levels of relevant rivers based on the expected rainfall upstream. This helps authorities make more accurate evacuation advisories, dispatch personnel to affected areas more appropriately, and deliver faster response times to prepare evacuation centers in the event of floods. The ability to predict risks in advance not only enables the preparation of appropriate action plans but also can further contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the waste of various energy resources.\n\nThrough this system and other AI-based solutions that can provide forecast information at various locations, the Fujitsu Group aims to reduce the risk of damage from natural disasters like river floods resulting from climate change. We will continue to contribute to the creation of a resilient society and the adaptation to climate change by promoting disaster prevention and mitigation in the event of natural disasters in cooperation with local communities, local governments, and businesses.",

At the same time, competition has emerged among countries trying to secure medical supplies and vaccines for their people, casting divisions in society into sharp relief and underlining persistent inequities for communities unable to access the same opportunities for treatment and economic recovery. Cooperation and competition are vying with one another around the world, and against this backdrop, I was appointed as CSO of the Fujitsu Group in April 2021. I believe my mission is to foster understanding within the Group regarding these problems facing global society and to drive our transformation to encourage the creation of new value for all, as well as to externally communicate the Group's efforts to solve social issues.\n\n## Revision of the Fujitsu Way Aimed at Moving to a New Stage\n\nThe Group first formulated the Fujitsu Way in 2002. Since then, we have steadily expanded our sustainability initiatives, which can also be described as the practical implementation of the Fujitsu Way, earning a certain amount of recognition from external groups and evaluating institutions. However, our activities have been driven mainly by certain, mainly corporate, divisions, and we must acknowledge that not all Group employees have a full sense of their own role in our efforts toward sustainability management.\n\nThe context for the 2020 revision of the Fujitsu Way is that of an accelerating global movement to create a new capitalism designed to overcome the challenges of climate change, social division and other social issues. In this environment, we were determined to take the Group's sustainability management efforts to the next stage. To ensure that the Group will\n\nYumiko Kajiwara\n\nCSO\n\n<!-- image -->",

It sets out the milestones that the Group will aim to achieve, looking ahead to the society of the future and backcasting to clarify the role that the Group should play as a technology company toward realizing it. We will also look to the past, digging down into our DNA to draw inspiration from our 86-year history since our founding.\n\n## Internal Promotion of Our Purpose and Sharing of Values\n\nTo help employees understand Our Purpose and engage in business with a focus on the sustainability of society, they must share the values that form the principles for their conduct. Our Values are 'Aspiration,' 'Trust,' and 'Empathy,' and for each of these three values, we have presented four conduct guidelines. These have been made into an explanatory document that has been translated into 19 languages to promote them internally. Furthermore, the heads of our internal divisions and Group subsidiaries are all responsible for promoting the Fujitsu Way, and we hold regular meetings for reporting on and sharing the status of implementation of the Fujitsu Way. In addition, to encourage employees to understand and take\n\nownership of Our Purpose, we introduced a dialogue program titled 'Purpose Carving \u00ae ' for putting the individual's own purpose into words as an exercise for helping each individual employee explore their own purpose and give it shape. We also create opportunities for employees to reflect on the value that their work brings to society.\n\nThrough these actions, sustainability initiatives within the Group are gradually being stepped up. As the president continuously communicates his thinking about the Fujitsu Way and demonstrates a strong commitment to purpose-driven management, corresponding movements are emerging among employees, and I am encouraged by those responses.\n\n## Promotion of GRB and Establishment of Non-Financial Indicators\n\nWe have been promoting Global Responsible Business (GRB) as a platform for implementing the Fujitsu Way. GRB is a platform comprising universal issues that need to be addressed in promoting sustainable management while upholding our responsibility as a technology company. We have established seven priority issues.\n\nThrough our efforts to promote GRB, we aim to cultivate a Groupwide mindset and organizational culture that can resolve sustainability-related issues for society. This is the reason for incorporating GRB-related items in our evaluation system for the executive team. At the same time, by disclosing our progress on the KPIs that we have set for each priority\n\nissue, we aim to demonstrate quantitatively to our customers and other external stakeholders the changes that we have made toward creating value in a way that is unique to Fujitsu.\n\nThe seven priority issues are mutually interlinked and exert a positive influence on each other, such as wellbeing and health and safety, or supply chain and compliance. By working toward set targets, the results should become evident in the trust that the Group receives from stakeholders, particularly customers, and in the trust that the Company receives from individual Group employees. Based on this idea, the Group has established non-financial indicators as customer Net Promoter Score SM (NPS \u00ae ) and employee engagement. We are monitoring the progress of sustainability management and changes toward the realization of Our Purpose through such management.\n\n## Connecting Corporate Value and Sustainability\n\nThe sustainable increase of the Group's corporate value depends heavily upon the sustainability of our global society, as well as on building relationships of trust with all stakeholders. By incorporating sustainability perspectives in our business as a matter of course, we strengthen the competitiveness of our services, and enhance the value we provide, leading to improvements in customer evaluation and employee engagement. As the CSO, I will drive the Group's transformation with a view to establishing this kind of interconnectedness.",

At present, however, given the unpredictability of day-to-day life and business activities due to an unprecedented crisis, we must redouble efforts to meet society's expectations. Accordingly, under the guidance of our leadership, we will step up sustainability-focused business management and make significant advances in directions that benefit society.\n\nFor details on 'Sustainability Management in the Fujitsu Group,' please visit the following website: https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/vision/policy/\n\n## The Fujitsu Group's Sustainability Management\n\n## Basic Approach\n\nIn contributing proactively to the transformation of society amid the current uncertainty and volatility, we have to conduct business activities as a member of international society based on the new Fujitsu Way, which clarifies Our Purpose, or reason for being. It is particularly important that we take into consideration environmental, social, and economic viewpoints when addressing issues, thereby formulating initiatives that have beneficial impacts on society. To this end, we revised our management targets by incorporating new non-financial indicators alongside existing financial indicators in fiscal 2020. Through long-term, stable contribution to society and customers financially and non-financially, the Fujitsu Group will achieve renewed growth.\n\n## Promotional Systems and Framework\n\nIn April 2020, the Fujitsu Group established the Sustainability Management Committee, tasked with determining how a responsible global company should conduct business management. Specifically, the committee is focused on realizing long-term growth by taking into consideration environmental, social, and economic impacts and by creating value for all of the Group's stakeholders.\n\nConvening every six months, the committee checks progress toward non-financial targets, deliberates on new activities, and\n\nreports findings to the Management Council and the Board of Directors. The committee is chaired by the CEO and comprises executives whom the chairperson appoints with a view to furthering sustainability management. As of October 2021, the committee had 17 members, including the chairperson.\n\nGuided by the Sustainability Management Committee while adhering to the overarching Global Responsible Business (GRB) platform of sustainability aspirations, we have identified seven\n\npriority issues as shown in the figure below. Setting our sights on key performance indicators for each of these issues, we are advancing initiatives across each region and division globally. The leaders of units and Group companies are responsible for promoting the Fujitsu Way internally. Therefore, these leaders will establish missions for their organizations based on the Fujitsu Way and the GRB platform and review the progress of initiatives aimed at accomplishing the missions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ever mindful that their corporate group is a member of society, all Group employees will not merely seek profits but simultaneously work to reduce the negative impact of business activities on sustainability while maximizing their positive benefits.\n\nBy promoting the GRB platform, our initiatives toward the non-financial sector will ultimately benefit our business and\n\nfinancial performance in the long term. Accordingly, the Sustainability Management Committee will regularly check the progress toward achievement of the GRB platform, and the committee's conclusions will be released through reviews of the Group's Management Direction and various media.\n\nFor details on the non-financial indicators, please see\n\npage 35, 'Non-Financial Indicators.'\n\nOur Purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. This statement represents an internal and external pledge to help realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nWe believe the SDGs essentially define a system transformation that must be achieved by 2030 to allow the world's population, which is expected to exceed 9 billion-plus inhabitants in 2050, to live a good life within the planetary boundaries. The issues highlighted in the SDGs include environmental, social, and economic elements. One key to solving these inherent problems is digital transformation (DX), which can be applied on a scale that encompasses all aspects of society. Fujitsu is transforming itself to a sustainable management model via its GRB platform and is also working to resolve societal challenges through its business operations.\n\nAs a DX partner for our customers, we are promoting ecosystem-style initiatives that connect data and services across industry sectors. We will take a multifaceted approach to societal challenges by means of co-creation, aiming to create an impact by achieving larger-scale solutions with a wide range of stakeholders, and to maximize that impact.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We held a dialogue with Dr. Kunio Ito of Hitotsubashi University, who explained the importance of increasing both earning power and the management of ESG initiatives, proposing ROESG \u00ae management (combining return on equity and ESG), along with President and Chief Executive Officer Masanobu Komoda of Mitsui Fudosan Co., Ltd., who led the company's sustainable urban development business for many years with a progressive spirit. Corporate Executive Officer Yumiko Kajiwara served as the moderator for the dialogue, facilitating a smooth and fruitful discussion from which we received valuable input from both speakers.\n\n## Experts\n\nMr. Masanobu Komoda President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMitsui Fudosan Co., Ltd.\n\n## Increasing Partnerships in Which Values Can Be Shared and Creating Social Value\n\nMitsui Fudosan's purpose is clarified in its Group statement: 'The Mitsui Fudosan Group aims to bring affluence and comfort to urban living.' This statement expresses the Group's aim to contribute to a sustainable society through urban development. The real estate industry has a natural affinity with ESG, and employees have internalized the mission to enrich people's lives through urban development. Sustainability includes three meanings: 'sustainability of the earth = environmental coexistence'; 'sustainability of people = health and longevity'; and 'sustainability of the economy = creation of new industries.' These concepts underpinned our smart city projects in Kashiwano-ha and Nihonbashi.\n\nExternal partnerships are essential in the real estate business today. For example, to create a smart city, it is absolutely necessary to cooperate with various industries in areas such as the development of urban operating systems and infrastructure, including institutions for science and education. This is why I want to create social value by developing ecosystems with an increasing number of partners that share the same values and aim to 'achieve a good balance of ESG, innovation, and earning power in their core business.' It is necessary to enable customers to understand social value, and employees also need to recognize social value as a competitive advantage. Fujitsu refers to global sustainability in 'Our Purpose,' and I have high expectations for our partnership with Fujitsu and our goal to jointly develop an ecosystem to help solve social issues through business.",

Like many of these progressive companies, Mitsui Fudosan Co., Ltd. is taking the same approach. In 2021, Fujitsu decided on seven Key Focus Areas for growth, while repeatedly going back to the question, 'Why Fujitsu?' In this particular dialogue, I felt there was a need to strive even harder to unify our business with ESG initiatives and contribution to society.\n\nInnovation is necessary for transformation. Therefore, diversity and conflict are also important elements. Healthy conflict is generated by dialogue in situations where diverse people with diverse values come together. This generates ideas and innovation, enabling the creation of innovative services.\n\nI have heard a good deal of advice from both of our experts about the necessary transformations for Fujitsu to realize its Purpose. We will demonstrate our leadership as a technology company at the forefront, aiming to solve pressing global issues such as climate change and natural disasters.\n\n## Leading DX and SX Driven by Personal Ownership of Fujitsu's Purpose through Dialogue\n\nHuman economic benefit has been prioritized over a responsible use of the earth's resources, leading to damage to common property and impacting climate change. There is a need to realize 'good capitalism' by combining the power of digital transformation (DX) and sustainability transformation (SX). This formula will also lead to greater resilience in corporate management. The environment for companies has changed drastically over the past few years, and management has become something of a mixed martial art. It is no longer sufficient to simply disclose financial information; managers now need to skillfully combine financial and non-financial information, back their information up with data and actively engage in dialogue with investors and other stakeholders to enable them to understand their company's value.\n\nAt the same time, internal dialogue is also very important. As corporate organizations become more and more diverse, they need to communicate the 'why'-the reason for their existence-convincingly and adjust their organizational direction accordingly. In other words, this is a company's purpose. During the process where companies internalize their purpose as part of themselves, people start to engage in many dialogues, which creates a participative management and ultimately drives transformation.\n\nThe 'why' is also an important question for technology. By continuing to ask why technology is important and how it can contribute to solving social issues, Fujitsu can realize good technologies and become a leader in DX and SX.\n\nThe key to success in purpose-driven management is human capital, and it is vital to develop employees to the fullest extent of their potential. Recently, Fujitsu seems to be creating a corporate culture encouraging people who learn autonomously. I hope the Fujitsu Group will continue to promote purpose-driven management through engagement with its employees.\n\n## Fujitsu\n\nTakahito Tokita Representative Director CEO/CDXO\n\n<!-- image -->",

My experiences working in this global role also shaped my understanding of issues regarding transformation. In the past, our strategic thinking has been focused on the Japanese market with separate management approaches for our businesses inside and outside of Japan. This has now shifted to us formulating and implementing corporate strategies from a global perspective in terms of markets, customers, and values. By having a global perspective, we open ourselves up to learning from others, challenging the way we do things and finding new ways to achieve sustainable growth.\n\nDiverse teams and companies make better decisions and can drive real progress as different voices can be heard and opinions considered. Communication is key in the global workplace to bring this to a reality, and it empowers us to move toward a common goal. It ensures we have effective engagement among our colleagues, customers and stakeholders, which is of the utmost importance.\n\n## Achieving Differentiation with Technologies That Lead to Solutions for Social Issues\n\nI started my career in Silicon Valley. Today, we are working to bring the individual purposes of our employees into closer alignment with the Fujitsu Group's Purpose to create a strong driving force. However, this is a difficult task, as our employees worldwide have different cultures and ways of thinking. I, myself, too, felt confused over cultural differences and customs when I first came to Japan. I am certain that it is important to constantly engage in dialogue, and to improve our ability to engage in constructive dialogue.\n\nAs we promote seven Key Focus Areas through Our Purpose- and datadriven approach, technology plays an extremely significant role. Our aim is to use technologies in which we are strong, like AI, security, supercomputing, and quantum computing to create services in fields like green energy and resiliency that lead to solutions for social issues globally. We will create systems that can supply the same level of services anywhere in the world, and enable customers to provide good business to their customers in turn.\n\nIn 2020, we established a non-financial performance indicator that is now standard practice for many global companies. These measures provide a closer link to our long-term organizational strategies and alignment with Our Purpose. We will strive to achieve these non-financial indicators that we have set, and in doing so, we will transform ourselves and our customers, which will contribute to creating a more sustainable world.\n\nThrough this dialogue, we received a lot of advice about how to transform our Group in order to realize Our Purpose. As global-scale issues emerge, the values of society and individuals are changing dramatically. In this environment, we will engage in dialogue about Our Purpose in order to move in the same direction as one company, and work together with business partners that share our values to realize even further transformation. Guided by this advice and opinions, we will strive to realize Our Purpose globally as 'One Fujitsu.'\n\nVivek Mahajan Corporate Executive Officer CTO\n\n<!-- image -->",

Respect for human rights is an essential element for conducting responsible business globally. Ensuring human rights is at the very foundation of our social responsibility, including the working environment within the Fujitsu Group and our supply chain, as well as the offering of safe and secure services to our customers amid the rapid digitalization of society. This is why the Fujitsu Group considers human rights to be an important issue.\n\n## Education on Human Rights\n\nThe Fujitsu Group conducts education and training activities using both course content that is common across the Company as well as content targeting issues specific to a region or Group company. In July 2021, we launched a new e-learning program on 'Business and Human Rights,' targeting approximately 130,000 Group employees, with the aim to enable individual employees to learn about how to conduct business with an awareness of human rights. The e-learning program introduces basic knowledge about human rights, global trends, and corporate initiatives and also provides examples of corporate activities that could have a negative impact on human rights in three key areas identified by Fujitsu (customers and end-users, employees, and the supply chain). In this way, the program aims to foster a deeper personal understanding of the importance of respecting human rights in day-to-day business.\n\nScreen shot from the fiscal 2021 e-learning program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AI Ethics Initiatives\n\nAs a company developing and providing AI services and solutions, in 2019, the Fujitsu Group formulated and announced the 'Fujitsu Group AI Commitment.' This commitment outlines Fujitsu's vision to use rapidly developing AI technologies with the aim of offering greater potential to all people and contributing to the prosperity of society. The Fujitsu Group is currently promoting a range of initiatives related to AI ethics. These include the establishment of the 'Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics,' which consists of outside experts in AI and other sectors. The committee provides objective appraisals of our initiatives on AI ethics, and its outcomes are shared with Fujitsu's Board of Directors. Furthermore, to evaluate and consider our actual business practices from diverse perspectives including human rights, privacy, and ethics, we have established the 'Human Centric AI Working Group,' which comprises personnel from multiple related internal divisions. As part of our AI governance, we are promoting initiatives including training for employees on AI ethics in order to prevent ethical problems related to AI.\n\n## BEING: Our Commitment to Society-Fujitsu Americas' Initiative\n\nIn spring of 2020, as social injustice issues continued to occur across the United States, Fujitsu Americas was compelled to take action and remain committed to human rights by pledging to listen and contribute to society. We confirmed our strong company stance on this matter and focused on efforts that would drive diversity and inclusion.\n\nAs part of this movement, we launched the Black Employee Inclusion Network Group (BEING). BEING is committed to creating a safe place to discuss issues, to being authentic in the workplace, to helping build an inclusive environment for all employees, and to serving communities in need.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBlack Employee Inclusion Network Group (BEING)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's human rights initiatives, please visit the following website. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/humanrights/",

In order to realize the potential of each individual, it is important to elicit various viewpoints and discuss them constructively as a group, engaging in dialogue and creating an environment in which everyone accepts each other's differences. Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is an important priority for the Fujitsu Group, as it enables us to contribute to solving social issues through innovation and to drive sustainable growth.\n\n## A Culture That Empowers Everyone to Be Themselves-LGBT+ Initiatives\n\nFujitsu is promoting initiatives to foster deeper understanding of gender and sexual diversity to create a workplace in which all employees can feel secure and comfortable and perform to the absolute best of their abilities. In addition to a message from the CEO, we also have training seminars and internal systems set up to promote recognition of gender and diversity-related topics throughout the Group. At the same time, we are making efforts to expand the network of LGBT+ allies in the Group by holding LGBT+ Ally Meetings where diverse LGBT+ individuals and allies can talk together, as well as movie screenings and other events.\n\nFujitsu Pride is a movement at the Fujitsu Group where representatives from LGBT+ employee network groups and allies from each region come together to collaborate and take action on a global scale, supported by executive sponsors. In 2020, with people unable to conduct activities due to COVID-19, we held the first-ever online 'Global Fujitsu Virtual Pride Week,' hosted by Fujitsu Pride. A large number of executives and employees from Fujitsu and Group\n\ncompanies in Japan and overseas participated in the activities. As an online format, the event included virtual parades, webinars, panel discussions, and small group events to discuss LGBT+ topics.\n\nEmployee volunteers participating in parades in cities all over the world\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Companywide Diversity Promotion Forum\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has formulated the Global D&I Vision & Inclusion Wheel to promote D&I, aiming to encourage employees to 'Be Completely You.' The Companywide Diversity Promotion Forum has been held each year since fiscal 2008, aiming to foster a corporate culture where everyone can play an active part in the Company as who they are. The forum features messages from the CEO and the management team regarding D&I, encourages employees to change their mindset and behavior, and provides an opportunity to think about the importance of D&I.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEO Tokita participating from his office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement team members in a panel discussion\n\n## Mentoring Program for Female Engineers\n\nThe Global Delivery Group operates a mentoring program for female engineers starting in the early years of their careers. Pairing female engineer mentees with senior engineer mentors, the\n\nprogram helps mentees to gain a wide range of skills, as well as confidence in their engineering ability by accumulating a variety of experience. The program is also used as a networking opportunity between female engineers from different countries and regions. We also offer a mentoring program for applicants to senior engineering programs to provide even more opportunities to increase employees' skill levels.\n\nParticipants gathering from multiple countries and regions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's diversity and inclusion initiatives, please visit the following website.\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/diversity/",

Thus, wellbeing is an important issue for the Fujitsu Group.\n\n## FUJITSU Learning Festival\n\nIn June 2021, the Fujitsu Group held 'FUJITSU Learning Festival 2021' as an online event for all employees and their families around the world. The event was designed to encourage employ-\n\nees to develop positive habits around independent, self-motivated learning. This initiative, which is part of Fujitsu's newly introduced job-based human resources system, relates to a new training policy to provide self-development support for employees who wish to carry out self-learning. Around 60 sessions were held over the five days of the event, including an interactive session with CEO Takahito Tokita, as well as seminars by internal and external speakers about various\n\nFUJITSU Learning Festival 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnline venue accessed by employees throughout the world\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthemes including agile thinking, sustainability, and SDGs, with sessions and workshops also held by employees. Around 37,000 people from 41 countries participated. Going forward, we plan to hold the event every year, aiming to create a positive cycle as an organization in which individual employees can live in a way that is true to themselves.\n\n## Recognition as a '2021 Health & Productivity Stock Selection' and One of the 'White 500 Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organizations'\n\nAs a company that considers its employees' health management from a management perspective and addresses the issue through strategic initiatives, Fujitsu was for the first time designated as a member of the '2021 Health & Productivity Stock Selection' by Japan's Ministry of Economy,\n\nTrade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Fujitsu was also certified as one of the top 500 'Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organizations' (the 'White 500') by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Nippon Kenko Kaigi, for the fifth consecutive year. This reflects our continuous efforts to maintain and improve the health of our employees\n\nand their families. Among our Group companies in Japan, one was recognized as a 'White 500 company' (top 500 enterprise), 14 were recognized under the 'large enterprise category,' and four under the 'SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) category.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Online Health Program\n\nThe Fujitsu Group is taking various measures to encourage the physical and mental wellbeing of employees and their families, taking into account changes in their lifestyles and working environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For employees in Japan, we provide various health e-learning programs such as stress management, while for the international region, we offer various online programs including exercises such as yoga and muscle training, study sessions on mental health, concerts, and cooking classes. We also hold various online events on the occasion of events like 'Global Wellness Day' and 'Mental Health Month.'

We have also switched from face-to-face meetings to online meetings and conference calls. As a general rule, we have suspended most overseas business trips and long-distance domestic business trips. In addition, we have developed and disseminated guidelines for working from home and have taken measures to review our internal operations and fulfill our social responsibilities, for carrying out smooth operations regardless of the environment.\n\nAs for office environments, we are implementing measures such as appropriately controlling the percentage of employees in the office, having seating layouts taken social distancing into account, placing alcohol-based disinfectant, and managing records of where people sit in nonfixed seating, in order to provide workplace environments where employees can work in safety.\n\nIn Japan, we also conducted local COVID-19 vaccination programs for employees, including Group company employees, in areas where Fujitsu's internal medical staff was able to administer the vaccination process (Kawasaki Plant, Osaka Hub, Oyama Plant, and Nagano Plant). As of October 2021, 65,244 vaccines have been administered.\n\nWe have also set up a consultation service for infectious disease countermeasures and disseminated information to our employees on how to prevent and combat the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's occupational health and safety initiatives, please visit the following website. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/safety/\n\nSDG Communities\u7d46 (kizuna)-is a project that aims to bring Fujitsu employees together to form global virtual communities focused on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations.

As a global corporation, it is our responsibility to care about human rights, the environment, diversity, and other issues not limited to the Group's internal interests, but touching on the entire supply chain. Fujitsu Group regards the supply chain as a matter of the utmost strategic importance, representing an essential aspect of conducting responsible business.\n\n## Addressing Conflict Minerals\n\nThe policy of the Fujitsu Group is to exclude any minerals that might give rise to conflicts, or that are at high risk of being associated with forced labor or human rights violations from its products, components, and supply chain. Fujitsu has established the Sustainability Management Committee as an internal organization to ensure the transparency of its supply chain and responsible sourcing of minerals. In addition, the Fujitsu Group conducts surveys regarding conflict minerals with reference to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from ConflictAffected and High-Risk Areas. These surveys use the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) and the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).\n\n## Communication with Suppliers\n\nThe Fujitsu Group holds business meetings with its major suppliers to provide explanations about assessment results as well as Fujitsu's business outlook and procurement strategy under the 'Suppliers' Performance Review' system. The feedback provided at these meetings also addresses CSR topics, and suppliers that do not meet Fujitsu's standards are asked to make improvements. In addition, since fiscal 2020, the Fujitsu Group has held the 'Fujitsu ActivateNow Partner Summit,' its global flagship event for suppliers. At the event, senior executives, heads of business groups, and the executive vice president responsible for purchasing give an overview of Fujitsu's business direction and explain Fujitsu's procurement strategy. During this event, we also present partners who have made exceptional contributions to our business with certificates of appreciation to strengthen further partnerships with our suppliers.\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's CSR procurement initiatives, please visit the following website. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/procurement/\n\nCompliance is one of the most important management priorities from the perspective of maintaining and improving corporate value. In all of our business activities, it is essential to be aware of and act with integrity at a high level of corporate ethics that respects international and local standards. Therefore, the Fujitsu Group recognizes compliance as an important management issue.\n\n## Policies and Structure for Implementation\n\nAt the Fujitsu Group, the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, which reports directly to the Board of Directors and is chaired by the CEO, is responsible for overseeing Groupwide compliance at the global level based on the Policy on the Internal Control System.* The Risk Management & Compliance Committee nominates the executives who shall be responsible for compliance and risk, and said executives, together with the relevant departments, shall carry out measures based on direction from the Risk Management & Compliance Committee and the Global Compliance Program. The Risk Management & Compliance Committee collaborates with the Regional Risk Management & Compliance Committees, which have been formed as subcommittees, and raises Groupwide awareness of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and achieves compliance with it.\n\n- * Policy on the Internal Control System\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/imagesgig5/notice121b.pdf (pages 5-10)\n\n## Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct\n\nThe Fujitsu Way contains a Code of Conduct, which outlines the fundamental principles that all Fujitsu Group employees should abide by, as shown on the right.\n\nFujitsu has also refined its Fujitsu Way Code of\n\nConduct by developing the Global Business Standards (GBS) in 20 languages to serve as a guide on legally compliant behavior for all Fujitsu Groupaffiliated employees worldwide and applies the GBS uniformly across the Fujitsu Group.\n\nGlobal Business Standards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFujitsu Way Code of Conduct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe do not use our position in our organization for personal gain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Outside of Japan, regional heads and Group company top managers continuously send out messages emphasizing the importance of compliance and a corporate culture that has zero tolerance for wrongdoing.\n\nFurthermore, Fujitsu established Fujitsu Compliance Week, which begins on December 9, the United Nations' designated International Anti-Corruption Day, and employs measures such as sending out simultaneous messages across the Fujitsu Group to encourage employees to focus on compliance and promote compliance discussions.\n\n## Global Compliance Program\n\nFujitsu has developed the Fujitsu Global Compliance Program (GCP) to implement and disseminate the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and the GBS and is working to maintain and improve the Fujitsu Group's global legal compliance structure. The GCP organizes Fujitsu's various compliance-related activities into five pillars in a systematic manner. The GCP promotes external understanding of Fujitsu's compliance structure and its compliance activities, in addition to clarifying what items Fujitsu needs to address on a continual basis. Based on this GCP, we implement various policies and initiatives in each region, taking into account factors such as each country/region's legal systems and government institutions' guidelines.\n\nPlease refer to the PDF below for information about the promotion of the Global Compliance Program. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/documents/about/csr/compliance/2021\\_Promoting\\_GCP\\_en.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's compliance initiatives, please visit the following website. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/compliance/",

As a global technology company, the Fujitsu Group has a responsibility to reduce not only its own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but also to contribute to solving climate change-related issues for customers and society. The global environment is the foundation of society itself and remains an important priority for the Fujitsu Group.\n\n## Aiming to Reduce GHG Emissions at Business Sites by 37.8% or More from FY2013 Levels\n\n## Increasing Our Medium- and Long-Term Targets\n\nIn May 2017, Fujitsu formulated its medium- and long-term environmental vision, 'Fujitsu Climate and Energy Vision,' and in August of the same year, obtained Science Based Targets (SBT) certification for 2\u00b0C-aligned emissions reduction targets to be achieved by 2030. Amid accelerating moves toward carbon neutrality, the Group reexamined the role that it should play, and in April 2021, it revised its emissions reduction targets for its business sites in fiscal 2030 from 33% to 71.4% below fiscal 2013 levels. These reduction targets were validated as 1.5\u00b0C-aligned targets by the SBT initiative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives toward Achieving Our Targets\n\nIn 2018, the Fujitsu Group joined the international initiative RE100, which aims to promote and expand the use of renewable energy. So far, progress has been made mainly in Europe and the United States, while promoting usage in Japan remains a challenge. In fiscal 2020, however, Fujitsu achieved 100% renewable energy use at its three Systems Laboratories (in Aomori, Kumamoto, and Oita prefectures), which host energy-intensive offices. Also, in fiscal 2021, we successfully achieved 100% renewable energy use at our Kawasaki Main Office, one of Fujitsu's key facilities in Japan.\n\nKawasaki Main Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAomori Systems Laboratory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Avoiding Risks Associated with Business Activities and Minimizing Risks to the Environment (Water Risk Countermeasures)\n\nThe Fujitsu Group conducts flooding damage impact assessments for each business site using hazard maps and implements countermeasures. We determine whether each business site falls within the 'estimated flood inundation area (planned scale: once every 10-100 years or assumed maximum scale: once every 1,000 years)' for nearby rivers as established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism or prefectural governments. We also assess what the impact will be on-site and off-site, and whether there will be an impact from water ingress in buildings, etc. We then rank the sites on a four-point scale. For sites that correspond with the most hazardous level, we assign a four and then formulate various measures to reduce risk, such as protecting the site perimeter with retaining walls and watertight panels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSliding gates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRemovable watertight panels\n\nGates that can be raised and lowered\n\n<!-- image -->",

To establish complete transparency and traceability for the barley supply chain from grower to consumer, there were technological challenges such as ensuring data reliability and tamper-proofing and tracking throughout different stages of a complex supply chain. The world's largest brewer, AB InBev is working with Fujitsu's Track and Trust Solution Center and its partner, SettleMint, to solve these challenges using blockchain technology.\n\nIn a pilot project, QR codes were added to one million beer packs, and by scanning them, consumers were able to see where the barley was grown, reaped, and malted, giving them more insight than ever before. Furthermore, by connecting players across the entire supply chain end-to-end on one secure, decentralized platform built using blockchain technology, we can contribute to improving productivity, water and energy efficiency, and soil health, as well as grower development.\n\nFor other cases, please see 'Social Innovation through DX' on pages 37-40\n\n.\n\n## Environmental Action Plan\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has formulated an Environmental Action Plan since 1993 and continues to broaden the scope of its environmental activities. To significantly reduce our own environmental impact, we implemented far-reaching measures throughout our factories and offices to cut CO2 emissions and chemical pollutants, reduce waste, and address other environmental concerns. In addition, we have also expanded the focus of our activities across the entire supply chain, including our customers, and society as a whole. The Fujitsu Group will continue responding to the demands of the changing times, and the Group will deepen and further develop its environmental activities with the goal of helping to create a sustainable and rewarding society.\n\n## Environmental Action Plan (Stage IX) (Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2020)\n\nSince fiscal 2019, we have executed measures set forth under the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage IX), which calls on us to reduce our operating bases' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, provide products that consume less power during usage, conserve water resources with a focus on supply-chain water risks, and respond to the problem of plastic waste. We achieved all of our targets for fiscal 2019, and in fiscal 2020, we achieved even further improvements on our target values.\n\n## Environmental Action Plan (Stage X) (Fiscal 2021 to Fiscal 2022)\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has specified targets that address the three global societal challenges of climate change, resource circulation, and living in harmony with nature. We will focus on these targets during the two-year period from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 by working to minimize negative environmental impacts in the supply chain.\n\n## Targets established in line with the societal challenges of climate change, resource circulation, and living in harmony with nature\n\n- Climate change: Strengthening our commitment to meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\n- Resource circulation: Maintaining and enhancing efforts in the areas of resource-saving product design (with an emphasis on reducing the use of plastics) and water risk assessments throughout the supply chain\n- Living in harmony with nature: Based on global trends, a new target to visualize impacts on biodiversity\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's Environmental Action Plan, please visit the following websites:\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan (Stage IX)\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/environment/approach/plan/stage9/\n\nEnvironmental Action Plan (Stage X)\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/environment/action-plan/index.html",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nUnder the Fujitsu Group's governance structure for risks and opportunities, the Group identifies and manages risks and opportunities related to climate change, while formulating and promoting countermeasures through the Sustainability Management Committee and the Risk Management & Compliance Committee. Both committees are chaired by the representative director and CEO, and their findings are reported periodically to the Board of Directors via the Management Council.\n\nTo strengthen sustainability management, including for climate change, Corporate Executive Officer Yumiko Kajiwara was appointed chief sustainability officer (CSO) in April 2021. The CSO will propose reforms to directors and the executive team and execute business related to sustainability. In addition, the CSO will promote the expansion of a range of initiatives that contribute to society's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality and successfully adapt to climate change.\n\n## Strategy\n\nUtilizing a 2\u00b0C scenario, the Fujitsu Group conducted an analysis of the period through 2050 and-drawing on its results to establish a medium- to long-term environmental vision-formulated the FUJITSU Climate and Energy Vision. The Group announced its GHG emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050, along with its contributions to climate change mitigation and adaptation of customers and society. The actions taken in response to this environmental vision demonstrated the resilience of the Group's strategies. Furthermore, in April 2021 the Group raised the standard for its GHG emissions reduction targets from 2.0\u00b0C to 1.5\u00b0C, based on the accelerating trend toward achieving carbon neutrality in global society.\n\nThe Fujitsu Group continuously promotes internal responses to climate change, such as reducing GHG emissions and bolstering the resilience of datacenters and business sites. In addition, the Group is working to promote value creation using digital technologies aimed at realizing a carbon-neutral society. One initiative includes a trial of a project that increases logistics efficiency by leveraging Fujitsu's quantum-inspired Digital Annealer to rapidly solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Fujitsu has also taken advantage of technological developments in computing, AI, and IoT to mitigate the impacts of climate change-related disasters, including for predicting climate and weather patterns with high accuracy and proposing evacuation plans. Fujitsu also announced that it will ensure that all the power required for its\n\nFJcloud service operations at its datacenters in Japan will be provided by renewable energy by fiscal 2022.\n\nMoreover, in its Management Direction update of April 2021, Fujitsu announced seven Key Focus Areas that will drive the 'For Growth' business domain. The Group will also consider climate change countermeasures within these areas and reflect them in its business strategies. Based on the Management Direction update of the Key Focus Areas and other factors, the Group has now started a multi-scenario analysis, including for the 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nKey Focus Areas\n\nP22-23\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe Risk Management & Compliance Committee identifies, classifies, assesses, and manages Groupwide risks, including climate change risks. The committee collects the results of risk assessments conducted based on the expertise of respective divisions and units in such areas as policy, reputation, natural disasters, supply chains, products and services. Then, using information collected, the committee conducts a two-factor matrix analysis of severity and the likelihood of risks, thereby identifying high-priority risks on a Companywide level. The Sustainability Management Committee shares climate change business risks, opportunities, and countermeasures and conducts progress management.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nThe metrics managed by the Fujitsu Group are GHG emissions and the introduction rate of renewable energy, and the Group has set GHG emissions reduction targets. In fiscal 2020, the Group's GHG emissions reduction results and renewable energy introduction rate trended at levels that were in reach of the Group's targets. In April 2021, the Group increased its GHG emissions reduction target to meet the 1.5\u00b0C standard, and now aims to reduce GHG emissions at its business sites by 71.4% (vs. fiscal 2013) in fiscal 2030.\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's TCFD-based information disclosure, please visit the following website. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/environment/tcfd/index.html",

Amid this, Fujitsu is working to create value through its strategy focused on the 'For Growth' and 'For Stability' business domains.\n\nAfter the shareholders' meeting held on June 28, 2021, we asked the just-reappointed independent directors about how Fujitsu perceives the changes in society and how they are linked to Fujitsu's own transformation.\n\n--Mr. Callon, it has been one year since you were appointed as a director. Have there been any discoveries or surprises that you did not anticipate when you were looking at Fujitsu as an investor?\n\nCallon: Actually, there have been no major surprises. As an investor, I was impressed with Fujitsu's deep commitment to generating social value, as evidenced by the establishment of Fujitsu's new Purpose and reformulation of the Fujitsu Way. However, as an investor, I had to base my evaluations only on surface-level results that were visible to external investors, such as Fujitsu's business strategy and execution and operating results. As a director, I am able to see not only our results but also the processes that underpin these results, including the roles that independent directors play in corporate governance and our discussions on strategy and execution. This has bolstered my confidence in Fujitsu as an excellent company.\n\nAbe: Scott has contacts with numerous companies both as an investor and as a business executive, and he has a very broad perspective. As a member of the capital markets, Scott's opinions are very persuasive, and the executive team pays close attention to them when discussing the expectations and concerns of the capital markets and investors regarding Fujitsu. Scott's recommendations have also come into play in the capital allocation policy announced in April 2021, which represents a step forward from that announced last year.\n\nCallon: A common challenge for Japanese companies is that even when they seek to provide robust disclosure, the disclosed information may not be conveyed fully and clearly to those outside the company. Thus, for Fujitsu's own disclosure,",

        "page_content": "it is better to make our policies and goals more explicit. I have suggested this to Mr. Tokita (CEO) and Mr. Isobe (CFO), and we have discussed it with Mr. Abe.\n\n## --There is growing demand for Board oversight of climate change and other sustainability initiatives. How is Fujitsu's Board of Directors responding to this new demand?\n\nCallon: As can be seen in all of Fujitsu's business activities being linked to Our Purpose, Fujitsu's corporate values have always been that it should contribute to society and benefit all stakeholders. Japan historically has had a philosophy of 'working for mutual benefit,' so there is no need to newly articulate the concept of 'stakeholder capitalism' here.\n\nMukai: In the fields of medicine, aerospace development, and education, in which I specialize, we are always thinking about our roles and significance in society, so I think it's natural for us to respond to social issues and the needs of the people in the community. The heart of DX lies in providing solutions to social issues, and I think our Group is exactly the same. Without being sensitive to the sustainability of society, our Group itself will not be sustainable.\n\nKojo: In the international community, there is a shared understanding that climate change has a negative impact on many issues, including poverty, infectious diseases, and biodiversity. The Fujitsu Group has a high level of awareness within its executive team, as illustrated by the reformulation of the Fujitsu Way with Our Purpose as its pillar. We are proactive in addressing climate change issues, and we have set non-financial indicators to disclose our own initiatives to external stakeholders.\n\nAs a director, I am able to see not only our results but also the processes that underpin these results, including the roles that independent directors play in corporate governance and our discussions on strategy and execution. This has bolstered my confidence in Fujitsu as an excellent company.\n\nMukai: In terms of integrating sustainability and business, progress on non-financial indicators has already been incorporated into the performance evaluations of senior management, and the Compensation Committee (please see page 74), of which Dr. Kojo and I are members, has begun considering the incorporation of reflecting the achievement of nonfinancial indicators in the remuneration of executive directors. However, the specific methods need to be discussed more. For example, it will take some time to come to a conclusion on how to take into account the difference between the time horizon of sustainability and the time horizon of business; how to ensure objectivity and fairness in evaluations; and how to measure results that are not easily quantifiable.\n\n--Mr. Abe, you said here a year ago that Fujitsu was preparing to further change the way Board meetings were managed in light of the 2020 Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Specifically, what changes have been made?\n\nAbe: We have been promoting closer communication between the Board of Directors and the executive team. This is because open communication is essential for drawing rational conclusions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe independent directors' meetings have long functioned as a forum for sharing information and fostering understanding of our business. Since 2020, we have also held more than a dozen 'business overview briefings' a year. These are study sessions where we receive explanations of individual businesses from the executive team. We also hold 'private sessions' by independent directors and independent Audit & Supervisory Board members to enhance communication and share their concerns and opinions. We are also increasing opportunities for direct communication, for example, by holding one-on-one sessions between the president and independent outside directors. Mr. Kenichiro Sasae was elected as an independent director at the shareholders' meeting held today. Even before his appointment we recognized the need to have a system to shed light on what was not understood clearly for all of us, not just newly appointed Board members.\n\nMukai: The increase in communication between the Board of Directors and the executive team, and the ability to share the concerns of both parties, are really thanks to the contribution of Mr. Abe, the chairman of the Board of Directors, who acts as a link in the communication with the senior executive team.",

        "page_content": "Kojo: We now have much better communication channels to convey to the executive team what information we need and to receive feedback from the team. This is very important in terms of not leaving opinions expressed unacted on and deepening discussions at Board meetings. The management of the Board of Directors has changed more and more over the past year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I feel that each time it has done so, its functions have been strengthened.\n\nAbe: As was the case with the COVID-19 pandemic, unexpected situations occur in corporate management. What is particularly important for the executive team to take agile action in such situations is to have a common understanding of the extent to which the Board of Directors should be involved in decision making and the extent to which the executive team should involve the Board of Directors. I believe that the foundation for such common understanding is regular communication.\n\n## --What will be required in the future to further improve the effectiveness of governance, especially in terms of the diversity of the Board?\n\nCallon: One thing I think we need is independent directors who are able to discuss technology and competition in the IT services industry on an equal footing with the management team. I started my career in computers, so I have a little bit of a background; Dr. Mukai is a scientist; and Mr. Abe has a strong understanding of the IT industry. However, the IT services industry is changing dramatically, and the range of technologies that we need to understand in order to generate insights into Fujitsu's future is also very broad. Even with study, it is difficult to generate a level of understanding that supports in-depth discussions.\n\nKojo: The level of knowledge of the independent directors has definitely deepened through learning at the 'business overview briefings' and 'private sessions' that Mr. Abe alluded to earlier. Even so, it is clear that there are many technical topics that cannot be understood immediately after listening to a single explanation. Moreover, our approximately 130,000 employees have wide-ranging understanding of technical topics across the Group's broad business scope.\n\nMukai: As for my personal study, I have access to the materials of the management meetings on tablet computers provided to independent directors by the Company. In addition to reading a considerable amount of material, I ask questions to young employees who are members of the Independent Directors & Auditors Council Support Office when I don't understand something, as well as doing my own research. That said, there is much more than one person can comprehend with their own range of knowledge and understanding. That's why we need members with diverse expertise and experience.\n\nCallon: A non-diverse board is like a soccer team consisting entirely of goalkeepers. For the Board to carry out its monitoring function and discuss and articulate Fujitsu's long-term strategy, it needs access to a diversity of knowledge and skills. This should include perspectives and advice based on industry knowledge and insights generated from Fujitsu peer benchmarking.\n\nAbe: It is dif ficult to say whether expertise in computer science or IT services qualifies a person to be a member of the Board of Directors, because it is not as simple as that. It is important for the Board of Directors to have both a big-picture view and expertise as a group, and it is meaningless to satisfy only the formal requirements. This issue is also related to the function of the Board of Directors: whether it should be a so-called 'management-type' board that discusses the substance of the business, or a 'monitoring-type' board that sets management policies and subsequently focuses on confirming progress.\n\nConsidering that the heart of DX is to provide solutions to social issues, our Group's own sustainability is not possible without being sensitive to the sustainability of society.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I believe that the foundation for such common understanding is regular communication.\n\nMukai: In terms of diversity, I think it would be excellent if we could include the voices of the younger generation, regardless of whether or not they directly participate in Board meetings. Looking further into the future than the medium to long term ultimately comes down to the question of how young people will change society and what they want to change.\n\n--Finally, what are your opinions and expectations regarding the next steps for value creation at Fujitsu, and what are your own aspirations?\n\nKojo: The future of the COVID-19 situation remains uncertain, and there is no foreseeable end to the crises that threaten the sustainability of society in the future. Under such circumstances, I would like to ask what kind of value our Group can provide to society, and I hope to continue to enhance my skills in doing so.\n\nMukai: This is the third year since our Group turned its direction toward DX, so we need to be able to show tangible results from our efforts to our customers and other external\n\nstakeholders. Personally, I am looking forward to the expansion of business that utilizes the data within our Group of 130,000 employees, and I myself need to learn more in order to consider the possibilities.\n\nCallon: In the past, hardware made up a large part of our business and required significant, ongoing capital investment. Today, however, we need to make decisions-essentially for the first time ever-on how to allocate the cash from our large cash flow generation capability. Since this cash is hardearned and valuable, we need to determine whether potential\n\ninvestments are businesses with high success probabilities and leverage Fujitsu's unique strengths. I support Fujitsu's Purpose-driven ambition to transform itself and strengthen its ability to solve important social problems, along with the dedication of all employees globally to grow long-term value for all stakeholders.\n\nAbe: With regard to internal reforms, under the leadership of CEO Tokita, Fujitsu's own DX promotion initiative, 'Fujitra,' has changed mindsets in our Group and is bringing about real changes. In terms of business, we have taken the necessary steps, including the establishment of a new company. From now on, we will monitor the results of our efforts to strengthen our problem-solving capabilities and support the executive team in achieving our goals by urging them on.\n\nAs chairman of the Board of Directors, I will continue to focus on eliciting the opinions of each director and communicating with the executive team to reach conclusions through open discussion. I will conduct meetings with a sense of urgency, as if we are being monitored by a third party, to ensure that we are having rational discussions.\n\nThe future of the COVID-19 situation remains uncertain, and there is no foreseeable end to the crises that threaten the sustainability of society in the future. Under such circumstances, I would like to ask what kind of value our Group can provide to society.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Message from the New Independent Director\n\nFujitsu is one of Japan's leading companies in the field of advanced technology, including services related to information technology and the development of supercomputers. The further development and success of its business is important from the perspective of progress and benefits not only for Japan but for all of humanity.\n\nI believe that Fujitsu's Purpose-\"to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation'aligns with the needs of our times. Fujitsu has also defined 'Aspiration,' supported by diversity and curiosity; 'Trust,' or acting with ethics and transparency; and 'Empathy,' listening to society and various stakeholders including shareholders, as important values. This is a thoughtful stance not only in the business world but also in considering the ideal form of nations and the international community as a whole.\n\nI am delighted to be able to participate as an independent director in a company that advocates such values and principles. I have served as an independent director at other companies as well, and I feel that corporate governance reforms in Japan in recent years are still underway in many\n\ncompanies, and that such reforms vary depending on the characteristics of each company. I hope that Fujitsu will continue to pursue new challenges and innovation and to evolve its business under its unique but internationally competitive governance, while maintaining its admirable culture. I see my role as an independent director to support this endeavor from a wider perspective, and I hope that my experience in the field of diplomacy will be useful here.\n\nThe Japan Institute of International Affairs, where I serve as president, was presented with the '2020 Think Tank of the Year-Top Think Tank in the World' award, and its findings may be of some help. Competition for technology among companies is intensifying around the world, and nations and groups of nations are looking to gain the ascendancy. In an age when those who control technology control the rules and the order of the surrounding data and cyber space, I would like to support Fujitsu in making the best choices between various alliances and partnerships and help navigate between liberalized and tightly regulated markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kenichiro Sasae\n\nPresident\n\nThe Japan Institute of International Affairs (JIIA)",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance\n\n## Basic Approach to Corporate Governance\n\nThe Company regards corporate governance as a critical mechanism to fulfill the senior management team's mission in a manner befitting shareholders' trust. This mission is based on Our Purpose (from the Fujitsu Way), and enables a form of business management that, rather than pursuing short-term profits, earns the trust of customers and business partners, motivates employees to work with vitality and pride, and contributes to society. Through such business management, the Company will grow and enhance corporate value over the medium to long term.\n\n## Structural Framework\n\nThe Company endeavors to ensure that the oversight and advice from the diverse perspectives of non-executive directors (the term used for the combination of independent directors and non-executive directors appointed from within the Company) are reflected in the management execution of executive directors, as part of the Board of Directors' function while leveraging the advantages of a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board system. (For the specific measures, please see '1. Overview of Corporate Governance Structure.')\n\nBased on a decision made by the Board of Directors in December 2015, the Company has established a basic policy, 'Corporate Governance Policy,' summarizing its approach to corporate governance. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/ir/library/governance/governancereport-b-en-20211223.pdf\n\nIn addition, for details on corporate governance, please visit the Fujitsu website (About Fujitsu > Sustainability > Corporate Governance):\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/csr/governance/\n\n## Initiatives Taken to Strengthen Corporate Governance\n\n## Reduced directors' terms to one year\n\nTo further clarify directors' management responsibilities\n\n## Established the Independent Directors & Auditors Council\n\nTo support independent directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, who maintain a certain degree of separation from the execution of business activities, in consistently gaining a deeper understanding of Fujitsu's business\n\n## Established Corporate Governance Policy\n\nTo explain to shareholders basic policies\n\non the establishment and operation of systems in light of basic approaches to corporate governance For the complete Corporate Governance Policy, please visit the following website. https://www.fujitsu.com/global/ about/ir/library/governance/ governancereport-b-en-20211223.pdf\n\n## Appointed independent director as chairman of the Board\n\nIndependent directors are appointed as chairman of the Board, chairperson of the Executive Nomination Committee, and chairperson of the Compensation Committee in order to strengthen the supervisory function.\n\n2006\n\n2009\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n## Established the Executive Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee\n\nTo ensure the transparency and objectivity of the process for choosing candidates for executives and the process of determining compensation, and to ensure an appropriate compensation system and level\n\n## Introduced performance-based stock compensation plan\n\nTo incentivize executive directors to improve medium- to long-term corporate value and to promote shareholder-oriented business management\n\n## Abolished senior executive advisor/ advisor system\n\nTo clarify management responsibility and strengthen corporate governance Fujitsu will enter into commission contracts with retiring officers, who will be known as 'senior advisors' or 'senior fellows,' on an individual basis and subject to a resolution of the Board of Directors, in cases where such treatment of retiring officers is indispensable as they are to be appointed as an officer of an unaffiliated organization, or where it is judged the individual is particularly useful for Fujitsu's business operations.\n\n## Made independent directors a majority on the Board of Directors\n\nAmong nine directors, five independent directors constitute a majority. Our aim is to increase the transparency and objectivity of deliberations.",

        "page_content": "## Appointment of External Directors and Auditors\n\nFujitsu actively appoints external directors and auditors to increase management transparency and further improve efficiency.\n\nFujitsu determines independence based on the independence standards stated above. All external directors and auditors have been registered with and accepted as independent directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members by the financial instruments exchanges on which Fujitsu is listed in Japan.\n\nFujitsu's views on the roles, functions, and specific reasons for nomination of external directors and external Audit & Supervisory Board members are as follows:\n\n## External Directors\n\nChiaki Mukai\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAtsushi Abe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYoshiko Kojo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScott Callon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKenichiro Sasae\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr. Chiaki Mukai has an impressive personal history as a doctor who became Asia's first female astronaut, and she exemplifies the Company's spirit of taking on challenges at the cutting edge of science. She led discussions on executive compensation in her capacity as the chairperson of the Compensation Committee. The Company expects that she will continue to be able to provide oversight and advice as an external director from a fair and objective global perspective based on broad knowledge of science and technology. Fujitsu and Academic Corporation Tokyo University of Science, which operates the Tokyo University of Science where Dr. Mukai serves as vice president, had business transactions in fiscal 2020 amounting to approximately \u00a561 million. Taking into account the scale of our sales, the amount of transactions is immaterial and does not constitute a conflict of interest. Therefore, Fujitsu considers Dr. Mukai to be independent.\n\nMr. Atsushi Abe has gained a deep understanding of the ICT industry and mergers and acquisitions through many years of experience in investment banking and private equity. As chairman of the Board of Directors, he has been managing proceedings objectively from his perspective as an investor gained through his experience to date and dialogues with institutional investors and has been leading discussions on the aforementioned. The Company expects that, in addition to being able to provide oversight and advice as an external director from a shareholder and investor perspective, Mr. Abe will continue to contribute to timely and decisive management decision making. Mr. Abe has never been a major shareholder, nor has he held a position involved in business execution of a major business partner of the Company. Therefore, Fujitsu considers Mr. Abe to be independent.\n\nDr. Yoshiko Kojo served in important positions, including the president of the Japan Association of International Relations, and her research has for many years focused mainly on the impact of economic entities (including private companies) on international politics. The Company expects that she will be able to provide extensive advice and oversight as an external director concerning the Company's responses to change in the external environment during a dramatic transition of international politics and with regard to initiatives for SDGs based on her deep insight. Dr. Kojo has never been a major shareholder, nor has she held a position involved in business execution of a major business partner of the Company. Therefore, Fujitsu considers Dr. Kojo to be independent.\n\nPreviously, Mr. Scott Callon worked at a foreign-affiliated securities firm. Currently, he serves as the chief executive officer of Ichigo Asset Management, Ltd., an independent investment advisory firm specializing in Japanese equity investment. He has garnered experience in conducting dialogues with investee companies as an institutional investor. From his past experience, the Company expects Mr. Callon to be able to provide oversight and advice from a shareholder and investor perspective and has designated him as an external director. Fujitsu and Japan Display Inc., where Mr. Callon is chairman, CEO, and representative executive officer, had business transactions in fiscal 2020 amounting to approximately \u00a5380 million. Taking into account the scale of our sales, the amount of transactions is immaterial and does not constitute a conflict of interest. Additionally, Ichigo Trust Pte. Ltd., which jointly holds voting rights with Ichigo Asset Management, Ltd., where Mr. Callon serves as chief executive officer, is our principal shareholder, although it does not fall under major shareholders stipulated in our independence standards. As he has never held a position involved in business execution of a major business partner of the Company, Fujitsu considers Mr. Callon to be independent.\n\nMr. Kenichiro Sasae has served in important positions including as the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the United States of America, and currently as the president of The Japan Institute of International Affairs. He has extensive knowledge and practical experience in international politics and economics. As the international situation has become more complicated in recent times, the Company expects that Mr. Sasae will be able to provide oversight and advice from a fair and objective global perspective based on his extensive knowledge and experience. Therefore, the Company expects that he will be able to fulfill his supervisory function and role as independent director. The Japan Institute of International Affairs, where Mr. Sasae serves as president, and the Company have no business relationship. As he has never held a position involved in business execution of a major business partner of the Company, Fujitsu considers Mr. Sasae to be independent.\n\n## External Audit & Supervisory Board Members\n\n| Koji Hatsukawa   | Mr. Koji Hatsukawa has been appointed as an external Audit & Supervisory Board member because he has a wealth of auditing experience at global corporations  as a certified public accountant as well as broad knowledge of corporate accounting. PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata (currently, PricewaterhouseCoopers  Aarata LLC), where Mr. Hatsukawa served as CEO, has not performed accounting audits for Fujitsu. Fujitsu and PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata had business  transactions in fiscal 2020 amounting to approximately \u00a5400 thousand. Taking into account the scale of our revenue, the amount of transactions is immaterial  and does not constitute a conflict of interest. Therefore, Fujitsu considers Mr. Hatsukawa to be independent.   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hideo Makuta     | Mr. Hideo Makuta has been designated as an external Audit & Supervisory Board member because he has profound insight into not only legal but also  economic and social matters affecting corporate management, gained through his career as a public prosecutor and as a commissioner of the Japan Fair  Trade Commission. Therefore, Fujitsu considers Mr. Makuta to be independent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |",

        "page_content": "## Systems for Ensuring the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nIn enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, the Company has focused on creating a system under which non-executive directors function effectively. Specifically, the Company believes it essential to establish a system that enables independent directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, who maintain a certain degree of separation from the execution of business activities, to consistently gain a deeper understanding of the Company's business. The Independent Directors & Auditors Council convenes on multiple occasions each year (nine times in fiscal 2020), and its members share information and exchange viewpoints so that each member can formulate their own opinions. In fiscal 2020, the members shared information and exchanged viewpoints on matters including the Company's Management Direction, the scope of business of the Company and of the Group as a whole. Based on the knowledge gained through the council, each independent director and Audit & Supervisory Board member provided advice to the Board of Directors. Moreover, to facilitate the operation of the Independent Directors & Auditors Council, the Company established the Independent Directors & Auditors Council Support Office in 2015. Under this system, one junior employee is assigned to support each council member so that they are able to acquire information through the support of these employees without requiring the mediation of the management execution team.\n\n## 3. Executive Compensation\n\n## Policy for Deciding Executive Compensation\n\nTo ensure a more highly transparent executive compensation system, Fujitsu established the Compensation Committee by a resolution of the Board of Directors at a meeting held in October 2009. The amounts of remuneration for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members summarized in 'Details of Remuneration' on page 77 are determined within the scope of total compensation established by resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting based on the framework of the policy on the determination of the details of compensation, etc., for individual directors (hereinafter referred to as the 'Determination Policy'), which was determined by the Board of Directors following the recommendation by the Compensation Committee. Compensation for each director is determined by the representative director and CEO subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, and compensation for each Audit & Supervisory Board member is decided based on consultation with the Audit & Supervisory Board members.\n\nDetails of the Determination Policy are as follows.\n\n## Summary\n\nFujitsu has determined executive compensation to secure the exceptional talent necessary to manage the Fujitsu Group as a global ICT company and to further strengthen the link between its financial performance and shareholder value, while simultaneously improving its transparency. With an eye to these requirements, executive compensation comprises the following: 'Base Compensation,' specifically a fixed monthly salary in accordance with position and responsibilities; 'Bonuses,' which are compensation linked to short-term business performance; and 'Performance-based Stock Compensation,' which is a long-term incentive that emphasizes the connection to shareholder value.\n\n## Base Compensation\n\nBase compensation is paid to all directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members. A fixed monthly amount shall be determined for each executive in accordance with the position and responsibilities of each executive.\n\n## Bonuses\n\n- \u00b7  Bonuses shall be paid to directors who carry out executive responsibilities. The bonus amount shall reflect business performance in the respective fiscal year.\n- \u00b7  As a specific method for calculating a bonus, Fujitsu shall adopt an 'On Target' model that uses consolidated revenue and consolidated operating profit as indicators, and the amount shall be determined in accordance with the degree of achievement of the performance targets for the respective fiscal year.\n\n## Performance-based Stock Compensation\n\n- \u00b7  Performance-based stock compensation shall be granted to directors who are responsible for the execution of duties to share gains with shareholders and to help enhance the Company's medium- to long-term performance.\n- \u00b7  Base numbers of shares for respective ranks, a performance evaluation period (three years), mediumto long-term performance targets based on consolidated revenue and consolidated operating profit, and coefficients corresponding to degrees of achievement of these performance targets shall be set in advance. Base numbers of shares shall be multiplied by coefficients corresponding to degrees of achievement of performance targets. After the number of shares for each fiscal year has been calculated, the total number of shares shall be allocated upon completion of the performance evaluation period.\n\n## Composition Ratio for Each Type of Executive Compensation\n\n- \u00b7  With the aim of setting competitive compensation that contributes to securing and retaining exceptional talent, executive compensation shall be determined based on the financial position of the Company, comparing the compensation composition ratio and compensation levels for each executive position at other companies with similar business lines and similar scale as benchmarks.\n- \u00b7  The ratio of performance-based compensation to the total compensation for executive directors shall be determined so as to strengthen the link between the Group's financial performance and shareholder value by setting higher ratios for higher ranks.\n- \u00b7  In the decision process, the Compensation Committee shall deliberate to ensure objectivity and validity.",

Policy for Strategic Shareholdings\n\nThe Company holds only those strategic shares with clear-cut objectives and meaningful significance in a positive manner. The Board of Directors Meeting examines the weighted average capital cost of the Company as the standard to evaluate quantitatively whether returns (quantitative factors such as dividends and the state of transactions) or risks are well balanced with the cost. If quantitative significance in shareholdings is not found, the Board of Directors Meeting will further evaluate whether there is a qualitative reason that supports the rationale for continuing to hold those shares and will discuss the continuation of such holdings. In fiscal 2020, the Company sold 23 issues, and at the Board of Directors Meeting, held on June 24, 2021, the Board determined which strategic shareholdings would be held by the Company at the end of fiscal 2020. The Company deals with strategic shareholders on an equal footing, just as it does with other business partners. Even when strategic shareholders indicate their sale of shares, we do not prevent them from selling. That said, we sometimes call upon them to consider the timing of the sale or the ways of selling their shares.\n\n## 5.  Views and Policies for Group Management and Measures to Ensure the Effectiveness of Corporate Governance\n\nFujitsu manages the Fujitsu Group with the aim of achieving continuous growth and the generation of medium- to long-term corporate value of the entire Group, while also urging each Group company to realize its potential to the maximum extent possible.\n\nFor some subsidiaries, we publicly list them with the aim of further improving their business value through diversification of the capital procurement necessary for sustainable growth and enhancing the value of the entire Group. By publicly listing subsidiaries, it is possible to focus on investment in specific businesses rather than just in the Group as a whole, thus contributing to diversifying investment opportunities. As there are some concerns regarding the possibility of a conflict of interest with minority shareholders and our publicly listed subsidiaries, we respect the independence of their management and make efforts to provide advice and support to enhance the corporate value of relevant subsidiaries by holding reporting sessions on an as-needed basis. To further promote our policies for Group management, we established a department in February 2020 as a corporate function that specializes in formulating and conducting plans and measures for the most suitable group formation and corporate governance, thus handling the management of the Group including listed subsidiaries.\n\nOur policy is to turn non-core listed companies into strong independent businesses. We will consider their independence from the following perspectives: ensuring sustainable growth of the relevant business, maximizing the Company's asset value, and considering the best timing for independence.\n\n## Measures to Ensure the Effectiveness of Corporate Governance\n\nFujitsu understands that its publicly listed subsidiaries make efforts to enhance corporate governance and provides support for these efforts. We recommend our listed subsidiaries to each become a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee to strengthen corporate governance. Accordingly, all listed subsidiaries are ensured their independence by appointing independent directors and directors dispatched from the Company to help maximize their corporate value.",

Furthermore, independent directors and auditors continued to hold the Independent Directors & Auditors Council in an effort to facilitate the exchange of information and formulation of opinions between them, and private sessions hosted by the independent directors were introduced as a platform for the independent directors and auditors to form opinions.\n\nThe evaluation of fiscal 2020 includes an evaluation of the chairman, and as in fiscal 2019, an anonymous questionnaire with a five-grade evaluation was conducted. From fiscal 2020, self-evaluations by directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members are also being carried out. The results of the questionnaire were reported at a regular meeting of the Board of Directors, and discussions based on the results were also held at this time. In addition, an evaluation of the Board of Directors by a proxy advisory firm was also conducted.\n\n- \u00b7  Compared to the previous year, overall improvements were recognized. However, there is room for further improvement in document format and volume as well as the information provided.\n- \u00b7  To enable the review of high-priority items, sharing information in advance and enhancing vital communication between Board members is important.

Accordingly, the Board of Directors formulated the Basic Policy on the Internal Control Structure. Based on this policy, the Fujitsu Group established a Risk Management & Compliance Committee reporting directly to the Board of Directors, which acts as the highest-level decision-making body on matters involving risk management and compliance.\n\nThe committee also assigns risk management compliance officers to each of Fujitsu's divisions and to Group companies in Japan and internationally. These organizations collaborate to build a risk management and compliance structure for the entire Group, thereby guarding against potential risks and mitigating risks that have already materialized.\n\nFurthermore, we created the Corporate Risk Management Division in November 2020, which reports directly to the CEO. This new body is responsible for risk management across the entire Fujitsu Group and is best positioned to interpret risk-related information and to spearhead rapid, appropriate responses where required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Risk Management & Compliance Committee identifies, analyzes, and assesses the major risks associated with business activities in all Fujitsu business divisions and Group companies in Japan and other countries. (Among the Group companies, implementation is focused on 33 risks identified as particularly important.) It also checks the progress of measures designed to avoid, mitigate, transfer and accept such risks, and then formulates new measures or reviews existing measures.

If a critical risk arises, such as a natural disaster, a product fault or defect, a system or service problem, a compliance violation, an information security breach, or an environmental problem, the division or Group company concerned reports immediately to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee.\n\nThis committee then coordinates with the related divisions and work sites to quickly resolve the problem by taking appropriate steps, such as establishing a task force. At the same time, the committee works to identify the causes of the problem and proposes and implements measures to prevent any recurrence. For critical risks, the committee also reports as needed to the Board of Directors. The Risk Management & Compliance Committee checks the progress of implementation of these processes on an ongoing basis and formulates improvements.\n\n## The Fujitsu Group's Response to COVID-19 Based on Business Continuity Plan\n\nRecent years have seen a significant increase in the risk of unforeseen events that threaten continued economic and social activity. Such events include earthquakes, floods and other large-scale natural disasters, and pandemics involving infectious diseases. To ensure that the Fujitsu Group can continue to provide a stable supply of products and services that customers require even when such unforeseen circumstances occur, we have formulated a Business Continuity Plan (BCP). We are also promoting Business Continuity Management (BCM) as a way of continually reviewing and improving our BCP.\n\nTo respond to the spread of COVID-19 and maintain the safety of its customers, suppliers, and employees and their families, the Fujitsu Group has placed the highest priority on preventing the spread of the infection, based on the BCP. The Group is also promoting initiatives to sustain the supply of products and services to customers and to help resolve the many societal issues that have arisen due to the spread of the infection.\n\nSpecific initiatives include recommending that employees work from home or stagger their working hours, and switching internal company meetings and events to a videoconference format or other web-based sessions. Furthermore, operations previously carried out on-site at customers' locations, such as system development, operations, and maintenance, have been switched to remote operations, and in cases where on-site operations are essential, we request that measures such as social distancing and ventilating work areas be taken. By putting in place a set of countermeasures in cooperation with customers and government agencies in Japan and elsewhere, our goal is to maintain key business operations and meet our social responsibilities.\n\n## Business Risks of the Fujitsu Group\n\nThe Fujitsu Group identifies, analyzes, and assesses the risks associated with business activities and works on measures to avoid or mitigate their impact and to deal promptly with any issues that do occur.\n\nFor details on the Fujitsu Group's business and other risks, please see the risk management section in Sustainability Data Book 2021, disclosed on the following website.\n\nhttps://www.fujitsu.com/about/csr/riskmanagement/\n\n## Main Business Risks\n\n- \u00b7  Economic and financial market trends\n- \u00b7 Customers\n- \u00b7  Competitors and the industry\n- \u00b7  Investment decisions and\n- business restructuring\n- \u00b7  Suppliers, alliances, etc.\n- \u00b7  Public regulations, public policy, and tax matters\n- \u00b7  Natural disasters and unforeseen incidents\n- \u00b7 Finance\n- \u00b7  Deficiencies or flaws in products and services\n- \u00b7  Compliance issues\n- \u00b7  Intellectual property\n- \u00b7 Security\n- \u00b7  Human resources\n- \u00b7  Fujitsu Group facilities and systems\n- \u00b7 Environment",

Changes to how people work are also making it necessary to reevaluate and, if needed, overhaul security defense frameworks to keep up with the times.\n\nThe Fujitsu Group has adopted the idea of a multilayered defense as the basic concept of its information security measures, using multiple different measures to defend against cyberattacks, which are typified by targeted attacks that cannot be protected against by a single security measure. As IT environments change from being hosted on-site to on the cloud, we are making the shift from the concept of a multilayered defense to one of 'zero trust' which trusts no user or device by default, operating under the premise that all networks, devices, users, and applications will be attacked. We apply 'zero trust' to the three axes of cybersecurity, physical security, and information management, and ensure internal information security by authorizing access to information assets after authenticating the legitimacy of the user.",

As a measure against targeted cyberattacks, we have built an authorization- and authenticationbased infrastructure, in addition to taking measures against unauthorized access and malware, in combination with measures against unauthorized device management and ID management, and data breaches. We are introducing measures to fight ever more sophisticated, varied, and complex cyberattacks.\n\n## Protection of Personal Information\n\nAs part of our efforts to protect personal information, Fujitsu acquired the PrivacyMark* 4 from JIPDEC in August 2007. We are also working to continually enhance our personal information protection, including annual training and audits on personal information handling.\n\nDomestic Group companies also acquire the PrivacyMark as needed and implement thorough personal information management. Privacy policies based on the laws and social demands of each country are posted on the websites of overseas Group companies.\n\n- *4  The PrivacyMark is granted to business operators that appropriately handle personal information under personal information management systems that conform to JIS Q 15001:2017.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Response to the GDPR* 5\n\nFujitsu has developed a global personal information protection scheme and is working to further strengthen the protection of personal data. Under the guidance of the CISO organization and legal business units, we are cooperating with entities such as our European subsidiaries to develop various internal rules and guidelines related to the protection of individual rights in response to the GDPR. We have also made check sheets for our design and initial setting. Furthermore, we have updated the operation process in accordance with such internal rules and guidelines and have held employee training sessions.\n\nIn response to regulations on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, we provide appropriate contractual and technical support in accordance with legal requirements. We applied to the Dutch Data Protection Authority in December 2017 for our Binding Corporate Rules for Processors, which are common rules established across the Fujitsu Group related to the handling of personal data that customers have entrusted to the Group for processing.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission and Japan have mutually recognized each other's data protection laws, which went into effect on January 23, 2019, as providing an adequate level of protection. Based on this recognition, Fujitsu has established internal rules related to the handling of personal information moved between regions and spreads awareness regarding those rules.\n\n- *5  The GDPR (EU regulations requiring companies, organizations, and groups to protect personal data) was enacted on May 25, 2018. It includes regulations on transferring personal data out of the European Economic Area and the obligation to report personal data breach within 72 hours.",

In the fiscal year ending March  31, 2022, economic activity is expected to  return gradually to normal, with an  attendant restart of IT projects and an  increase in new projects related to digital  transformation (DX). DX initiatives including  modernization of existing legacy IT systems  are expected to accelerate in response to  changes in lifestyle patterns and workstyles  brought about by COVID-19.                                                                                       | Revenue Revenue in Solutions/Services was \u00a51,765.9 billion, down 6.2%  year on year. This decrease is due to impacts of COVID-19,  including delays of business negotiations with customers in the  enterprise and healthcare sectors, a fallback after the  completion of a major business deal in the finance and retail  sector, and a nationwide development halt in the infrastruc- ture business among local governments. In addition, the end of  the support period for Windows 7 in 2020 led to a fallback in  areas like PC setup and deployment support in the hardware- related business, which had performed strongly in the previous  fiscal year.  Operating Profit Operating profit was \u00a5183.5 billion, up \u00a54.0 billion year on year.  This increase is due to an improvement in profitability in  Solutions/SI and operation and maintenance services, as well as | (Billions of yen) 2,000 1,500 1,000 1,883.0 1,883.0 | 200 150 100                                                                 | (Billions of yen)  179.5 179.5                                              | 183.5 183.5 10.4 10.4                                                       | (%) 20.0 15.0 10.0                                                          |    |    |\n| Technology  Solutions | System  Platforms    | Impacted by a decline in IT investments due  to delays and standstills of projects caused  by the spread of COVID-19, the domestic  System Platforms market contracted in the  fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. In the fiscal  year ending March 31, 2022, the market is  expected to return to growth with the  restart of these projects and the start of  new DX-related projects.  Driven by the switch from LTE to 5G, the  size of the North American and Japanese  mobile infrastructure markets has increased,  and demand for O-RAN-compliant base  stations in particular is expected to grow  rapidly.

Despite a decline in revenue for System Products including  servers and storage systems due to COVID-19, revenue increased  due to a major business deal related to supercomputers and  growth in demand for communication infrastructure including  5G base stations and optical transmission networks in the  network business. Operating Profit Operating profit was \u00a541.2 billion, up \u00a513.7 billion year on year.

Despite securing a deal for a  large-scale IT system development project in Europe, the  strong impact of COVID-19 in the regions outside of Japan, as  well as business reorganization measures like the withdrawal  from low-profit businesses in Europe and the products business  in the Americas led to a decline in revenue.  Operating Profit Operating profit was \u00a511.6 billion, up \u00a57.7 billion year on year.  Operating profit grew due to improvements and an increase in  profit in the NWE (Northern & Western Europe) and the  Americas businesses and the absence of the previous fiscal  year's business model transformation expenses centered on  North America. The decline in revenue was offset by improved  profitability and higher efficiency in relation to expenses  stemming from the first positive results of business model  transformation initiatives.
