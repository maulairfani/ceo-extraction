        "page_content": "## MESSAGE OF THE CHAIRMAN\n\nFellow Shareholders,\n\nSince Manila Water began more than 20 years ago, your company has constantly made significant strides in growth and stability, owing to our many years of experience in resolving numerous challenges which came our way. From the early difficulties in rehabilitating the East Zone water and wastewater system, to the raw water shortage and regulatory challenges last year, Manila Water has always persevered and come out stronger.\n\n2020, however, was unique in that we faced a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to fundamentally challenge our economic and healthcare systems, and ultimately, the way we live. We also had to deal with the Taal eruption and the many typhoons last year, which tested our operations and commitment to our stakeholders.\n\nYour Company responded to these challenges by prioritizing stakeholder welfare, ensuring efficiency and effective execution of our operations, and building a solid platform for growth and resilience entering a post-COVID world.\n\nLet me first talk about our efforts to protect our stakeholders. Our first priority was to ensure the health and safety of our employees, while ensuring 24/7 availability of water services. We deployed technical personnel to key facilities on a rotating basis. Sacrificing time with their family and loved ones, these managers manned their posts over extended periods of time to ensure continued water, and sanitation services to residences, health centers and government facilities.\n\nSimilarly, our project delivery teams worked with our contractor partners to safely restart our infrastructure projects as quarantine restrictions were eased. These projects also supported our contractor partners and their employees with much-needed livelihood\n\nduring critical times. The construction of new wastewater infrastructure, further improvements to our water distribution network, and the execution of new water supply projects will provide an even higher level of service in our concession area, as well as source much needed water supply for the short to medium-term.\n\nMeanwhile, we also supported our customers through extended payment periods and temporary suspension of disconnection activities for past-due accounts amidst the community quarantines. We thank the MWSS Regulatory Office for the partnership in alleviating our customers' economic plight.\n\nFor the community-at-large, Manila Water worked with government, our sister companies in the Ayala Group, and other private sector partners to establish the We Heal As One treatment facility at the World Trade Center. Capable of accommodating 500 patients, Manila Water played a crucial role in immediately constructing hygiene and sanitation facilities for quarantined patients. We also assisted local government units by providing potable water for our healthcare and law enforcement frontliners in the field, as well as ensuring that hospitals will have uninterrupted service.\n\nManila Water engaged in a disciplined exercise to assess our portfolio. Unfortunately, this meant discontinuing our Healthy Family packaged water operations, as well as provisions for several of our domestic and international businesses that were encountering difficulties. We added liquidity and strength to our already robust balance sheet with the successful issuance of our Sustainability Bonds in the middle of 2020. The proceeds from these bonds will be used to finance several critical projects in the near term. We are delighted that the Sustainability Bonds further cements our commitment to ESG business practices, which we have pioneered in the Philippine water space.",

This important milestone is the culmination of several months of hard work and discussion with several key government agencies to arrive at what we see as a new working template for public-private partnership. We believe that this is a solid foundation from which to continue providing more reliable service to our customers in the East Zone through key infrastructure investments.\n\nFinally, as we look to opportunities in the future, we are delighted to introduce a new partner into Manila Water with the entry of the Razon group as soon as regulatory processes are complete. Mr. Ricky Razon and his team bring a solid track record and global experience in managing regulated businesses, as well as in successfully operationalizing concession contracts and public-private partnerships. We are excited for the synergies this partnership brings to Manila Water and to our stakeholders.\n\nTo close, Manila Water has always risen to any challenge, and has consistently emerged stronger. Over the years, we have honed our technical skills to attain operating efficiencies considered by many as among the most advanced in the world.\n\nFor over 20 years, we have invested around Php116 billion in water infrastructure. This has created around 5,200km of pipes that deliver over a billion liters of potable water per day to more than seven million Filipinos in Metro Manila. Sanitation and wastewater coverage also expanded to nearly two million of our countrymen in the East Zone. We are proud that our colleagues at Manila Water - a unique mix of seasoned pioneers, and young and innovative individuals - have transformed Manila Water into a world-class company.\n\nWe are proud that the efforts of our Company have been recognized by several international institutions, which include the Asian Human Capital Award by the government of Singapore. We have also received a recognition as One of Asia's Top Greenest Companies by FinanceAsia,",

        "page_content": "## MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\nMr. Chairman, Members of the Board, fellow shareholders and stakeholders of Manila Water.\n\nThe year 2020 has been an unprecedented year for all of us on many levels. I can best describe  it as the year when Manila Water was hit with a 'Perfect Storm' where multiple challenges converged, further complicating their individual impact. The 'Perfect Storm' of the raw water supply challenges, natural disasters including the eruption of Taal, the political storm of the Concession Agreement challenge, and the final blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, all compounded and enhanced each other's adverse impacts, exacerbating the situation. I am happy to report, your Company persevered and continued to fulfill its service mission. Not only did we cope, we adapted, and even improved our capacities and capabilities.\n\nManila Water's 2020 net income declined 18% from the previous year to Php4.5 billion. This decline was driven by the lower contribution of our domestic subsidiaries due to the impact of COVID-19 on the business, as well as the recognition of additional expenses for estimated probable losses across the group.\n\nFor our East Zone operations housed under the Parent Company, the slowdown of business activity brought about by the imposed Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) resulted in lower billed volume from our commercial and industrial segments. This was, however, offset by an increase in the residential segment as more people were confined to their homes. While this shift caused revenues to remain relatively flat versus last year, our resilient service performance even under the imposed quarantine bolstered a 3% improvement in total billed volume.\n\nOn the other hand, the onset of the COVID-19 resulted in higher receivables, with the suspension of disconnection activities and the government-mandated extension for customer payments. Collection efficiency dropped to 63% in the middle of the year, but we focused and pushed recovery to a year-end level of 92% through the efforts of our Business Areas and Territory Teams.\n\nFurthermore, cost and expenses decreased 18% to Php5.4 billion, driven by our aggressive cost management initiatives despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the recognized impairment loss for our investment in Manila Water Total Solutions, 2020 net income of the Parent Company stood at Php4.7 billion for the year, a 7% decline from 2019.\n\nFor our domestic subsidiaries under Manila Water Philippine Ventures, the pandemic significantly impacted our businesses in Boracay and Clark, with travel restrictions causing an 84% decline in tourist arrivals in Boracay and the imposed quarantines in Clark contributing to a 7% drop in billed volume. For our Estate Water business, the 70% decline in supervision fees was driven largely by the deferment of projects due to quarantine restrictions, and in part by the change in accounting treatment of supervision fees. This impact was partially offset by the notable performance of our other subsidiaries such as Laguna Water, as well as the start of operations in several expansion areas even under the prevailing challenges posed by COVID-19.\n\nFor our international businesses under Manila Water Asia Pacific, our equity share in net income of associates declined by 67% to Php214 million, with the lower contribution from East Water and Saigon Water. This was partially offset by the increase in contribution from Thu Duc and Kenh Dong Water.\n\nDespite the global difficulties presented by the pandemic, in December 2020 we successfully closed a Management, Operations and Maintenance Contract with Saudi Arabia's state-run water agency, the National Water Company. This operations and maintenance contract is in partnership with the French water distributor Saur Group and Saudi's Miahona Company. The seven-year agreement covers the implementation of enabling projects and the management of the water and wastewater facilities and systems of the North West Cluster served by National Water Company. The cluster includes the cities of Madinah and Tabuk, comprised of 300,000 square kilometers of land area, with a population of more than three million. In all, Manila Water Asia Pacific ended the year at a net loss of Php371 million. Excluding one-offs which was mainly the recognition of additional estimates for probable losses in our investment in Cu Chi, core income stood at Php163 million, 12% higher than last year.\n\nLastly, for Manila Water Total Solutions we announced the closure of our Healthy Family business division effective October 31 last year due to the unit's inability to financially sustain business operations. Manila Water Total Solutions will continue to exist and operate in line with its primary purpose of providing water, wastewater and environmental services and solutions.\n\nWith the onset of the community quarantine in March, we implemented business contingency measures like never before, to ensure that critical facilities and business",

Particularly, in view of health and safety concerns, we suspended meter reading activities for the duration of the ECQ. When community quarantine restrictions were eased, we immediately focused on customer concerns regarding billing and payment.  Furthermore, customers were provided concessions on bill payments by way of extended payment periods and installment plans when applicable. Equally important, we pushed for the development and adoption of various electronic/online platforms to promote added convenience and safety for customers in their settlement of bills. We launched our one-stop customer portal, my.manilawater.app. This new platform provides our customers not only with a more convenient alternative to view and pay for their water bills online, but an easier, and more effective way to interact with Manila Water.\n\nFor our employees, we quickly deployed five (5) key initiatives focused on their personal well-being, workplace health and safety, mental wellness, personalized employee communications and undisrupted training through digital and virtual channels. In all these we saw the commitment of our team members to continue serving our customers despite the pandemic risk. Mindful of their passion, we only deployed essential technical and business operations teams at the facilities while the rest remained on a split work from home deployment protocol. Re-entering team members were initially required rapid testing to ensure workplace safety. What kept me up at night was the thought of over 500 team members out there servicing our customers during the initial, most challenging phase of the lockdowns.  I worried about anyone of them getting infected, but am very happy to report we have not lost anyone to COVID-19 due to work assignment exposure.\n\n97% Water Availability for East Zone maintained at\n\nOur efforts to remain resilient and deliver on our service commitments in the face of challenges has yielded benefits for our customers and stakeholders. Reliable water availability for the East Zone was consistent throughout the year.  In all, our total CAPEX implementation for the Company reached a historical all-time high of Php12 billion. This was achieved despite the difficulties caused by quarantine restrictions, strict safety and health re-entry guidelines, contactor limitations, and supply chain challenges.\n\nIn Manila Water, our service commitment inspires us to forge ahead in the face of adversity and find ways to become more innovative and resilient. The difficult challenges we faced in 2019 during the raw water supply shortage helped us prepare for the challenges brought about by the pandemic. The lessons we learned during the crisis resulted  in  a  more  agile  and  responsive water network that enables us to maintain a reliable and even more efficient water distribution system. These intricate and realtime network adjustments are now executed and monitored centrally via our newly enhanced Operations Management Center, using state-of-the-art technologies across the network. This more 'techy' operating environment is the big reason why we were successful in maintaining 24/7 water service even during the strict lockdowns.\n\nOur journey to a more digitized environment was significantly accelerated out of necessity due to the new normal caused by the pandemic. Aligned to Manila Water's core value of innovation, the transformation was happening in every aspect of the company.  The teams developed sixty (60) automation and workflows apps, using standard and secured tools, half of which were fully user or citizeninitiated and developed.  This highlights the",

Cited particularly by the World Bank was our being world-class in several categories, including commercial operations, technical operations, organization and strategy, human resource management, and financial management.\n\nIn the middle of the storms, our finance team led by our CFO surprised many by successfully completing the debut issuance of the US$500 million 4.375% 10 non-call 5-year Senior Unsecured Fixed Rate Sustainability\n\n'...our service commitment inspires us to forge ahead in the face of adversity and find ways to become more innovative and resilient.

This was our first ever bond issuance in the international capital markets.  The offering is the single largest sustainability bond issued by a listed private water utility in Asia, and the first ASEAN sustainability bond by a corporate issuer out of the Philippines.\n\nOne by one we dealt with each storm and recently, we finally signed a Revised Concession Agreement.  We believe that there are revisions that will be very helpful towards the sustainability of our Company well into the future. The resolution of the Concession Agreement will now allow us to focus on the urgent need to ensure sustainable water supply and wastewater services to the East Zone of Metro Manila. There are many who helped make this happen even from outside the organization and I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of you.\n\nFrom the innovations in operation and efficiency which we have realized, we have set the stage for better ways of serving our customers and growing our business. The already proven world-class operating competency and capacity will now be enhanced with the entry of our new partner, as already announced. The entry of the Razon Group brings a new set of opportunities for Manila Water, as they bring their expansive global reach and business development expertise - with operations in Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Together with our new partner, we definitely see new and clear opportunities for growth and expansion.

In early March, it declared COVID-19 a global pandemic as it rapidly spread worldwide; as of the end of 2020, over 82 million people have been infected with over 1.8 million succumbing to the disease. The Philippines was not spared from the effects of COVID-19, recording its first case on January 30, 2020. A few days after, on February 1, the first death outside China was recorded in the country.\n\nSource: WHO: https://covid19.who.int\n\n<!-- image -->",

On March 16, the government announced the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in the whole island of Luzon. The implementation of the ECQ limited mobility in the island, only allowing people to leave homes for basic necessities such as food and medicine. Public transportation and recreational services were temporarily suspended and only those classified by the IATF as essential workers could report to their workplace.\n\nSAFETY OF EMPLOYEES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSUPPORT TO CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCUSTOMERS' ACCESS TO SERVICE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to Manila Water; a magnitude of which it has never experienced before, and at a time when the Company is recovering from the 2019 Water Crisis. However, ensuring business continuity and uninterrupted service to customers were the primary objectives of the Company, while ensuring safety for its employees, support to service providers and customer access to services.\n\nForefront to the Company's response is the activation of the Incident Management Response Team (IMRT) led by the Business Continuity Team and the Corporate Human Resources Group with the team's first critical mission was to keep all employees safe in their working environment.\n\n## Prioritizing Employee Safety and Well-Being\n\nManila Water undertook key measures to ensure the safety of all employees, regardless of work arrangement through Employee Safety Services and Workplace Safety Programs. Wellness Programs were likewise implemented which values the overall well-being of employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManila Water ensures the safety of employees and customers through regular disinfection of workplace and business areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough these programs, the Company continuously engages and keeps the organization updated albeit through digital platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, keeping the workplace clean and sanitized was also prioritized. Disinfection activities were immediately performed in all facility premises, including offices, vehicles, common areas and shared equipment. This was done for most of the facilities on a daily basis. All personnel were also provided with Personal Protective Equipment; over 1,000 face shields and over 60,000 face masks were distributed since March 2020. Additional protective gears were provided to those reporting to areas that are more exposed to the virus.  Safety applications were immediately rolledout for the purpose of checking, tracking and transportation. Employees were also tested for the virus prior to re-entry and were provided with the necessary kits and guidance on the other  protocols implemented by the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This meant that several key personnel temporarily lodged in the facilities. Sleeping quarters were made available, as well as sufficient supply of food and grocery items delivered directly to the employees, while at the same time accommodating service providers, such as utility and security personnel.\n\n## Operating in the New Normal\n\nWith hundreds of facilities to operate, Manila Water encountered issues in its operations as the quarantine restrictions were in place. The primary issue was due to lack of manpower as several employees were unable to report to work. Similar with the rest of the country, Manila Water employees were faced with: (1) the lack of  absence of public transportation; (2) getting stranded within a locked down community; and (3) health concerns due to COVID-19. Even with the means to travel to the workplace, the Company wanted to ensure the safety and well-being of reporting employees, thereby shifting the Company to a skeletal workforce operating its facilities.",

This was also the issue in the deployment of service providers and contractors, as well as due to lower manpower of contractors, vendors and suppliers. These led to delays in several key services such as sanitation, water and network maintenance and project implementation.\n\nOn the business operations side, Manila Water temporarily suspended its meter reading and billing activities as well as face-to-face customer interactions for complaints resolution and collection activities. Upon resumption of these services, Manila Water received over 30,000 customer requests and complaints in the third quarter, significantly higher than the pre-ECQ level of just over 15,000. Billing complaints were two times the pre-ECQ level brought about by the resumption of actual billing which covers the period when the Company suspended its meter reading and billing activities.\n\nFurthermore, the temporary and permanent closing of commercial establishments, including those engaged in manufacturing and construction, put pressure on the\n\n## EAST ZONE 2020 QUARTERLY COLLECTION EFFICIENCIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompany's revenue generation. While the aggregate billed volume was higher than the previous year, this was mostly attributed to the residential segment which has a lower average tariff than the commercial and industrial segments as people stayed in their homes during the quarantine.  Collection levels were severely affected as restrictions posed challenges for customers to pay their bills. Disconnection activities were likewise suspended for a period of time, and the Company provided installment payment schemes in line with the Bayanihan Law.\n\n## Adapting to the New Normal\n\nManila Water was able to adapt and implement different ways of work amidst the new realities brought about by the pandemic which led to the continued provision of 24/7 water supply to its customers with minimal unplanned service interruptions (i.e. Typhoon Ulysses), as well as the resumption of previously suspended services and activities, while complying to government health and safety guidelines. The creation of a digital working environment paved the way for all employees to connect and to continue with their work, without sacrificing productivity.",

The active use of available online applications was implemented enterprise-wide: (1) meetings, presentations and collaboration acivities; (2) document approvals and processing; (3) internal and external Company events and announcements; and (4) employee engagement activities.\n\nAlso, to maximize reach and provide convenience, the Company launched the Manila Water mobile application, empowering the East Zone customers to have access to their bills, make online payments and report any service concerns.  Manila Water likewise maximized its Operations Management Center (OMC) which provides a purview of the Company's facilities and customer experience. The technical and business teams are able to immediately address customer service issues using the data generated in the OMC.\n\n## Continuing Commitment to Service Mission\n\nManila Water's service mission of providing genuine service to its customers is front and center to the Company's response to any challenge it faces. The limitations brought about by the pandemic did not stop Manila Water from upholding its service standards.\n\nTreating the pandemic as an incident, the IMRT ensures that the Management Team of Manila Water is aware of all issues concerning employee welfare, as well as technical and business operations, prompting immediate action from the line. The implementation of safety protocols as well as stringent controls enabled the Company to minimize service interruptions and facilities downtime. Planned activities were closely monitored and emergency activities were completed within committed turn-around.\n\nEven with mobility limitations, the territory management team of Manila Water ensured that it was able to respond to customer inquiries and complaints within service standards. The teams were proactive in customer communications through different channels, such as social media, text blasts and website announcements, providing information to customers as regards planned activities, emergency works and significant service announcements. Upon resumption of face-to-face customer interaction, the Company ensured that employees and customers follow social distancing and safety protocols.\n\nThe Company thrived in its recovery from the first of half of 2020 when stricter quarantine restrictions were in effect. Upon easing of these restrictions in the second half, Manila Water pursued activities which led to significant recovery in key business and operating indicators.\n\n## East Zone\n\n|                               | 1H2020   | FY2020   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| CAPEX (in Million Php)        | 3,140    | 9,840    |\n| Collection Efficiency (YTD %) | 63       | 92       |\n\n## Sustained Key Results Indicators amidst the pandemic (East Zone)\n\n|                                    |   2020 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|\n| Water Availability (%)             |   97   |\n| Billed Volume Growth (%)           |    2.5 |\n| Response to Service Complaints (%) |   99.4 |\n\n## MWPV\n\n|                               |   1H2020 | FY2020   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| CAPEX (in Million Php)        |      748 | 2,249    |\n| Collection Efficiency (YTD %) |       83 | 95       |",

Situated in the middle of the Taal Lake in the province of Batangas, the volcanic eruption severely affected the shore towns of Talisay and San Nicolas, as well as communities surrounding the lake. Highly affected are the areas within the CALABARZON Region, distressing at least 400,000 people 2 (over 100,000 families) within the radius of the danger zone. Manila Water Philippine Ventures' subsidiaries, Laguna AAAWater Corp (Laguna Water) and MWPV South Luzon Water Corp.

Upon the eruption of the Taal Volcano, Laguna Water and South Luzon Water, as well as Manila Water's Parent Company activated its Call Tree, accounting for the condition of all employees.

Outside the affected barangays but still within South Luzon Water's service area, the company ensured 100 percent facility operations.\n\nWastewater services were also under normal operations amidst the eruption, maintaining target flows and effluent quality standards. Laguna Water also initiated a more active monitoring and checking of water quality in its water source and facilities to ensure safe and potable water for the customers. All parameters tested, including turbidity, were well within the Philippine National Standards for Drinking Water standards, indicating safe for human consumption.

In spite of the ongoing adjustments in business operations, Laguna Water and South Luzon Water simultaneously initiated its support to the affected communities. As an immediate response, Manila Water and Laguna Water deployed 30 tankers, providing potable water to areas with water supply interruptions, even beyond its concession area.

The City of Marikina was heavily affected. By 7 A.M. the Marikina River water level reached 20.7 meters which prompted the nearest Manila Water facility, the Olandes Sewage Treatment Plant, to shut down. Similarly, flood levels in the Municipality of Cainta also caused one of the Company's facilities in the area, the Brookside Pumping Station, to shut down. Also, due to the strong winds and flooding, power provider, Meralco, had to implement power outages to avoid electrocution in flooded areas.\n\nAs Typhoon Ulysses continued to move westward, Tropical Cyclone signals were downgraded, which prompted the Company to lower its alert level to Yellow in the evening. As a result of the onslaught of the typhoon, the Company experienced damages and disruptions to the operations of the East Zone Concession.\n\n## Securing the Safety of Employees\n\nDuring the onslaught of Typhoon Ulysses, Manila Water ensured that all of its employees were accounted for, triggering a classification system  that would identify the magnitude by which the typhoon affected their respective households.

Over 300,000 customers were affected by the flood and almost 200,000 customers experienced no water coming from the cities of Antipolo, Marikina, Pasig, Quezon City and Taguig, as well as from the municipalities of Cainta, Rodriguez, San Mateo and Taytay.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also, billing and collection activities were disrupted in over 41,000 customers in severely affected areas due to heavy obstructions on-site which resulted in average billing during the period.\n\nAside from the assistance of the Company in providing water to evacuation centers, Manila Water also deployed 26 desludging tankers and 2 jetters to support the clean-up operations of the LGUs of Marikina, Rodriguez, San Mateo and Quezon City.\n\nProviding potable water in evacuation centers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| City/Municipality   | Desludging Tanker Deployment   | Desludging Tanker Deployment                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                     | Count                          | Location                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Marikina            | 14                             | Calumpang, Brgy Tanong, Riverbanks Mall, Brgy.

The Company's ability to deliver value depends greatly on an ecosystem of services, particularly the provision of water from watersheds, rivers, lakes and aquifers, thus it values bodies of water as a primary resource that needs to be taken care of. And without adequate available raw water, the Company's delivery of water supply service is at risk. Wastewater management, on the other hand, is a service obligation of the Company and by returning wastewater back to nature in a non-polluted form, a vital service to the ecosystem is delivered.\n\n## SOCIAL\n\nManila Water is a vital partner in every community it serves. The Company ensures that people in a sustainable and empowered community have access to clean, reliable and affordable water, along with sewer and sanitation services that safeguard public health and economic productivity of individuals, helping reduce poverty and reduce inequality. The most essential input to the Company's ability to realizing its vision and living its mission are the capable men and women who run the business every single day.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Board of Directors of Manila Water is composed of eleven directors with four members elected as independent directors.

Communities clamor for the sustainable provision of basic utilities such as potable water and sanitation services. One of the most effective ways of protection against COVID-19 virus is through proper hygiene and cleanliness practices. The importance of disinfection efforts such as constant and proper hand washing was never more highlighted than at the onset of the pandemic. The challenge for water providers is to maintain a high level of service despite prevailing limitations.\n\nManila Water recognizes the importance of having sufficient water supply and sanitation services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company focused on maintaining service levels in its East Zone Concession and in its other operating subsidiaries. Key measures were undertaken to ensure that water and wastewater operations continued, while keeping employees safe from the dangers posed by COVID-19. At the same time, the Company remained true to its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on Clean Water and Sanitation.\n\nManila Water perseveres in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic for the welfare of its employees, customers, and stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustaining water and wastewater service levels under the pandemic has been challenging, given the limited mobility and the need to comply with stringent health and safety standards. As the world slowly transitions to a new normal, Manila Water maintains its resolve to adapt to these new challenges.\n\n## OUTLOOK AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## Valuing Genuine Service\n\nManila Water remains focused on its service mission to provide exceptional service to its customers. The Company faces the COVID-19 pandemic head-on and is committed to perform even better, even as it strives to address the new realities brought about by social, environmental, and institutional challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Manila Water prioritized the safety of its employees as they continued the provision of genuine service to the Company's customers. The safety and well-being of employees were upheld by Management by providing assistance such as transportation, access to healthcare and the adoption of alternative work arrangements. Equally important, the Company focused on business sustainability, prudently managing its financial resources to maintain service continuity, operational resiliency, and timely project implementation.\n\n## Ensuring water and environmental sustainability\n\nLearning from the 2019 water crisis, the East Zone Concession's focus in ensuring water supply stability to its customers reaped benefits as the Company maintained a 97 percent water supply availability in 2020. This was achieved despite limitations brought about by the pandemic. Moving forward, the Company will continue to pursue more water security and sustainability projects.

The proceeds from the issuance are intended to refinance maturing obligations and finance programmed water and wastewater capital expenditures for 2020-2021 and are targeted towards projects related to (1) Sustainable water and\n\nModel Plaque to commemorate the success of the bond issuance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwastewater management; (2) Terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation; and (3) Affordable basic infrastructure categories. The issuance recently received an accolade as the Best Sustainability Bond - Corporate in The Asset's Annual Triple A Country Awards 2020.\n\n## Focusing on operational resiliency and efficiency\n\nBeyond the East Zone Concession, financial resource preservation remained a priority. Specifically, MWPV exercised its option to borrow an additional Php3.0 billion from partner banks to ensure that sufficient resources are available for MWPV's operations and capital expenditures, as well as for existing projects of subsidiaries and equity investments.\n\n'In support of its commitment to water and environmental sustainability, the Parent Company successfully debuted in the international debt capital markets through the issuance of its maiden ASEAN sustainability bond. '\n\nIn terms of operations, new business development initiatives of the non-East Zone businesses gave way to keeping current operations stable and meeting service level standards. Taking the East Zone Concession as its benchmark for operating amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsidiaries adapted to the new realities of their respective service areas. Notwithstanding the current challenges, the potential opportunities in the water space remain robust and Manila Water will continue to look at these as soon as the circumstances become better.\n\n## Digitizing for the Future\n\nAmidst the COVOD-19 pandemic, Manila Water recognizes the need to fast track its digitization initiatives to increase efficiency, facilitate added convenience for customers, and minimize operational disruptions. The Company maximized its existing digital platforms, increasing usage and integration while maintaining information security. Furthermore, the Company introduced new digital platforms for its operations to increase ease of use, accessibility, and operational efficiency, regardless of the necessary changes in work arrangements. Manila Water continues to develop and strengthen its digital infrastructure to face the new realities.",

The Company is accountable to its regulators, shareholders, employees and customers, among others.\n\nProfitability, sustainable development and corporate social responsibility are expected to be continuously enhanced. In order to achieve its corporate objectives, Manila Water recognized the need for the active management of risks inherent to its business which involves the entire organization.\n\nManila Water continues to implement its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program based on a globally accepted approach, the ISO 31000, and has been cascaded across the Manila Water enterprise which includes subsidiaries in MWPV and MWAP to ensure attainment of its objectives.\n\nThe ERM Program operationalizes the Company's Manual of Corporate Governance which mandates the Board of Directors (BOD) to ensure the presence of organizational and procedural controls supported by an effective management information system and risk management reporting system. In addition, the Company's Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) provides oversight to management functions relating\n\nERM shall aim to integrate risk awareness and responsibility into each level of management activities, and into all strategic planning and decisionmaking processes within the Company.\n\nto strategic, financial, operational, compliance, legal, environmental, social and other risks of the Company.

He chairs the Risk Management Executive Committee (RMEC) which is composed of top management and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The RMEC provides oversight and input to the President and to the Board to enable them to formulate better and informed decisions on matters related to risks.\n\nThe RMEC provides direction on the design and implementation of appropriate systems, tools and methodologies to support the ERM process and other risk management activities and designates owners of specific risks and enablers of the ERM process (ERM Champions/Partners/ Risk Officers).\n\nThe CRO is the ultimate champion of ERM at Manila Water. Supporting the CRO is the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department. It is responsible for developing risk management tools, methodologies and processes.

The risk management system of Manila Water is reviewed and assessed annually by Internal Audit using a risk maturity assessment framework aligned with global best practices to determine the system's adequacy, suitability and effectiveness. An external assessment of Manila Water Company's ERM maturity was conducted in 2018 by Ayala Corporation through Aon Philippines.\n\n## 2020 ERM HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe following changes were implemented to further improve the implementation of ERM across the enterprise:\n\n- \u00b7 Appointment of the Chief Finance Officer as concurrent Chief Risk Officer, and merger of the EERM and Sustainability departments.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the number of BROC meetings to quarterly, instead of semi-annually, to provide more opportunities for deeper discussions of top risks as well as provide ample attention to the risks of new business operations.\n- \u00b7 Enhanced deep dive discussions at the subsidiary level using risk driver analysis.\n- \u00b7 Commencement of the review and updating of the existing ERM policy, framework and organizational structure, with the target of BROC approval in early 2021, and subsequent rollout across the enterprise of the revised risk dictionary (including risk indicators), revised risk register templates and reporting tools.\n\n## ERM FRAMEWORK AND PROCESS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMandate and Commitment\n\n<!-- image -->",

For Manila Water, this means consistently delivering essential services that address societal and environmental needs, using the core business to create positive and lasting impact for the Company, its customers, employees, business partners, supply chain, government partners and the investing community. To quote Manila Water chairman Fernando Zobel de Ayala in the early days of the East Zone concession, the Company has 'a mission to fulfill, not a business to run'.\n\n## OVERALL MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n\nManila Water has long adopted a sustainability framework which articulates the impact its core business has on society, environment and the economy, but at the same time, the integration of the focus areas at the heart of corporate strategy, tactics and execution will ensure long-term survival and viability of the business. This framework serves as a template for communicating the unique context of sustainability in Manila Water and is used in the disclosures of key risks, accomplishments and impacts.\n\n## RESPONDING TO EVOLVING EXPECTATIONS OF STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe Manila Water sustainability framework was adopted in 2004 and the first sustainability report was published in the succeeding year.  Through the years, the Company evolved the scope and quality of its sustainability reporting in sync with the improvements in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) specifications to respond to the growing expectations of the investing community.  The advent of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 further cemented Manila Water's role as a champion for Water and Sanitation, and the Company also adopted the indicators associated with SDG 6 to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\narticulate its contributions and impact, along with those of other ancillary SDGs. (See Our Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals in page 50.)\n\nIn recent years, investors and other stakeholders have increasingly demanded additional disclosures in  ESG performance of companies. Data-driven sustainability has become more relevant to prepare businesses amidst emerging megatrends and negative externalities such as climate change, societal inequalities and a global pandemic. Given this backdrop, Manila Water commenced on using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting framework, in addition to the others previously mentioned, for the 2020 reporting period. This new phase of the Company's sustainability journey is a step forward to firm up Manila Water's commitment to integrate emerging sustainability paradigms and practices into its management systems to boost long-term financial viability and address the evolving needs of stakeholders.",

The sustainability commitments were a product of listening to and close coordination with stakeholders, and adopted in response to societal and environmental needs that align with the long-term viability of the business.\n\nThe Company aims to provide a balanced, accurate, and accessible assessment of its strategy, performance, and prospects related to financial, economic, social, environmental, and governance issues and risks that have a material impact on the business and its stakeholders.\n\nManila Water follows a structured process to identify, understand, validate and prioritize its most material sustainability issues on a regular basis.  However, the usual channels of engaging with stakeholders to discuss matters relevant to them were unavailable during a time of pandemic in 2020.  In response, the Company had to employ online means in conducting its materiality exercise, such as surveys and focus group discussions via videoconferencing where possible.\n\nThe determination of material issues to the Company were guided by the following considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 Reporting frameworks adopted by Manila Water, such as:\n- \u00b7 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n- \u00b7 Integrated Reporting (<IR>)\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n- \u00b7 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)\n- \u00b7 Current and emerging risks/issues critical to achieving strategic objectives and the sustainability of the operating models of the business units;\n- \u00b7 Feedback from key stakeholders gathered through virtual platforms due to the pandemic such as surveys, bulletins, social media, videoconferencing, and;\n- \u00b7 Public controversies",

No community can be sustainable without adequate water and sanitation available to everyone, and for a community to be resilient against man-made or natural threats, those water services must also be resilient. The Company has a core service obligation to provide water and wastewater services delivered to customers in a reliable and efficient manner, resilient towards various risk scenarios, and at an affordable cost. The Company continuously strives to expand these services to more people -- especially the marginalized -- and improve the way its services are delivered. The Company believes that inclusivity is fundamental in its service expansion plans, making sure that no one gets left behind especially the marginalized communities, also known as the base of the pyramid. The Company continues to enhance its business continuity program to anticipate different disruptive events. At the same time, the Company have made significant investments in ensuring asset\n\nand operational resilience.\n\n## ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD\n\nManila Water's flagship sustainability program, the key manifestation of its 'creating shared value' story, is the 'Tubig Para Sa Barangay' (TPSB) or Water for the Community program that addresses the need of low-income communities for clean and affordable water.  With technical, organizational and business model innovations adopted since 1997 to ensure that water services reached the unserved and underserved, the TPSB has become recognized as a best practice in the global water sector.\n\nComplementing the TPSB program is the Lingap program that provides clean water to public service institutions such as schools, public markets, and hospitals, ensuring that people have access to clean and safe water beyond their dwellings. Both TPSB and Lingap were replicated and adopted in the Boracay and Laguna subsidiaries taking into consideration local conditions.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Manila Water continued operating to serve communities with water which is vital in ensuring public health.  In response to the Bayanihan Act, it provided concessions by deferring water service disconnections due to unpaid water bills, and installment schemes were agreed upon with affected customers.",

This resiliency is a must on the physical assets, the employees and the support services that ensure a smooth recovery and restoration of operations arising from any disruption such as earthquake, floods and droughts.\n\nManila Water has initiated 'Project Kawayan', a flagship resilience program conceptualized to:\n\n- \u00b7 Further improve the disaster management system, disaster response capability and organizational resiliency of the business,\n- \u00b7 Adequately prepare, promptly respond, restore or recover its critical service and minimize service interruption in case of unavoidable incidents within tolerable recovery time, and\n- \u00b7 Provide pre-drafted and pre-determined protocols to the organization on how to overcome a business disruption caused by an emergency through a business continuity manual\n\nThe project is led by the top leaders and business continuity plan partners from various groups across the Company. A technical working group conducts of risk assessment and business impact analyses which provide a view of possible impacts on human capital, financial, technical, reputational, operational and legal aspects of the Company.\n\nAs the Company's long-term operational viability is threatened by climate change, Manila Water is committed to make its assets, operations and supporting actors climate resilient to ensure the continuity of services. The Company's strategies to address the risks and opportunities of climate change are specified in the Manila Water Climate Change Policy which focuses mainly on climate change adaptation while supporting climate change mitigation initiatives. Among the adaptation initiatives are:\n\n- \u00b7 Institutionalizing resiliency and adaptation assessment in the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of all assets\n- \u00b7 Retrofitting existing assets and building new assets to be climate-resilient\n- \u00b7 Strengthening disaster risk reduction and management capacity of the organization\n- \u00b7 Taking a proactive role in developing, protecting, rehabilitating, and enhancing water sources, including watersheds, surface, and groundwater resources.\n\n(A comprehensive discussion of Manila Water's climate-related risks and opportunities, strategies and accomplishments are in the published 2015-2020 Manila Water Climate Change Report.)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The community partners, or kasanggas , act as the force multipliers on the ground by relaying advisories to customers on matters such as water interruption, desludging drives, and public consultations. Due to government restrictions imposed during most of 2020, the Company's customer representatives maximized the use of online platforms such as Viber, Messenger and Facebook. This enabled the Company to receive real-time feedback, such as water pilferages, pipe breakages, and other service complaints, resulting in faster response times and problem resolution.\n\nReeling from a water crisis in early 2019, the Company has secured approval from the water security agency for the development of medium-term water sources, some of which are located in watersheds which are in the domain of indigenous peoples. As the new water headworks are being built, the Company has started work on the rehabilitation and enhancement of surrounding watersheds by engaging the local communities and people organizations in environmental education, provisioning of sustainable livelihoods and a long-term tree nurturing program focusing only on native species. Although engagement with\n\nthe Dumagat indigenous peoples of Angat and Ipo have been going on for decades, in 2020 the Company embarked on forming partnerships with Dumagats of Tayabasan at the Marikina watershed to support the Wawa Calawis project.

The university programs are all competency-based, aimed at developing talents by enhancing their leadership, technical, and functional skills, in preparation for future critical roles.  Furthermore, technical and leadership skills are learned within the virtual four walls of a classroom (or an online learning platform) and through close mentoring of leaders who oversee the implementation of stretched assignments.\n\nThe new work arrangements prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the push for online learning.

The Company is heavily dependent on the provisioning function of ecosystem services, particularly on raw water supply, which justifies its significant investments in the natural environment.\n\nThe Company helps protect the environment through watershed protection, rehabilitation, wastewater treatment and realizing operational efficiencies throughout the water value chain.  These are also complemented by people-centric programs such as environmental stewardship advocacies and community initiatives to address the root causes of environmental degradation:  poverty and apathy.\n\nManila Water's relationship with nature is not one-way though.  The relationship is reciprocal, as the Company also performs services to ecosystems mainly through its wastewater operations.  After water is used by customers, the Company collects and treats wastewater before discharging clean effluent back to the environment, thus reducing the pollution of rivers and lakes, and avoiding the release of greenhouse gases that otherwise untreated wastewater would form.  In the course of championing UN SDG 6 (Access to Water and Sanitation), three allied sustainable development goals (SDG 13 - Climate Action, SDG 14 - Life Below Water, and SDG 15 - Life on Land) are also being supported by Manila Water.\n\nMANAGING WATER RESOURCES GRI:2018 303-1, 303-3, SASB IF-WU-440a.1., SASB  IF-WU-440a.3.\n\nManila Water ensures that raw water withdrawals from groundwater and surface water sources as well as its discharges are within regulatory limits and done in a manner that protects the water resources and receiving bodies of water.  Manila Water has commissioned studies to understand the viability and sustainability of aquifer resources.  Both surface & ground water abstractions are regulated by the water authority through the issuance of water permits or water rights.\n\n## Water Withdrawal by Source (in mcm)\n\n|                                     |   2018 |   2019 |   2020* |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Groundwater                         |   85.1 |   93   |   110   |\n| Surface Water                       |  776.9 |  747.4 |   777.7 |\n| Bulk Water   or Third   Party Water |    3   |    3.4 |     5.4 |\n| Groundwater                         |    0.2 |    0.2 |     0.3 |\n| Surface Water                       |    2.8 |    3.2 |     5.2 |\n| Total                               |  864.9 |  843.8 |   893.1 |\n\n*Manila Water started the new classification of GRI:2018 303-3 in 2020 to segregate bulk water or third-party water sources, classify if raw water is freshwater or other water, and if raw water comes from water-stressed areas.

        "page_content": "Source: World Resources Institute's Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WATER SOURCES OF MANILA WATER\n\nThe Company's total water withdrawal in 2020 was 893.1 million cubic meters (MCM) of raw water across all its operating subsidiaries in the Philippines and Vietnam. 8.1 mcm of backwash water of water treatment was recovered and reused to add on the production of potable water. Based on the World Resources Institute's Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct, Manila Water does not abstract water from high to extremely high baseline water stressed regions.  All raw water abstracted is freshwater, which is defined as water with total dissolved solids of less than 1000 mg/L.\n\nAs much as possible, Manila Water prefers to utilize surface water sources as these are more renewable compared to groundwater. Eighty seven percent of the Company's raw water comes from surface water. The East Zone Concession  abstracts 98 percent of its raw water from  Umiray, Angat, Ipo, La Mesa Manila water system, and Laguna Lake, and only 2 percent comes from groundwater to augment its water supply requirements while new surface water sources are being developed. Cebu Water and Boracay Water sustainably sources from the Luyang River and Nabaoy River, respectively. Kenh Dong and Thu Duc Water in Vietnam sources from Dau Tieng Lake and  Dong Nai River in Ho Chi MInh, respectively.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of groundwater sources, Manila Water monitors groundwater conditions and determines how long the aquifer reserves will last. The status of groundwater abstraction is regularly reported to the National Water Regulatory Board (NWRB).\n\nGroundwater studies were conducted to determine the sustainability of existing sources. The East Zone Concession's groundwater study in Metro Manila East Zone from 2016 reveals that groundwater levels are sufficient until 2055 with the extraction rates approved by NWRB even with a climate change scenario included. In addition, Manila Water has an on-going study on the assessment of groundwater dynamics and water quality of groundwater sources using isotope and nuclear techniques.  This study is in partnership with the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute and National Water Resources Board.\n\nLaguna Water conducts a groundwater study every four years since 2012. The results of the studies in 2012 and 2016 show that the groundwater in the covered areas is sufficient until 2090, at current rates of utilization growth. The 2020 groundwater study of Laguna Water focused on the impact of a 7.2 magnitude West Valley Fault earthquake on surrounding aquifers, the impact of Laguna Wellfield's 100 MLD extraction on downstream aquifers, and the effect of expanding the said wellfield.",

        "page_content": "## PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe 2016 groundwater study of Clark Water identified locations of aquifer-rich sources and their available yields. Clark Water also commissioned surface water feasibility studies on the Sacobia, Marimla, and Bamban rivers. The results of these studies were used in Clark Water's master planning activities, for inclusion in the service improvement plan that will be reviewed by its regulator.\n\nManila Water keeps track of not only the water availability but also the changes in raw water quality of both surface and groundwater. Surface water supply is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly during heavy rainfall and typhoons on degraded land which makes surface water turbid, while groundwater is dependent on natural factors such as topographic position and the mineral composition of the underlying geology. Both types of sources are affected by pollution and other human activities.\n\n## PROTECTING AND REHABILITATING WATERSHEDS\n\nGRI 304-3, SASB IF-WU-440a.3\n\nManila Water recognizes the impacts of raw water availability and quality to its operations and conversely, the Company's impacts on the water sources. Thus, the Company anchors on nature-based solutions and environmental stewardship of key watersheds that it depends on. In 2020, Manila Water funded the protection of 9,515 hectares in Ipo, La Mesa, and Upper Marikina watersheds.  The Company planted 16,241  native trees in 2020 reaching a total of 1,188,020  trees nurtured since it began its watershed management initiatives. Manila Water also helped in the formulation of the Integrated Watershed Management Plan of Ipo, La Mesa, Upper Marikina, and Luyang watersheds.\n\n## Watershed Risks and Mitigation Initiatives\n\nManila Water has identified the risks associated with its key watersheds and the mitigation initiatives to address these risks.\n\n## Watershed\n\n## Risks\n\n## Mitigation initiatives\n\nGeneral Nakar (Kaliwa, Kanan, Umiray, and 13 other minor watersheds)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Forest degradation/deforestation\n- \u00b7  Loss of biodiversity\n- \u00b7  Erosion\n- \u00b7  Vulnerability of surface and groundwater to contamination due to anthropogenic interventions\n- \u00b7  Disaster Risks (flood, rain-induced landslide and tropical cyclones)\n\n- \u00b7  Finalization and implementation of Integrated Watershed Management Plan\n- \u00b7  Reforestation\n- \u00b7  Maintenance and development of previously enriched areas\n- \u00b7  Operationalization of Bantay Gubat/ Deputized Environment and Natural Resources Offices\n- \u00b7  Capacity building activities on sanitation and disaster risk reduction and management\n- \u00b7  Engagement into a Memorandum of Agreement for the management of Kaliwa Watershed and development of action plans",

        "page_content": "Manila Water treated a total of 74.1 mcm of wastewater in its 70 centralized aerobic wastewater treatment facilities before properly discharging it, avoiding 12,613 tons of organic pollutants from entering the water body. Further, 74,030 tons CO 2 e was avoided from entering the atmosphere. Manila Water complies with the effluent guidelines and other regulations on wastewater.\n\nThe details of the effluent quality are in the Environmental Performance Index of the 2020 IR microsite.\n\nManila Water has started the upgrading of its wastewater facilities to meet its DENR-approved compliance action plans in compliance with the new DENR Revised General Effluent Standards of 2016 (DAO 2016-08) which requires the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and ammonia from wastewater to reduce algal growth in water bodies.\n\n## ENSURING ENVIRONMENTAL\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nGRI:2018 306-2, GRI 307-1\n\nTo ensure environmental compliance, Manila Water has a proactive approach. Potential non-compliance is monitored frequently and acted upon to avoid adverse environmental impacts. Manila Water has Pollution Control Officers appointed for each facility who ensure compliance with all environmental regulatory requirements and whose performance is validated through\n\nregular internal audits. Waste minimization and pollution prevention are being implemented through operational control measures needed to address significant environmental aspects and impacts as identified in Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Control (HIRAC) system. Manila Water had no significant environmental fines and penalties of more than PhP 50,000 nor non-monetary sanctions in 2020.\n\n## SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nThe largest contributor to non-hazardous solid wastes is wastewater treatment which converts organic pollution into microbial biomass in sludge, a by-product of aerobic treatment which further undergoes dewatering to yield biosolids.  Grits and screenings from raw wastewater are properly disposed of in sanitary landfills. Biosolids from the East Zone Concession and Boracay Water facilities are hauled, composted, and used as a soil conditioner in lahar-affected areas in Pampanga. Laguna Water composts biosolids within its treatment facility while Clark Water dries and stores biosolids in a drying pond in its wide expansive property. Other nonhazardous solid wastes generated in offices and facilities are segregated and disposed of properly. Recyclable materials are sold to junk shops while old meters are sold to recyclers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n74.11 mcm\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12,613 tons\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

East Zone Concession  donates its used oil and used-lead acid batteries to ABS-CBN Foundation's Bantay Langis and Bantay Baterya, respectively. The Company shifted\n\nto LED lighting, reducing the amount of busted fluorescent lamps generated yearon-year. In 2020, a total of 133.04 tons of hazardous wastes were generated. Hazardous wastes are properly stored in hazardous wastes storage and transported, treated, and safely disposed of through DENR-accredited service providers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Manila Water undertakes a continuing NRW reduction program to attain or maintain the optimal NRW reducing wastage of water, energy, chemical, and other raw materials.\n\nThe program involves both technological and stakeholder-approach. Manila Water utilizes the district metering areas organization approach in managing nonrevenue water that usually arises from too much local pressure, undetected leaks and metering error. Furthermore, the Company works with the community kasanggas in identifying leaks and illegal connections.\n\nIn 2020, managing NRW was a big challenge due to the inability of field personnel to 'walk the line' during the community quarantines, thus preventing a timely detection and resolution of leaks, real time adjustment of pressure and identification of tampered meters.",

In the course of expanding service coverage and providing customers with quality water and wastewater service, Manila Water invests heavily in and operates essential infrastructure which create jobs and opportunities within the organization and across the supply chain.  At the personal level, the Company contributes to the improved health of customers with the delivery of clean water and sanitation, ensuring optimal productivity of individuals which in turn fuels local and national economic growth and helps lessen inequality and reduce poverty.\n\n## SUPPORTING THE ECONOMY DURING A PANDEMIC\n\nWater is essential for drinking, sanitation, and food production for millions of people.  It is imperative that the Company maintains a steady supply of water across homes, communities, healthcare facilities, schools, and other public spaces.  This need was magnified in the country's strategic responses to the pandemic, one of which is the frequent washing of hands to prevent the spread of disease. Manila Water ensured that the distribution of clean water was uninterrupted, despite the mobility\n\nrestrictions and health hazards to water utility personnel who are also considered frontliners.  Disconnection activities were suspended, and as the pandemic left millions of Filipinos with limited income, grace periods and installment schemes for paying water bills, and through online means, were offered to customers. For commercial and industrial customers that suffered from the economic slowdown, Manila Water ensured that water supply did not become a limitation, best exemplified by the uninterrupted services by the Laguna and Clark subsidiaries which serve major industrial zones.\n\nIn 2020, Manila Water provided direct employment to 2,311 individuals in Metro Manila and its subsidiaries across the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. No Manila Water employee lost his or her job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The health and safety of the Company's frontliners was a topmost priority as meter reading and bill delivery were suspended during the enhanced community quarantine, but continuous employee productivity was ensured through innovative measures. Work-From-Home arrangements for employees were established and health protocols were developed for employees who needed to report to the main office, work hubs, facilities, and project sites.",

While access to water, sanitation and hygiene has been crucial to rise against the odds, still it is a privilege for those who do not have adequate WASH services within their reach.\n\nWith this advocacy at its core, Manila Water Foundation kept forging ahead amid the pandemic to reach those in the most vulnerable situations. MWF rose to the challenge, and immediately reconstructed its WASH programs to serve those at the frontline.\n\nIn summary, MWF has now reached out to 4,336,478 individuals, and touched lives in a total of 69 provinces nationwide with the combined contributions of all its major programs and its WASH in Pandemic initiatives.\n\nThe programs of the MWF continue to contribute to various UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), supporting Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. Aside from this, MWF anchors its programs to Goal 1:\n\nNo Poverty, Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, Goal 4: Quality Education, Goal 14: Life Below Water, Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Goal 11: Building Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Goal 17: Partnership for the Goals.\n\nDespite the pandemic and the challenges that marked 2020, MWF continues to pursue its vision of more communities having clean, safe and potable water and safely managed sanitation. With its WASH in Pandemic, Integrated WASH, Flagship and Special Programs, MWF works hard to keep the nation's lifeblood flowing for a future where no community is left behind.\n\n## 2020 Achievements of the WASH in Pandemic Program\n\nSupporting the health and safety protocols directed by the national government in 2020, MWF launched its WASH in Pandemic program. It aimed to provide hygiene facilities, supplies and education to communities and institutions as precautionary measures to address the threat of COVID-19. The WASH in Pandemic program was divided into three subcategories: WASH in Pandemic for Communities, WASH in Pandemic for Institutions, and WASH in Pandemic for Emergencies.",

The initiative supports the Department of Education's WASH in Schools (WinS) program with the goal of providing adequate WASH facilities for schools across the country. Moreover, MWF also served as a co-organizer in the Ayala Group's Brigada ng Ayala , leading its Kalusugan at Kaligtasan cluster.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWASH in\n\nPandemic Communities 214,375 individuals served 13 hygiene facilities constructed 2,800 hygiene kits with\n\nIECs distributed\n\nWASH in Pandemic Institutions 110,187\n\nWASH in Pandemic Emergencies 64,106\n\nindividuals served\n\n9\n\nhygiene facilities constructed\n\n## 3,100\n\nhygiene kits with IECs distributed\n\nindividuals served\n\n## 9,843\n\ngallons of water deployed with hygiene products\n\n## 42\n\nwater dispensers donated\n\nLastly, for WASH in Pandemic for Emergencies, MWF reached out to local government units, national agencies, quarantine facilities and hospitals to provide support especially to health care and safety workers who are the forefront at the fight against the pandemic.\n\nCrucial to the implementation of the WASH in Pandemic program is upholding health and safety.  With this, the design of the facilities constructed under the program showcases a 'hybrid' design. This allows users to switch on the tap in two ways: with a lever that can be used by hand or an elbow, or by stepping on a foot pedal. There is also a one-meter distance between faucets to observe physical distancing. To make it more accessible for all, there is a lowered sink which can be easily used by children and persons with disabilities (PWDs). Equally important, each facility is built with three faucets with soap containers and installed with signages about COVID-19 precautionary measures, proper handwashing, and the responsible use of water. These ensure that the facility is not merely an access point but also acts as an avenue to magnify important messages during the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For its sanitation phase, Sitio Monicayo's Sanitation Group has also been organized, with 45 toilet-less households provided with a toilet facility between the end of the 2019 to early 2020. Behavioral change communication (BCC) materials i.e. WASH Jingle, ' Bayang May Kalinga ,' WASH Storybook, ' May Tubig na Sina Tinay ,' and WASH module, ' Gabay sa Tubig, Sanitasyon at Palalusugan ' were also turned over to the community as it closed out the project by the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, in Barangay Sapang Uwak, Porac, Pampanga, MWF inaugurated water facilities early in 2019 to address this basic need of access to clean, potable and safe water. Three water storage tanks and threekilometer piped connections to 13 watering points were built in the community where its main source of water is a natural spring. This was in partnership with Manila Water Philippine Ventures - North Luzon Regional Business Development (MWPV-NLRBD) and the Municipal Government of Porac. In 2020, MWF officially turned over the project to the Porac Municipal LGU for its sustainability.\n\n## Roots to Shoots\n\nIn 2020, MWF's Integrated WASH Program was tapped to lead the WASH component of Roots to Shoots (RTS) program, a threeyear multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral initiative equally led in a consortium with Pilipinas Shell Foundation and World Vision Development Foundation. With particular focus on the earliest stages of child development, the initiative aims to foster the right conditions for children to take root, grow, and branch out to reach their full potential.\n\nUnder Roots to Shoots, MWF immersed in the towns of Bombon and Pasacao in Camarines Sur to provide technical and capacity building support to the local water district which yielded better water quality and service in the area. Through the rehabilitation of the water system, 900 households connected to the water district experienced 24 hours of water supply for the first time after two years. Moreover, the construction of 17 handwashing facilities encouraged behavioral change on proper hygiene among the community residents to protect them from the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19.\n\nWASH Community: Sitio Monicayo, Mabalacat City, Pampanga\n\n## 38,725.29 m 3\n\nvolume of water delivered to the community\n\n709,760 Amount of collected money from rationing\n\nWASH Community: Barangay Sapang Uwak, Porac, Pampanga\n\n15,120 m3 volume of water delivered to the community\n\nWASH Community: Bombon and Pasacao, Camarines Sur\n\n13\n\nCovered  Barangays\n\n920\n\nHouseholds with Improved Water Access\n\n276 Capacity Building Attendees\n\n17 Handwashing Facilities Built\n\n7 Community Facilities with Improved Water Access\n\n1 Sanitation Facility",

These programs are for public institutions and low-income communities that have less to no capacity to install their own stand-alone water supply system and are in-need of hygiene education.\n\nLingap is an infrastructure development program for hygiene and drinking facilities in public institutions such as schools and health centers.\n\nTo support the learners and teachers in an Islamic community, MWF in partnership with GMA Kapuso Foundation, helped rehabilitate the sanitation and hygiene facilities at Datu Saber Elementary School in Marawi City. In November 2020, MWF officially turned over the school's newly rehabilitated four-faucet hygiene facility and three-cubicle toilet facility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAhon is an infrastructure development program of stand-alone water supply or sanitation system in low-income communities. Under Ahon program are two sub-programs: Ahon Tubig, an infrastructure development program of stand-alone water supply systems in lowincome communities; and Ahon Sanitasyon, an infrastructure development program of stand-alone sanitation facilities in lowincome communities.\n\nThe highlight of the Ahon program in 2020 is the inauguration of the Ahon Tubig project in partnership with Laguna Water, Water.org, and the local government of Cabuyao City. The project aimed to provide piped-in water service connections for 136 families at Barangay Niugan and Barangay Mamatid.\n\nFor Ahon Sanitasyon , MWF in partnership with Philippine Bobbin Corporation turned over two (2) five-cubicle communal toilets in Barangay Muzon 1 and 2 in Rosario, Cavite. These provide safely managed sanitation access to 235 households, addressing 32.5 percent of the population practicing open defecation in the community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMWF also turned over a four-cubicle public toilet the at Sta. Lucia Chapel in Boracay Island in partnership with Boracay Water and Barangay Manocmanoc. The public toilet aims to not only promote health and sanitation among churchgoers, but to also encourage environmental sustainability through wastewater treatment.",

MWF utilized its social media platforms to inform, educate, and encourage its audiences, especially the youth who are learning from home. To complement the celebrations, MWF also reached out to special institutions and public spaces to distribute much-needed hygiene products that are essential in the fight against COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 ACHIEVEMENTS OF MWF SPECIAL PROGRAMS\n\nMWF also serves through its Special Programs, which promotes national development and immediately addresses our people's needs in times of disasters and calamities.\n\nAgapay is the provision of water access and sanitation services to disaster-affected communities. Under Agapay are two sub-programs: Agapay Tubig , a disaster response sub-program that distributes bottled drinking water and deploys water tankers to affected families to address their needs for drinking, bathing, and other hygiene-related activities; and Agapay Sanitasyon , a disaster response program that builds sanitation facilities for affected families and individuals who were displaced from their homes and communities.\n\nFrom a volcanic eruption to devastating typhoons that occurred in 2020, MWF was able to serve those in the most vulnerable situations through the Agapay program. Following the impact of Taal Volcano's eruption, Typhoons Pepito, Quinta, Rolly and Ulysses, MWF deployed around 58,810 gallons of drinking water and around a thousand hygiene kits to severely affected communities in Metro Manila and other areas of Luzon.\n\n## MWF Prize for Engineering Excellence\n\nis a biennial award and the first-ever recognizing body in the country that honors Filipino engineers who made notable contributions in the areas of water, sanitation, environment, and sustainability for marginalized communities.\n\n## AGAPAY TUBIG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22,015\n\nAhon Sanitasyon:\n\nIndividual Served\n\n## AGAPAY SANITASYON\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was mainly due to the recent finalization of the purchase price allocation of the investment in East Water which was acquired in 2018. Goodwill for the acquisition was reduced by THB1,496 million, which was reallocated to Fair Value of the underlying assets of East Water. As of December 31, 2020, total adjustment related to the fair value amortization of East Water's investment amounted to THB259 million, equivalent to Php411 million.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group inked a Management, Operations and Maintenance Contract with Saudi Arabia's state-run water agency, the National Water Company. This operations and maintenance contract is in partnership with the French water distributor Saur Group and Saudi's Miahona Company. The seven-year agreement covers the implementation of enabling projects and the management of the water and wastewater facilities and systems of the North West Cluster served by National Water Company. The cluster includes the cities of Madinah and Tabuk, comprised of 300,000 square kilometers of land area, with a population of more than three million. This initiative is among the first of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's plans to privatize its water infrastructure sector. Said country's 2030 Vision targets to carry out a series of contracts to improve the water distribution services in all of its six clusters.\n\nMWAP's consolidated net loss ended at Php371 million in 2020.\n\n49%",

Despite initiatives to push for cost efficiency, Healthy Family ended the year with a net loss of Php63 million.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, the Company announced the closure of its Healthy Family Business Division effective October 31, 2020 due to said division's recurring losses and inability to financially sustain business operations. The dynamic competitiveness in the bottled water industry and recent economic challenges, despite notable efforts of management to improve operating efficiency and profitability, proved too difficult for the business to cope and keep operations viable.\n\nFor the Environmental Services segment, the slowdown in projects caused a significant drag on profitability, resulting to a net loss of Php16 million. This is likewise the case for the Pipelaying segment, wherein delays in the implementation of its remaining projects have driven down performance to a net loss of around Php11 million.\n\nThese developments led to MWTS posting a net loss of Php109 million for the year.",

Attendance in a corporate governance seminar conducted by a duly recognized private or governmental institution is also a mandatory requirement prior to their assumption of office and during their term of office.\n\nThe Company also provides general access to training courses to its directors as a matter of continuous professional education as well as to enhance their skills as directors and keep them updated in their knowledge and understanding of the Company's business. The Board and Board Committees are also allowed to hire independent legal counsel, accountants, or other consultants to advise them when necessary.\n\nAt every board meeting, directors are provided with a management update on the operational and financial status of, and other relevant matters, about the Company to ensure that the directors are continuously informed of new developments and the performance of the Company.\n\nUpon assumption of office, a director appointed for the first time undergoes a corporate orientation program conducted by the Office of the Corporate Secretary. The corporate orientation program includes modules on the operations of the Company, as well as relevant contracts of the Company. The orientation also covers existing policies, rules and regulations of the Company. The curriculum of the orientation program may be revised as often as necessary to include other relevant subjects and matters relating to the Company. In addition to the corporate orientation program for new directors, the Office of the Corporate Secretary informs the Board of any updates on the matters covered by the orientation program. The corporate orientation program and updates are usually given during the regular meetings of the Board.\n\nThese programs notwithstanding, Manila Water encourages its directors to attend external trainings, courses or continuing professional education programs on corporate governance. The Directors are required to inform the Office of the Corporate Secretary of the trainings or courses attended for record and disclosure purposes.",

These include the organizational meeting of the Board which is held immediately after the annual stockholders' meeting. Under the By-laws, special meetings may be called by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, President or at the instance of a majority of the members of the Board.\n\nTo promote transparency, the Board has a policy of requiring the presence of at least one independent director in all its meetings. In the past years, the Board has not conducted a meeting without the presence of at least one independent director.\n\nUnder the Manual, a director's absence, or non-participation, for whatever reason in more than fifty percent (50%) of all Board meetings, both regular and special, in a year is a ground for temporary disqualification in the succeeding election.\n\n## Attendance of Directors in Board Meetings\n\nIn 2020, a total of eleven (11) meetings were held by the Board (exclusive of the Annual Stockholders' Meeting), as follows:\n\n- 1. Special Board Meeting held on January 31, 2020\n- 2. Regular Board Meeting held on February 20, 2020\n- 3. Organizational Board Meeting held on April 17, 2020\n- 4.

Almendras, the Company's President and Chief Executive Director, is an Executive Director and was not a party to the meeting of the Non-Executive Directors held on June 11, 2020 and November 24, 2020.\n\nDuring the 2020 Annual Stockholders' Meeting held on April 17, 2020, and conducted virtually via https://asm.ayala.com/MWC2020, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and CEO of the Company, and the Chairman of the Audit Committee along with the other directors and executive officers of the Company, were in attendance. Their attendance was duly recorded in the minutes of the said meeting.\n\n## Quorum in Board Meetings\n\nUnder the Charter of the Board, at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members of Board (as fixed in the Articles of Incorporation) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of corporate business, and every decision of at least a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which there is a quorum shall be valid as a corporate act, except when a higher quorum is required in contracts binding on the Company.\n\nIn the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn any meeting from time to time until a quorum is obtained.\n\n## Board Remuneration\n\nThe Board determines a level of remuneration for directors that shall be sufficient to attract and retain directors and compensate them for attendance at meetings of the Board and Board Committees and their performance of numerous responsibilities of a Board member. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the fees and other compensation for directors. In fulfilling this duty, the Remuneration Committee is guided by the objective of ensuring that the proposed fees should fairly compensate the directors for the work required consistent with the Company's size and industry.\n\nIn a special meeting held on April 11, 2011, the Board approved an increase in the Board remuneration. The approved remuneration for each member of the Board consists of PhP500,000.00 as a fixed annual retainer fee, PhP200,000.00 for each meeting of the Board actually attended, and PhP50,000.00 for each Committee meeting actually attended. This Board remuneration structure was approved by the stockholders in its annual stockholders' meeting held on April 11, 2011 and has not been modified since then. In the same annual meeting, the stockholders approved the amendment of the By- laws, giving the Board of Directors the authority to determine the amount, form, and structure of the fees and other compensation of the directors.",

        "page_content": "## Annual Board Evaluation\n\nThe Board has an annual evaluation process that is required to be accomplished by the directors, which enables an informed and objective assessment of the following:\n\n- 1. Board and Board Committee processes and meetings;\n- 2. Compliance with the responsibilities and functions of the Board and Board Committees;\n- 3. Board-Management relationship;\n- 4. Board Member self-evaluation; and\n- 5. Evaluation of the performance of the President and CEO and Senior Management\n\nThis evaluation enables the Board and the Management to determine areas that need improvement on the very scope and criteria of the evaluation process. It also allows the Board to explain their respective ratings and to provide their own comments on the matters discussed in the evaluation. The scope and criteria for the Board Evaluation Process is contained in the Charter of the Board of Directors. The Charter of the Board is available for download at the Company's website.\n\nIn addition to the annual Board evaluation process, the Audit Committee adopted SEC Memorandum Circular No. 4 Series of 2012 on the Guidelines for the Assessment of the Performance of Audit Committees of Companies Listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange which took effect on June 30, 2012. Pursuant to this, an annual evaluation is also being conducted to assess the performance of the Audit Committee.\n\nThese annual evaluation processes are facilitated by the Office of the Corporate Secretary in coordination with the Corporate Governance Committee.\n\n## Office of the Corporate Secretary\n\nThe Corporate Secretary ensures that the Board and the Management follow internal and external rules and regulations and facilitates clear communications between the Board and Management. More importantly, the Company recognizes the mandate of the Office in championing the compliance of the Board and the Company with good corporate governance practices and policies. For this purpose, the Office of the Corporate Secretary, under its Charter, is mandated to coordinate with the Office of the Compliance Officer with regard to the formulation and implementation of the corporate governance practices of the Company, especially those relevant to and affecting the Board. This is to ensure that sound corporate governance practices are embedded across the entire organization.\n\n## The Management\n\nThe Management is primarily responsible for the operations of the Company. As part of its accountability, the Management is required to provide the Board with adequate, regular, and timely information on the operations and affairs of the Company.\n\nThe roles of the Chairman, and the President and CEO were made separate to ensure an appropriate balance of authority, increased accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision- making.\n\nThe Manual requires the Company to disclose the relationship between the Chairman, and the President and CEO, if any, in its annual report to the SEC. The Chairman of the Board, Fernando Zobel de Ayala, and the President and CEO of the Company, Jose Rene Gregory D. Almendras, are not related to each other.\n\n## Succession Planning\n\nThe Board, with the assistance of the Remuneration Committee, the Nomination Committee, and the Company's Corporate Human Resources Group, has adopted a professional development program for employees, officers, and senior management. Through competency management, the Company has put in place a process to determine the skills necessary for particular positions in the Company and identifies key talents for purposes of succession. The Company's Corporate Human Resources Group has developed a Talent Master Plan to determine the optimal organizational structuring, recruitment strategies, performance evaluation methodologies, total rewards management, and career development. These are all geared to attract, retain, and engage the Company's employees, officers, and senior management, and to cultivate them to become the Company's future business leaders.\n\nThe development of a leadership talent pool is crucial to the success of Manila Water in the future. Hence, it is one of the top strategic priorities of the Company. For the succession of the top key management positions, the Company has formed an Acceleration Pool composed of selected high potential key talents within the organization.\n\nTalents identified to be part of the Acceleration Pool undergo the following:\n\n- 1. Assessment that gauges a talent's business driver readiness and leadership competencies;\n- 2. Creation of an Individual Development Plan that outlines possible developmental areas and stretched assignments; and\n- 3. Coaching and mentoring sessions with the Management Committee.",

Together with his primary function, the Compliance Officer is also tasked to oversee the implementation of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Related Party Transactions Policy.\n\n## The Corporate Governance Office\n\nThe Enterprise Corporate and Contract Advisory Services Department, (the 'Department') which is under the Legal and Corporate Governance Group is the unit tasked to formulate and implement the initiatives and policies on good corporate governance. The Department, on matters of corporate governance, reports directly to the Compliance Officer under the supervision of the Corporate Governance Committee. The Department has been active in the continuous conduct of orientation to all Manila Water employees and business partners on the Company's governance policies, particularly on matters contained in the Manual and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, such as transparency, whistle blower policy, honesty and fair dealing, and prompt and adequate disclosure of material information, among other policies.\n\nAmong the mandates of the Department is the continuous identification of gaps and challenges on corporate governance practices across the organization.

It helps the organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The activities of IA are governed by a separate Internal Audit Charter approved by the Audit Committee and the Board.\n\nThe IA reports to and supports the Audit Committee in the effective discharge of the Committee's oversight roles and responsibilities. The IA consists of talents and professionals who are either a Certified Public Accountant, Certified Internal Auditor, Certified Information Systems Auditor, Certified Internal Control Auditor, Certified Forensic Accountant, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer, or a mix thereof.\n\nIA prepares a risk-based internal audit plan (Audit Plan) approved by the Audit Committee annually, which is reassessed quarterly to consider emerging risks. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the Audit Plan and all deviations therefrom and ensures that internal audit examinations cover the evaluation of adequacy and effectiveness of controls encompassing the company's governance, operations, and information systems; reliability and integrity of financial and operational information; safeguarding of assets; and compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nThe IA conducts its activities guided by the Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA) Professional Practices Framework consisting of the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (Standards), the Definition of Internal Auditing and the Code of Ethics. In December 2017, the external auditing firm Punongbayan & Araullo conducted an independent validation of the internal audit function's Quality Assessment Review and concurred that the internal audit activity 'Generally Conforms' to the International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) and its mandatory elements namely: (1) Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing; (2) Definition of Internal Auditing; (3) Code of Ethics; and, (4) International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (Standards). The rating is considered the highest possible rating per IIA methodology. The Standards require that the external assessment be conducted at least once every five (5) years.",

The disclosure of any conflict of interest, including related party transactions, is required to be made fully and immediately. In cases where related party transactions exist, it is the Company's policy that complete information on such transaction be immediately disclosed, and, if a director or officer is involved, the director or officer concerned shall not be allowed to participate in the decision-making process. The policy also mandates that a director who has a continuing conflict of interest of a material nature shall be required to resign, or if the Board deems appropriate, be removed as a member of the Board.\n\nThe Company's Manual is continuously being revised in accordance with the directives and issuances of the SEC and to comply with the highest standards of corporate governance.

Related party transactions entered into by the Company with one or more of its directors or officers are voidable at the option of the Company, unless the transaction is deemed fair and reasonable under the circumstances and at arm's length, and the procedure for the procurement and approval for similar transactions was strictly complied with.\n\nThe RPT Policy provides for the process of approving related party transactions, as well as the implications for violations. In addition, the RPT Policy prohibits related party transactions involving loans and/or financial assistance to a director and loans and or financial assistance to members of the Management, except when allowed pursuant to an established Company benefit or plan. Under the RPT Policy, the approval of the Related\n\nParty Transactions Committee is required for material related party transactions.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, the Board approved the amendments Company's Policy on Related Party Transactions in order to comply with the provisions of the Rules on Material Related Party Transactions for Publicly Listed Companies of the SEC.

The Code sets forth the standards for professional and ethical behavior, as well as articulate acceptable and unacceptable conduct and practices in internal and external dealings of the Company. The Code should be properly disseminated to the Board, senior management and employees, and should also be disclosed and made available to the public through the company website.\n\nThe Code addresses the issues and relationships between and among the Company's directors, officers and employees, and its customers, suppliers, business partners, government offices and other stakeholders. The Code includes policies on: Honesty and Fair Dealing; Conflict of Interest; Corporate Entertainment and Gifts; Insider Trading; Disclosure; Creditor Rights; AntiCorruption; and Anti-Sexual Harassment.\n\n## Honesty and Fair Dealing\n\nThe core principle of the Company is to conduct business honestly and fairly with its investors, suppliers, contractors, service providers, customers and employees and other third parties. Directors, Officers and employees shall act honestly, ethically and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and protect the name and reputation of the Company.

('MWC', SEC Identification Number: A199611593) to undertake an independent assurance of the sustainability/ non-financial disclosures in MWC's 2020 Integrated Report (the 'Report') in its printed format for the year ended 31st December 2020. The intended users of this Assurance Statement are the management of the Company.\n\nWe performed this assurance engagement using DNV's assurance methodology VeriSustain TM1 , which is based on our professional experience, international assurance best practice including International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised*, along with the Global Reporting Initiative's ('GRI's') Principles for Defining Report Content and Report Quality and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board's ('SASB's') industry-specific Standards. The verification engagement was carried out from December 2020 to March 2021.\n\nWe understand that the reported financial data and related information are based on statutory disclosures and Audited Financial Statements # , which are subject to a separate independent statutory audit process. We did not review financial disclosures and data as they are not within the scope of our assurance engagement.\n\nWe planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion related to assurance of non-financial sustainability disclosures in this Report. We are providing a 'limited level' of assurance based on DNV's VeriSustain and no external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this assurance engagement.\n\nThe engagement excludes the sustainability management, performance, and reporting practices of MWC's suppliers, contractors, and any third-parties mentioned in the Report. The Company's position statements, the statements for the management approach, and case studies and examples are excluded from the scope of our work.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF MWC AND OF THE ASSURANCE PROVIDER\n\nThe Board of MWC has sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report and is responsible for all information provided in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting the information presented in the Report. MWC has stated that this Report has been prepared based on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework (the '<IR> Framework') and has adopted general disclosures and selected topic-specific disclosures related to identified material topics from the GRI Standards 2016, selected GRI Standards (2018 and 2020) as well as the SASB Standards 2018 (Water Utilities & Services).\n\nDNV's assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the Company to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith, true, and free from material misstatements. Because of the selected nature (sampling) and other inherent limitation of both procedures and systems of internal control, there remains the unavoidable risk that errors or irregularities, possibly significant, may not have been detected. DNV was not involved in the preparation of any statement or datum included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement.  DNV expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Assurance Statement.\n\nOur verification engagement included limited level of verification of sustainability performance disclosures for the identified material topics of MWC as identified under the reporting boundary brought out in the Report in the section 'Material Aspects' ie. covering entities over which Manila Water has operational control or has seconded employees in operations. Our verification applies a \u00b15% uncertainty threshold towards errors and omissions for the performance data brought out in the Report.",

        "page_content": "## BASIS OF OUR OPINION\n\nWe planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion as part of the assurance engagement. We adopted a risk-based approach, i.e. we concentrated our verification efforts on the issues of high material relevance to Utilities and its key stakeholders. A multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed non-financial disclosures related to the Head Office at Quezon City, and selected sites of MWC (Taguig Business Area, Bulakan Water Company, Inc. and Laguna Water LTI Sewerage Treatment Plant in the Philippines, based on DNV's sampling plan. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions, we carried out remote assessments as one-to-one discussions and onsite location assessments were not feasible. We undertook the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the non-financial sustainability disclosures in this Report;\n- \u00b7 Review of approach to materiality determination and stakeholder engagement and recent outputs although DNV did not have any direct engagement with external stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Review of information provided to us by the Company on its reporting and management processes related to sustainability performance for the reporting year based on the reporting framework adopted by MWC;\n- \u00b7 Interviews with selected members of leadership team, and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability issues and review of selected evidence to support issues discussed. We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with overall responsibility for the programmes to deliver the targets for mediumand long-term vision, mission and milestones;\n- \u00b7 Performed desk review of selected sustainability parameters for sampled entities, and findings were discussed and resolved with the corporate sustainability team;\n- \u00b7 Planned site assessments with three (3) sites - Taguig Business Area, Bulakan Water Company, Inc. and Laguna Water LTI Sewerage Treatment Plant - to review the processes and systems for preparing site level sustainability data and the implementation of MWC's sustainability strategy. We were free to choose the sites we sampled for our remote assessments;\n- \u00b7 Review of supporting evidence for key claims and data disclosed in the Report. Our verification processes were prioritized based on our risk-based approach, i.e. relevance of identified material topics and sustainability context of the business;\n- \u00b7 Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating the performance data and, for a sample, checking the data consolidation at site and corporate levels.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are shorter in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. During the assurance process, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement.\n\n## OPINION AND OBSERVATIONS\n\nOn the basis of the limited assurance engagement undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that MWC's 2020 Integrated Report does not properly describe the non-financial performance of identified material topics based on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework ('<IR> Framework').\n\nWithout affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations against the principles of VeriSustain:\n\n## Stakeholder Inclusiveness\n\nThe participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to Sustainability.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness.\n\nThe Report brings out the Company's relationships with its key stakeholders who affect operations and influence performance ie. regulators, customers, employees, the finance community, suppliers and the media. The Report brings out the channels and initiatives that the Company has established to engage with identified stakeholders and MWC's responses to these key concerns through various disclosures on strategies and value creation in the Report, and other platforms and mechanisms.",

This is based on global environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and considers ESG issues that could result in significant impacts on communities, business partners, workforce and the environment, and the relative influence on stakeholders' assessment and decision making, considering the requirements of the <IR> Framework's Guiding Principles. The material matters identified were further validated through stakeholder engagements conducted remotely during the year.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nThe extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Responsiveness.\n\nResponses to identified material topics and significant issues which have arisen during the reporting period are addressed through disclosures on strategies, management approach and dedicated 'Special Reports'. Further, the Report also brings out its non-financial performance related to its material topics through selected GRI Topic-Specific Standards and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) disclosures. The Report considers the risks, opportunities and outcomes associated with significant stakeholders and the external environment, and brings out the implications and mitigation mechanisms deployed by the Company to maintain its ability to create value on the long term. The Report may further strengthen on this Principle in future reporting periods by bringing out the long- and medium-term targets towards value creation related to its identified material topics.\n\n## Reliability\n\nThe accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying data management systems.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Reliability.\n\nThe majority of the performance disclosures verified through offsite verification, i.e. at the Head Office and sampled sites, and through desk reviews, were found to be fairly accurate, reliable, identifiable and traceable to the source. Considering the limited sampling, we did not detect any major errors related to data collection or aggregation. We also reviewed the calculations and related assumptions used for its suitability, taking into account the principle of Reliability. Some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to interpretation and aggregation errors. These identified errors were communicated, and the responses and corrections made to the reported data and information were reviewed.\n\n## Completeness\n\nHow much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organization and its stakeholders is reported.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Completeness.\n\nThe Report discloses the Company's non-financial disclosures based on the <IR> Framework and performance during the chosen reporting period related to its material issues using appropriate GRI Topic Specific Standards and SASB disclosures, for the identified boundary of operations and covering the Company's approaches to value creation achieved through its identified capitals, its business model, strategies and management approach disclosures and responses to key challenges faced.",

Under MWAP are two affiliated companies in Vietnam, namely Thu Duc Water B.O.O. Corporation (Thu Duc Water) and Kenh Dong Water Supply Joint Stock Company (Kenh Dong Water), both supplying treated water to Saigon Water Corporation (SAWACO) under a take-or-pay arrangement. Also, under MWAP are Saigon Water Infrastructure Corporation (Saigon Water), a holding company listed in the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, and Cu Chi Water Supply Sewerage Company, Ltd. (Cu Chi Water). Apart from its operations in Vietnam, MWAP has associates in Thailand and Indonesia through Eastern Water Resources Development and Management Public Company Limited (East Water), a fully integrated water supply and distribution company listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and PT Sarana Tirta Ungaran (PT STU), an industrial water supply operation in Indonesia, respectively.\n\nLastly, Manila Water Total Solutions Corp. (MWTS), a wholly-owned subsidiary, handles after-the-meter products and services including pipe-laying, integrated wastewater services, the incubation of new sector businesses and until October 31, 2020 the sale of Healthy Family Purified Water in five-gallon, 500-ml and 350-ml bottles in selected areas in Metro Manila.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nGroup net income for the period ended December 31, 2020 declined by 18 percent from the same period last year to Php4,500 million 1 from Php5,496 million. Excluding the one-offs,  core income stood at Php5,779 million, 22 percent lower than the same period last year. This was driven by lower contribution from domestic subsidiaries due to impact of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as one-off recognition of additional estimates for probable losses across the Group.\n\nThe Group's key financial performance indicators are discussed below:\n\n|                                                                   | For the periods ended December 31 (in million Pesos)   | For the periods ended December 31 (in million Pesos)   | For the periods ended December 31 (in million Pesos)   | For the periods ended December 31 (in million Pesos)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | 2020                                                   | 2019                                                   | Increase/  (Decrease)                                  | %                                                      |\n| Total operating revenues                                          | 21,125                                                 | 21,647                                                 | (522)                                                  | -2%                                                    |\n| Total cost and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) | 8,338                                                  | 9,606                                                  | (1,268)                                                | -13%                                                   |\n| Other income (loss) -

The relatively flat revenue contribution from the East Zone Concession was partially offset by lower revenues from other domestic subsidiaries and lower other operating income which decreased by 46 percent largely as a result of lower supervision fees from Estate Water. The Group derived 80 percent of its operating revenues from the sale of water, while 16 percent came from environmental and sewer charges. Other revenues, which accounted for the balance, are comprised of supervision fees, after-the-meter services, connection fees and septic sludge disposal, among others.\n\nFor the periods ended December 31 (in million Pesos)\n\n|                                                                   | 2020   | 2019   | Increase/  (Decrease)   | %    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------------|------|\n| Salaries, wages and employee benefits                             | 2,267  | 2,315  | (47)                    | -2%  |\n| Direct costs                                                      | 3,735  | 4,220  | (485)                   | -11% |\n| Overhead                                                          | 1,561  | 2,291  | (730)                   | -32% |\n| Premises                                                          | 361    | 375    | (14)                    | -4%  |\n| Other expenses                                                    | 413    | 406    | 8                       | 2%   |\n| Total cost and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) | 8,338  | 9,606  | (1,268)                 | -13% |\n\nConsolidated costs and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by 13 percent to Php8,338 million in 2020 from Php9,606 million as all expense accounts posted decline versus the same period last year. Notable is the 25 percent decline in overhead costs which was largely due to the one-off expenses in 2019 such as the Php534 million in relation to the penalty imposed by MWSS and additional expenses which arose in the ordinary course of business. Meanwhile, direct costs declined 11 percent to Php3,735 million, driven by lower septic sludge disposal and repairs and maintenance due to postponement of activities during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). This decline was supported by the lower power, light and water expenses despite the higher supply coming from the Cardona Water Treatment Plant and deep wells which operate at a higher production cost, as well as the higher direct cost levels in some domestic subsidiaries.\n\nEquity Share in Net Income of Associates decreased 67 percent during the period to Php214 million, mainly driven by lower contribution from Saigon Water and East Water, with the latter's lower contribution due to the finalization of the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA). Said decrease was slightly offset by the higher contributions from Thu Duc Water and Kenh Dong Water which increased by 9 percent and 26 percent respectively. Meanwhile, Other Expenses totaled Php1,058 million for the period, driven by net foreign exchange losses, as well as the provisions for probable losses for Cu Chi Water and Zamboanga Water.\n\nConsequently, consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) declined by 6 percent to end at Php11,943 million in 2020, with an EBITDA margin of 57 percent. Depreciation and amortization rose by 20 percent to Php3,523 million mainly attributable to the completed capital expenditures in 2019 and the relatively higher billed volume and wastewater flows in 2020.\n\nNet interest expense was higher by 5 percent to Php1,757 million from the same period last year, driven by the increase in loans, including the sustainable bonds, of the East Zone Concession and other subsidiaries.",

This recognition partially offset the otherwise resilient performance of the business amid the COVID-19 pandemic which affected all businesses globally. Excluding one-offs, core income of the Parent Company was at Php5,736 million, 15 percent lower than the same period in 2019 due to higher depreciation expense from completed projects, interest expense and note forex losses from the issuance of sustainability bonds.\n\n|                                         | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                         | 2020                                | 2019                                | Increase/  (Decrease)               | %                                   |\n| Operating Highlights                    |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Billed volume (in million cubic meters) | 506                                 | 494                                 | 12.4                                | 3%                                  |\n| Number of billed connections            | 1,017,639                           | 1,002,380                           | 15,259                              | 2%                                  |\n| Collection Efficiency                   | 92.36%                              | 99.63%                              | (7.3 ppts.)                         |                                     |\n| Non-revenue water (end-of-period)       | 15.5%                               | 10.5%                               | (5.2 ppts.)                         |                                     |\n| Financial Highlights (in million Pesos) |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Revenues                                | 17,104                              | 17,039                              | 65                                  | 0%                                  |\n| Cost and expenses                       | 5,435                               | 6,595                               | (1,160)                             | -18%                                |\n| Other Income (Expense)                  | (1,524)                             | 48                                  | (1,572)                             | -3,293%                             |\n| EBITDA                                  | 10,145                              | 10,492                              | (348)                               | -3%                                 |\n| Amortization & Depreciation             | 2,848                               | 2,405                               | 443                                 | 18%                                 |\n| Interest Expense - net                  | (1,099)                             | (1,019)                             | (80)                                | 8%                                  |\n| Provision for Income Tax                | 1,531                               | 2,045                               | (515)                               | -25%                                |\n| Net income                              | 4,666                               | 5,022                               | (356)                               | -7%                                 |\n\nThe favorable raw water levels and the Company's resilient service performance even under the imposed strict community quarantine restrictions helped bolster a 3 percent improvement in billed volume. However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on customer mix. Specifically, billed volume mix shifted 5 percentage points in favor of the residential segment, as businesses ceased operations and more people were confined to their homes during the imposed community quarantines. As a result, revenue mix was affected by way of an 8 percentage point movement towards the residential segment,  which in turn caused average tariff to decrease 2 percent from the same period last year. This led to revenues of Php17,104 million for the period, relatively flat versus last year. Excluding the effect of the voluntary bill waiver program in 2019 amounting to Php353 million, revenues would have been lower by 2 percent versus last year.\n\nMeanwhile, cost and expenses decreased 18 percent to Php5,435 million, despite higher Expected Credit Losses amounting to Php259 million due to extension of due dates for water bills. The overall decrease in cost and expenses was driven by aggressive cost management in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and relatively by the penalty of MWSS in 2019. Additional expenses recognized were in 2019 in line with various exposures pertaining to operations and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe Company recorded a Php534 million penalty imposed by MWSS in relation to the water supply shortage in 2019. Even as Manila Water abides by the MWSS decision to impose said penalty in 2019, Manila Water assumes no liability on the penalty's basis as the Company was not the root cause of the water supply shortage.",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nDuring the 2 nd half of 2019, the Supreme Court ordered each of the MWSS concessionaires, jointly and severally with MWSS, to pay more than Php921 million in fines for non-compliance with the Clean Water Act.  The Company affirmed that it will exercise all its legal options in relation to this case, including the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration which it timely submitted to the Supreme Court on October 2, 2019.\n\nWith these, EBITDA declined by 4 percent to Php10,145 million from Php10,492 million in the same period last year. EBITDA margin stood at 59 percent.\n\nCollection levels were similarly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as community quarantine restrictions posed challenges for customers to pay their bills. In compliance with the mandate of MWSS and in line with the Bayanihan Law, the Company suspended disconnection activities and provided installment payment schemes to customers as necessary. While these factors caused collection efficiency to drop to over 92 percent from about 100 percent the same period last year, significant recovery in collection levels were realized as quarantine restrictions were eased.\n\nIn spite of the challenges in 2020 posed in large part by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company remained resilient and continued to deliver on its service obligations to customers.\n\n## Manila Water Philippines Ventures (MWPV)\n\nThe following discussion covers the consolidated results of Manila Water Philippines Ventures, driven mainly by its core domestic operating subsidiaries in Boracay Water, Clark Water, Laguna Water, and Estate Water (a division of Manila Water Philippine Ventures).\n\n|                                                     | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | 2020                                | 2019                                | Increase/  (Decrease)               | %                                   |\n| Operating Highlights                                |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Billed volume (in million cubic meters)             | 105                                 | 97                                  | 8                                   | 9%                                  |\n| Financial Highlights (in million Pesos)             |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Revenues                                            | 4,224                               | 4,686                               | (462)                               | -10%                                |\n| Cost and expenses                                   | 2,950                               | 2,894                               | 56                                  | 2%                                  |\n| EBITDA                                              | 1,319                               | 1,822                               | (503)                               | -28%                                |\n| Operation of the segment under PFRS 5 - after tax 3 | (334)                               | 89                                  | (423)                               | -476%                               |\n| Net income (loss) attributable to MWC               | (480)                               | 450                                 | (930)                               | -207%                               |\n\nMWPV ended the year 2020 with a net loss of Php480 3 million, 207 percent lower than last year due to the combined effects of the following: (1) lower net income contribution from Estate Water attributable to the decrease in supervision fees, with said decrease mainly due to the change in accounting treatment and the slowdown in projects; (2) the decrease in net income of Boracay Water mainly due to an 84 percent decline in tourist arrivals brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) higher operating expenses and financing costs of MWPV's standalone operations; (4) higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to additional capital expenditures; and (5) additional estimates for the Group's various exposures during the period, including significant provisions in line with Zamboanga Water.\n\nOn a consolidated MWPV level, revenues declined by 10 percent to Php4,224 million. Specifically, the noted 4 percent growth in water and wastewater revenues for the period was offset by the 70 percent decline in Estate Water's supervision fees. The year-on-year growth in water and wastewater revenues was attributable to the 9 percent increase in billed volume, mostly coming from the full year operations of new operating subsidiaries, as well as higher effective tariff of Laguna Water with its upward tariff adjustment implemented at the start of 2020. Cost and expenses were higher by 2 percent year-on-year to Php2,950 million.  This was attributable to the net effect of the following:  (1) decrease in power costs",

In 2020, an additional provision of Php218  million was recognized in relation to the termination of Zamboanga Water's contract with Zamboanga City Water District.\n\nThe movements in the MWPV Group's revenues and costs resulted in a 28 percent reduction in EBITDA to Php1,319 million from Php1,822 million in 2019. EBITDA margin was at 31 percent, lower by 8 percentage points from last year's 39 percent.\n\nNet interest expense stood at Php478 million, higher by 14 percent versus the same period last year, driven by additional loan drawdowns of the subsidiaries. Depreciation and amortization expense grew by 29 percent to Php708 million, due to significant capital expenditures made by the Group in prior years which have already been depreciated.\n\nCollection levels of the domestic subsidiaries were also affected during the period of the ECQ, but tracked on an upward trajectory as soon as quarantine restrictions were eased in the third quarter. As such, the total collection efficiency of the MWPV group for 2020 stood at 95 percent.\n\nBelow is a summary of the results of MWPV's core subsidiaries:\n\n|                                         | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                         | 2020                                | 2019                                | Increase/  (Decrease)               | %                                   |\n| Clark Water                             |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Billed volume (in million cubic meters) | 13.4                                | 14.5                                | (1.0)                               | -7%                                 |\n| Net income (in million Pesos)           | (80)                                | 43                                  | (123)                               | -286%                               |\n| Laguna Water                            |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Billed volume (in million cubic meters) | 44.9                                | 44.1                                | 0.8                                 | 2%                                  |\n| Net income (in million Pesos)           | 481                                 | 409                                 | 72                                  | 18%                                 |\n| Boracay Water                           |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Billed volume (in million cubic meters) | 3.2                                 | 4.8                                 | (1.6)                               | -33%                                |\n| Net income (in million Pesos)           | (117)                               | 79                                  | (196)                               | -248%                               |\n| Estate Water (Division of MWPV)         |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Supervision Fees                        | 249                                 | 825                                 | (576)                               | -70%                                |\n| Billed volume (in million cubic meters) | 10.5                                | 10.5                                | (0.0)                               | 0%                                  |\n| Net income (in million Pesos)           | (76)                                | 355                                 | (432)                               | -121%                               |",

Excluding one-offs, core income of MWAP was at Php163 million, 12 percent higher than last year.\n\nIn line with MWAP Group's governance and management practices, additional expenses for estimated losses pertaining to operations are reviewed periodically. Following this review, estimates are adjusted to reflect the current state of the business. An additional expense of Php337 million was recognized during the year ended  December 31, 2020 in relation to the Group's exposures.\n\nEquity share in net income of associates also decreased by 67 percent to P214 million mainly due to the finalization of the purchase price allocation of the Investment in East Water in 2020 following the acquisition in 2018. Goodwill for the acquisition was reduced by THB1,496 million, which was reallocated to Fair Value of the underlying assets of East Water. As of December 31, 2020, total adjustment related to the fair value amortization of East Water's investment amounted to THB259 million, equivalent to Php411 million.\n\nOn the other hand, cost and expenses declined by 46 percent to Php85 million, attributable to the lower travel expenses due to travel restrictions and deferment of new business development activities brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBelow is a summary of the results of MWAP's associates:\n\n|                                                      | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   | For the periods ended December 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Equity Share in Net Income of Associates - PFRS      | 2020                                | 2019                                | Increase/  (Decrease)               | %                                   |\n| East Water at 18.72% contribution, before adjustment | 232                                 | 323                                 | (91)                                | -28%                                |\n| Impact of Fair Value Amportization                   | 411                                 | 29                                  |                                     |                                     |\n| East Water at 18.72% contribution, adjusted          | (179)                               | 295                                 | (474)                               | -161%                               |\n| Thu Duc Water at 49.00% contribution                 | 267                                 | 245                                 | 21                                  | 9%                                  |\n| Kenh Dong Water  at 47.35% contribution              | 164                                 | 131                                 | 33                                  | 26%                                 |\n| Saigon Water at 37.99% contribution                  | (37)                                | (19)                                | (18)                                | -98%                                |\n| PT STU at 20% contribution                           | (0.7)                               | 1.5                                 | (2)                                 | -148%                               |\n| TOTAL                                                | 214                                 | 654                                 | (440)                               | -67%                                |",

Meanwhile, for the Environmental Services segment, the slowdown in projects caused a significant drag on profitability by way of a net loss of Php16 million for the period. This is likewise the case for the Pipelaying segment, wherein delays in the implementation of its remaining projects have drove down performance to a net loss of about Php11 million. Coupled with higher head office costs amounting to Php18 million, MWTS ended 2020 with a net loss level of about Php109 million.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\n\nTotal assets as of December 2020 stood at nearly Php157 billion, an increase of about Php22 billion against December 2019 driven by the increase in cash and short-term investments and service concession assets.  The Group balance sheet remains strong, with the Company remaining compliant with loan covenants and key ratios maintained well within set tolerances.\n\n|                               | As of December 31 (in million Pesos)   | As of December 31 (in million Pesos)   | As of December 31 (in million Pesos)   | As of December 31 (in million Pesos)   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                               | As of  Dec 31, 2020                    | As of  Dec 31, 2019                    | Increase/  (Decrease)                  | %                                      |\n| Assets                        | 156,527                                | 134,602                                | 21,925                                 | 16%                                    |\n| Cash + Short Term Investments | 20,857                                 | 9,068                                  | 11,789                                 | 130%                                   |\n| Service Concession Assets     | 102,272                                | 93,519                                 | 8,753                                  | 9%                                     |\n| Other Assets                  | 33,398                                 | 32,015                                 | 1,383                                  | 4%                                     |\n| Liabilities                   | 96,363                                 | 78,610                                 | 17,753                                 | 23%                                    |\n| Equity                        | 60,163                                 | 55,991                                 | 4,172                                  | 7%                                     |\n| Ratios                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |\n| Net Bank Debt to Equity       | 0.90x                                  | 0.86x                                  |                                        |                                        |\n| DSCR                          | 1.89x                                  | 1.48x                                  |                                        |                                        |\n| ROE                           | 8%                                     | 10%                                    |                                        |                                        |",

Net bank debt to equity was at 0.90x while Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) stood at 1.89x.  Average Cost of Debt for the Group was at 4.25 percent, 25 basis  points lower than the same period last year, while Return-on-Equity was at 8 percent.\n\nIn view of prevailing circumstances, Manila Water did not declare cash dividends in 2020.  With the ongoing discussions with government on the Concession Agreement, as well as the need to continuously focus on service continuity and operations resiliency amid the prevailing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, resources are being prioritized towards ensuring reliable service to customers.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\nThe Group ended 2020 with total capital expenditures of Php12,090 million, with Php9,840 million or 81 percent of said amount accounted for by the East Zone Concession.  Majority of the East Zone Concession's capital expenditures were spent on wastewater expansion, network reliability and water supply projects in line with attaining service obligations outlined in its government-approved Rate Rebasing service improvement plan. The balance was accounted for by concession fees paid to MWSS.\n\nMeanwhile, total capital expenditures of the domestic subsidiaries amounted to Php2,250  million.  Of the total amount, Php445 million was undertaken by Laguna Water for its water network expansion, while Boracay Water disbursed Php239 million.  Estate Water spent Php972 million for its greenfield and brownfield projects, while the balance was taken on by the remaining subsidiaries for its various projects.\n\n## RECENT MATERIAL EVENTS\n\n## Subscription by Prime Metroline Holdings, Inc./Trident Water\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company signed a Subscription Agreement with Trident Water for the acquisition of 820 million common shares, which represents 25 percent stake in Manila Water, at Php13 per share or estimated total proceeds of Php10.7 billion in equity.\n\nThe signing of the Subscription Agreement, as well as the approvals secured from shareholders at the 2020 Annual Stockholders' Meeting for the increase in capital stock and carved out shares, are components of a series of events towards the completion of the transaction.  Other conditions precedent and approvals are being worked on and remain in progress.\n\nOn July 02, 2020, the Company received formal notice from the SEC approving several key amendments to the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation. Particularly, these amendments are (1) to increase the Carved-Out Shares from 300 Million unissued common shares to 900 Million unissued common shares allocated for issuance in one or more transactions or offerings for cash, properties, or assets to carry out the Company's corporate purposes as approved by the Board of Directors; and (2) to allow the issuance of the Carved-Out Shares 'for cash, properties, or assets to carry out' the corporate purposes of the Company as approved by the Board of Directors. Carved-Out Shares are common shares which are waived of shareholders' pre-emptive rights and are earmarked for specific corporate purposes.\n\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company received a copy of the resolution from PCC, indicating that said Commission will take no further action with respect to the transaction. Specifically, it was deemed that the proposed acquisition of shares in Manila Water will not likely result in substantial lessening of competition.",

(previously known as Prime Metroline Holdings, Inc.) signed an Amendment to the Subscription Agreement which both parties signed last February 1, 2020.  The amendment covers the inclusion of Trident Water Company Holdings, Inc. as party to the Subscription Agreement following its establishment, as well as the updated payment terms which is 50 percent upon Closing and 50 percent upon call of Manila Water's Board of Directors.\n\n## Zamboanga Water Contract Termination\n\nOn April 3, 2020, the management of Zamboanga Water, a wholly owned subsidiary of MWPV, received a letter, dated April 1, 2020, from the Zamboanga City Water District (ZCWD), informing the former of the termination of the NonRevenue Water Reduction Service Agreement (NRWRSA) between Zamboanga Water and ZCWD.  In the letter, ZCWD indicated that the erratic supply of water due to the recurrent dry spell and El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon affecting the District Metered Areas (DMAs) established by Zamboanga Water has rendered the NRWRSA impractical and unworkable, and thus, in the interest of fiscal responsibility and sound management of government funds, ZCWD requested the termination of the NRWRSA.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, the Board of Directors of Zamboanga Water approved the acceptance of ZCWD's request to terminate the NRWSA. Said approval is without prejudice the claims and remedies due Zamboanga Water under the terms and conditions of the contract, which the Company continues to uphold. Despite earnest efforts, Zamboanga Water and ZCWD were unable to arrive at an amicable settlement.\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Zamboanga Water filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Philippine dispute Resolution Center, Inc., the arbitral body designated in the NRWRSA, for claims related to unpaid fixed fees and performance fees, interest and other claims. The arbitration is currently ongoing.\n\n## Issuance of ASEAN Sustainability Bonds\n\nOn July 22, 2020, Manila Water announced its plan to issue an offering of USD-denominated senior unsecured notes, which qualify as ASEAN sustainability bonds. Proceeds from the issuance of the bond are intended to refinance debt and finance programmed capital expenditures for 2020-2021, pursuant to the Sustainability Financing Framework (SFF) which the Company recently established; proceeds are targeted towards financing projects related to (1) Sustainable water and wastewater management, (2) Terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation, and (3) Affordable basic infrastructure categories. The Company's SFF is aligned with the Green Bond Principles 2018 and Social Bond Principles 2018 and likewise complies with the ASEAN Sustainability Bond Standards and SEC MC No. 8, s 2019.\n\nOn July 23, 2020, the Company successfully issued the USD500 million ASEAN sustainability bonds, debuting in the international debt capital markets. The Company is the first Philippine Corporate to issue an ASEAN sustainability bond. Equally important, this issuance is the single largest green, social or sustainability bond issued by a listed private water utility in Asia. The 10-year non-call five-year bond was priced at 99.002 with a coupon rate of 4.375 percent p.a., offering a yield of 4.50 percent p.a.\n\nThe successful bond issuance enables the Company to diversify its fund sources, to refinance maturing obligations, as well as fund its committed water and wastewater infrastructure projects in the East Zone Concession.",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Closure of Healthy Family Business Division\n\nOn August 26, 2020, the Company announced that Manila Water Total Solutions Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Manila Water, will be closing its Healthy Family Business Division effective October 31, 2020 due to said division's recurring losses and inability to financially sustain business operations. The dynamic competitiveness in the bottled water industry and recent economic challenges, despite notable efforts of management to improve operating efficiency and profitability, proved too difficult for the business to cope and keep operations viable.\n\nMWTS will continue to exist and operate based on its primary purpose of engaging in water, wastewater and environmental services.\n\n## Execution of Revised Concession Agreement\n\nOn March 31, 2021, MWSS and the Company executed a Revised CA following the directive of the President to review the provisions of the CA. The Revised CA confirms the continuation of the concession until July 31, 2037. The Revised CA removes recovery of Corporate Income Taxes and the adjustment for foreign currency differential (FCDA). The revised CA also lowers the yearly inflation factor to 2/3 of the Consumer Price Index adjustment and imposes a cap on tariff rate increases equivalent to 1.3x the previous standard rate for water and 1.5x the previous standard rate for wastewater. Instead of a market-driven appropriate discount rate, the Company shall now be limited to a 12% fixed nominal discount rate.  The rate rebasing mechanism under the original CA is retained. However, no tariff increases will be implemented until December 31, 2022 in order to assist the disadvantaged sector and to contribute to the economy's recovery post COVID-19. The Undertaking Letter of the Republic has been retained with the exclusion of the clause prohibiting interference by the government in  the rate setting mechanism and with the proviso that this shall now apply only to contracts and obligations existing at the time of execution of the revised CA.\n\n## Contingency Measures Amid the Covid-19 Pandemic\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the communities which Manila Water serves, numerous contingency measures have been undertaken to ensure business continuity and to safeguard the health and safety of employees and customers.\n\nWith the onset of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), the Group put in place business contingency measures to ensure that critical facilities and business centers remain operational to provide reliable service to our customers. Particularly, in view of health and safety concerns, the Group suspended meter reading activities in its various service areas for the duration of the ECQ. When community quarantine restrictions were eased, the Group immediately focused on customer concerns regarding billing and payment. For customer billing concerns, the Group worked closely with its respective regulators and other government agencies to validate and provide clarifications to billing queries. Furthermore, customers were provided concessions on bill payments by way of extended payment periods and installment plans where applicable. For payment concerns, the Group pushed for the adoption of various electronic/online platforms to promote added convenience and safety for customers in their settlement of bills.\n\nFor employees, to ensure their welfare and safety amid the COVID-19 pandemic and ECQ, only essential technical and business operations employees are deployed at the facilities while the rest remain on call on a split operations/work-fromhome deployment protocol. Re-entering employees were initially required to undergo rapid testing, and upon entry to Company premises are provided the necessary protection (protective gear; disinfection of facilities) and support to ensure their safety.",

(the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'the Group'), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRSs).\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with Philippine Standards on Auditing (PSAs).  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in the Philippines (Code of Ethics) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Philippines, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.

The amounts billed to customers consist of a number of components, including basic charge, environmental charge and foreign currency differential adjustment and where applicable, sewer charge.  These tariffs depend on the customer type and are determined based on a formula as prescribed by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System Regulatory Office (MWSS RO).  This matter is significant to our audit because the revenue recognized depends on the completeness and accuracy of capture of water consumption based on the meter readings over the concession area taken on various dates; the propriety of rates applied across customer types; and the reliability of the systems involved in processing the billing transactions.\n\nRelevant disclosures related to this matter are provided in Notes 1, 2, 3, 6 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the controls over the read and bill process, which includes the capture of water consumption and calculation of billed fees, downloading of data from the billing system and uploading of data to the Parent Company's financial reporting system.  We involved our internal specialist in the testing of the related controls over these processes.  We performed a.) analytical procedures; and b.) test calculation of the billed amounts using the volume of water consumption and MWSS RO-approved rates and compared them with the amounts reflected in the billing statement.  We also evaluated the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Provision and contingencies\n\nThe Group is involved in legal proceedings and assessments for local and national taxes and for alleged noncompliance with laws and regulations.  This matter is significant to our audit because the estimation of the potential liability resulting from these legal proceedings and assessments require significant judgment by management.  The inherent uncertainty over the outcome of these tax and legal matters is brought about by the differences in the interpretation and implementation of the relevant laws and tax regulations and/or rulings.\n\nThe Group's disclosure about provisions and contingencies are included in Notes 1, 3 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit response\n\nOur audit procedures include the involvement of our internal specialists in reviewing the status of these legal proceedings and assessments, and the legal and tax positions of the Group based on the merits of the arguments against the assessments, previous court decisions, implementing rules and opinions issued by relevant government and regulatory agencies.  In addition, we performed a recalculation of the amount of the provisions and compared this with the outstanding provisions as of year-end.  We also evaluated the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amortization of service concession assets using the units-of-production (UOP) method\n\nThe service concession assets (SCA) of the Group is related to its concession agreements.  The Group uses UOP method in amortizing its SCA based on the actual billed volume over the estimated billable water volume for the remaining period of the concession agreement.  The UOP amortization method is a key audit matter as the method involves significant management judgment, estimates, and assumptions, particularly in determining the total estimated billable water volume over the remaining periods of the concession agreements.  It considers different factors such as population growth rate, supply and consumption, which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, and service coverage, including ongoing and future expansions.\n\nRefer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the relevant disclosures related to this matter.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited",

We evaluated the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of management's specialist who estimated the total billable water volume.  We also reviewed the report of the management's specialist and gained an understanding of the methodology and the basis of computing the forecasted volumes, taking into consideration the impact associated with coronavirus pandemic.  Furthermore, we compared the estimated billable water volume for the year against the actual data generated from the billing system.  We recalculated the amortization expense for the year based on the actual billed water volume.\n\n## Impairment testing of service concession assets and property and equipment\n\nAs discussed in Note 3, the Parent Company's market capitalization as of December 31, 2020 is significantly below its net book value, which decline was triggered by, among others, the ongoing discussion with the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System on the provisions of the Concession Agreement identified for renegotiation and amendment.  This is an impairment indicator that requires an assessment of the recoverability of the Parent Company's non-financial assets, particularly its service concession assets and property and equipment with carrying amounts of P=89.13 billion and P=1.08 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.  The determination of the recoverable amounts of these assets requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and assumptions.  The valuation of these assets using fair value less cost to sell requires the assistance of an external appraiser whose calculations also depend on certain assumptions, which have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, such as recent sales, offering prices or listing of comparable properties registered within the vicinity of the subject assets and cost to build similar assets, adjustments to sales prices based on internal and external factors, and deductions for physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence.\n\nThe disclosures in relation to the above matters are included in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit response\n\nWe involved our internal specialist in evaluating the methodology and assumptions used in determining the fair values of the service concession assets and property and equipment.  For the market approach, the assumptions used include information supporting the comparability of the subject assets with identical or similar properties for which information is available, value of comparable properties and adjustments made to the value of the comparable properties.  We made inquiries with the management's specialist who appraised the assets about the methodology and assumptions used in the valuation of the subject assets, taking into consideration the impact associated with coronavirus pandemic, and we evaluated the specialist's competence, capabilities, and objectivity by considering its qualifications, experience and reporting responsibilities.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises the information included in the SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.  The SEC Form 20-IS (Definitive Information Statement), SEC Form 17-A and Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2019 are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audits, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with PSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with PSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The Concession Agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of the Parent Company throughout a twenty-five (25)year concession period.  The MWSS Regulatory Office (MWSS RO) monitors and reviews the performance of each of the Concessionaires - the Parent Company and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (Maynilad), the West Zone Concessionaire.",

While the Parent Company has the right to manage, operate, repair, and refurbish specified MWSS facilities in the East Zone, legal title to these assets remains with MWSS.  The legal title to all fixed assets contributed to the existing MWSS system by the Parent Company during the Concession remains with the Parent Company until the Expiration Date (or until the early termination date) at which time all rights, titles and interest in such assets will automatically vest to MWSS.\n\nOn Commencement Date, the Parent Company officially took over the operations of the East Zone and rehabilitation works for the service area commenced immediately thereafter.  As provided in the Parent Company's project plans, operational commercial capacity has been obtained upon substantial completion of the rehabilitation work.\n\nUnder the Concession Agreement, the Parent Company is entitled to the following rate adjustments:\n\n- a. annual standard rate adjustment to compensate for increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI);\n- extraordinary price adjustment (EPA) to account for the financial consequences of the occurrence\n- b. of certain unforeseen events stipulated in the Concession Agreement;\n- c. foreign currency differential adjustment (FCDA) to recover foreign exchange losses including all accruals and carrying costs thereof, arising from MWSS loans and any Concessionaire loans used for capital expenditures and concession fee payments, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Amendment No. 1 of the Concession Agreement dated October 12, 2001 (see Notes 2, 10 and 13); and\n- d. Rebasing Convergence Adjustment for the purposes of calculating the Rates Adjustment Limit for each of the five Charging Years of the Rebasing Period determined based on the following:\n- i. where the Rebasing Adjustment is found to be positive, the Rebasing Convergence Adjustment for the first Charging Year of the Rate Rebasing Period shall be equal to the Rebasing Adjustment, and the Rebasing Convergence Adjustment for each of the following four (4) Charging Years shall be zero; and\n- ii. where the Rebasing Adjustment is found to be negative, the Rebasing Adjustment for each of the five (5) Charging Years of the Rebasing Period shall be equal to the Rebasing Adjustment divided by five (5).\n\nThese rate adjustments are subject to a rate adjustment limit which is equivalent to the sum of CPI published in the Philippines, EPA and Rebasing Convergence Adjustment as defined in the Concession Agreement.  The Concession Agreement also provides a general rate setting policy for rates chargeable by the Parent Company for water and sewerage services as follows:\n\n- a. For the period through the second Rate Rebasing date (January 1, 2008), the maximum rates chargeable by the Parent Company (subject to interim adjustments) are set out in the Concession Agreement; and,\n- b. From and after the second Rate Rebasing date, the rates for water and sewerage services shall be set at a level that will permit the Parent Company to recover, over the twenty-five (25)-year term of the concession, its investment including operating, capital maintenance and investment incurred, Philippine business taxes and payments corresponding to debt service on MWSS loans and the Parent Company's loans incurred to finance such expenditures, and to earn a rate of return equal to the appropriate discount rate (ADR) on these expenditures for the remaining term of the concession.\n\nThe maximum rates chargeable for such water and sewerage services shall be subject to general adjustment at five (5)-year intervals commencing on the second Rate Rebasing date, provided that the MWSS RO may exercise its discretion to make a general adjustment of such rates.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOn April 16, 2009, the MWSS Board of Trustees (MWSS BOT) passed Resolution No. 2009-072 approving the fifteen (15)-year extension of the Concession Agreement (the 'Extension') from May 7, 2022 to May 6, 2037.  This resolution was confirmed by the Department of Finance (DOF), by authority from the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, on October 23, 2009.  The significant commitments under the Extension follow:\n\n- a. To mitigate tariff increases such that there will be reduction of the balance of the approved 2008 rebased tariff by 66%, zero increase of the rebased tariff in 2009 and a P=1.00 increase for years 2010 to 2016, subject to CPI and FCDA adjustments.\n- b. To increase the share in the current operating budget support to MWSS by 100% as part of the concession fees starting 2009.\n- c. To increase the total investments from the approved P=187.00 billion for the periods 2008 to 2022 to P =450.00 billion for 2008 to 2037.\n\nWith the approval of the Extension, the recovery period for the Parent Company's investment has been extended by another fifteen (15) years from 2022 to 2037.\n\nOn December 5, 2019, the MWSS BOT issued Resolution No. 2019-201-CO revoking Resolution No. 2009-072 dated April 16, 2009 pertaining to the Extension of the Concession Agreement of the Parent Company from May 7, 2022 to May 6, 2037.\n\nOn December 20, 2019, MWSS released a press statement clarifying Resolution No. 2019-201-CO and confirming that the action of the MWSS BOT did not result in the rescission or outright cancellation of the Concession Agreement.\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the Parent Company received a response letter from the MWSS RO confirming that the twenty-five (25)-year Concession Agreement from 1997 to 2022 and the Memorandum of Agreement and Confirmation between the Parent Company and the MWSS providing for the fifteen (15)-year Extension from 2022 to 2037 have not yet been cancelled.\n\n## Rate Rebasing Tariff Adjustments\n\nIn March 2012, the Parent Company submitted to MWSS a business plan embodying its rate rebasing proposals for charging year 2013.  The rate rebasing activity is done every five (5) years.  MWSS conducted a review of the proposal including the Parent Company's last five (5) years' financial performance.  The financial review process was extended up to the third quarter of 2013.  On September 10, 2013, the MWSS RO issued Resolution No. 13-09-CA providing for a negative rate rebasing adjustment of 29.47% on the Parent Company's 2012 average basic water rate of P=24.57 per cubic meter which shall be implemented in five (5) equal tranches of negative 5.894% per charging year. The Parent Company objected to MWSS' Rate Rebasing determination and formally filed its Dispute Notice on September 24, 2013, before a duly-constituted Appeals Panel, commencing the arbitration process, as provided under Section 12 (in relation to Section 9.4 of the Concession Agreement).\n\nOn December 10, 2013, the MWSS BOT, through MWSS RO Resolution No. 13-012 CA, approved the implementation of a status quo for the Parent Company's Standard Rates, including FCDA, until such time that the Appeals Panel has rendered a final award on the 2013 Rate Rebasing determination.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, the Parent Company received the final award of the Appeals Panel in the arbitration which included the following tariff component determination:\n\n- a. P =28.10 billion Opening Cash Position (OCP) which restored P=11.00 billion from the September 2013 OCP determination of MWSS of P=17.1 billion;\n- b. P =199.60 billion capital expenditures and concession fees which restores P=29.50 billion from the September 2013 future capital and concession fee expenditure of P=170.10 billion;\n- c. 7.61% ADR which was an improvement of 79 bps from the post-tax ADR of 6.82% in September 2013; and\n- d. exclusion of corporate income tax from cash flows beginning January 1, 2013.\n\nConsequently, the final award resulted in a rate rebasing adjustment for the period 2013 to 2017 of negative 11.05% on the 2012 basic average water charge of P=25.07 per cubic meter.  This adjustment translated to a decrease of P=2.77 per cubic meter from the tariff during the intervening years before the 2018 rate rebasing.  Annual CPI adjustments and the quarterly FCDA will continue to be made consistent with the Parent Company's Concession Agreement with MWSS.",

To mitigate the impact on the tariff of its customers, the Parent Company shall stagger its implementation over a five (5)-year period.  The first tranche took effect on October 16, 2018 amounting to P=1.46 per cubic meter or 5.70% of the pre-rebased 2017 basic tariff.  The MWSS BOT also approved the implementation of the subsequent partial Rebasing Convergence Adjustment on a staggered basis as scheduled below:\n\n- \uf0b7 P=2.00 on January 1, 2020,\n- \uf0b7 P=2.00 on January 1, 2021, and\n- \uf0b7 P=0.76 to P=1.04 on January 1, 2022.\n\nOn December 13, 2018, the MWSS BOT (MWSS Resolution No. 2018-190-RO) approved the Parent Company's implementation of the 5.70% CPI Adjustment to be applied to the 2018 average basic charge of P=26.98 per cubic meter and the 2.62% FCDA to be applied to the 2019 average basic charge.  These adjustments are recommended by the MWSS RO (MWSS RO Resolution No. 2018-12-CA) and took effect on January 1, 2019.\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, subject to the validation of the MWSS RO of the feasibility and cost of the Wawa Bulk Water Source to Calawis Project as the Parent Company's medium-term water source, an additional partial Rebasing Convergence Adjustment of up to P=0.28 per cubic meter on top of the basic partial Rebasing Convergence Adjustment of P=0.76 per cubic meter, was approved by the MWSS BOT on September 27, 2018.\n\nThe Parent Company decided to defer the implementation of its previously approved rate rebasing adjustments and inflation adjustments for the charging year 2020 and 2021, in coordination with MWSS RO.\n\nArbitration under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Rules (1976) On April 23, 2015, the Parent Company served to the Republic of the Philippines (the 'Republic'), through the DOF, its Notice of Claim demanding that the Republic indemnify the Parent Company in accordance with the indemnity clauses in the Republic's Letter of Undertaking dated July 31, 1997 and Letter of Undertaking dated October 19, 2009.\n\nThe Parent Company asserted that the Republic interfered with the specific mechanism contained in Article 9.4 (General Rate Setting Policy/Rate Rebasing Determination) of the Concession Agreement thereby causing the impairment of the Parent Company's rate of return.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, the Parent Company received from its legal counsel the Award (the 'Award') rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal (the 'Tribunal') in the arbitration proceedings between the Parent Company and the Republic constituted under the Permanent Court of Arbitration, with proceedings held in Singapore.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled that the Parent Company has a right to indemnification for actual losses suffered by it on account of the Republic's breach of its obligation.  The Tribunal ordered the Republic to indemnify the Parent Company the amount of P=7.39 billion representing the actual losses it suffered from June 1, 2015 to November 22, 2019 and to pay 100% of the amounts paid by the Parent Company to the Permanent Court of Arbitration and 85% of the Parent Company's other claimed costs.\n\nOn December 11, 2019, during the meeting of the Committee on Good Government and Public Accountability and the Committee on Public Accounts of the House of Representatives, the Parent Company's President and Chief Executive Officer made the following pronouncements in deference to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte:\n\n- a. The Parent Company will not collect the P=7.39 billion Award rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration proceedings between the Parent Company and the Republic.\n- b. The Parent Company will defer implementation of the Approved Rate Adjustment effective January 1, 2020 and has signified its intention to establish a suitable arrangement with the MWSS.\n- c. The Parent Company has agreed to and started discussions with the MWSS on the provisions of the Concession Agreement identified for renegotiation and amendment.\n\nAs of the date of authorization for issuance of this report, the Parent Company has yet to formally receive a copy of the proposed revisions to the Concession Agreement.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Parent Company Water Supply Shortage\n\nIn March 2019, the large decline in La Mesa dam water levels caused water service availability in the East Zone to drop significantly, reaching its lowest level at about 68.5 meters in April 2019.  In order to ease the widespread inconvenience of the water supply shortage to the customers who were affected by the unprecedented water shortage, the Parent Company announced a one-time voluntary Bill Waiver Program on March 26, 2019. This program had two parts, namely: (1) all customers will receive a bill waiver of the minimum charge in their consumption which represents ten (10) cubic meters covering water, environmental and sewer charges; and (2) all customers from hard-hit barangays with absolutely no water service for at least seven (7) days from March 6 to March 31, 2019 will not be charged at all for the month of March 2019.  The bill waiver is in the nature of an abatement or reduction from the gross amount or price to be paid by the customers. This was implemented in April 2019 and was treated as sales discount in the customer's billings.\n\nIn April 2019, MWSS BOT (MWSS Resolution No. 2019-055-CO and MWSS Resolution No. 2019-056-CO) imposed a financial penalty of P=534.05 million on the Parent Company for its failure to meet its service obligation to provide 24/7 water supply to its customers (see Note 18).  While the development of new water sources is, under the Concession Agreement, ultimately the responsibility of MWSS, the Parent Company has abided by the decision of MWSS to pay the financial penalty of P=534.05 million even as it assumes no liability on the basis of the penalty as the Parent Company was not the root cause of the water supply shortage.  Pursuant to the directive of the MWSS RO, the P=534.05 million financial penalty was distributed to the East Zone customers through rebates wherein all connections as of March 31, 2019 received a minimum rebate equivalent to their first 10 cubic meters or P=153.93 each while identified severely affected accounts received an additional rebate of P=2,197.94 each.\n\nSupreme Court Decision in Relation to the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004\n\nThis case arose from a complaint filed by the OIC Regional Director Roberto D. Sheen of the Environmental Management Bureau-National Capital Region (EMB-NCR) before the Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) against the Parent Company, Maynilad, and MWSS for alleged violation of Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004 (RA No. 9275, the 'Clean Water Act'), particularly the five (5)-year deadline imposed in Section 8 thereof for connecting the existing sewage line found in all subdivisions, condominiums, commercial centers, hotels, sports and recreational facilities, hospitals, market places, public buildings, industrial complex and other similar establishments including households, to an available sewerage system.  Two (2) similar complaints against Maynilad and MWSS were consolidated with this case.\n\nOn September 18, 2019, the Parent Company received a copy of the Decision of the Supreme Court on the case 'Manila Water Company, Inc. vs. The Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, et.al.' with G.R. No. 206823 and promulgated on August 6, 2019.  In the Decision, the Supreme Court found the Parent Company liable for fines in violation of Section 8 of the Clean Water Act in the following manner:\n\n- a. The Parent Company shall be jointly and severally liable with MWSS for the total amount of P =921.46 million covering the period starting from May 7, 2009 to the date of promulgation of the Decision, August 6, 2019, to be paid within fifteen (15) days from finality of the Decision.\n- b. From finality of the Decision until full payment of the P=921.46 million fine, the Parent Company shall be fined in the initial amount of P=322,102.00 per day, subject to a further 10.00% increase every two (2) years as provided under Section 28 of the Clean Water Act, until full compliance with Section 8 of the same law.\n- c. The total amount of fines imposed by the Decision shall earn legal interest of six percent (6.00%) per annum from finality and until full satisfaction thereof.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, the Parent Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 1, 2020, the Parent Company received a copy of the Consolidated Comment (on the separate Motions for Reconsideration filed by petitioners MWSS, Maynilad Water Services, Inc., and the Parent Company) filed by the Office of the Solicitor General in behalf of the adverse parties.\n\nThe Parent Company filed with the Supreme Court a Motion for Leave to file and admit its Reply last August 17, 2020.",

On May 29, 2020, the MWSS BOT approved a FCDA adjustment for the third quarter of 2020 similar to the prevailing FCDA adjustment for the second quarter of 2020 of P=0.48 per cubic meter which had no impact on customer bills.\n\nLaguna Water's Concession Agreement with the Provincial Government of Laguna (PGL) On April 9, 2002, Laguna Water entered into a concession agreement (as amended on March 31, 2004, July 22, 2009, June 30, 2015, and May 3, 2018) with PGL, a local government unit organized and existing under Philippine Laws.\n\nUnder the terms of the concession agreement, PGL grants Laguna Water (as contractor and as agent for the exercise of certain rights in Laguna) the sole and exclusive right and discretion during the concession period to manage, occupy, operate, repair, maintain, decommission and refurbish the identified facilities required to provide water services to specific areas for an operational period of twenty-five (25) years which commenced on October 20, 2004.\n\nWhile Laguna Water has the right to manage, occupy, operate, repair, maintain, decommission and refurbish specified PGL facilities, legal title to these assets remains with PGL.  Legal title to all assets procured by Laguna Water in the performance of its obligations under the agreement remains with Laguna Water and shall not pass to PGL until the end of the concession period at which time, Laguna Water will transfer, or if the ownership is vested in another person, cause the transfer to PGL.  Laguna Water has the exclusive right to provide water services in the service areas specified in the concession agreement.  Concession fees set forth in the concession agreement are computed as a percentage of revenue from water services (see Note 10).\n\nSeventy percent (70%) of the concession fees are applied against any advances made by Laguna Water to PGL.  The remaining thirty percent (30%) of the concession fees are payable annually thirty (30) days after the submission of the audited financial statements by Laguna Water, starting on the first operational period.\n\nThe concession agreement also states that the base tariff shall be increased by ten percent (10%) in Year 7, 9, 11, 14, and 17 of Laguna Water's concession, which took effect on the commencement date on October 20, 2004.\n\nOn June 30, 2015, Laguna Water and the PGL signed an amendment to the concession agreement which expands the concession area to cover all cities and municipalities in the province of Laguna, as well as the service obligation to include the provision of wastewater services and the establishment of an integrated sewage and septage system in the province.\n\nIn connection with the amendment to the concession agreement on June 30, 2015, the Sangguniang Bayan of the municipality of Calauan, Laguna approved the resolution allowing Laguna Water to provide water and wastewater services to the municipality of Calauan.",

The concession agreement sets forth the rights and obligations of Boracay Water as concessionaire throughout a twenty-five (25)-year concession period.

On January 30, 2015, the Parent Company and ZCWD signed and executed a JVA in relation to the NRW reduction project in Zamboanga City.  On April 10, 2015, the Parent Company and ZCWD incorporated Zamboanga Water to implement the NRW Reduction project.\n\nOn June 2, 2015, Zamboanga Water entered into a NRW Reduction Service Agreement (NRWRSA) with ZCWD.  Under the NRWRSA, ZCWD grants Zamboanga Water the right to implement Network Restructuring and NRW Reduction Programs for ZCWD's water distribution system.\n\nIn March 2019, the City Government of Zamboanga City declared a state of calamity due to the recurrence of El Ni\u00f1o.  This prompted the ZCWD to implement a service-wide water rationing scheme. Consequently, Zamboanga Water was constrained to suspend its NRW Reduction activities due to the unstable supply caused by said water rationing.\n\nIn October 2019, Zamboanga Water and ZCWD jointly formed a Technical Working Group to negotiate and resolve all the pending issues or disputes arising during the implementation of the NRW Reduction Project, such as the impact of the yearly occurrence of El Nino, non-payment of performance and 'locked-in' fees, opposing interpretation of provisions in the NRWRSA, among others.\n\nPer Section 1.10 of the NRWRSA, a rebaseline is to be performed if there is a decrease in supply resulting from El Ni\u00f1o.  Per agreement with ZCWD Project Management Unit (PMU) in November 2017, the computed NRW cu.m./day prior the rebaseline shall be used as basis for the 'locked-in' performance computation.  However, a supplemental agreement to formally recognize the computation and payment of 'locked-in' performance has not been finalized as of December 31, 2019.\n\nOn April 3, 2020, Zamboanga Water received a letter, dated April 1, 2020, from the ZCWD, requesting for the termination of the NRWRSA.  In its letter, ZCWD indicated that the erratic supply of water due to the recurrent dry spell and El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon affecting the District Metered Areas (DMAs) established by Zamboanga Water has rendered the NRWRSA impractical and unworkable, and thus, in the interest of fiscal responsibility and sound management of government funds, ZCWD requested for the termination of the NRWRSA.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, Zamboanga Water approved the termination of the NRWRSA.  Such termination, however, is without prejudice to Zamboanga Water's claims against ZCWD and remedies under the NRWRSA.  The termination of the NRWRSA resulted to the classification of Zamboanga Water as discontinued operations (see Note 3).  The summary of results of operations and cash flows of Zamboanga Water as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented in Note 19.\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Zamboanga Water filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. (PDRCI), which is the arbitral body designated in the NRWRSA.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the arbitration is currently ongoing.\n\nBulk Water Sales and Purchase Agreement between Tagum Water and Tagum Water District (TWD) On July 28, 2015, TWD awarded the Tagum City Bulk Water Supply Project (the 'Tagum Bulk Water Project') to Davao Water, a consortium of the Parent Company and iWater, Inc.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, Davao Water signed and executed a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with TWD.

The summary of results of operations and cash flows of MWTSHealthy Family as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented in Note 19.\n\n## Parent Company's Management, Operation, and Maintenance Contract (MOMC) with the National Water Company (NWC), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nOn December 3, 2020, the Consortium of Saur SAS, Miahona Company, and the Parent Company signed a MOMC with the NWC, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the latter's North West Cluster.  The MOMC will comprise the management, operations, and maintenance of the water and wastewater facilities of the North West Cluster (Madinah and Tabuk) over a seven (7)-year contract period, which will entail the implementation of enabling projects and deployment of key personnel to manage the cluster and achieve the key performance indicators target set by the NWC.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Consortium is currently in the process of registering and incorporating a 'Project Company' to implement the MOMC, as part of the conditions precedent to the project commencement date. The Parent Company, through MWAP as its investment vehicle, will have a 20% equity interest in the Project Company. As part of the MOMC requirement, the Parent Company executed a guarantee in favor of NWC supporting the financial and operational obligations of the Project Company.\n\n## Approval for the Issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe BOD approved and authorized the issuance of the consolidated financial statements on February 24, 2021.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared using the historical cost basis. The Parent Company's presentation and functional currency is the Philippine Peso (P=, Peso, or PHP). Amounts are rounded off to the nearest Peso, except when otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements of the Group provide comparative information in respect of the previous periods.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in compliance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS).\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020.\n\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.  Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:\n\n- a. power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);\n- b. exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- c. the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.\n\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control.",

        "page_content": "When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- a. the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n- b. rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n- c. the Group's voting rights and potential voting rights.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the noncontrolling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.  When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies.  All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.  If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:\n\n- a. derecognizes the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;\n- b. derecognizes the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interests;\n- c. derecognizes the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;\n- d. recognizes the fair value of the consideration received;\n- e. recognizes the fair value of any investment retained;\n- f. recognizes any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and\n- g. reclassifies the parent's share of components previously recognized in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\n## Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial years, except for the PFRS, amended PFRS and improvements to PFRS which were adopted as of January 1, 2020.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the new standards and amendments did not have any material impact to the Group.\n\n- a. Amendments to PFRS 3, Business Combinations - Definition of a Business\n\nThe amendments to PFRS 3 clarify that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output.  Furthermore, it clarifies that a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs.\n\nThese amendments may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations.  The Group did not have any business combinations for the period ended December 31, 2020.\n\n- b. Amendments to PFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, PFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and PAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe amendments to PFRS 9 and PAS 39 provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform.  A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainties about the timing and or amount of benchmarkbased cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.\n\nThe Group does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.",

Amendments to PFRS 16, Leases - Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions\n\nThe amendments provide relief to lessees from applying the PFRS 16 requirement on lease modifications to rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  A lessee may elect not to assess whether a rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification if it meets all of the following criteria:\n\n- \uf0b7 the rent concession is a direct consequence of COVID-19;\n- \uf0b7 the change in lease payments results in a revised lease consideration that is substantially the same as, or less than, the lease consideration immediately preceding the change;\n- \uf0b7 any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021; and\n- \uf0b7 there is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease.\n\nA lessee that applies this practical expedient will account for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19 related rent concession in the same way it would account for a change that is not a lease modification, i.e., as a variable lease payment.\n\nThe amendment, issued on May 28, 2020, is effective June 1, 2020 but, to ensure the relief is available when needed most, lessees can apply the amendment immediately in any financial statements - interim or annual - not yet authorized for issue.\n\nThe Group adopted the amendment on its effective date.  As of December 31, 2020, the Group has not received any rent concessions (see Note 11).  The Group will continue to monitor future rent concessions that will fall within the scope of this amendment and assess its impact on the Group's financial position and operations, when applicable.\n\n- d. Amendments to PAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, and PAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors - Definition of Material\n\nThe amendments provide a new definition of material that states 'information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.'\n\nThe amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements.  A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users.\n\n- e. Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued on March 29, 2018\n\nThe Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and none of the concepts contained therein override the concepts or requirements in any standard.  The purpose of the Conceptual Framework is to assist the International Accounting Standards Board in developing standards, to help preparers develop consistent accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place and to assist all parties to understand and interpret the standards.\n\nThe revised Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts, provides updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts.\n\n## Future Changes in Accounting Policies\n\nPronouncements issued but not yet effective are listed below.  The Group intends to adopt the following pronouncements when they become effective.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the Group does not expect that the future adoption of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.",

Amendments to PFRS 3, Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n\nThe amendments are intended to replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements.  The amendments added an exception to the recognition principle of PFRS 3, Business Combinations, to avoid the issue of potential 'day 2' gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of PAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, or Philippine IFRIC 21, Levies, if incurred separately.\n\nAt the same time, the amendments add a new paragraph to PFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date.\n\n- b. Amendments to PAS 16, Property,Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use\n\nThe amendments prohibit entities from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss.\n\nThe amendment must be applied retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented when the Group first applies the amendment.\n\n- c. Amendments to PAS 37, Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'.  The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.\n\nThe amendments must be applied to contracts for which the Group has not yet fulfilled all its obligations at the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments.",

Annual Improvements to PFRSs 2018-2020 Cycle\n- \uf0b7 Amendment to PFRS 1, First-time Adoption of Philippine Financial Reporting Standards Subsidiary as a First-Time Adopter\n\nThe amendment permits a subsidiary that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of PFRS 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent, based on the parent's date of transition to PFRS.  This amendment is also applied to an associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of PFRS 1.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PFRS 9, Fees in the '10 per cent' Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\n\nThe amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability.  These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf.  An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment.\n\nThe Group will apply the amendments to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment.\n\n- \uf0b7 Amendments to PAS 41, Agriculture - Taxation in Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe amendment removes the requirement in paragraph 22 of PAS 41 that entities exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of assets within the scope of PAS 41.\n\nEffective beginning on or after January 1, 2023\n\n- a. Amendments to PAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nThe amendments clarify paragraphs 69 to 76 of PAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current.  The amendments clarify:\n\n- \uf0b7 what is meant by a right to defer settlement;\n- \uf0b7 that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period;\n- \uf0b7 that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right; and\n- \uf0b7 that only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification.\n\n## b. PFRS 17, Insurance Contracts\n\nPFRS 17 is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure.  Once effective, PFRS 17 will replace PFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.  This new standard on insurance contracts applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features.  A few scope exceptions will apply.\n\nThe overall objective of PFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers.  In contrast to the requirements in PFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting policies, PFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting aspects.  The core of PFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:\n\n- \uf0b7 a specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach); and\n- \uf0b7 a simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts.",

Amendments to PFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, and PAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n\nThe amendments address the conflict between PFRS 10 and PAS 28 in dealing with the loss of control of a subsidiary that is sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture.  The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transfer to an associate or joint venture involves a business as defined in PFRS 3.  Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognized only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associate or joint venture.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, the Financial Reporting Standards Council postponed the original effective date of January 1, 2016 of the said amendments until the International Accounting Standards Board has completed its broader review of the research project on equity accounting that may result in the simplification of accounting for such transactions and of other aspects of accounting for associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Current versus Noncurrent Classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position based on a current and noncurrent classification.  An asset is current when it is:\n\n- a. expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\n- b. held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- c. expected to be realized within twelve (12) months after the reporting period; or\n- d. cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve (12) months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as noncurrent.\n\n## A liability is current when:\n\n- a. it is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;\n- b. it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- c. it is due to be settled within twelve (12) months after the reporting period, or\n- d. there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve (12) months after the reporting period.\n\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as noncurrent.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nFair value is the estimated price that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- a. in the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- b. in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value as a whole:\n\n- a. Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- b. Level 2: valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n- c. Level 3: valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Group's management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurement.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash includes cash on hand and in banks.  Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nThese are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of more than three months from the date of acquisition and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments\n\n## Financial assets\n\n- a. Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as either subsequently measured at amortized cost, at FVOCI, or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them.  With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs.  Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under PFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nIn order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest' on the principal amount outstanding.  This assessment is referred to as the 'solely payments of principal and interest test' and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows.  The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.",

Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \uf0b7 the asset is held within the Group's business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \uf0b7 the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment.  Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized, modified or impaired.\n\nThe Group classified cash in banks and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, contract assets, and deposits as financial assets at amortized cost (see Notes 5, 6, and 10).\n\n## c. Derecognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of financial assets) is derecognized when:\n\n- \uf0b7 the right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (i) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.  When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.  In that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability.  The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.\n\nContinuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.\n\n## Modification of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new asset, with the difference between its carrying amount and the fair value of the new asset recognized as  a derecognition gain or loss in profit or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.\n\nThe Group considers both qualitative and quantitative factors in assessing whether a modification of financial asset is substantial or not.  When assessing whether a modification is substantial, the Group considers the following factors, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 Change in currency\n- \uf0b7 Introduction of an equity feature\n- \uf0b7 Change in counterparty\n- \uf0b7 If the modification results in the asset no longer considered 'solely payment for principal and interest'\n\nThe Group also performs a quantitative assessment similar to that being performed for modification of financial liabilities.  In performing the quantitative assessment, the Group considers the new terms of a financial asset to be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial asset.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWhen the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial asset, the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR) (or creditadjusted EIR for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets) and recognizes a modification gain or loss in the statement of income.\n\nWhen the modification of a financial asset results in the derecognition of the existing financial asset and the subsequent recognition of a new financial asset, the modified asset is considered a 'new ' financial asset.  Accordingly, the date of the modification shall be treated as the date of initial recognition of that financial asset when applying the impairment requirements to the modified financial asset.  The newly recognized financial asset is classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless the new financial asset is deemed to be originated as credit impaired (POCI).\n\n## d. Impairment\n\nThe Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) for all debt instruments not held at FVTPL.  ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original EIR.  The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\n\nECLs are recognized in two stages.  For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next twelve months (a 12-month ECL).  For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).  ECL's are recognized in two stages.  For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL's are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next twelve months (a 12-month ECL).\n\nFor receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.  The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are ninety (90) up to one hundred eighty (180) days past their due dates.  However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group.  A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## a. Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, either as financial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group's financial liabilities comprise of financial liabilities at amortized cost.\n\n## b. Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter initial recognition, long-term debt and service concession obligations are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method.\n\nGains and losses are recognized under the 'Other income (expense)' account in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognized or impaired, and through the 'Interest expense' account when the gains and losses are amortized.  Amortized cost is",

Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or canceled or has expired.  When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the Group's statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Exchange or modification of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group considers both qualitative and quantitative factors in assessing whether a modification of financial liabilities is substantial or not.  The terms are considered substantially different if the present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original EIR, is at least 10% different from the present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.  However, under certain circumstances, modification or exchange of a financial liability may still be considered substantial, even where the present value of the cash flows under the new terms is less than 10% different from the present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.  There may be situations where the modification of the financial liability is so fundamental that immediate derecognition of the original financial liability is appropriate (e.g., restructuring a financial liability to include an embedded equity component).\n\nWhen an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.  The difference between the carrying value of the original financial liability and the fair value of the new liability is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the exchange or modification of the existing financial liability is not considered as substantial, the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial liability as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original EIR and recognizes a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.\n\nIf modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment.  If the modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the financial instrument and are amortized over the remaining term of the modified financial instrument.\n\n## Offsetting Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statements of financial position, if and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group assesses that it has a currently enforceable right of offset if the right is not contingent on a future event and is legally enforceable in the normal course of business, event of default, and event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and all of the counterparties.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). NRV is the estimated selling price less estimated costs to complete and to sell.  The cost is determined using the moving average method for all inventories, except for raw materials and finished goods.  The cost of raw materials and finished goods are determined based on the periodic weighted average method.\n\nThe cost of raw materials includes all costs directly attributable to their acquisition.\n\nFinished goods include the cost of raw materials, direct labor, and a proportion of manufacturing overhead.",

These typically include prepayments for regulatory costs, business taxes, insurance and employee health care expenses, and other benefits.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, except land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and any impairment in value. Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value.\n\nThe initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties, taxes and any directly attributable costs of bringing the property, plant and equipment to its working condition and location for its intended use, including capitalized borrowing costs incurred during the construction period.  Expenditures incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are normally charged to operations in the period in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditures have resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of property, plant and equipment beyond its originally assessed standard of performance, the expenditures are capitalized as additional cost of the related property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment commences once the property, plant and equipment are available for use and are calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (EUL) of the property, plant and equipment as follows:\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\n5 years or lease term, whichever is shorter\n\nPlant and technical equipment\n\n5 years or the term of the related management contract, whichever is shorter 3 to 5 years\n\nOffice furniture and equipment Transportation equipment\n\n5 years\n\nThe EUL and depreciation and amortization method are reviewed periodically to ensure that the period and method of depreciation and amortization are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property, plant and equipment.\n\nConstruction in progress represents property, plant and equipment under construction and is stated at cost including costs of construction and other direct costs.  Construction in progress is not depreciated until such time that the relevant assets are in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.\n\nWhen property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization and accumulated impairment, if any, are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited to or charged against current operations.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost including any directly attributable costs with the development of the software that are expected to generate future expected benefits.  All other costs of developing and maintaining software are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nFollowing initial recognition, software are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.  Software are assessed to have finite useful lives of three (3) to five (5) years.\n\n## Service Concession Assets and Obligations\n\nThe Group accounts for its concession agreements with MWSS, PGL, TIEZA, CDC, OWD, CWD, and BuWD; JVAs with PAGWAD, TnWD, LWD, and CCWD; and SMA with CIWD under the Intangible Asset model as it receives the right (license) to charge users of public service.  Under the Group's concession arrangements, the Group is granted the sole and exclusive right and discretion during the concession period to manage, occupy, operate, repair, maintain, decommission and refurbish the identified facilities required to provide water services.  The legal title to these assets shall transfer to MWSS, PGL, TIEZA, CDC, OWD, CWD, BuWD, PAGWAD, TnWD, LWD, CCWD, and CIWD (under the SMA) at the end of the concession period.",

Under the service concession arrangements, Cebu Water, Tagum Water, and Ilagan Water are awarded the right to deliver bulk water supply to the grantor for a specific period of time under the concession period.\n\nDuring the construction phase of the arrangements, the Group's contract asset (representing its accumulating right to be paid for rehabilitation works) is presented as part of 'Service concession assets' (SCA) for Intangible Asset model and under 'Contract Assets' for Financial Asset model.  The SCA also include the present value of the service concession obligations assumed by the Parent Company at drawdown date and other local component costs and cost overruns paid by the Group, as well as additional costs of rehabilitation works incurred.\n\nAmortization of SCA commences when the SCA are available for use and are calculated on a straightline basis over the remaining concession period.  Beginning May 1, 2017, the Parent Company, Boracay Water, Clark Water, and Laguna Water's water and used water assets are amortized using the units-ofproduction (UOP) method over the estimated total billable volume for the remaining period of the respective concession agreements to better reflect the usage of these assets, which is directly related to its estimated total billable volume and is aligned with industry practice.\n\n## Investments in Associates\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over these policies.\n\nThe considerations made in determining significant influence is similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost.  The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.  Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.\n\nThe consolidated statement of comprehensive income reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate.  Any change in the other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Group's other comprehensive income.  In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.  Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.\n\nThe aggregate of the Group's share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income outside of operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and noncontrolling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.  If the Group's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.\n\nThe financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in its associate.  At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.  If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and then recognizes the loss as 'Other income (loss)' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.",

Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Business Combinations and Goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.  The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.  For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.  This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss included under 'Remeasurement gain (loss) arising from business combination.'\n\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.  Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.  Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of PFRS 9, is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with PFRS 9.  Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of PFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the acquirer shall account for the combination using those provisional values.  The acquirer shall recognize any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve (12) months of the acquisition date as follows: (i) the carrying amount of the identifiable asset, liability or contingent liability that is recognized or adjusted as a result of completing the initial accounting shall be calculated as if its fair value at the acquisition date had been recognized from that date; (ii) goodwill or any gain recognized shall be adjusted by an amount equal to the adjustment to the fair value at the acquisition date of the identifiable asset, liability or contingent liability being recognized or adjusted; and (iii) comparative information presented for the periods before the initial accounting for the combination is complete shall be presented as if the initial accounting has been completed from the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost where cost is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for noncontrolling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date.  If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in profit or loss and included under 'other income (expenses).'\n\nFollowing initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.  For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units.  Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated should:\n\n- \uf0b7 represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and",

The acquirer shall then review the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date for all of the following:\n\n- a. the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed;\n- b. the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, if any;\n- c. for a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and\n- d. the consideration transferred.\n\nIf that excess remains after applying the requirements above, the acquirer shall recognize the resulting gain in profit or loss on the acquisition date.  The gain shall be attributed to the acquirer.\n\nWhere goodwill forms part of a CGU (or group of CGUs) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.  Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.\n\n## Water Rights\n\nWater rights are accounted for as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life.  These pertain to the permit acquired separately, and are recognized as an intangible asset as these were issued by the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) without an explicit provision on the period of effectivity. Costs incurred for the acquisition of water rights are capitalized and measured on initial recognition at cost.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 1067, also known as the Water Code, states that water permits shall continue to be valid as long as water is beneficially used.  The rights may be suspended or revoked based on certain grounds such as non-compliance with approved plans and specifications or schedules of water distribution, and use of water for a purpose other than that for which it was granted.\n\nAll water permits are subject to modification or cancellation by the NWRB, after due notice and hearing, in favor of a project of greater beneficial use or for multi-purpose development, and a water permittee who suffers thereby shall be duly compensated by the entity or person in whose favor the cancellation was made.\n\n## Impairment of Nonfinancial Assets\n\nThis accounting policy applies primarily to the Group's property, plant, and equipment, software, SCA, contract assets representing SCA under construction, right-of-use assets, investments in associates, goodwill, and water rights.  The Group assesses, at each reporting date, these nonfinancial assets, excluding goodwill and water rights, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.  If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\n\nWater rights with indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the CGU level.  Such intangibles are not amortized.  The life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable.  If not, the change in the life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.",

When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.  If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other fair value indicators.  Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.\n\nA previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.  If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.  That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.  Such reversal is recognized in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as revaluation increase.  After such a reversal, the depreciation and amortization charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\n## Leases (Upon Adoption of PFRS 16, Effective January 1, 2019)\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.  That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## The Group as a Lessee\n\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.  The Group recognizes lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\n\n## a. Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use).  Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.  The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.  Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.\n\n## b. Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.  The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate.  Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.",

        "page_content": "In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.  After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.  In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## c. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of office spaces (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option).  It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value.  Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Leases (Prior to Upon Adoption of PFRS 16)\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\n\nA reassessment is made after the inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:\n\n- a. there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal of or extension of the arrangement;\n- b. a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term;\n- c. there is a change in the determination of whether fulfillment is dependent on a specified asset; or\n- d. there is a substantial change to the asset.\n\nWhere reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b).\n\nA lease where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset is classified as an operating lease.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.  The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized.\n\nRevenue recognized over time using the output method\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue from water and sewerage services, environmental charge, operation and maintenance services and performance fees over time using output method.  As a practical expedient allowed under PFRS 15, the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice since the Group bills a fixed amount for every cubic meter of water delivered or NRW recovered.\n\n- \uf0b7 Water and used water revenue\n\nWater and used water revenue are recognized over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefit from the performance of the related water and sewerage services.  Water and used water are billed every month according to the bill cycles of the customers.  As a result of bill cycle cut-off, monthly service revenue earned but not yet billed at end of the month are estimated and accrued.  These estimates are based on historical consumption of the customers.  Also, twenty percent (20%) of water revenue is recognized by the Parent Company as environmental charge.",

Revenue from supervision fees is recognized over time using an output method.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2020, revenue from supervision fees of MWPVI, Aqua Centro, EcoWater, and Laguna Water is accounted for as connection fees.  With the new information gathered from operating greenfield projects and changes in circumstances, the allocation of the transaction price between connection fees and future water services was reassessed.  As a result, the supervision fees are allocated between connection fees and future water services (as consideration for water affordability or lower water tariff) based on the relative stand-alone selling price method for contracts and projects initiated starting January 1, 2020.  The stand-alone selling price of connection fee is estimated based on adjusted market assessment approach while the stand-alone selling price allocated to future water services is estimated considering actual and projected water tariffs.  The change in estimate is accounted prospectively and supervision fees pertaining to existing projects as of December 31, 2019 will continue to be accounted for entirely as connection fee.\n\nRevenue from supervision fees is recognized over time using the output method.  Supervision fees accounted for as connection fees is recognized and measured using a survey of performance completed to date and milestones reached.  Supervision fees accounted for as future water service is recognized as the customer receives and consumes the benefit of water affordability or lower water tariff based on the agreed estimated water demand projections.\n\n## \uf0b7 Revenue from pipeworks and integrated used water services\n\nRevenue from pipeworks and integrated used water services is recognized over time as the water and wastewater network related services are rendered using an output method.  Under this method, progress is measured using survey of performance completed to date and milestone reached.  This is based on the work accomplishment report prepared by the project contractor as approved by the project management head.\n\nRevenue recognized over time using input method\n\nThe Group determined that the input method is the appropriate method in measuring progress of the rehabilitation works, construction revenue, and service fees because there is a direct relationship between the Group's effort (i.e., actual cost incurred incurred) and the transfer of service to the customer.\n\n## \uf0b7\n\n- Revenue from rehabilitation works and Cost of rehabilitation works Revenue from rehabilitation works is equivalent to the related cost for the rehabilitation works covered by the service concession arrangements which is recognized as part of contract assets included under SCA or concession financial receivables and pertain to revenue from construction or",

Revenue from construction services is recognized over time, using input method.  Under this method, progress is measured based on actual costs incurred on materials, labor, and overhead relative to the total project costs.\n\n## \uf0b7 Service fees\n\nService fees for technical assistance extended to ZCWD are recognized over time, using input method, when the related services have been rendered to the ZCWD.  Under this method, progress is measured based on actual costs incurred on manpower and overhead relative to the total project costs.\n\n## Revenue recognized at a point in time\n\n## \uf0b7 Distributors' fee\n\nDistributors' fee is recognized as revenue at a point in time when control of the trade assets has been transferred to the distributor, generally upon delivery of the related assets.\n\n## \uf0b7 Revenue from packaged water\n\nRevenue from packaged water and other water related products is recognized at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the distributor, generally upon receipt of the related product, to the customer.\n\n## \uf0b7 Other operating income\n\nOther customer related fees such as reconnection and disconnection fees, income from customers late payments, income from septic sludge disposal, and income from bacteriological water analysis are recognized at a point in time when the control over these good or services have been transferred to the customer.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\n## Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due).\n\n## Contract assets\n\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer.  If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.  If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to a customer, a contract liability is recognized when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).  Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest income is recognized as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield of the assets.\n\nFor all financial instruments measured at amortized cost, interest income is recorded using the EIR.  EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability.

These are recognized:\n\n- \uf0b7 on the basis of a direct association between the costs incurred and the earning of specific items of income;\n- \uf0b7 on the basis of systematic and rational allocation procedures when economic benefits are expected to arise over several accounting periods and the association can only be broadly or indirectly determined; or,\n- \uf0b7 immediately when expenditure produces no future economic benefits or when, and to the extent that, future economic benefits do not qualify or cease to qualify, for recognition in the consolidated statement of financial position as an asset.\n\nCost of services and operating expenses are measured at the amount paid or payable.\n\n## Foreign Currency-Denominated Transactions\n\nForeign exchange differentials arising from foreign currency transactions of the Parent Company's loans and concession fees are credited to or charged against operations.  For the Parent Company, as approved by the MWSS BOT under Amendment No.1 of the Concession Agreement, the following will be recovered or refunded through billings to customers:\n\n- a. restatement of foreign currency-denominated loans;\n- b. difference of actual and twelve (12)-month projected concession fee payments against the amounts of concession fees translated using the base exchange rate assumed in the business plan approved every rate rebasing exercise.  The current base exchange rates are P=53.16:US$1.00, P=0.475: Y1.00, P =62.156: \u20ac1.00 based on the latest rate rebasing exercise effective January 1, 2018;\n- c. difference of actual and twelve (12)-month projected interest payments translated using the exchange spot rate on settlement date and average forex of the month immediately preceding the cut-off information date, respectively, against the amount of interest translated at drawdown rate; and\n- d. difference of actual and twelve (12)-month projected payments of other financing charges relating to foreign currency-denominated loans translated at exchange spot rate on settlement date and average forex of the month immediately preceding the cut-off information date, against the amount of other financing charges translated at drawdown rate.\n\nFor Boracay Water, its concession agreement with TIEZA allows for the recovery of the following from its customers:\n\n- a. restatement of foreign currency-denominated loans;\n- b. excess of actual interest payments translated at exchange spot rates on settlement dates over the amounts of interest translated at agreed base rate; and\n- c. excess of actual payments of other financing charges relating to foreign currency-denominated loans translated at exchange spot rates on settlement dates over the amount of other financing charges translated at agreed base rate.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Parent Company and its Philippine subsidiaries is the Philippine Peso.  Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the separate financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group's entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.  All differences are taken to profit or loss, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity.  These are recognized in OCI until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognized in profit or loss.  Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.  Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.",

Other water revenue-FCDA is credited (debited) upon recovery (refund) of realized foreign exchange losses (gains).  The write-off or reversal of the deferred FCDA pertaining to concession fees will be made upon determination of the rebased foreign exchange rate, which is assumed in the business plan approved by the MWSS RO during the latest Rate Rebasing exercise, unless indication of impairment of the deferred FCDA would be evident at an earlier date.\n\nThe functional currency of MWAP, MWSAH, TDWH, KDWH, MSEA, and MWTH is the United States Dollar (US$ or USD), while Asia Water, Thu Duc Water, Kenh Dong Water, Saigon Water and Cu Chi Water's functional currency is the Vietnamese Dong (VND), PTMWI and PTSTU's is the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), and MWTC and East Water's is the Thailand Baht (THB).  As of reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries and associates are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange at the reporting date and their profit and loss accounts are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.  The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognized in OCI and reported as 'Cumulative translation adjustment', a separate component of equity.  On disposal of a foreign entity, the 'Cumulative translation adjustment' relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Borrowing Costs\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, development, improvement and construction of fixed assets (including costs incurred in connection with rehabilitation works) that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are recorded as property, plant and equipment or SCA, as applicable.  All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\nThe interest capitalized is calculated using the Group's weighted average cost of borrowings after adjusting for borrowing associated with specific developments.  Where borrowings are associated with specific developments, the amounts capitalized is the gross interest incurred on those borrowings less any investment income arising on their temporary investment.\n\nThe capitalization of those borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.  Capitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all activities necessary in preparing the related assets for their intended use are complete.  Borrowing costs include interest charges and other related financing charges incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds.  Premiums and/or discounts on long-term debt are included in the 'Short-term and Long-term debt' account in the consolidated statement of financial position and are amortized using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized when the Group has: (a) a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; (b) it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.  Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as an interest expense.  Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is not recognized as a separate asset and only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.  Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  These are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.  Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plan\n\nThe net defined benefit liability or asset is the aggregate of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period reduced by the fair value of plan assets (if any).",

Past service costs are recognized when plan amendment or curtailment occurs.  These amounts are calculated periodically by independent qualified actuaries.\n\nNet interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability or asset that arises from the passage of time which is determined by applying the discount rate based on government bonds to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\n\nNet interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as expense or income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nRemeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses and return on plan assets (excluding net interest on defined benefit liability or asset) are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.  Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\n\nPlan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies.  Plan assets are not available to the creditors of the Group, nor can they be paid directly to the Group.  The fair value of plan assets is based on market price information.  When no market price is available, the fair value of plan assets is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects both the risk associated with the plan assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets (or, if they have no maturity, the expected period until the settlement of the related obligations).  If the fair value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the measurement of the resulting defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe Group's right to be reimbursed of some or all of the expenditure required to settle a defined benefit obligation is recognized as a separate asset at fair value when and only when reimbursement is virtually certain.\n\n## Termination Benefit\n\nTermination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee's employment as a result of either an entity's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date or an employee's decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment.\n\nA liability and expense for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the entity recognizes related restructuring costs. Initial recognition and subsequent changes to termination benefits are measured in accordance with the nature of the employee benefit, as either post-employment benefits, short-term employee benefits, or other long-term employee benefits.\n\n## Short-term Employee Benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits include items such as salaries and wages, social security contributions, and nonmonetary benefits, if expected to be settled wholly within twelve (12) months after the end of the reporting period in which the employees rendered the related services.  Short-term employee benefits are recognized as expense as incurred.  When an employee has rendered service to the Group during the reporting period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any amount already paid.",

The undiscounted liability for employee leaves is recognized for services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Share-Based Payment\n\n## Employee share purchase plan\n\nThe Parent Company has an employee stock ownership plan (ESOWN) which allows the grantees to purchase the Parent Company's shares at a discounted price.  The Parent Company recognizes stock compensation expense over the holding period.  The Parent Company treats its ESOWN plan as option exercisable within a given period.  These are accounted for similar to the PFRS 2, Share-based Payment, options.  Dividends paid on the awards that have vested are deducted from equity and those paid on awards that are unvested are charged to profit or loss.  For the unsubscribed shares where the employees still have the option to subscribe in the future, these are accounted for as 'Common stock options outstanding' in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Equity\n\nCapital stock is measured at par value for all shares subscribed, issued and outstanding.  When the Group issues more than one class of stock, a separate account is maintained for each class of stock and the number of shares issued.\n\nWhen the shares are sold at premium, the difference between the proceeds at the par value is credited to 'Additional paid-in capital' account.  Direct costs incurred related to equity issuance are chargeable to 'Additional paid-in capital' account.  If additional paid-in capital is not sufficient, the excess is charged against retained earnings.  When the Group issues more than one class of stock, a separate account is maintained for each class of stock and the number of shares issued.\n\nSubscriptions receivable pertains to the uncollected portion of the subscribed shares.\n\nRetained earnings represent accumulated earnings of the Group.  Appropriated retained earnings are set aside for future business expansions.  The Parent Company's BOD declares dividends from the unappropriated portion of its retained earnings.\n\nOther equity reserves pertain to gain from sale of investments in a subsidiary by the Parent Company that did not result to a loss of control.\n\n## Taxes\n\n## Value Added Tax (VAT)\n\nInput VAT pertains to the 12% indirect tax paid by the Group in the course of the Group's trade or business on local purchase of goods or services.  Deferred input VAT pertains to input VAT on accumulated purchases of property, plant and equipment and service concession assets for each month amounting to P=1.00 million or more.  This is amortized over five (5) years or the life of the property, plant and equipment or service concession assets, whichever is shorter, in accordance with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) regulation.\n\nOutput VAT pertains to the 12% tax due on the local sale of goods and services by the Group.\n\nIf at the end of any taxable month, the output VAT exceeds the input VAT, the outstanding balance is included under 'Trade payables' in the 'Accounts and other payables' account.  If the input VAT exceeds the output VAT, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding months and included under the 'Other current assets' account.\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.  The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, for all temporary differences, with certain exceptions, between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.",

The participating preferred shares participate in the earnings at a rate of 1/10 of the dividends paid to a common share.\n\nDiluted EPS is computed by dividing earnings attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, after giving retroactive effect of any stock dividends, if any, during the period and adjusted for the effect of dilutive options.  Outstanding stock options will have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the underlying common share during the period exceeds the exercise price of the option.  Where the effects of the assumed exercise of all outstanding options have anti-dilutive effect, basic and diluted EPS are stated at the same amount.\n\n## Assets Held in Trust\n\nAssets which are owned by MWSS, PGL, TIEZA, CDC, OWD, CWD, PAGWAD, TnWD, BuWD, LWD, and CCWD that are operated by the Group under the Group's concession agreements are not reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position but are considered as 'Assets held in trust' (see Note 25).\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe Group aggregates two or more operating segments into a single operating segment when separately, each operating segment has similar economic characteristics and service area.  The Group aggregated its local and foreign subsidiaries into the Domestic Subsidiaries segment and Foreign Subsidiaries segment, even if the subsidiaries cater to different customers, since management has assessed that these entities have similar economic characteristics and service area.  The Group considers the Manila Concession and Head Office, Domestic Subsidiaries, and Foreign Subsidiaries as its operating segments that are aggregated based on the geographical location and source of revenues.

Any event after the reporting date that is not an adjusting event is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements when material.\n\n## 3. Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with PFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.  The estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements are based upon management's evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.  Actual results could differ from such estimates.\n\nManagement believes the following represent a summary of these significant estimates and judgments:\n\n## Judgments\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Service concession arrangements\n\nIn applying Philippine Interpretation IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements, the Group has made a judgment that its concession agreements with MWSS, PGL, TIEZA, CDC, OWD, CWD, and BuWD; JVAs with PAGWAD, TnWD, LWD, and CCWD; and SMA with CIWD qualify under the Intangible Asset model as it receives the right (license) to charge users of public service (see Notes 2 and 10).",

The Group considers several factors including its representation in East Water's BOD, representation in East Water's Investment Committee, and its voting power through share ownership to determine the Group's power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of East Water.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group owns 18.72% of East Water (see Note 12).\n\n## Revenue recognized using the input and output method\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue from rehabilitation works, construction revenue, and service fees using the input method while it recognizes supervision fees, and revenue from pipeworks, and revenue from integrated used water services using the output method.  The input or output method of recognizing revenue over the period covered by the separate contracts with customers requires the Group to base the level of transfer of control over these services based on the Group's review and concurrence with work accomplishment reports prepared by project managers or submitted by independent project contractors.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\nThe Group aggregates two or more operating segments into a single operating segment when separately, each operating segment has similar economic characteristics and service area.  The Group aggregated its local and foreign subsidiaries into the Domestic Subsidiaries segment and Foreign Subsidiaries segment even if it caters to different customers since management assessed that these entities have similar economic characteristics and service area.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group considers the Manila Concession and Head Office, Domestic Subsidiaries, and Foreign Subsidiaries as its operating segments that are aggregated based on the geographical location and source of revenues (see Note 26).\n\nDetermination of lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options - the Group as a lessee The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options.  The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease.  That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.  After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., construction of significant leasehold improvements or significant customization to the leased asset) (see Note 11).\n\n## Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe Group is currently involved in various legal proceedings and exposures in the ordinary conduct of business.  The estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims has been developed in consultation with internal and external counsels handling the defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results (see Note 30).\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the operations of Zamboanga Water qualify as discontinued operations because the termination of the NRWRSA indicates that Zamboanga Water, a joint venture company incorporated solely for the execution of the NRWRSA, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, ceases to operate including its noncurrent assets which are to be closed rather than sold or distributed to owners.'\n\nMeanwhile, MWTS' Healthy Family division also qualifies as discontinued operations following the segment's permanent closure effective October 31, 2020 due to recurring losses and inability to financially sustain business operations.\n\nAs a result of the preceding circumstances, results of operations presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the corresponding consolidated notes to the financial statements in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were restated to exclude from continuing operations the discontinued operations of Zamboanga Water and MWTS Healthy Family  (see Note 19).",

        "page_content": "## Use of Estimates\n\nKey assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below.  Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## Revenue and cost recognition - rehabilitation works\n\nThe Group measures revenue from rehabilitation works at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.  The Group's revenue from rehabilitation works are recognized over time, using the input method. Under this method, progress is measured by reference to the actual costs incurred to date. Revenue from rehabilitation works recognized by the Group is equivalent to the costs of rehabilitation works incurred as these costs are recovered by the Group through its right to charge the customers. The Group's revenue from and cost of rehabilitation works amounted to P=10,976.17 million,\n\nP=10,852.91 million, and P=9,661.98 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively (see Notes 6 and 10).\n\n## Provision for ECLs of receivables from customers\n\nThe Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for receivables.  The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.\n\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates.  The Group calibrates the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.  For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., inflation) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increase in prices of basic goods and services, the historical default rates are adjusted.  At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analyzed.\n\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions, and ECLs, which have been adjusted to consider a range of possible outcomes, is a significant estimate.  The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions.  The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.\n\nIn compliance with the mandate of MWSS and in line with the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the Parent Company suspended disconnection activities; extended payment terms for specific billing periods covered by the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) or modified ECQ (MECQ) during the year; and provided installment payment schemes to customers, as necessary, without incurring interests, penalties and other charges.  These factors were incorporated in the Group's determination of historical observed default rates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, allowance for expected credit losses of receivables from customers amounted to P=1,749.07 million and P=1,300.64 million, respectively (see Note 6).\n\n## Estimating the period over which control over services is transferred to the customer\n\nFor each group of similar customer contracts that result in revenues recognized over a period of the time, the Group makes an estimate of such period over which the Group transfers the control of the services provided to the customer.  For revenue from rehabilitation works, construction revenue, service fees, supervision fees, and revenue from pipeworks and integrated used water services, the Group has determined that the period of revenue recognition is the term of the customer contract.  For connection fees revenue, the Group has estimated that the customer receives control over the remaining concession period or remaining customer contract term.\n\n## Estimating useful lives of water rights\n\nMW Consortium and MWPVI estimate that the useful lives of the water rights to be indefinite, considering that the water permits remain valid for as long as water is beneficially used.  It is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in MW Consortium and MWPVI's estimates.  The amounts and timing of recording of expenses for any period would be affected by changes in these factors and circumstances (see Note 13).",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Impairment of nonfinancial assets\n\nThe Group assesses the impairment of nonfinancial assets (property, plant and equipment, SCA, contract assets representing SCA under construction, right-of-use assets, investments in associates, water rights, and deposits under other current and noncurrent assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  The factors that the Group considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n- \uf0b7 significant changes in the manner of usage of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Group's overall business;\n- \uf0b7 significant negative industry or economic trends;\n- \uf0b7 significant decline in net worth or market capitalization; and\n- \uf0b7 significant decline in distributed profits or increase in losses.\n\nAs described in the accounting policy, the Group estimates the recoverable amount as the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use.\n\nIn determining the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the assets, the Group is required to make estimates and assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits.\n\nIn 2018, MWTS closed three (3) water bottling plants.  As a result, the Group recognized impairment loss on its property, plant and equipment amounting to P=71.43 million, representing the write-down of leasehold improvements and water treatment equipment to its recoverable amounts as of December 31, 2018 (see Note 9).  This is presented as part of 'Other income (loss)' in the MWTS' Healthy Family profit or loss (see Note 19).\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Group recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Saigon Water amounting to P=3.97 million, P=74.33 million, and P=65.41 million, respectively, due to the decline in market capitalization.  On March 31, 2020, MWSAH recognized an impairment on its investment in Cu Chi Water amounting to P=336.67 million due to the current and prospective financial performance and condition of Cu Chi Water (see Note 12). These are presented as part of 'Other income (loss)' in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (see Note 18).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Group has determined that there are no indicators of impairment on its investments in Thu Duc Water, Kenh Dong Water, East Water, and PT STU (see Note 12).  As of December 31, 2019, the Group has determined that there are no indicators of impairment on its investments in Thu Duc Water, Kenh Dong Water, Cu Chi Water, East Water, and PT STU (see Note 12).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Parent Company's market capitalization significantly declined compared to its net book value, which decline was triggered by, among others, the ongoing discussion with MWSS on the provisions of the Concession Agreement identified for renegotiation and amendment (see Note 1).  Management has determined that, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recoverable amount of the Parent Company's nonfinancial assets is higher than its net book value.  Therefore, the Group did not recognize any impairment loss on the Parent Company's nonfinancial assets particularly its property and equipment and SCA amounting to P=1,078.20 million and P=89,128.06 million in 2020 and P=925.11 million and P=81,052.26 million in 2019, respectively.  The recoverable amount was determined by an external appraiser by considering the fair value of property and equipment and SCA's current highest and best use, taking into consideration recent sales, offering prices or listing of comparable properties registered within the vicinity of the subject assets and cost to build similar assets, adjustments to sales prices based on internal and external factors including impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and deductions for physical deterioration and all other relevant forms of obsolescence.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no indicators of impairment on the Group subsidiaries' property plant and equipment and SCA, right-of-use assets, water rights, and deposits under other current assets and other noncurrent assets (see Notes 9, 10, 11 and 13).",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of goodwill on the acquisition of Clark Water\n\nGoodwill impairment testing requires an estimation of the recoverable amount which is the fair value less cost to sell or value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows for the cash-generating unit and to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of cash flows.\n\nThe Parent Company's impairment test for goodwill related to the acquisition of Clark Water is based on value in use calculations using a discounted cash flow model.  The 2021 cash flows for the next twenty (20) years assume a steady growth rate and are derived from Clark Water's latest business plan.  The Parent Company used the remaining concession life of Clark Water when testing for impairment.  The recoverable amount is most sensitive to discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model.  The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 10.66% and 11.67% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe carrying value of goodwill on the acquisition of Clark Water in the consolidated statements of financial position amounted to P=130.32 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  The Group has not recognized any impairment on the goodwill from the Clark Water acquisition as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Estimating billable water volume\n\nThe SCAs related to the concession agreements of the Group are amortized using the UOP method based on actual billed volume and total estimated billable volume for the remaining period of the concession agreements.  The Group considers factors such as population growth rate, supply and consumption, and service coverage, including ongoing and future expansions in estimating the total billable water volume over the remaining periods of the concession agreements.  In 2020, the Group also considered the impact on future billable volume considering the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which has affected the billed volume mix and consumption.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, SCA amortization expense based on the UOP method are disclosed in Notes 10 and 18.\n\n## Deferred FCDA\n\nUnder the concession agreements entered into by the Parent Company and Boracay Water with MWSS and TIEZA, respectively, the Parent Company and Boracay Water are entitled to recover (refund) foreign exchange losses (gains) arising from concession loans and any concessionaire loans.  The Parent Company and Boracay Water recognized deferred FCDA (included as part of 'Other noncurrent assets' in the consolidated statement of financial position) for both realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses.  Deferred FCDA is set up as an asset for the realized and unrealized exchange losses since this is a resource controlled by the Parent Company and Boracay Water as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Parent Company and Boracay Water.  Net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains, on the other hand, which will be refunded to the customers, are presented as liability.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Parent Company and Boracay Water's deferred FCDA classified under 'Other noncurrent assets' amounted to P=403.18 million and P=1,669.04 million, respectively (see Note 13).\n\nThe Group's deferred FCDA arises from a rate adjustment mechanism for the recovery or compensation on a current basis, subject to quarterly review and adjustment by MWSS or TIEZA, when necessary, of accrued foreign exchange gains and losses, arising from MWSS or TIEZA loans and concession loans used for capital expenditures and concession fee payments.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of deferred taxes at each reporting date and reduces deferred tax assets to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilized.  Significant management judgement is required to determine the amounts that could be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning.\n\nAlso, the Group does not recognize deferred taxes on certain deductible temporary differences where doubt exists as to the tax benefits they will bring in the future (see Note 20).\n\nIn 2020, the Parent Company used itemized deductions in the calculation of its current income tax.  The tax rate of 30% was used in computing for the deferred income taxes of the Parent Company as this is the rate that the underlying deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered, settled or utilized in the future.  As a result of the shift from OSD to itemized deduction, the Parent Company recorded additional deferred income tax assets amounting to P=1,181.15 million (see Note 20).",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Pension liabilities\n\nThe cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations.  The actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions.  These include the determination of the discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates, incapacity rates, retirement rate, and termination rates.  The amounts of defined benefit obligations are highly sensitive to changes due to the complexity of the valuation and its long-term nature.  Discount rate, salary increase rate, retirement rate, and termination rate assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.  The Group's net pension liability amounted to P=219.60 million and P=194.19 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (see Note 16).\n\nIn determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation.  Future salary increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the specific country.  Retirement and termination rates are based on expected rates at which employees are assumed to retire or leave the employment of the Group.\n\nFurther details about the assumptions used are provided in Note 16.\n\n## Estimating the incremental borrowing rate for leases\n\nThe Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it used its incremental borrowing rate to measure its lease liabilities.  The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.  The incremental borrowing rate therefore reflects what the Group 'would have to pay', which requires estimation when no observable rates are available (such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing transactions) or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (for example, when leases are not in the subsidiary's functional currency). The Group estimates its incremental borrowing rate using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as the subsidiary's stand-alone credit rating).\n\nThe Group's lease liabilities amounted to P=393.94 million and P=308.48 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively (see Note 11).\n\n## Estimating fair values for the purchase price allocation of East Water\n\nThe Group acquired shares of stocks of a company in Thailand in 2018.  The fair value of the net assets of the investee company was determined using a combination of multi-period excess earnings valuation method, which assumed expected future earnings stream attributable to the identified incomegenerating asset discounted using the rate of return commensurate to the asset, and fair value less cost to sell valuation method.  The Group estimated the cash flows  based on average life of the identified assets.\n\n## 4. 2019 Business Combination and Goodwill\n\n## EDCG\n\nOn December 11, 2018, Aqua Centro entered into seven (7) APAs with EDCG's subsidiaries to acquire the subsidiaries' assets related to the provision of water service in ten (10) subdivisions in Imus, General Trias, and Naic in the province of Cavite.  These subsidiaries are Earth Aspire Corporation, First Advance Development Corporation, Ambition Land Inc., Prosperity Builders Resources Inc., Tahanang Yaman Homes Corporation, Extraordinary Development Corp., and Earth + Style Corporation.\n\nOn January 9, 2019, Aqua Centro paid 50.00% of the total contract price amounting to total consideration of P=24.67 million while the balance was paid on November 28, 2019 after compliance with all conditions precedent to its APAs.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Aqua Centro has already started operations in nine (9) out of the ten (10) subdivisions.  As of December 31, 2020, Aqua Centro shall operate the one (1) remaining subdivision once all the conditions precedent under the APAs have been fulfilled.",

The OSD allowed to corporate taxpayers shall be in an amount not exceeding forty percent (40%) of their gross income. Gross income refers to gross sales or gross revenue derived from any business activity, net of returns and allowances, less cost of sales or direct costs but before any deduction is made for administrative expenses or incidental losses.  This was applied by the Parent Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018.\n\nThe use of OSD as the method of computing tax deductible expenses affected the recognition of several deferred tax assets and liabilities, such that no deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognized on items of income and expenses that are not considered in determining gross income for income tax purposes.\n\nThe effective tax rate of 18% for the years in which OSD is projected to be utilized was used in computing the deferred income taxes on the net service concession obligation starting 2008.\n\nIn 2020, the Parent Company used itemized deductions in the calculation of its current income tax.  The tax rate of 30% was used in computing for the deferred income taxes of the Parent Company as this is the rate that the underlying deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered, settled or utilized in the future.  As a result of the shift from OSD to itemized deduction, the Parent Company recorded additional deferred income tax assets amounting to P=1,181.15 million.\n\nDeferred taxes on allowance for ECL and pension liability were not recognized by the Parent Company. The net reduction in deferred tax assets from applying the 18% effective tax rate to the recognized deferred taxes on net service obligation and the derecognition of the deferred taxes relating to the accounts with temporary differences which are not considered in determining gross income for income tax purposes by the Parent Company amounted to P=130.41 million as of December 31, 2019.  As of December 31, 2020, deferred taxes on allowance for ECL amounting to P=273.99 million was not recognized.\n\n## Clark Water\n\nClark Water as a duly registered CFZ enterprise under RA No. 9400, An Act Amending RA No. 7227 otherwise known as the Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992, is entitled to all the rights, privileges and benefits established thereunder including tax and duty-free importation of raw materials and capital equipment and special income tax rate of 5% applied on its gross income earned in lieu of all national and local taxes.",

As a result, the applicable income tax rate is the Regular Corporate Income Tax rate of 30% and Minimum Corporate Income Tax rate of 2%.\n\n## Other subsidiaries\n\nAll other domestic subsidiaries of the Parent Company used the Itemized Deduction in determining the amount of their deductible expenses for income tax purposes. As a result, the applicable income tax rate is the Regular Corporate Income Tax rate of 30% and Minimum Corporate Income Tax rate of 2%, while foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax rates applicable in their respective countries.\n\n## NOLCO\n\nThe Parent Company's subsidiaries, namely, MWTS, Calasiao Water, MWPVI, Zamboanga Water, MW Consortium, Davao Water, Tagum Water, and MWTV have total NOLCO amounting to P=343.75 million and P=397.54 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which may be used as deduction against future taxable gross income.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe methods and assumptions used by the Group in estimating the fair value of the long-term financial assets at amortized cost and other financial liabilities such as long-term debt, service concession obligations, and customers' guaranty deposits and other deposits are as follows:\n\n- a. The fair values are estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology using the Group's current incremental borrowing rates for similar borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the liability being valued.\n- b. The discount rates used for PHP-denominated loans were 0.99% to 10.50% in 2020 and 3.02% to 7.42% in 2019 while the discount rates used for foreign currency-denominated loans ranged from 0.99% to 5.52% in 2020 and 3.17% to 6.89% in 2019.\n\nFor the Parent Company, the recoverable amounts of its nonfinancial assets, particularly its property and equipment and service concession assets, have been determined through the assistance of external appraisers.  The fair value, which was considered in the calculation of the recoverable amounts, was established as the current highest and best use of the property.  This was further defined as the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms' length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThere were no financial assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  During the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurement.\n\n## 28. Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies\n\nThe Group's principal financial instruments comprise of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, contract assets from MCWD and TWD, short-term debt, long-term debt, and service concession obligations.  The main purpose of the Group's financial instruments is to fund its operations and capital expenditures.  The main risks arising from the use of financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  The Group has various other financial assets such as trade receivables and payables which arise directly from the conduct of its operations.\n\nThe Parent Company's BOD reviews and approves the policies for managing each of these risks.  The Group monitors risks arising from all financial instruments and regularly report financial management activities and the results of these activities to the Parent Company's BOD.  In addition, the Group ensures that all loan covenants are complied with.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are summarized below:\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.  The Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its financial instruments with floating and/or fixed rates.  Fixed rate financial instruments are subject to fair value interest rate risk while floating rate financial instruments are subject to cash flow interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group's policy is to manage the interest payments using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts to minimize the Group's exposure to changes in interest rates primarily from its long-term debt.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group's mix of fixed interest and floating interest rate of long-term debt are 64.85% to 35.15% and 63.93% to 36.07%, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fixed interest rates of the Group's foreign currency denominated longterm debt are from 1.33% to 4.38% and are from 4.98% to 9.00% for Peso denominated long-term debt. As of December 31, 2019, the fixed interest rates of the Group's foreign currency denominated long-term debt are from 1.33% to 1.51% and are from 4.42% to 9.00% for Peso denominated long-term debt. Floating interest rates are based on 6-month LIBOR, EURIBOR or BIBOR plus margin as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.",

Thus, the Group does not expect any movement of the foreign currencies against the Philippine Peso to have a significant effect on the Group's income before income tax.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Group's established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.  Credit risk for receivables from customers is managed primarily through credit reviews and an analysis of receivables on a continuous basis.  The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Outstanding customer receivables and contract assets are regularly monitored and customer payments are facilitated through various collection modes including the use of postdated checks and auto-debit arrangements.\n\nAn impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses.  The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of customer segments with similar loss patterns (i.e., by geographical region, and product type).  The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.\n\nGenerally, trade receivables are written off when deemed unrecoverable and are not subject to enforcement activity. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.  Counterparty limits are reviewed and approved by the BOD and are updated when necessary.\n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in various banks.  Material amounts are held by banks which belong to the top five (5) banks in the country.  The rest are held by local banks that have good reputation and low probability of insolvency.  These are considered to be low credit risk investments.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank loans, and debentures.  The Group's policy is to maintain a level of cash that is sufficient to fund its operating cash requirements for the next three (3) to six (6) months and any claim for refund of customers' guaranty deposits.  Capital expenditures are funded through long-term debt, while operating expenses and working capital requirements are sufficiently funded through internally generated cash. Maturing debts are refinanced through a combination of long-term debt and internally generated cash.\n\nThe Group's financial assets used for liquidity management based on their maturities are as follows:\n\n|                                   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020               |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                   | Within 1 year       | 1 to 5 years        | More than 5 years   | Total - Gross                   |\n| Assets:                           |                     |                     |                     |                                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents         | P =20,727,258,023   | P =-                | P                   | =- P=20,727,258,023             |\n| Short-term investments            | 129,300,000         | -                   | -                   | 129,300,000                     |\n| Receivables:                      |                     |                     |                     |                                 |\n| Customers                         | 4,634,541,122       | -                   | -                   | 4,634,541,122                   |\n| Employees                         | 26,721,569          | -                   | -                   | 26,721,569                      |\n| Interest from banks               | 10,306,422          | -                   | -                   | 10,306,422                      |\n| ZCWD                              | 39,509,823          |                     |                     | 39,509,823                      |\n| Others                            | 195,194,601         | -                   | -                   | 195,194,601                     |\n| Contract assets from MCWD and TWD | 276,328,970         | 1,143,936,076       | 3,415,957,589       | 4,836,222,635                   |\n|                                   | P =26,039,160,530   | P =1,143,936,076    | P                   | =3,415,957,589 P=30,599,054,195 |",

The Group's target gearing ratio is set at 60%.  This target is to be achieved by managing the Group's level of borrowings and dividend payments to shareholders (see Note 15).\n\n|                                     | 2020                                | 2019             |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Total liabilities                   | P=96,363,110,383                    | P=78,610,432,600 |\n| Less service concession obligations | 9,105,646,095                       | 9,153,821,686    |\n|                                     | 87,257,464,288                      | 69,456,610,914   |\n| Total stockholders' equity          | 60,163,455,106                      | 55,991,207,785   |\n| Total                               | P=147,420,919,394 P=125,447,818,699 |                  |\n| Gearing ratio                       | 59%                                 | 55%              |\n\nThe Group also monitors its net debt to equity ratio.

On November 15, 2010, the local government of Quezon City demanded the payment of P=302.71 million for deficiency real property taxes from MWSS on MWSS properties within its territorial jurisdiction.  The assessments from the municipality of Norzagaray and Quezon City have been questioned by the Concessionaires and MWSS, and are pending resolution before the Central Board of Assessment Appeals and Supreme Court, respectively.  On November 7, 2018, the Supreme Court issued its decision declaring that the real properties of MWSS located in Quezon City are exempt from the real estate tax imposed by the local government of Quezon City.  On June 17, 2019, the Supreme Court decision on the case became final and executory and was thereby recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the provision for estimated probable losses pertains to various legal proceedings and exposures arising in the ordinary course of business.  Management believes that any amount the Group may have to pay in connection with any of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position or operating results.  The information normally required under PAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, is not disclosed as it may prejudice the outcome of the proceedings (Note 1).",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 31. Events After the Reporting Period\n\n## Parent Company\n\nOn February 15, 2021, the Parent Company and Prime Strategic Holdings, Inc. (previously Prime Metroline Holdings, Inc.) signed an Amendment to the Subscription Agreement which both parties entered into last February 1, 2020.  The amendment covers the inclusion of Trident Water Company Holdings, Inc. (Trident Water) as party to the Subscription Agreement following its establishment, as well as the updated payment terms which is 50.00% upon Closing and 50.00% upon call of the Parent Company's BOD.\n\nOn the same date, Philwater and Trident Water executed a Share Purchase Agreement wherein Philwater agrees to sell 2,691,268,205 of its preferred shares in the Parent Company to Trident Water with a payment term over a five (5)-year period.  The purchase of the preferred shares reflects a 39.09% voting stake and 8.19% economic stake in the Parent Company.  The rights and title to the shares, except voting rights covered by the proxies, which shall be executed upon the execution of the Shareholders' Agreement, shall not be transferred until all payments are made.  Dividends earned by the preferred shares shall continue to be for the account of Philwater until full payment has been made.\n\nThe Parent Company has not issued, and Trident Water has not acquired, the 820.00 million common shares subject of the Subscription Agreement pending the completion of the following conditions to closing:\n\n- 1. Execution of the Shareholders' Agreement by Ayala, Philwater, and Trident Water, and\n- 2. Compliance with and completion of the mandatory tender offer by Trident Water to the shareholders of the Parent Company as may be required by the SEC.\n\nTrident Water will initiate the mandatory tender offer after receipt of written approval by the SEC.  The mandatory tender offer is estimated to be completed by April 2021.  The Shareholders' Agreement will be signed after the completion of the mandatory tender offer.\n\n## MWPVI\n\nOn January 14, 2021, the consortium of MWPVI and TPGI has signed and executed a JVA with the SJCWD for the design, construction, improvement, upgrade, rehabilitation, maintenance, operation, financing, expansion, and management of the water supply system and the provision of water and sanitation services of SJCWD in San Jose City, Nueva Ecija.\n\n## Clark Water\n\nOn June 16, 2016, the DENR promulgated DENR Administrative Order (DAO) No. 2016-08 regulating the discharge of nutrients and imposing additional limits and parameters.  Pursuant to Section 10 of DAO No. 2016-08, Clark Water sought the approval of the DENR of its Compliance Action Plan ('CAP') which would have extended the current five (5)-year CAP of Clark Water.  On July 17, 2020, Clark Water received the approval of DENR on its submitted CAP with project completion deadline of December 31, 2021.  On October 19, 2020, the CDC sent a letter to the DENR in support of Clark Water's request for extension of its CAP to 2023.  On November 11, 2020, however, the CDC received a letter from the DENR denying Clark Water's request citing the DAO No. 2016-08's clear five (5)-year limit for the grace period. On November 26, 2020, CDC sent another letter to the DENR appealing to the DENR for reconsideration of their request to postpone the DAO No. 2016-08.  On December 7, 2020, the DENR sent a letter to the CDC, denying their request for the second time.  On January 29, 2021, Clark Water received a show cause order from the Environmental Management Bureau requiring Clark Water to justify why it should not be penalized for not being able to commence construction last January 15, 2021.  Clark Water is given 60 days to respond.\n\nAs of date of authorization for issuance of this report, Clark Water has not yet started the implementation of projects to comply with the CAP and DAO No. 2016-08 as Clark Water has not obtained (1) CDC's necessary approval of the Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment in relation to the projects, and (2) CDC's issuance of construction-related permits to the contractor for the Bionutrient Removal (BNR)-related projects.  Non-compliance to the CAP and DAO No. 2016-08 may result to possible fines and penalties as indicated under Section 28 of RA No. 9275.",
