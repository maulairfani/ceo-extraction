We apply a combined assurance model, which seeks to optimise the assurance obtained from management as well as internal and external assurance providers while fostering a strong ethical context and mechanisms to ensure compliance. Through the risk management process, approved by the Board, management identifies key risks facing Sasol and implements the necessary internal controls.\n\n## Our combined assurance model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe process is monitored and evaluated under the direction of internal audit, while external audit teams cover key controls and accounting matters in the course of their audits. Other levels of external assurance are obtained as and when required. The Board and Audit Committee assessed the effectiveness of controls for the year ended 30 June 2020 as satisfactory, primarily through a process of management self-assessment, including formal confirmation from executive management and also considered reports from internal audit, external audit and other assurance providers. The consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the period.\n\n## Directors' approval\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring the integrity of Sasol's integrated reporting. The Board gave attention to management's evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures. Other than the material weaknesses reported in the Annual Financial Statements and the Form 20-F, we believe Sasol has designed such internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses, we confirm that the 2020 Integrated Report addresses all material issues and matters which affect the Group's ability to create value, and fairly represents the Group's integrated performance. The Board approved this report and its publication on 21 August 2020.\n\nThe Board confirms that Sasol is in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act relating to its incorporation and is operating in conformity with its Memorandum of Incorporation.\n\n## Signed by the Board:\n\nSipho Nkosi Chairman of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nColin Beggs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKatherine Harper\n\nBeatrix KennealyMpho Nkele\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Robertson\n\nStephen Westwell\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFleetwood Grobler President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nManuel Cuambe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMuriel Dube\n\nMartina Fl\u00f6el\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNomgando Matyumza\n\nMoses Mkhize\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaul Victor Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVuyo Kahla\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\n## Committed to delivering sustainable value\n\nSasol is driven to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. Our strategy takes into account the six capitals, the stakeholders with whom we interact and the risks and opportunities that our operating environment presents. Our heavily geared balance sheet and the extreme market volatility required  us to revise our strategy to ensure our resilience in a dynamic new world and deliver a robust Future Sasol. We continuously monitor the material matters that we have identified as having the potential to substantially affect - both positively and negatively - our ability to create value over the short, medium and long term.\n\n## Risk\n\nThe main purpose of risk management is to adequately position the organisation to understand and respond to the potential risks that could materially impact the execution of our strategy and value creation.\n\n## Our top risks\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risks\n- \u00b7 Safety and operational risks\n- \u00b7 Legal, regulatory and governance risks\n- \u00b7 Information management risks\n- \u00b7 Capital investment risks\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical risks\n- \u00b7 Market risks\n- \u00b7 Sustainability risks\n- \u00b7 People risks\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder risks\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 risks\n\n## Our key stakeholders\n\nOur ongoing engagement with stakeholders enhances our reputation and improves our understanding of stakeholders' needs and interests to position us for a sustainable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees and organised labour\n\nShareholders and providers of capital\n\nCustomers\n\nGovernments and regulators\n\nCommunities\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs)\n\n## Six capitals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human capital\n\nTo grow and steer our business and operate our facilities safely and efficiently, we require high-performing, innovative and diverse people with the right skills and experience.

We actively engage stakeholders to ensure we progress on strategy and have a multi-stakeholder approach to solve challenges.\n\n## Natural capital\n\nWe require natural gas, coal and crude oil as well as air, water, land and energy to convert hydrocarbon reserves into valueadding product streams, while minimising our environmental footprint.\n\n## Financial capital\n\nWe are disciplined in the way we allocate our financial capital. We use cash generated by our operations, divestments, debt and equity financing to sustain our business and fund growth.\n\n## Manufactured capital\n\nBy investing in plant and equipment, we are able to convert hydrocarbon resources into high-value product streams and operate reliably. These investments also help manage our environmental footprint and assist in complying with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Intellectual capital\n\nOur proprietary and licensed technologies, software, licences, procedures and protocols support our competitive advantage.

The oil price collapse, volatility in chemical prices and the spread of COVID-19 came at a time when the balance sheet was at peak gearing. We took immediate steps to respond to this crisis but also realised that we had to reset Sasol to become sustainably profitable in a lower oil price environment.

As governments grapple with containing this highly infectious, and often deadly virus, we are witnessing global economic turmoil on a scale unlike anything experienced in modern history.\n\nCOVID-19 has impacted every company and economy in some form, potentially also triggering lasting geopolitical change. The effects on Sasol are particularly profound.\n\nAs the COVID-19 storm approached, we were already at a disadvantage owing to our highly geared balance sheet. This placed the Group's liquidity at serious risk, especially as oil prices collapsed and product demand for some commodities evaporated.\n\nThis thrust a sudden and unprecedented set of challenges on us. In the face of these, the Board supported the management team in rapidly activating a comprehensive response plan. This plan was aimed at stabilising the business in the short term, while preparing for a strategic reset - Future Sasol - to ensure a sustainable Group in an enduring low oil price environment and carbon-constrained world.\n\n## Driving an immediate response\n\nMuch of the Board and management's focus in the latter half of the year was to stabilise and strengthen Sasol's foundation in the short term, which would serve as a springboard for building Future Sasol.\n\nThe immediate priority was a cash conservation drive to shore up Sasol's liquidity, alongside accelerating and broadening the asset disposal programme and preparing for a rights issue to shareholders.\n\nThese measures will continue well into the new financial year, while we transition to Future Sasol.\n\nWe recognise that the world may see lower-for-longer oil prices and will demand low-carbon energy and hence we have to change Future Sasol aims to improve our cash flow generation and pursue lower carbon alternatives that can benefit all stakeholders. We are aiming to position a business that can be resilient and sustainably profitable in a US$45/bbl world. This change is underpinned by a reset strategy and revised operating model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's revised strategy focuses on areas where we believe there are good value growth prospects, which are low risk and with lower-carbon intensity, informed by evolving consumer needs and powerful megatrends.\n\nFurthermore, we have narrowed Sasol's portfolio to focus on two businesses - Chemicals and Energy - pursuing customerled growth in select markets, while resizing the upstream portfolio to focus on gas in Southern Africa and discontinuing oil growth activities in West Africa.\n\nWe remain firmly committed to transitioning to a lowercarbon world and developing solutions to meet our sustainability goals. The Board is working closely with management to deliver a credible greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction roadmap to meet our 2030 target and develop a longer-term emission reduction ambition to 2050. The 2030 roadmap has been published in the Climate Change Report CCR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our 70-year history we have faced and overcome many challenges. Our deeply entrenched 'can-do' spirit drives our perseverance and has enabled Sasol to deliver, even in times of great uncertainty. Evidence of this includes our track record of beating cost targets. We strongly believe we will emerge from this crisis a stronger, more resilient Group.\n\n## Our safety performance\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I report six fatalities this year: three employees and three contractors tragically lost their lives in work-related incidents. On behalf of the Board and all Sasol people, I convey our sincerest condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of those who died.\n\n'Eliminating fatalities and improving our culture' is one of the Group's five material matters identified in the year (see material matters on page 42). Any loss of life is unacceptable. As the Board, we are continuing to work with management to drive focused interventions to proactively address the prevention of fatalities and high-severity injuries.\n\nTo contain and prevent the spread of COVID-19, I am pleased that management acted swiftly in implementing all regulatory requirements and necessary workplace controls and continues to actively monitor and mitigate the impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our 70-year history we have faced and overcome many challenges. Our deeply entrenched 'can-do' spirit drives our perseverance and has enabled Sasol to deliver, even in times of great uncertainty. ' '\n\n## Passing the dividend to protect the balance sheet\n\nThe Board made the decision to pass both the interim and final dividend. This was in an effort to protect the balance sheet in the long-term interest of our shareholders, and indeed of our many stakeholders. Dividend pay-outs by Sasol South Africa Limited (SSA) were also impacted by lower product demand and reduced earnings. This will affect SSA's ability to pay off the loans of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment transaction - Sasol Khanyisa. It is therefore an immediate priority that we reset the business to improve cash flows, drive cost reduction and the profitability of our businesses.\n\n## Leadership and governance\n\nThe Board Review into the LCCP underscored the need to further strengthen Sasol's internal governance systems, prompting a number of initiatives to improve governance processes and controls.\n\nThe Board worked to ensure that Sasol has a culture of accountability. We acknowledged that for trust in the Group to be restored, a reset was required, including new leadership. As a result, the Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers, Mr Bongani Nqwababa and Mr Stephen Cornell, agreed to an amicable mutual separation, and a new President and CEO, Mr Fleetwood Grobler, was appointed effective 1 November 2019.\n\nIn addition to these changes, and the retirement of our Chairman, other governance developments in the year included the retirement of our Lead Independent Director (LID) and the appointment of a successor, the appointment of two new Directors, as well as a new Company Secretary.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Dr Mandla Gantsho, Mr JJ Njeke, Mr Bongani Nqwababa and Mr Stephen Cornell for their invaluable contributions over the years. I welcome Mr Fleetwood Grobler, Mr Vuyo Kahla and Ms Katherine Harper to the Board, congratulate Mr Stephen Westwell as our new LID, and extend a welcome to our new Company Secretary, Ms Lucy Mokoka. Diversity remains important to Sasol and I am pleased that these appointments further that goal as six of our 15 Board members are women.\n\nIn response to Sasol's recent challenges, the Directors unanimously agreed to a fee sacrifice of at least 20%, for the duration of the employee sacrifice, to assist the Group in overcoming cash flow challenges.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Directors for the important example they have set.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nIt was an honour to be appointed Chairman of Sasol on the eve of the Group's 70 th anniversary. I am conscious of the great responsibility that comes with the position, particularly at a time of great upheaval - not only for a world suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but also for Sasol.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I extend my thanks and deep appreciation for the profound contributions of every employee during a critical and unprecedented period in the Group's history. Sasol employees stepped up by diligently driving the cash conservation effort, while many thousands also sacrificed part of their salaries to support the organisation. This is evidence of the 'Team Sasol' spirit.\n\nI also acknowledge Sasol's stakeholders for your continued support and engagement. Throughout this Integrated Report, and the Sustainability Report SR , we reflect on the work Sasol is doing to grow shared value for society at large; minimise our environmental footprint; ensure safe and enduring operations; as well as focus on securing the Group's resilience in a lower-carbon future. Your challenge and input have been important in our effort to set a new strategic direction. I look forward to continuing our dialogue.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs we mark Sasol's seven decades in business, we take comfort from the Group's resilience. However, we do not take it for granted. We understand the extent of the work that is required to navigate successfully through the immediate macroeconomic storm as well as the substantial changes that are required to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Group in a low oil price and carbon-constrained world.\n\nWe look forward to working collaboratively with our many partners across the globe as we endeavour to regain their confidence and secure Future Sasol that is resilient and indeed fit-for-the-future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSipho Nkosi Chairman\n\n21 August 2020\n\n.",

Additionally, we suffered credit rating downgrades as a result of the volatile macro environment.\n\nResponding to these new challenges in the second half of our financial year required a deliberate and swift pivot in our priorities to stabilise our business in the short term, while charting a path forward to long-term sustainability under a revised strategy and operating model. This we drove through a comprehensive response plan ultimately aimed at resetting Sasol.\n\n## Factors driving our strategic reset\n\nSignificant internal and external issues, both short and long term in nature, have compelled us to reset Sasol.\n\nIn the short term, two critical factors spurred our comprehensive response plan.\n\nFirst, as the COVID-19 storm emerged, Sasol's financial position was already under severe pressure. The balance sheet was heavily geared due to the additional spend that was required to complete the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP). With high debt levels we cannot pay dividends, or invest in new growth opportunities, and our ability to withstand market shocks, like COVID-19, is weakened.\n\nSecond, the market was extremely volatile. In South Africa and other parts of the world we have seen dramatic falls in product prices and witnessed a steep decline in demand due to lockdowns.\n\nThe need to restore financial stability drove our self-help cash conservation measures which were introduced in the second half of the year. These measures are intended to restore financial stability in the short term and beyond.\n\nIn the first half of financial year 2020, we were planning on a US$60 per barrel oil price. Now, we need to plan in a US$45/bbl environment. This is a very significant change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMany of our assets are also at risk of diminishing returns. What this means is that with lower oil prices and higher feedstock costs, we face the risk of lower returns on our invested capital.\n\nAdditionally, we need to take account of shifting investor expectations requiring a more focused portfolio and higher delivery of value from Sasol.\n\nFinally, increasing societal pressure to reduce our carbon emissions will remain. Globally there is an enhanced focus on sustainability, which Sasol supports, and we want to take a leadership role in South Africa's transition to a lower-carbon economy by helping develop gas as a key feedstock and renewables as a secondary energy source. We will leverage our engineering and energy expertise to drive low-carbon energy solutions and help the country meet its international climate change commitments.\n\nMany of these factors are not new and our strategy has been evolving to take account of them in recent years. The events of 2020 and the financial pressures we faced required an acceleration in our strategic response to fundamentally reset Sasol.\n\n## Urgent steps to survive the crisis\n\nWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic we took urgent steps to stabilise the Group in the short term. This entailed:\n\n- \u00b7   Conserving cash through self-help management actions in operational and capital expenditure of US$1 billion in 2020 with a further US$1 billion in financial year 2021.\n- \u00b7   Accelerating asset disposals and delivering proceeds in excess of the targeted US$2 billion.\n- \u00b7   Pursuing a rights issue of up to US$2 billion.\n\nI am pleased to report that by year-end:\n\n- \u00b7   We exceeded our self-help target of US$1 billion by curtailing discretionary capital and limiting sustenance capital to the minimum level required to maintain safe and reliable operations. Furthermore, we optimised external spend and implemented cost saving measures across various human capital levers. This culminated in our best working capital performance yet and a robust cost performance.\n- \u00b7   On asset divestments, we concluded the establishment of our joint venture explosives business with Enaex and sold our interest in the Escravos GTL plant in Nigeria to Chevron. In July 2020, we signed an exclusive negotiation agreement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA swift and decisive response was required to stabilise our business in the short term, while charting a path forward to long-term sustainability under a revised strategy and operating model. ' '\n\nwith Air Liquide to own and operate our 16 air separation units at our Secunda complex for proceeds of approximately R8,5 billion. The proceeds from these transactions make a substantial contribution to our targeted divestments.\n\n- \u00b7   Progress on a partnering transaction in our Base Chemical assets in United States (US) is far advanced and announcements will be made at the appropriate time.\n\nAll our actions have culminated in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4,3 times. We successfully agreed with our lenders to waive the covenant at June 2020 and lift the December 2020 covenant from 3,0 times to 4,0 times.\n\nWe will pursue a rights issue of up to US$2 billion in the second half of financial year 2021. Cash flow generation and divesting of non-core assets will all contribute to re-instating the dividend at a time when net debt to EBITDA is below 2,0 times.\n\n## Advancing our strategy for long-term value\n\nA key part of our comprehensive response plan was to look beyond near-term measures and position the business for sustained profitability in a low oil price environment. This entailed reviewing and updating our strategy to bring greater focus to our portfolio and transition Sasol to a lower-carbon future.\n\nFuture Sasol will comprise two market-focused businesses, Chemicals and Energy. A key decision as a result of this is the discontinuation of all oil growth activities in West Africa and resizing our upstream portfolio to focus on gas. The revision of our strategy aims to have a greater focus on value realisation for all stakeholders, business sustainability and enhanced cash generation. It acknowledges the need to streamline what was previously a complex and wide portfolio.\n\nThe Chemicals Business will transform our portfolio towards specialty chemicals in which we enjoy differentiated capabilities and strong market positions that can be expanded over time. We will continue to focus on our commodity chemicals portfolio, however this will diminish over time as we focus more on specialty chemicals.\n\nThe Energy Business comprises the Southern African value chain and associated assets and will be positioned for higher cash generation through improved margins, cost efficiency and divesting of assets with low returns. This business will also pursue GHG reduction through a focus on gas as a key complementary feedstock and renewables as a secondary\n\nenergy source. These will be critical enablers to achieve our 2030 GHG reduction target and our longer-term sustainability aspirations.\n\nThese two businesses will be fully accountable for profit and loss, management of resources and capabilities. A lean corporate centre will enable the businesses by fostering synergies and integrating activities, setting strategic boundaries and allocating capital. These developments will support improved financial returns.\n\nIn tandem, resetting our strategy necessitated a revised operating model, which will become effective on 1 November 2020. The top leadership structure has already been realigned and optimised to enable this new model. Our intent with Future Sasol is to deliver a Group that is streamlined, focused and positioned to succeed. It is therefore a matter of much regret that not all our employees will be able to make the journey to the new Sasol. In this, unfortunately, we have no choice. We have to put the sustainability of Sasol first, and the steps we are following are taken with only this in mind.\n\nFuture Sasol will not only look different, it will behave differently, requiring a change in culture and ways of working, and will be more open to partnering arrangements. It will remain heavily committed to South Africa and plans to work closely with the government to align with the country's energy and economic goals.\n\n## Megaproject on cusp of completion\n\nThe LCCP in United States has essentially reached completion. The ethane cracker achieved beneficial operations in August 2019 and by year-end, five out of the six downstream chemicals units were fully operational, with the most recent Ziegler and Guerbet alcohols units reaching beneficial operations in June 2020. These milestones have brought the online capacity of LCCP's specialty chemicals units to 100% and LCCP's total online nameplate capacity to 86%. The lowdensity polyethylene (LDPE) plant is the last remaining unit to bring the capacity of the LCCP to 100%. We expect the LDPE to reach beneficial operations in October 2020.\n\nThe completion of the specialty chemicals units cements our position as having the broadest integrated alcohols and surfactants portfolio in the world and further strengthens recognition of our leading position in chemicals for essential care markets such as laundry, home care, personal care and hygiene.",

Foremost of these is safety. It is thus very distressing that we reported six fatalities in the year. This is unacceptable. We continue to take decisive action to make zero harm a reality by pursuing with greater vigour our programme to prevent high-severity injuries and fatalities.\n\nWe are fast-tracking our investigations into fatalities so that we can establish the root cause without prolonged delays. This will allow us to address any underlying risks and put in place measures to prevent any recurrences.\n\nTo drive this greater focus and efficiency, since my appointment I have been personally involved in managing the investigations into every fatality.\n\nIn what has been Sasol's most challenging year on record, I must commend all Sasol employees for diligently implementing our comprehensive response plan to stabilise our business. Across the organisation, I have witnessed our people rally behind delivery on our self-help measures to improve Sasol's cash position, with many thousands of employees also sacrificing a portion of their salaries.\n\n## Reflecting on our 2020 results\n\nWe reported a strong operational performance in the first half of 2020, however with the oil price collapse and outbreak of COVID-19 in the second half, we experienced much lower demand for our products and depressed margins. We recorded a loss of R91,3 billion for the year including impairments of R111,6 billion.\n\n'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince June 2020, we have seen a marked improvement in our operational performance with demand resuming in some areas of the business. We are optimistic that this performance will continue in 2021.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIn the ten months since I was appointed, we have navigated a scale of volatility that I have not seen in my 36 years at Sasol.\n\nWe look ahead to the new year with greater clarity and confidence. Drawing on the experience over the last 70 years and expertise both within the Group and among our many stakeholders, I am optimistic that we have what it takes to enhance cash flow and reposition the balance sheet in the short term, on the assumption that oil prices remain low until the end of our 2021 financial year. Over the longer term, our strategy will enable a more robust, resilient and sustainable Sasol.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the significant efforts of 'Team Sasol' across the globe. I am encouraged by your energy, focus and delivery in this volatile environment.

In Energy, we will leverage our integrated value chain and strong cash generating assets to deliver enhanced returns and use our leading position in gas to grow in the region.\n\nIn Chemicals, our broad range of integrated alcohols and surfactants, specialty alumina products and our track record of collaborative innovation with customers position us to win in specialty markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7   Accelerate asset disposals and urgently deliver Future Sasol to reset the Group before 2022\n- \u00b7  Safely ramp-up LCCP units to expected value\n- \u00b7   Stabilise business operations to pre-COVID-19 levels, focus on increased value extraction\n- \u00b7  Sustainable reduction of working capital and sustenance capital\n- \u00b7   Conserve cash to deleverage the balance sheet and reduce operating cost sustainably\n- \u00b7   Portfolio enhancement through strategic acquisitions, mergers or partnerships\n- \u00b7   Effectively introduce gas in wider Southern Africa and renewables solutions\n- \u00b7   Position our Energy Business to lead the energy transition in Southern Africa\n- \u00b7   Establish Sasol as notable global special chemicals player\n\nOur capital allocation principles remain unchanged. Our immediate priorities are to strengthen the balance sheet, reducing net debt to EBITDA to below 1,5 times and reintroducing the dividend.

In 2020, the Board met twice to consider Sasol's operating context and the execution of strategy in a highly volatile macroeconomic environment. Directors reviewed the Group's emission reductions target to 2030 and the roadmap to achieving the target, considering the impact on society and business continuity. In May 2020, the Board endorsed the updated strategy which is aligned with the energy transition and powerful megatrends. The strategy aims to deliver sustainable returns to all stakeholders in the long term.\n\n- \u00b7   Deliver affordable gas supply to our operations from 2024, when we expect our supply from existing fields in Mozambique to start declining\n- \u00b7   Focus on value extraction and organic growth of integrated value chains\n- \u00b7  Achieve emission reductions and air quality goals\n\n## Aimed at aligning with the UN SDGs\n\nIn October 2019, we announced our absolute medium-term GHG emission reduction target to 2030. To support the achievement of this target, we developed an emission reduction roadmap and, in parallel, updated our strategy by considering a range of scenarios that cover a variety of possible future outcomes. While none of us can be certain which path the energy transition will take, we are confident that this honed strategy is more consistent with the Paris Agreement goals and are pleased with the progress made in 2020, including several initiatives, details of which are in our Climate Change Report CCR .\n\n## COMMITTED TO ENSURING STRATEGIC DELIVERY\n\nOur clearly laid out ambitions are not without risk and uncertainties.\n\nSecuring affordable gas supply to transition our South African value chain is a key driver for long-term viability. In addition, having capital available for growth is a key success factor to grow our Chemicals Business.\n\nTo successfully meet our aspirations of Future Sasol and achieve our long term goals we will have to reset the Group to be competitive in a lower oil price environment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In parallel, an asset disposal programme is gaining momentum, shaping Sasol's future portfolio.

This will be achieved through:\n\n- \u00b7  Gross margin improvements.\n- \u00b7   Reduction in cash costs through business optimisation and pursuing a global cost competitive position.\n- \u00b7   Optimisation of sustenance capital through the use of predictive maintenance strategies and digitalisation.\n- \u00b7   Maintaining optimal working capital levels.\n- \u00b7   Creating of shared services to bring efficiencies and sharing of best practices.\n\nThese targets will be firmed up and articulated at our Investor Day Briefing in November 2020.",

How did Sasol respond?\n\nIn the face of these sudden and unprecedented challenges, we took immediate steps to implement a comprehensive response plan to stabilise the business in the short term and raise cash of at least US$6 billion by the end of financial year 2021 to repay debt. This is being achieved through a combination of self-help measures, an expanded and accelerated asset divestment programme and a pending rights issue of up to US$2 billion.\n\n## Self-help management actions\n\nWe implemented a cash conservation programme focused on enhancing cash flow and cost competitiveness in a low oil price environment, with a US$2 billion cash delivery by 30 June 2021.\n\nBy year end, we exceeded our US$1 billion target for 2020 due to the diligent efforts of our teams, significant cost reduction, implementation of a cash 'war room' and careful management of capital expenditure. We reported a record 12.5% working capital measure - the lowest level to date.\n\n## Pursuing a rights issue\n\nWe are pursuing a rights issue of up to US$2 billion which will be executed in the second half of the 2021 financial year, subject to shareholders approval. This is a final step in the process to reset our capital structure. The exact amount of the rights issue and its timing is subject to prevailing operating and market conditions as well as other initiatives, such as further disposals and implementation of our Future Sasol that is aimed at enhancing cash flows and improving our cost competitive position.\n\nThe planned assets disposals combined with a rights issue and Future Sasol is expected to reset the debt structure of the Company to become more sustainable in the future.\n\nQ\n\nSasol's balance sheet is under extreme pressure. What are the immediate focus areas to restore the Group back to its targeted leverage levels?\n\n## To create headroom on the balance sheet and manage our debt facilities prudently, our immediate focus areas are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduce debt through self-help measures, asset disposals and pursue a rights issue in second half of financial year 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSafely ramp-up and deliver the LCCP to expected operating rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImplement Future Sasol to enhance cash flows\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransform our asset portfolio in line with our strategic objectives over the next 12 to 30 months\n\n## Stepped-up asset disposal target\n\nIn 2017, we announced a review of our assets and the commencement of a disposal process to streamline the portfolio. As part of our 2020 comprehensive response plan, we are accelerating and expanding this programme that is aligned with balance sheet, shareholder value and strategic objectives. We aim to deliver proceeds in excess of US$2 billion by 2021. To date, we have secured proceeds of US$0,6 billion, including the sale of our 16 air separation units in Secunda.\n\nWe are clear that we will only dispose of assets at value and will not destroy long-term shareholder value.\n\n## Future Sasol\n\nWe are undertaking a purposeful and systematic review of our global cost competitiveness and business structure. This strategic reset is to deliver a focused and sustainable business for the future, so that we are a profitable business in an environment of sustained low oil prices. With sharpened focus on our two core Chemicals and Energy Businesses, it creates scope for sustainable shareholder value creation through shareholder returns and strategic investment.\n\n## MANAGING THE BALANCE SHEET IN UNCERTAIN TIMES\n\n## Paul Victor\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite our short-term challenges, we believe that Sasol has a compelling investment proposition: it is enabled by our integrated value chains, highly skilled people, prudent financial risk management and the execution of our revised strategy. ' ' Q What is Future Sasol and how will it reposition Sasol?\n\nA key part of our comprehensive response plan is to look beyond the near-term measures and position the business for sustained profitability in a low oil price environment. The objective of Future Sasol is to build a resilient company that will be sustainably profitable in a low oil price environment. This will allow Sasol to deliver better for all its stakeholders, including taking an important role in the country's transition to a low-carbon economy. The revised strategy aims to have a greater focus on enhanced cash generation and value realisation for shareholders. These changes collectively add up to the most radical reset of the Company, in its 70 year history.\n\n## The key elements of the reset are:\n\nFirst, the shape and operating model of Sasol will change. It will focus on two business units - Chemicals and Energy - each responsible for their own profit and loss, supported by a much smaller central, head office function. We acknowledge that we needed to streamline what was previously a complex and wide portfolio.\n\nSecond , the financial returns of Sasol will improve: the new Sasol has been designed to produce higher, sustainable cash flows from the revised portfolio of assets so that Sasol can operate in a US$45 per barrel oil environment. Increased ROIC will be driven by leveraging digitalisation, cost optimisations, margin improvements and reduction in overheads.\n\nImproved returns are necessary to fund future growth and in order to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\nThird , the new Sasol will not only look different - it will behave differently, requiring a change in culture and 'ways of working' . The new Sasol will be more open to partnering arrangements with greater focus on delivering quick and cost-effective solutions. It will be more customer-focused in its orientation.\n\nFourth , the strategy of the new Sasol makes clear portfolio choices about transitioning to a lower carbon business . Sasol intends to play a leadership role in the country's energy transition, by helping develop gas as a key feedstock and renewables as a secondary energy source.\n\nFifth, the new Sasol will remain committed to South Africa and plans to work closely with government to align with the economic and energy goals of the country.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat shifts are required to achieve Future Sasol and what KPIs + will you use to monitor performance?\n\nWe understand the shifts that will be required to move us from where we are today to the Future Sasol which is aligned with our long-term strategy. As a global chemicals and energy company, we believe we can return superior returns to shareholders in the long term by delivering on our strategic targets, applying our disciplined capital allocation framework and extracting further value from our existing assets.\n\n## Sasol today\n\n## Future Sasol\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPosition us for sustainable growth\n\n- \u00b7 Chemicals: grow specialty chemicals in attractive and differentiated end markets\n- \u00b7 Upstream: pursue affordable gas\n- \u00b7 Energy: grow our liquid fuels retail footprint in South Africa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeliver strong cash flows from our foundation businesses\n\n- \u00b7 Significant volume and cash flow growth from foundation businesses and the LCCP\n- \u00b7 Enhance our cost effectiveness\n- \u00b7 Cash fixed costs flat compared to prior year\n- \u00b7 Continued investment to safely sustain our foundation businesses limited to US$1,5 billion per annum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransform our asset portfolio to be fit-for-purpose\n\n- \u00b7 Rigorous assets review, value-enhanced disposals and deliver sharpened capital allocation discipline\n- + Key performance indicators\n- *   ROIC - Return on invested capital.

        "page_content": "## CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER'S STATEMENT (continued)\n\nTo achieve our aspiration as set out in Future Sasol, which is aligned with our long-term strategic targets, we need to strengthen our current operations by focusing on:\n\n- \u00b7 Reducing our cash fixed cost base to be globally competitive and align our overheads with the size of the portfolio;\n- \u00b7 Ramping-up LCCP to expectations;\n- \u00b7 Improving our project execution and rolling out the lessons learnt from the LCCP to other areas of the business;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that the LCCP fundamentals remain intact despite increased cost and schedule delays by focusing on productivity and process safety;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Future Sasol has very ambitious plans. What does that mean for the Group's balance sheet and capital structure?\n\nWe need to reduce our debt quantum to a more sustainable level and reshape the portfolio. We are in the process of identifying assets that are not strategically aligned or integrated or have returns that are below weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for disposal or closure. In a lower oil price environment, we cannot afford to run assets that do not meet our targeted return: it destroys value delivery to shareholders and our stakeholders.\n\nFor the remaining assets, we aim to improve the quality of returns through:\n\n- \u00b7 Margin improvements and reduced go-to-market costs;\n- \u00b7 Cost  improvement through a new operating model, an organisational redesign, improved procurement processes, improved productivity and cost of doing business, digitalisation and other efficiencies;\n- \u00b7 Capital, working capital and cash management improvements;\n- \u00b7 Fit-for-purpose functional design; and\n- \u00b7 More effective and efficient governance structures aimed at quicker decision-making.\n\nTransitioning to Future Sasol will not be an easy task and will require Team Sasol to think outside the box in terms of new ways of working, embracing digitalisation and improving our margins. However this reset, together with our asset disposals and a rights issue of up to US$2 billion, will enable us to maintain a more manageable capital structure going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## After seven years of planning and construction, Sasol is now partnering on LCCP's Base Chemical assets. Why?\n\nThe LCCP remains a strategic asset in a good location near key markets. As indicated at our Capital Markets Day in 2017, Sasol was intending to grow the specialty chemicals business and participate only selectively in commodity chemicals. This was motivated by the fact that commodity chemicals typically have a high level of exposure to cyclical pricing.\n\nSince 2017 the outlook for commodity chemicals has become much more challenging with ongoing oversupply now widely expected. This has been exacerbated by the recent, unexpected collapse in the oil price and the unprecedented global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on Sasol.\n\nAs such, in June 2020, Sasol announced an updated strategy which aims to position Sasol to deliver sustainable, attractive, long-term shareholder returns with a focus on growing specialty chemicals globally and advancing energy solutions in Southern Africa.\n\nThe partnering on LCCP's Base Chemicals assets accelerates the focus on the specialty chemicals portfolio. We believe that this will help long-term value creation. The partnering will also reduce net debt and so provide a more sustainable capital structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## With all the LCCP units now online, except for the LDPE facility, how does that impact the Group's balance sheet and income statement?\n\nThe LCCP remains a strategic component of our portfolio. The LCCP provides earnings diversification to the Group and access to US dollar cash flows which can be used to settle the US dollar debt. Having a diverse currency exposure in the balance sheet is important as it assists with the spreading of liquidity and currency risk.\n\n- \u00b7 Shifting product slate in integrated value chains to higher margin businesses;\n- \u00b7 Maintaining an optimum level of sustenance capital spend;\n- \u00b7 Improving our environmental performance and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe are committed to improving cash flows from our base of high-quality, diversified assets, with only marginal levels of further capital investment and believe this can be achieved in the short- to medium-term from our digitalisation drive, continuing work to manage costs, as well as a focused review and optimisation of our portfolio. In the long term, we will enhance cash flows by ramping up the LCCP units in US and extracting more value from our oil and gas investments in Mozambique.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Considering the targeted US$2 billion proceeds from the asset sales, why does Sasol still need to go ahead with a rights issue?\n\nAs the Group operates in different businesses and geographies, the future cash generation and resultant debt levels could vary vastly in cases where different asset disposal options are decided on. Proceeds from assets sold in South Africa would require approval from the South African Reserve Bank to pay off US dollar denominated debt and therefore the matching of currency from proceeds to reduce debt has to be carefully considered. It is also not clear on the timing of asset disposals, given the current economic conditions.\n\nThe disposal of a share in our Base Chemicals portfolio in the US represents a significant step forward in delivering the asset disposal lever of the Company's comprehensive response plan announced on 17 March 2020. Proceeds from the disposal, combined with the progress in achieving short-term cash improvement measures, should make a meaningful and positive impact on Sasol's financial prospects, principally as a result of the intended use of disposal proceeds to settle debt with payment obligations within the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nThe Company will also pursue a rights issue of up to US$2 billion in the second half of financial year 2021 as the final step of the response plan. The rights issue should allow Sasol to operate sustainably within its covenant thresholds and deliver on its strategy going forward. The exact amount of the rights issue and its timing is subject to prevailing operating and market conditions as well as other initiatives, such as further disposals, that Sasol may implement consistent with its  strategic reset.\n\nThe planned asset disposals combined with such a rights issue and Future Sasol are expected to reset the debt structure of the Company at a lower level in order to make it more sustainable for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sasol has recorded significant impairments. What led to such big write-downs?\n\nThe impairments include R72,6 billion (US$4,2 billion) attributable to our Base Chemicals assets in US that have been classified as held for sale and R35,2 billion relating to our integrated South African value chain that have been significantly impacted by the decrease in crude oil prices, a further softening of global chemical prices and refining margins and lower market demand in a post-COVID-19 environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSasol has moved from investment grade to sub-investment grade during the second half of 2020. What plans are in place to restore Sasol's investment grade?\n\nConsistent with our long-term commitment to return to investment grade credit rating, we are engaging with ratings agencies regarding the progress on our comprehensive response plan. In the short term, we are constrained by a weak global macroeconomic environment in the oil and gas and chemicals sectors, as well as the sovereign ceiling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## When do you expect to resume dividend payments?\n\nDividend payments are an important part in the Group's capital allocation framework. However, given Sasol's current financial leverage and the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, the Board believes that it would be prudent to continue with the suspension of dividends. This will allow us to continue to protect our liquidity in the short-term and focus on reducing leverage in order to create a firm platform to execute our strategy and drive long-term shareholder returns. In addition, in accordance with the covenant amendment agreement with lenders, Sasol will not be in a position to declare a dividend for as long as net debt to EBITDA is above 3 times. We expect the balance sheet to regain flexibility following the implementation of our comprehensive response plan and will resume dividend payments when net debt to EBITDA is sustainably below 2 times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What does the resetting of Sasol's strategy mean for the Group going forward?\n\nSasol will be a reshaped and tactically focused business. We have a high quality, well diversified global portfolio with a range of strategically advantaged assets and value chain integration. We believe that our portfolio will be positioned to be sustainably profitable in a low oil price environment, ensuring our ability to deliver value to stakeholders in the long term.\n\nOur strategy is aimed at enhancing free cash flow, improving the sustainability of our operations and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nAs with all multinationals, our focus on sustainability has become more pronounced. Our updated strategy reinforces our commitment to greening our facilities in Secunda by introducing renewable energy and achieving our target of reducing GHG emissions in South Africa by at least 10% by 2030.",

        "page_content": "## OUR OPERATING CONTEXT\n\nAs an integrated chemical and energy company, our ability to create value is closely connected to the macroeconomic environments of the countries in which we operate, most notably South Africa where we generate more than 80% of our earnings. The external operating context impacts our profitability and business continuity, risk management and the decisions we make on our strategy. It also informs our thinking on material matters. Our ability to create value depends on a number of key economic drivers, our response to them as well as their impact on our stakeholders.\n\n## Global markets\n\nTrade tensions between United States and China as well as Brexit uncertainties contributed to global growth slowing to 2,9% in calendar 2019 (International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook 2020), the lowest growth since 2016.\n\nMore recently, the rapid spread of COVID-19 disrupted global trade and economic activity, confirming China's significant role in global supply chains and as a driver of global demand.\n\nAs the virus spread, lockdowns, supply chain disruptions and financial market dislocations led to a dramatic collapse in global economic activity.\n\nThe outlook remains highly uncertain. Ultimately, the virus's impact on global economic growth, and on the macroenvironment, will be driven by the speed with which it is contained, lockdowns are lifted, and measures are developed to address it. Aside from these, China/US trade tensions, the evolution of 'Brexit' and other geopolitical risks remain on the radar.\n\nCurrently, we expect the global and South African recessions to be the worst in recent history. The global economy is likely to contract by more than 3% in calendar 2020, with a recovery to around 4,5% growth in calendar 2021.\n\nSouth Africa is likely to face an even worse recession, with the economy expected to contract by around 7% in calendar 2020 before showing a modest recovery in calendar 2021. The expected recession combined with a potential weak recovery could have lasting impacts on efforts to sustainably alleviate high levels of unemployment, poverty, and inequality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rand/US$ exchange rate\n\nThe South African economy was in recession before COVID-19 spread, with lockdown measures exacerbating already acute socio-economic and structural pressures.\n\nWeakening growth prospects, high debt levels and electricity supply constraints contributed to the country being downgraded further into sub-investment territory.\n\nA combination of COVID-19 fears and domestic factors contributed to the average rand/US dollar exchange rate weakening to R15,69/US$ in 2020, the weakest level since 2016.\n\nThe exchange rate could recover some lost ground once COVID-19-related fears subside and investors become more willing to invest in riskier assets and emerging economies. Our outlook for 2021 currently sees the exchange rate ranging between R16,00 and R17,00/US$.\n\nAverage exchange rate (US$/Rand)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Where we operate\n\nTurnover\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lower oil prices\n\nOil prices gave way as demand evaporated and excess supply came onto market due to the failure of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reach a supply agreement at the beginning of March. With lower demand due to COVID-19 global travel restrictions, the risk of running out of physical storage capacity pushed the average Brent crude oil price to a low of US$19,02/bbl in April 2020.\n\nThe OPEC agreement to cut 9,7 MMb/d effective 1 May along with economic cuts by other non-OPEC producers including US and Canada, started the process to stabilise the oversupplied market.\n\nDated Brent crude oil prices averaged US$51,22/bbl in 2020 a 25% decrease from 2019 levels and a three-year low.\n\nGlobal consumption decreased by an estimated 5 million barrels per day (MMb/d) to 94,4 MMb/d in 2020 year - largely due to the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns that weakened economic activity, as well as road and air passenger transport.\n\nGiven a significant overhang of inventory in the market and uncertainty regarding demand, we forecast muted price increases. We expect oil prices to range between US$35/bbl and US$45/bbl in 2021.\n\nAverage Brent crude oil (US$/bbl)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Where we invest\n\nNon-current assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Down cycle in commodity chemical margins\n\nThe chemical industry, already in a down cycle, saw further contraction in demand for most commodity chemicals as a result of COVID-19. Ethane prices fell in the first six months of 2020 owing to ethane cracker startup delays and increased propane and butane competition. This was accentuated by the oil price decline in March. However, concerns over falling tight oil production and associated ethane supply from the Permian caused ethane prices to rise above 20US$c/pg in May 2020.\n\nThe average base chemicals basket decreased from US$830/ton in 2019 to US$681/ton in 2020 as the oil price crash reduced the cost of naphthabased chemicals production, reducing the cost advantage of ethane-based producers.\n\nThe lockdown in South Africa negatively impacted demand and feedstock supply as Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) operated at 75% capacity in the second half of 2020. The demand for solvents, particularly high purity alcohols due to virus-related applications, remains healthy.\n\nIncreased commodity chemicals supply as new Chinese capacity comes online combined with weak near-term demand could keep chemical prices low in the short term. Oil price volatility and the current COVID-19 pandemic could add further pressure on both prices and volumes.\n\nIn the short to medium term, US ethane prices are also expected to remain volatile, driven by lower ethane availability as US tight oil production falls and remains below pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional cracker capacity will be brought online in 2021, increasing ethane demand. Lower competition from alternate feedstocks and higher gas prices also place upward pressure on ethane prices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This exacerbated an already-weak oil price, which further deteriorated in April. Our gearing moved out of the target range, as did our ratio of net debt to EBITDA. Sasol's share price dropped to its lowest level in 20 years. Credit ratings, particularly in the oil and gas sector, came under pressure. Sasol's rating was reduced to sub-investment grade. This resulted in an increase in our borrowing costs.\n- \u00b7   Sasol and its partner in Natref, Total South Africa, decided to temporarily suspend production at Natref and cut back on production at Secunda Synfuels. The cut in production severely impacted our gross margins and revenue. We took advantage of the opportunity and accelerated maintenance work at both Synfuels and Natref to allow continuous operations in 2021. To respond the unprecedented oil price collapse and COVID-19 economic consequences, we announced a series of self-help measures for the short term (Refer to page 22).\n- \u00b7   Lower spending, as well as the passing of our recent interim and final dividend had a negative impact on almost all of the capitals. With many employees sacrificing part of their salaries to assist the Group in overcoming the challenges, morale and talent retention were negatively affected.\n- \u00b7   The reduced cash flows also led to some delays in our digitalisation programme, which we launched in 2018 to deliver enhanced safety, improved customer experience, increased efficiency and to create new value through innovation. COVID-19 did, however, trigger greater adoption of digital ways of working. The large-scale disruption of the pandemic also underscored the imperative to have a sustainable business that provides economic value as well as environmental and social value. Our approach to ESG matters affects Sasol's reputation, financial performance and sustainability. Finding the right balance will attract investor confidence and support, restore trust with stakeholders and secure our social licence to operate.\n- \u00b7   While lower ethane prices in the early part of the calendar year supported margins, this reversed in May and June as ethane prices increased to above 20 US$ cents per gallon.\n\nIn the current economic crisis, with COVID-19 and low oil prices placing significant pressure on our already stretched balance sheet, we understand that we can only deliver sustainable value by creating focus in the organisation, realism around targets and plans and pursuing delivery in terms of volumes, targets and promises to our stakeholders. We understand the urgency of doing so and have assembled a dedicated team to drive a comprehensive response plan to mitigate these macroeconomic factors. We have employed scenarios to develop targets, which are focused on cash conservation and efficiency improvements. To date, we have developed plans for ~80% of the targets for 2021.\n\nOur actions to address the operating context are:\n\n- \u00b7   Updating our strategy - in driving focus, we acknowledged that we needed to streamline what was previously a complex and wide portfolio and our updated strategy is now anchored on two businesses and makes clear portfolio choice to transition to a lower-carbon business.\n- \u00b7  Implementing Future Sasol to enhance cash flows and improve our global cost competitiveness position.\n- \u00b7   Conserving  cash of at least US$1 billion through EBITDA and capital savings in 2021. This is building off the just over US$1 billion cash conserved.\n- \u00b7  Secured proceeds of US$0,6 billion to 30 June 2020.\n- \u00b7   Hedging our exposure to oil, US dollar and ethane - oil hedges, targeting 80% of Synfuels' annual fuel production are currently in progress, US$5,4 billion of our US dollar exposure as at 30 June 2020 and 49% of our 2021 ethane exposure have been hedged.\n\nEconomies are expected to return to pre-COVID-19 activity levels within two to three years, with growing populations, a rise in the middle-class and increasing urbanisation likely to support growth in demand for energy and chemicals. However, positive climate change benefits, a potential increase in 'working from home' trends, further development of digitalisation and robotics and other efficiency gains are likely to have permanent effects on the long-term fuel and chemical demand outlooks. COVID-19-related experiences could accelerate some existing trends, implying that future demand needs to be met in a quicker, more sustainable and efficient way. These trends impact our strategy in several ways:\n\n- \u00b7   The pressure for cleaner energy could increase the demand for gas, if affordable, within the South African energy mix. However, the scale and timing of Sasol and third-party gas developments for the medium to long term may be impacted by lower economic activity.\n- \u00b7   While fuel (petrol, diesel and especially jet fuel), and chemical demand levels may remain depressed in the next year or two, we remain confident that there will be sufficient demand for these products to support our business into the future.\n- \u00b7   Changing consumer preferences are likely to impact chemical demand growth - products associated with sanitisation, computer manufacturing, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals could create increased demand for solvents and other chemicals that are supplied into these markets.\n\nOur updated strategy remains supported by the megatrends and is robust in a post-COVID-19 environment - managing the challenges that face our business in the short to medium term will remain difficult until COVID-19 is brought under control.",

These material matters are aligned with our risk business imperatives. Managing them effectively could support or hinder our ability to execute our strategy and remain competitive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Why this is important\n\n## Targets\n\n## What we have done about this\n\nTypically, our foundation businesses are strong cash generators. But the oil price slide, unprecedented decline in demand for our liquid fuels as well as increasing overheads and high variable costs put pressure on these assets. With a highly leveraged balance sheet, the Board focused on maximising cash flows so as to manage liquidity and ensure we had the cash to service our business needs. We evaluated all levers to generate more cash - including increasing volumes through stable and reliable operations; postponing discretionary capital spend without putting the safety and integrity of our operations at risk; reducing external spend; and optimal planning.\n\nWe worked to build a strong, safe culture, reduce risks and minimise the potential impact of any incidents. Our reduced cash flows and cost-containment drive led to some delays in our digitalisation programme, however COVID-19 triggered greater adoption of digital ways of working.\n\nThe disruption of COVID-19 underscored the imperative to have a sustainable business that provides economic as well as environmental and social value. Sasol's approach to ESG matters affects the Company's reputation, financial performance, and sustainability.\n\nIn October 2019, our Climate Change Report launched our transition framework for resilience. In 2020, we recognised the centrality of gas and renewables to sustain our operations. We developed a roadmap to achieve the 2030 target for our South African operations and embedded climate-change management in decision-making. Carbon taxes impact the viability of Sasol's business. For phase 1 of the Carbon Tax Act, our liability is between R800 million and R1 billion.\n\nFinding a balance between the need for economic development, job creation, energy security and GHG emission reductions remains crucial. Sasol's active role will reinforce our relevance, in turn, attracting investor confidence, restoring trust and retaining our licence to operate.\n\nThe loss of six lives in workplace incidents was tragic, impacting negatively on the Sasol community. A safe workplace is happier and more productive, where people are more motivated and engaged. We believe zero harm is indeed possible.\n\nFor this, we need to continuously strengthen our culture, with a focus on embedding the right behaviours. We need to ensure our leadership has the capability and capacity to enable a cultural transformation towards a diverse, inclusive, resilient and sustainable organisation. We want a culture that provides a stimulating environment where commitment supports employees' desire to achieve, enabling broader value creation. By asking employees to sacrifice part of their salaries to conserve cash, we impacted on staff morale and talent retention. Both are essential to build a Sasol that is fit-for-the-future.\n\nExpenditure to complete the LCCP strained Sasol's finances, evidenced by the high level of debt and the suspension of the dividend. As we approached the LCCP's cash inflection point, COVID-19 lockdowns disrupted economic activity and led to unprecedented market volatility. Oil prices collapsed. Demand for fuel products fell steeply, impacting earnings and cash flows. Gearing moved out of the target range, as did our ratio of net debt to EBITDA. Sasol's share price dropped to its lowest level in 20 years. Our credit rating reduced to sub-investment grade. We amended our borrowing covenants and our borrowing costs increased. To reduce our debt, we announced a robust series of self-help measures for the short term.\n\nRecent global events signalled a lower-for-longer oil price environment. We accelerated an update of our strategy and reset Sasol to be sustainably profitable at US$45/bbl. This will enable us to better withstand market volatility, earn our right to succeed and support overall value creation.\n\nIn 2019 we started to commission the first units of the LCCP. In 2020 we brought more units online. Full delivery and ramp-up of the LCCP and an increase in earnings towards run-rate expectations are critical in unlocking value. They are an essential enabler of our strategy, in particular by strengthening our specialty chemicals portfolio and transforming Sasol's earnings profile and diversifying our risk.\n\nOur asset disposal programme aims to ensure that our capital is invested effectively. In 2020 we expanded the programme's scope as we updated the strategy to focus on two distinct businesses. We made choices to stop all oil growth activities in West Africa and resize the upstream portfolio to focus on gas.\n\n- \u00b7  Zero harm at all our operations. \u00b7   Secunda Synfuels Operations production of between 7,7 7,8 million tons.\n- \u00b7  Cash savings of US$1 billion in 2020 and a further US$1 billion planned in 2021.\n- \u00b7  30% global energy efficiency improvement by 2030, off a 2005 baseline.\n- \u00b7  Maintain 302 million tons CO 2 e based on a five year carbon budget by end of calendar year 2020.\n- \u00b7  Reduce by 2030 the absolute GHG emissions from our South African operations by at least 10% off our 2017 baseline.\n\n\u00b7  Zero harm. \u00b7  RCR of 0,27 in 2020.\n\n- \u00b7  Improved culture.\n- \u00b7  Long-term gearing 30%. \u00b7  Long-term net debt/EBITDA 1,5x.\n- \u00b7  To return to investment grade credit rating.\n- \u00b7  At least US$2 billion in proceeds from asset disposals by end of financial year 2021 and pursuing a rights issue of up to US$2 billion in the second half of financial year 2021.\n- \u00b7  LCCP total cost of US$12,8 billion. \u00b7  Proceeds from asset disposals exceeding US$2 billion.\n- \u00b7  Took decisive action to make zero harm a reality by pursuing with greater vigour our programme to prevent high-severity injuries and fatalities.\n- \u00b7  Brought forward to May 2020 the routine Secunda Synfuels' maintenance shutdown scheduled for September 2020, enabling continuous production in 2021.\n- \u00b7  Brought forward routine maintenance work at Natref, after halting production in April.

They encompass both financial and non-financial indicators as well as quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\n## Recordable Case Rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Recordable Case Rate (RCR) has regressed slightly from 0,26 to 0,27 over the 12 month reporting period. There were six tragic fatalities in the Group. Each incident undergoes thorough investigation to determine the root cause and we apply learning to reinforce safe behaviours.\n\n## Total energy used\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAchieved improvements of only 14,3% for our operations towards our energy efficiency target of 30% improvement by 2030. Unstable operations associated with COVID-19 and the low oil price adversely affected our energy requirements and consequently our performance.\n\n## Total waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSasol's approach to waste management has undergone significant changes over the years in response to changing legislation and industry practices. The total waste generated decreased by 7% from 2019. Hazardous waste generation increased from 328 kt in 2019 to 333 kt in 2020. We generated 195 kt of non-hazardous waste, down from 237 kt in 2019.\n\nOur GHG intensity (tons CO 2 e per ton of production - meant for external sale) increased to 3,91 in 2020 from 3,61 in 2019.\n\nOur global water demand grew by about 6% in the past year due to the increase in water demand from new production assets in the US. Total water use increased from 134,2 million m 3 in 2019 to 142,6 million m 3 in 2020. The new water targets (2021 - 2025) will be 'context-based' and will focus on reducing the absolute volume of water used for production aligned with the 2015 baseline, without sacrificing production.\n\n## GHG intensity\n\n## B-BBEE status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continued to deliver on our commitments towards sustainable transformation and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) despite current macroeconomic challenges.\n\n## Total water use\n\nGrowing and developing our people\n\nFinancial risk and balance sheet management\n\n## Bursaries granted\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continued awarding bursaries to top performing undergraduate and postgraduate students globally to secure and develop a critical talent pipeline of the future. During 2020, our bursary pool decreased from 497 in 2019 to 455. Our investment in the bursary scheme decreased marginally to R60,2 million.\n\n*Excludes Sasol Global Foundation bursaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's ROIC for 2020 was significantly impacted by the impairment of assets across most of our businesses. ROIC, excluding impairments improves to 1,3%. The decrease from prior year is mainly due to the lower Brent crude oil and product prices and the impact of COVID-19 on the macroeconomic environment. Our strategic reset is aimed at improving our ROIC to above WACC returns.\n\n- ^ Excludes the ramp-up of the North American operations (LCCP)\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA +\n\nYear\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased due to the lower Brent crude oil and product prices and the economic consequences of COVID-19 impacting gross margin partially offset by a weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate and higher sales volumes from the LCCP units reaching beneficial operation.\n\n- +   2019 have been restated to include all unrealised translation gains and losses and all realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities. Refer to the inside back cover (IBC) for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n## Gender diversity (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2020, one of our key priorities was to improve female representation across all layers of the organisation particularly senior leadership layers. To this end, female representation at Vice President and Senior Vice President layer increased by 11. We continued with the execution of our diversity-10-point-plan which provides a set of qualitative measures designed to enable the achievement of our diversity objectives, including the recruitment, development and retention of candidates from underrepresented groups as well as measures to enhance gender equity in South Africa.\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Quality-based earnings growth % (in US$ real terms - 2017 baseline)\n\nYear\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBIT was severely impacted by the impairments of R111,6 billion, the low Brent crude oil and product prices, the translation impact of the weaker closing exchange rates, losses on our derivative and hedging activities and the economic consequences of COVID-19. Within a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Group successfully delivered on its comprehensive response plan targets.\n\n## Core headline earnings per share (CHEPS) *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur core HEPS* decreased mainly as a result of the impact of the lower Brent crude oil and product prices and the impact of COVID-19 on sales volumes partially offset by the weaker exchange rates and a strong cost performance.\n\n- *   2019 has been restated to include all unrealised translation gains and losses and all realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivative and hedging activities. Refer IBC for definition of Core HEPS.\n\n## Net debt-to-EBITDA\n\nYear\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5,0\n\nNet debt: EBITDA ratio at 30 June 2020 of 4,3 times per the revolving credit facility and US dollar term loan covenant definition due to a weaker rand/US dollar closing exchange rate and lower adjusted EBITDA. To create flexibility in the balance sheet during our peak gearing period we have successfully engaged with our lenders to waiver our covenants as at 30 June 2020 and to lift our covenants from 3,0 times to 4,0 times of net debt: EBITDA at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Cash available from operating activities\n\nYear\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCash available from operating activities decreased from R43,4 billion in 2019 to R30,6 billion in 2020. This is mainly due to lower Brent crude oil and product prices, the impact of COVID-19 on our sales volumes, higher finance costs and lower dividends received from our equity accounted investments. This was offset by the weaker exchange rate and a strong working capital and cost performance.",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGICALLY MANAGING OUR GROUP TOP RISKS\n\nIn pursuing our goals towards creating, preserving and realising value for our stakeholders, within our enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, we aim to proactively manage risk and opportunities in a dynamic operating context. In 2019 and 2020 we faced challenges and risks associated with various events that significantly impacted our business, including COVID-19 and heightened macroeconomic volatility. We also incurred higher costs to complete the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP); had our credit ratings downgraded; saw our risk appetite metrics move outside tolerance levels; and are currently facing balance sheet and liquidity pressures amid business sustainability concerns.\n\nOur mature ERM framework and actions, while being continually tested, are proving invaluable in countering the unprecedented risks facing Sasol. We are implementing Board-led responses to mitigate risks and minimise the short- to medium-term impacts on our business. We have reset our strategy to position for a more resilient Future Sasol, which is able to respond to longer-term sustainability risks.\n\nWe continue to focus our risk management process on ensuring the adequacy, appropriateness and effectiveness of our key responses to mitigate potential significant business impacts, and to ensure delivery on our committed targets.\n\n## Our enterprise risk management (ERM) process\n\nOur Group top risks are identified in consideration of our strategy, and ever-changing internal and external operating context. We continue to ensure that we the strengthen the link between our strategy and Group top risks by applying our ERM process in the context of our key business imperatives, which provide the anchor for our Group top risks.\n\n## TOP RISKS INFORMED BY:\n\nStrategy, internal and external operating context, and key business imperatives\n\n## KEY BUSINESS IMPERATIVES:\n\nBusiness sustainability and earnings growth, long-term business viability, employee value proposition and stakeholder impact\n\n## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\n## Identifying and reviewing our top risks\n\nOur key business imperatives, aligned with our strategy, guide and inform our top risks. We regularly review our top risks with due consideration to our dynamic and changing internal and external operating context. We benchmark our top risks against available global, industry and peer company risk views.\n\n## Reporting on our top risks\n\nWe have regular reporting assurance reports to mandated governance and oversight structures. We communicate and report significant risks to external stakeholders in accordance with statutory and non-statutory requirements.\n\n## Assessing, managing and responding to our top risks\n\nWe assess and understand the potential impact of our top risks through application of a materiality lens and manage the impact on our defined Group risk appetite and tolerance levels. We understand our capability to respond to our top risks by identifying and regularly reviewing the appropriateness and efficacy of our key responses.\n\n## Risk management governance and assurance\n\nWe have mandated governance and oversight structures at Board and management level, with defined risk combined assurance management principles, obtain and provide internal, external, management and/or independent assurance on key responses on our risk management processes.\n\nApplying our ERM process to identify, assess, manage, govern, assure and report on our top risks and respond to heightened risks being faced in the short, medium and long term\n\n## Managing our Group risk appetite and tolerance\n\nTo optimise financial returns and commitments to our stakeholders we proactively manage risks within set Group risk appetite and risk tolerance levels. We define risk appetite as the extent and type of risk we are willing to take in order to meet our strategic objectives. We define risk tolerance as the level of uncertainty we are prepared to accept and can cope with. It identifies the maximum boundary, beyond which we are unwilling to operate. In the short-to-medium term we anticipate that we will continue to operate with risk appetite metrics outside tolerance levels. We are actively managing exposures related to debt covenant breaches and implementing key responses aimed at deleveraging the balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our risk appetite and tolerance metrics:\n\n- \u00b7  Return on invested capital\n- \u00b7  Earnings growth\n- \u00b7  Net debt-to-EBITDA\n- \u00b7  Gearing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Review of risk appetite and tolerance metrics considers the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Changes in business conditions\n- \u00b7  Changes to economic environment\n- \u00b7   Evolving Group strategic priorities and portfolio changes\n- \u00b7  Credible risk scenarios\n- \u00b7  Changing competitive conditions\n\n## Governance and oversight of risk management\n\nThe Board and management's risk, assurance and reporting responsibilities are informed by our Risk Policy, Board Charter, governance framework and King IV\u2122 requirements. In this year, we further enhanced the governance and oversight roles through reviewing and updating the Board and management Committees' terms of reference and extending risk reporting to all relevant Committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board is responsible for the strategic direction and control of the Group. It retains overall accountability for the governance of risk. The Board Committees are appropriately mandated to assist the Board in giving effect to its accountability. The Board receives regular updates on the significant risk areas facing the Group and plays a pivotal role in ensuring appropriate responses to the top risks and current heightened risks facing Sasol. The Board has also appointed independent advisors to assist with obtaining assurance on select key responses and management actions related to the heightened short-to-medium term financial and operational risks facing the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility to implement and execute effective risk management to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Group Executive Committee (GEC).\n\nExecutive Vice Presidents (EVPs) as members of the GEC are accountable for management of risks within their areas of responsibility, with delegated responsibility and ownership to their respective entities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur risk management process is iterative and applied in a dynamic operating context",

It ensures that Sasol capitalises on its opportunities as an ethical, decisive and responsible corporate citizen and embraces and promotes value-creating governance through a deliberate and structured approach.\n\n## Board agenda:\n\nBoard meetings take place at least quarterly, and more regularly as needed. For the reporting period, the Board held its quarterly meetings, and an additional 12 special meetings.\n\nThe Board uses its meetings to discharge its governance and regulatory responsibilities. Meeting agendas are formal, follow a tailored work-plan agreed ahead of each meeting by the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company Secretary, with input from Board Committee Chairmen as appropriate. Meeting agendas comprise management reports on operational and financial performance as well as matters of strategy, risk and opportunity, Group governance, compliance and legal matters, and matters otherwise reserved for Board decision-making.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that it has fulfilled its responsibilities in accordance with its Board Charter for the reporting period.\n\n## Board Charter\n\nThe Board Charter (the Charter) provides for the roles, responsibilities, functions and powers of the Board, individual directors and the officials and executives of Sasol. The Charter further addresses the powers delegated to various Board Committees and the relevant principles of the Group's limits\n\nand delegations of authority and matters reserved for final decision-making or pre-approval by the Board. The Charter describes the policies and practices of the Board in respect of matters such as corporate governance, trading by Directors in the securities of the Company, declarations and conflicts of interest , Board meeting documentation and procedures, composition of the Board and the nomination, appointment, induction, training and evaluation of Directors and members of Board Committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## + Attendance record\n\n- \u00b7S Nkosi 88% ^ *\n- \u00b7S Westwell 94% #*\n- \u00b7MJ Cuambe 94% *\n- ^ Illness\n- # Family bereavement\n- *  Special Board meetings, other than quarterly meetings\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board delegates certain responsibilities to well-structured Board Committees without abdicating accountability. The delegation is formal in terms of Board-approved Terms of Reference for each Committee underpinned by the Memorandum of Incorporation and the Board Charter. The Board appoints the members for the skills required to effectively provide strategic direction to the Sasol Group, as well as monitor and oversee the activities of the Group. The Board receives reports and minutes of each Committee meeting.\n\nThe Board has established a framework for the delegation of authority to the President and Chief Executive Officer, which also sets out the material decisions in respect of which it has reserved the decision-making authority as the Board of the ultimate holding Company of the Group. The composition, mandate and performance of the various Board Committees are reviewed at least annually, and contribute to the effective discharge of the Board's duties and responsibilities to grow and protect value for our stakeholders.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Board formed two new Sub-Committees, the Gearing Sub-Committee and a SubCommittee to consider Non-Binding Offers, and to deal with balance sheet management and asset disposals respectively.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nMs MML Mokoka was appointed as the Company Secretary of Sasol Limited effective 1 November 2019. The decision to appoint or remove the Company Secretary is a Board decision. The Board was satisfied that Ms Mokoka holds the requisite knowledge and experience to fulfil the duties of Company Secretary.\n\nThe Company Secretary provides a central source of guidance and support to the Board and within the Company on matters of good governance and changes in legislation. The Board is aware of the duties of the Company Secretary and empowers her to fulfil those duties. As gatekeeper of good governance, the Company Secretary maintains an arm's length relationship with the Board and its Directors as far as is reasonably possible.\n\n- \u00b7GMB Kennealy 94% *\n- \u00b7NNA Matyumza 94 % *\n- \u00b7ZM Mkhize 94% *\n\n## Governance framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* The Board, at its meeting on 22 May 2020, resolved to dissolve the Digital, Information Management and Hedging Committee (DIMH) and to allocate the DIMH's financial market risk management and hedging mandate to the Audit Committee, and the DIMH's digital and information management mandate to the Capital Investment Committee.\n\n## Diversity\n\nEffective oversight and decision-making require a range of perspectives. The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board, and is committed to ensuring a diverse and inclusive culture at Board level where Directors believe that their views are heard and their concerns are attended to free from bias, discrimination and harassment.\n\nRace, age and gender diversity, underpinned by the relevant skills as well as business, geographic and professional experience and background, enhance the composition of a truly diverse Board. All Board appointments are made on merit, having due regard for the benefits of diversity in its widest sense. In 2019 the Board set a target of 40% representation of women by 30 June 2022. This target was met early in 2020, with six women serving on the Board (40%), three of whom are Black. During May 2020, the Board confirmed its 2019 race-diversity target of a minimum representation of 50% Black Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is for this reason that the Board extended the tenure of the Chairman of the Audit Committee following the review and confirmation of independence. The Board has determined that Directors may serve on the Board for up to nine years, extendable annually up to a maximum of 12 years.\n\nDr MSV Gantsho and Mr MJN Njeke retired from the Board, as Chairman and Lead Independent Director respectively, following Sasol's Annual General Meeting held on 27 November 2019. Mr SA Nkosi, who joined the Board during May 2019 as Independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman-designate, assumed the Board Chairmanship on 27 November 2019. The Board elected Mr S Westwell, who has served the Board since 2012, as Lead Independent Director.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TENURE\n\nTenure 9+ years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tenure 5 - 9 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTenure less than 5 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage tenure\n\n## 4,75 years\n\nAverage age of Board members\n\n59 years\n\n## Development, evaluation and assessment of independence\n\nOngoing training and development are an important contributor to an effective Board. The development of industry and group knowledge is a continuous process and Directors are briefed on, among others, information relevant to the business undertakings of the Group, including on matters specific to the sectors in which it conducts business, legal developments and changes in the risk and general business environment, as well as Directors' duties and responsibilities, on an on-going basis.\n\nNewly appointed Directors are apprised of Sasol's business and their duties and responsibilities through a structured induction programme which includes site visits, meetings with management and induction material on topics related to, among others, governance and our business. The Board, its Committees as well as any Director, are entitled to seek independent professional advice concerning the Company's affairs and to gain access to any information they may require in discharging their duties as Directors.\n\nDuring 2020 the Board had an opportunity for an internally facilitated evaluation workshop, aimed at reflection and discussion by the Board of its performance and that of its Committees, its members and Chair, as well the Company Secretary. The process focused on themes related to general Board governance, Board composition, Board culture and meeting dynamics, as well as relevant information and Board materials. In addition, the Board received a detailed update on the JSE Listing Requirements as part of its annual development programme.\n\nThe Board and its Nomination and Governance Committee specifically consider the independence of Directors and their other commitments when they are first appointed, as well as annually, or at any other time when a Director's circumstances change and warrant re-evaluation. This is done to determine whether a Director has sufficient time to discharge his or her duties effectively and is free from conflicts that cannot be managed satisfactorily. The Board was satisfied that all its Independent Non-Executive Directors met its independence criteria for the 2020 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SKILLS/EXPERIENCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNumber of Board members",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear stakeholder\n\nThis report highlights key components of Sasol's Remuneration Policy which we believe are aligned with the Group's strategy. It illustrates how the policy translated into reward outcomes in 2020 and where the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) had to use its discretion to deviate from the policy. The Committee reviews the policy annually to ensure that it remains relevant and continuously enables the attraction, motivation and retention of skilled resources while maintaining a balance with the interests of our many stakeholders.\n\nIn the past two years, I have engaged with a number of interested parties on Sasol's Remuneration Policy and its implementation. This constructive dialogue has informed many decisions on remuneration. Some of these decisions were in the process of being implemented when the business faced additional challenges in the form of extreme market volatility as COVID-19 spread across the world. As Sasol started to feel the impact of high levels of debt related to the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) in United States (US), it had to make many difficult decisions and had to do so swiftly. With no one able to forecast exactly how long it will take for the world to recover from the pandemic, which together with the sharp decrease in the Brent crude oil price, has had a significantly negative impact on Sasol in the last quarter specifically, we reconsidered our Remuneration Policy and reset it where appropriate.\n\n## Feedback on the Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report\n\nAt our last Annual General Meeting (AGM), support for the Remuneration Policy increased from 78,53% to 83,37%. However, the Committee is disappointed that only 71,65% of shareholder votes were in favour of the 2019 Implementation Report. As we did not meet the 75% threshold of support, we embarked on a virtual roadshow to understand dissenting investors' concerns. This was so that we could understand the reasons for votes against the Implementation Report, explain the context for the decisions that were taken, and ensure in the planning for the next year that we thoroughly consider the feedback from our investors to improve the level of support from our shareholders.\n\n## Non-binding advisory votes on the Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following table categorises shareholder concerns in broad themes as well as our responses to these concerns both for the year under review as well as the next financial year:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Shareholder concerns                                                                                                                         | Our responses in 2020 and 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Insufficient weighting on environmental targets and the  exclusion of emission reduction targets from our incentive  plans                   | 2021:  We will increase the weighting of environmental targets to  20% of the STI scorecard  Measures that directly relate to the reduction of carbon emissions  over the next few years will be included in the STI and LTI plans                                                                                                               |\n| The inclusion of core headline earnings rather than a measure  over which management has more direct control                                 | 2020:  The weighting attached to this target was reduced 2021:  This target will be removed from the STI scorecard                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| The weightings attached to the return on invested capital  (ROIC) and the project delivery targets were too low                              | 2020:  The weightings for both targets were increased 2021:  The weighting attached to ROIC will be further increased                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| The threshold for relative total shareholder return (TSR) at  the 40th percentile should be increased to the median of the  comparator group | 2020/21:  The threshold for vesting to start will be the median TSR  of the comparator group vs Sasol's TSR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The peer group used for remuneration benchmarking is no  longer relevant                                                                     | 2021:  The peer group to be reviewed to include more South African  mining companies and smaller energy and chemical companies  from Europe and US                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Insufficient details provided regarding the setting of the cost  reduction and volumes targets and the achievement thereof                   | 2020:  The volumes target was reviewed to only include volumes  from key production facilities and the cost reduction target was  reviewed - both should aid the disclosure of performance against  these targets 2021:  Volumes produced will be changed to sales volumes and the  cost reduction targets are aligned with the commitments made |\n\nOur incentive plans for 2020 includes environmental targets relating to energy efficiency and a measure for fires, explosions and releases (FERs).\n\nOur Climate Change roadmap published in August 2020 will inform the inclusion of more environmental targets in our short-term and long-term incentive plans. We take seriously our responsibility to ensure safe and profitable operations with a reduced impact on the environment. Indeed, reducing our carbon footprint is a key reason for the revision of the Group's strategy in the year.\n\nWe were encouraged by feedback that shareholders appreciated the detailed disclosures in our Remuneration Report, and that they supported the Board's decision to not pay short-term incentives to senior and executive management in respect of 2019 due to the cost and schedule overruns at the LCCP. In addition, from our recent engagements we gathered support for better alignment between our incentive plan targets and the Group's key priorities for 2021.\n\n## The impact of business performance on remuneration decisions\n\nThe 2020 year commenced with the investigation into the overruns at the LCCP, which resulted in an almost three-month delay in the release of our 2019 financial results. The Board appointed Mr Fleetwood Grobler as the new President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Vuyo Kahla as an Executive Director, Mr Marius Brand as Executive Vice President (EVP) for Group Technology and Mr Brad Griffith as EVP for the Chemicals Business.\n\nIn October 2019, Mr Bongani Nqwababa and Mr Stephen Cornell, then Joint President and CEOs, agreed to an amicable mutual separation with the company. Effective 31 October 2019, Mr Nqwababa and Mr Cornell stepped down as Joint CEOs, and as Executive Directors of Sasol and its subsidiaries. As announced on 28 October 2019, the Board has identified neither misconduct nor incompetence on the part of the Joint CEOs. The Board mandated the Committee to agree on the separation terms for these two executives details of which are disclosed in this report.\n\nThe Committee ensured that the agreed separation packages were in line with market practice for executive separations. Both executives were placed on garden leave during the contractual six months' notice period and we granted an additional two months' employment on full salary to Mr Cornell to accommodate his school-going children before their repatriation to US. We agreed a separation package equal to approximately 12 months' salary for Mr Cornell and Mr Nqwababa respectively.\n\nAs the collapse in oil prices and weak economic activity due to the spread of COVID-19 exacerbated Sasol's stretched balance sheet, our new President and CEO acted swiftly to put in place a comprehensive response plan to stabilise the business. With employee-related costs making up approximately 50% of our cash fixed costs, we needed to make difficult remuneration-related decisions as part of the self-help measures to manage balance sheet challenges.\n\nIn April 2020, the Board approved the following measures as part of a comprehensive response plan:\n\n- \u00b7 no short-term incentives for 2020, despite the fact that some of the targets had been met in respect of the targets set for 2020;\n- \u00b7 immediate termination of all monetary recognition plans and employee support programmes;\n- \u00b7 no salary increases for employees outside of collective bargaining units in October 2020;\n- \u00b7 a headcount freeze on all permanent positions and a review of all non-permanent positions;\n- \u00b7 a salary sacrifice of between 10% and 24% for 6 900 of our employees effective 1 May 2020 for a period of up to eight months which was suspended on 4 August due to the Company's improved liquidity position; and\n- \u00b7 the suspension of the employer's contribution towards retirement funds for employees falling outside the collective bargaining structures, for a period up to eight months (subject to rule amendments being approved and this being a feasible lever in countries where we have operations). Following a review on 4 August 2020, the employer retirement fund contribution was reinstated due to the Company's improved liquidity position.",

        "page_content": "## Governance and rewards\n\n## Report of the Remuneration Committee (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board also agreed to a fee sacrifice of 20% on the NED Board and Committee fees for the duration of the employee sacrifice.\n\nThese decisions were not taken lightly, particularly as 4 000 of our senior employees had not received a short-term incentive the previous year despite the fact that many targets had been met, as well as the diminished value of long-term incentives. The Committee is grateful for the united support of employees during this extraordinarily challenging period and is concerned about the potential negative effect that these extreme measures could have on the retention of key employees. As a result, we are considering retention measures to prevent a potential exodus of scarce and critical skills.\n\nAligned with market practice, the Committee further recommended to the Board a differentiated approach to minimum shareholding requirements for the President and CEO, Chief Financial Officer and other Executive Directors. The annual LTI award to members of the Group Executive Committee GEC was postponed from the ordinary period following shortly after the disclosure of the Annual Financial Statements, to March 2020. The Committee wanted to ensure that all matters addressed in the Board review were closed out before the annual LTI awards were made. The vesting of the entire award will be subject to performance and time vesting conditions.\n\nThe short-term actions to ensure Sasol's survival in 2020 are clearly not sustainable for the long term. As a result, the President and CEO announced a strategic reset and appointed a new leadership team to enable more focused portfolios, reducing the GEC by 25%. The revised strategy and new operating model will allow for a streamlined, more focused and efficient organisation that is sustainably profitable at oil prices of US$45/barrel and is able to withstand shock events. This will also have an impact on the workforce.\n\n## 2021 focus\n\nOver the next year, we will focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewing our Remuneration Policy given the impact of the macroeconomic challenges on reward practices globally. This includes simplification of the short-term incentive plan design and the inclusion of incentive targets to support efforts to strengthen the financial situation, our pursuit of zero harm and the climate change roadmap.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the long-term incentive plan design and the inclusion of environmental targets.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the combination of LTI instruments to include restricted share units (RSUs).\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the minimum shareholding requirements for executives.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the peer group we use for benchmarking purposes.\n\n## Future considerations\n\nGlobally, there is an increased focus on pay gap reporting as many consider this to be a measure that promotes a fairer and more equal society. Many countries have made the disclosure of pay gaps and CEO pay ratios obligatory. The Committee has approved a methodology to track internal pay equity. Tracking pay ratios together with our commitment to ensuring at least a living wage to our employees, as well as many of our other human resources policies, form part of our commitment to social justice.\n\n## Use of consultants\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee appointed Alvarez & Marsal Taxand UK LLP (A&M) as independent external advisors, the previous advisors to the Committee were AON. A&M is a UK-based firm that is a signatory to the UK Remuneration Consultants' Code of Conduct, that provides the Committee with input on Remuneration Policy, advice on global trends and assists in decision-making on proposals made by management. The Committee was comfortable with the advisors' independence over the past year.\n\n## In closing\n\nThe Committee is committed to ensuring that Sasol's Remuneration Policy and the implementation thereof is fair and responsible. There is no doubt that in the new year all of us will need to reset our expectations and look at reward-related matters in a different way. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all our shareholders for your support, and trust that you will endorse our Remuneration Policy and Implementation Report at the next AGM.\n\nMpho Nkeli\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee 12 August 2020\n\nThis first part of the report describes the roles and responsibilities of management at Sasol and provides an overview of Sasol's Remuneration Philosophy and Policy, as well as remuneration elements.\n\nFor clarity, the following terms are used for reporting purposes:\n\n| Role                           | President and  CEO                                                        | GEC - CFO,  other Directors  and Prescribed  Officers                                                              | Senior Vice President (SVP) -  Group leadership                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Vice President (VP) -  leadership                                                                                                                                                                                     | Senior management                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description                    | Enterprise-wide  accountability  for the Group,  reporting to the  Board. | The GEC has  the ultimate  authority within  the organisation  to set the  strategy and  direction for the  Group. | SVPs have global or end- to-end responsibility for an  operating model entity or  Group function.

In all sectors our minimum wage is higher than what is generally considered a living wage in the geography or location.\n- \u00b7 The mix and flexibility of our remuneration options depend on the type of positions in our organisational structure as well as geographical practices.\n- \u00b7 Appropriate approval processes are in place to prevent conflicts of interest and to mitigate any risks that may unintentionally result from our remuneration programmes.\n- \u00b7 The Committee is empowered to intervene in exceptional circumstances when formulaic outcomes appear to be inappropriate and/or not aligned with business performance.\n- \u00b7 No form of unfair discrimination will be tolerated, and salary differentials are substantiated through defensible principles included in our Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nOur Remuneration Policy is a crucial enabler of Sasol's strategy. The objectives of our policy are sustainable high performance based on a values-driven organisational culture and aligning behaviour with the Company's risk management framework. The policy is designed in such a way that it strives to provide competitive, market-aligned pay while balancing the need for cost containment. Additionally, the policy aligns top management's interests with stakeholders' by promoting and measuring performance that drives long-term growth and sustainable value creation.\n\n## Remuneration Committee governance\n\nSasol complies with the relevant remuneration governance codes and statutes that apply in the various jurisdictions within which it operates. We apply recommended practices stated under Principle 14 of the King IV Code\u2122. The Committee is appointed by the Board to assist in ensuring that the Group remunerates its employees fairly, responsibly and transparently by implementing affordable, competitive and fair reward practices to promote the achievement of strategic objectives and positive outcomes in the short-, medium- and long-term. A copy of the Committee's Terms of Reference as well as the Remuneration Policy is available on the Group's website.\n\nThe President and CEO, the EVP: Human Resources and Corporate Affairs and the Vice President: Global Rewards attend meetings of the Committee by invitation. Members of the Group Executive Committee (GEC) recuse themselves when their own remuneration is discussed. The Committee is supported by Mr David Tuch, A&M.\n\nThe President and CEO tables the performance outcomes of all Prescribed Officers to the Committee to inform the award and vesting of annual increases and incentives. The Chairman of the Board tables the performance outcomes and proposed rewards for the Executive Directors at the Committee which recommends it to the Board.\n\nThe Committee has used its discretion twice in the past year: to not award short-term incentives despite some of the targets being met, and the adjustment, for reasons of COVID-19, of the production volumes achievement in the long-term incentive vesting percentage for those LTIs that will vest in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Governance and rewards\n\n## Report of the Remuneration Committee (continued)\n\n## Enabling the achievement of key strategic priorities\n\nOur Remuneration Policy sets the foundation for the development of fixed salary, variable pay plans and benefit structures that address our talent needs and enables the achievement of our strategy. Through our variable pay plans, we drive a high-performance culture where employees are encouraged to achieve targets set at an individual, Operating Model Entity (OME) and Group level. The Committee annually reviews the targets set for our short-term incentives (STIs) and long-term incentives (LTIs) to ensure that these are relevant and aligned with the business priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the remuneration elements and strategic intent of each component.\n\n## Fixed pay Policy and strategic intent\n\nBasic salary or Total Guaranteed Package (TGP) depending on the location.\n\nBroad pay bands set with reference to location and sector median benchmarks that reflect the complexity and scale of our business to ensure that we attract and retain the talent required for successful operations.\n\nThe Committee approves the cost of annual increases and considers market and economic data as well as affordability when making this decision. Mandates are provided for salary increase negotiations with recognised trade unions.\n\n## Strategic intent:\n\n- \u00b7 Attraction and retention of key employees\n- \u00b7 Internal equity and external competitiveness\n- \u00b7 Recognition of competence and individual performance\n\n## Fixed pay - Application\n\n## Outcomes 2020\n\nEmployees in countries other than South Africa and employees in the South African bargaining sectors are paid a base salary rather than a TGP.\n\nIn South Africa, the minimum wage paid to our employees in the different sectors is compared with the living wage for a family as provided by Trading Economics to ensure that we pay a living wage to our employees.\n\nSalaries are paid monthly to all employees except for employees in United States and Canada who receive salary payments on a bi-weekly basis in line with local market practice.\n\nEmployees who are promoted are considered for salary adjustments where justified.\n\nPerformance aligned annual increases are processed for employees outside the collective bargaining sectors with effect from 1 October. Across the board increases for other employees are implemented with effect from 1 July.\n\nAn increased cost of 5,3% was approved for South African employees falling outside of the bargaining units and implemented on 1 October 2019.\n\nThe total cost of increases for members of the Group Executive Committee was also within this approved cost.\n\nFor our international jurisdictions, increases were aligned with the local market conditions and closely aligned with the forecast market movement.\n\nNo annual increases will be awarded in 2021 to employees falling outside the bargaining units.\n\n6 900 employees were asked to take a salary sacrifice effective 1 May 2020 for up to eight months; the sacrifice varied between 10% and 24% depending on the role category. This sacrifice has contributed significantly to our cash conservation efforts resulting in the suspension on 4 August 2020 due to the Company's improved liquidity position.\n\n## Benefits and allowances Policy and strategic intent\n\nBenefits include, but are not limited to, membership of a retirement plan, healthcare and risk cover to which contributions are made by both the Company and the employee.\n\nAllowances are paid in terms of statutory compliance or as is applicable in a sector/jurisdiction.\n\nA number of special allowances including, inter alia housing, cost of living, home leave and child education are included in the Group's expatriate policy.\n\n## Strategic intent:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance with legislation\n- \u00b7 Negotiated and contractual agreements\n- \u00b7 Strengthening of the employee value proposition\n\n## Short-term incentive (STI) Policy\n\n## Short-term incentive (STI) Application\n\n## Outcomes 2020\n\nA single structure is applied globally and paid annually in September after Committee approval. Most mining employees earn a production bonus which is accrued bi-weekly, linked to safely produce against mining targets.\n\nTarget incentives align with market median.\n\nThe STI structure consists of Group, entity, and individual performance targets set in advance of every financial year.\n\nThe Committee can exercise its discretion to vary incentive outcomes as deemed appropriate and based on affordability.\n\nGroup, entity and individual performance targets are reviewed annually to ensure relevance, continuous improvement and alignment with the Group's strategic objectives which include safe, sustainable performance.\n\nSustainability is a key performance objective and measured at Group and entity levels. In addition to the Group targets, the following objectives are included in entity and individual STI scorecards as applicable: safe transportation of hazardous chemicals, occupational health measures, carbon emissions, and leaks or spills of hazardous materials. These measures balance safety, environmental sustainability and operational performance criteria.\n\nIndividual targets are agreed in the annual individual performance contracts, and performance against objectives is assessed bi-annually.\n\nRefer to pages 74 to 75 for detailed targets.\n\nAs part of the self-help measures announced in March 2020, a decision was supported not to pay short-term incentives to any employee for 2020, despite performance targets being achieved on Group, entity and individual level. This decision has reduced the cash fixed costs for the Group by approximately R2,5 billion.\n\n## Benefits and allowances - Application\n\n## Outcomes 2020\n\nBenefits are offered on retirement for reasons of sickness, disability or death. The beneficiaries of employees who pass away while in service receive an additional insurance cover the quantum depends on the retirement plan of which they were a member during service.\n\nAllowances are linked to roles within specific locations and are paid together with salaries. Expatriate allowances and benefits are offered to protect quality of life in the host country.\n\nSasol utilises different options to provide healthcare to employees and their families by means of medical insurance and/or public health plans, as well as additional insurance in countries where appropriate and marketrelated.\n\nAll employees have healthcare cover in the event that they are infected by COVID-19.\n\nSpecial leave categories were introduced in 2020 to accommodate the lockdowns in the respective countries where we have a presence. No employees were asked to go on unpaid leave during lockdown periods or shutdown of operations.\n\nSasol confirms that, in all countries where we have employees located that participate in retirement funds, the governance of these funds meets all local fiduciary requirements. All Defined Benefit Fund liabilities are appropriately detailed in Sasol's Statement of Financial Position.\n\nThe employer contributions to retirement funds in US and South Africa (SA) were suspended for a period of up to eight months starting 1 May 2020 to assist with cash flow. Following a review on 4 August 2020, the employer retirement fund contribution was reinstated due to the Company's improved liquidity position.",

A split vesting period of three and five years applies to participants in Group leadership and top management.\n\n## Strategic intent:\n\n- \u00b7 Alignment with group performance\n- \u00b7   Attraction and retention of senior employees and scarce and critical skills\n- \u00b7   Alignment with shareholders' long term interests and experience\n\n## Long-term incentives - Application\n\n## Outcomes 2020\n\nLTIs form an important part of our pay mix and annual target LTI awards are annually reviewed to ensure market competitiveness.\n\nThe equity- or cash-settled LTI plans give participants the opportunity, subject to vesting conditions, to receive Sasol ordinary shares or ADRs or the equivalent cash value of share linked LTI awards. Participants have the option to sell or retain the shares after the vesting period. Executive Directors are required to retain vested shares until minimum shareholding requirements have been met.\n\nThe Committee annually considers the corporate performance targets (CPTs) and the vesting of the 2020 LTI awards are subject to the following targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Return on invested capital\n- \u00b7 Total shareholders' return\n- \u00b7 Increase in production volumes over headcount\n\nRefer to pages 74 to 75 for detailed targets.\n\n- In 2020, the annual LTI award was granted to participants excluding members of the GEC, on 29 October 2019.\n\nThe annual LTI award for members of the GEC was delayed to 4 March 2020 until all matters raised in the Board review were closed out. The on-appointment awards for the President and CEO as well as the newly appointed EVPs were also made on this date.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirements\n\nOn 1 November 2019, Mr VD Kahla was appointed as Executive Director and was replaced as Company Secretary for Sasol Limited by Ms MML Mokoka. The Committee recommended to the Board that the share ownership requirement for the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other Executive Directors, be differentiated, and approved the following requirements:\n\n\u00b7  President and Chief Executive Officer: 300% of annual pensionable remuneration \u00b7  Chief Financial Officer: 200% of annual pensionable remuneration \u00b7  Other Executive Directors: 100% of annual pensionable remuneration\n\nThe requirement must typically be achieved within five years from the date of appointment unless otherwise agreed by the Board. Due to the extended voluntary closed period that the Group was in during 2020, it was agreed that for Mr VD Kahla, the five-year period will only start once the closed period lifts in 2021. The Board has further considered that due to the low levels of achievement against the CPTs over the past five years in particular, that the five-year period for Mr P Victor, be extended. In the meantime, the Board expects that all after-tax vested shares from previously granted LTI awards be retained until the minimum shareholding requirement has been met.\n\n100% of LTIs awarded to members of the GEC are subject to the achievement of corporate performance targets.\n\nThe Committee assessed that overall performance of the LTI awards made in 2016 was achieved at 47% of target. Of these, 50% vested and were delivered to the executives in the form of equity or cash with the remaining 50% due to vest after a further two years in 2022. Participants who leave the service of the Group for reasons other than retirement, retrenchment, by death, disability or ill-health, or for any other reason approved by the Committee, will forfeit the awards not vested or of which all performance and time conditions have not been met.\n\n## Executive service contracts\n\n- \u00b7   The President and Chief Executive Officer is appointed on a three-year contract which can be extended by 12 months if mutually agreed.\n- \u00b7   Members of the Group Executive Committee have permanent employment contracts with notice periods of three to six months. The contracts provide for salary and benefits as well as participation in incentive plans on the basis of Group and individual performance as approved by the Board. Executive Vice Presidents who are members of the South African Sasol Pension Fund are required to retire from the Group and as Directors of the Board at the age of 60, unless they are requested by the Board to extend their term. Perquisites available to the members of the GEC are disclosed in the Remuneration Implementation Report (Implementation Report).\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nNon-Executive Directors (NEDs) are appointed to the Sasol Limited Board based on their competencies as well as insight and experience appropriate to assist the Group in setting the strategy and assessing performance against key priorities. Consequently, fees are set at levels to attract and retain the calibre of directors necessary to contribute to a highly effective board. They do not receive short-term incentives, nor do they participate in long-term incentive plans. No arrangement exists for compensation in respect of loss of office.\n\nNEDs are paid a fixed annual fee in respect of their Board membership, as well as supplementary fees for Committee membership and an additional Committee fee for special purpose Committees of the Board. Actual fees and the fee structure are reviewed annually. A travel allowance, approved by shareholders, is payable for international travel but will only be implemented in 2021 to the extent that NEDs will be required to travel internationally.\n\nIn 2018, following consultations with our large institutional investors, the Committee proposed a single currency fee structure which was approved at the 2018 November AGM. The new structure has been phased in for our resident NEDs. The Board agreed to defer the last adjustment to the new fee structure by one year to 1 July 2021. Where current NEDs' fees are higher than the new single currency fee structure, their fees are kept unchanged.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of COVID-19 across the world, NEDs volunteered fee sacrifices of between 20% and 40% in support of our cash conservation efforts effective from April 2020.\n\nNo increase in fees will be requested at the November 2020 AGM.\n\n## Annual Non-Executive Directors' fees:\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2020  Fees incl.

Long-term incentives for 2020 represent the award made on 22 September 2017.

The actual vesting date for the annual awards is 22 September 2020; subject to the company being in an open period. Dividend equivalents accrue at the end of the vesting period, to the extent that the LTIs vest. 50% of the vested LTIs and accrued dividends will be released on 22 September 2020 and the balance in September 2022, subject to the rules of the LTI plan. As there are no further performance conditions attached to the balance of the 50%, the full amount is disclosed in the single figure table.\n- 3.

Mr Cornell exited with effect from 30 June 2020.\n- 2.  Mr Cornell participated in an individual Senior Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) in order to adjust for differences between the benefits that would have been payable under his previous employer's Defined Benefit retirement fund and the benefits payable under the retirement programmes of Sasol (USA) Corporation. The SERP benefit (R9 707 538) is included in Risk and Retirement funding and was payable following his mutual separation.\n- 3.  Other benefits for Mr Cornell under his expatriate contract include accommodation (R1 380 514), subsidised business transport (R27 469), school fees (R225 209), private accommodation (R52 309), leave encashment on termination (R1 348 852), relocation expenses (R1 746 021), employer contributions to US statutory funds (R712 160), final tranche of a staggered sign on payment (R2 984 416), tax assistance (R71 801) and tax on expatriate benefits (R3 149 125).\n- 4.  Mr Nqwababa exited with effect from 30 April 2020.\n- 5.  Other benefits for Mr Nqwababa include leave encashment on termination (R853 039), subsidised business transport (R31 184) and private accommodation (R25 156).\n- 6.  In terms of the LTI Plan rules, Messrs Cornell and Nqwababa retain their LTI awards subject to the normal vesting criteria and corporate performance targets; the LTIs are not subject to accelerated vesting. Long-term incentives for 2020 represent the award made on 22 September 2017. The illustrative amount is calculated in terms of the number of LTIs x corporate performance target achieved (26%) x closing share price on 12 August 2020. The actual vesting date for the annual awards is 22 September 2020; subject to the Company being in an open period. Dividend equivalents accrue at the end of the vesting period, to the extent that the LTIs vest. 50% of the vested LTIs and accrued dividends will be released on 22 September 2020 and the balance in September 2022, subject to the rules of the LTI plan. As there are no further performance conditions attached to the balance of the 50%, the full amount is disclosed in the single figure table.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the impact, we are safeguarding our liquidity headroom and protecting Sasol's balance sheet by focusing on our comprehensive response strategy.\n\n## Dear stakeholder\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2020, we exceeded our cash conservation target of US$1 billion, largely through capital and working capital optimisation and cost savings measures, consisting of mainly human capital levers. This is testament to the resilience and commitment of 'Team Sasol' who worked tirelessly to deliver on this strong performance. In addition, we expanded and accelerated our asset divestment programme and realised R4,3 billion in disposal proceeds by 30 June 2020. We have committed plans to conserve a further US$1 billion in cash in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIR Refer to President and Chief Executive Officer's Statement on pages 8 to 10 for detail on our comprehensive response plan.\n\nIn 2020, oil prices averaged at US$51/bbl, with a high of US$70/bbl in January 2020 and a low of US$13/bbl in April 2020. The oil price collapse significantly impacted on our margins and we expect that oil prices will remain low for the next 12 to 18 months as the impact of COVID-19 becomes better understood. Oil markets remain exposed to shifts in geopolitical risks as well as supply and demand movements.\n\nWithin this context, our foundation businesses delivered resilient results with a strong volume, cash fixed cost and working capital performance. As our Energy Business felt the effects of the supply and demand shocks that led to lower crude oil prices and product differentials, our Chemical businesses maintained robust results on some products, ensuring a level of resilience in our cash flows.\n\n## Rand crude oil price forecast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe global chemicals industry was heavily impacted by adverse macroeconomic developments: the US-China trade dispute, the oil price crash and the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, leading to unprecedented economic disruptions and extreme price and demand volatility across most of our markets and product portfolios. In commodity chemicals, prices diluted further due to increased global capacities, particularly for polymers. Against this challenging backdrop, our Chemicals Business delivered a solid performance, benefitting from its diverse global portfolio and value-chain integration. It is expected that markets will remain volatile for the remainder of this calendar year with rebalancing of supply-demand occurring at varying speed in different regions, depending on COVID-19 mitigation and economic stimulus packages.\n\nDuring 2020, the rand/US dollar exchange rate averaged R15,69 compared to R14,20 in the prior year. The weaker average rand/US dollar exchange rate significantly benefitted on the results of our Chemicals business, which is more exposed to foreign currency sales and capital expenditure.\n\nAs Sasol's balance sheet reached peak gearing of 114,5% at 30 June 2020, we implemented several focused management actions as part of our comprehensive response plan to improve our liquidity position. We had to make decisions to protect and strengthen the balance sheet, some of which negatively impacted on employee morale, growth and investor perceptions. Through this difficult period, we continued to manage the balance sheet and position the Company to create a more sustainable capital structure going forward through Future Sasol. We expect the balance sheet to remain constrained over the next two years, allowing for very little expansion or growth.\n\n## Key drivers impacting our results\n\nSasol's integrated risk management process enabled us to monitor and respond to the volatile macroeconomic environment. We continued to closely monitor the progress of our strategic objectives by considering and planning for various likely financial scenarios in determining whether the risk is within the limits of our risk tolerance and risk appetite as well as testing the robustness of our mitigation actions. In order to assess the impact of the operating environment on our business, it is important to understand those factors that affect the delivery of our results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk                                 | Impact on value creation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit market risk and  liquidity    | Our current leverage impacts the liquidity  available to us and our cost of obtaining  funding.                                                                                                                                                               | \u00b7  Funding requirements are continuously  monitored and regular engagements with  lenders are held to ensure that we maintain  appropriate levels of liquidity. \u00b7  Our comprehensive response plan to                                                                           |\n| Volatile markets and  exchange rates | We are significantly impacted by the  rand/US dollar exchange rate, with our  product prices based largely on global  prices quoted in US dollars and a large  portion of our capital investments being  in US dollars.                                       | \u00b7  We use forward exchange contracts to hedge  foreign currency-denominated transactions.  \u00b7  We further entered into zero-cost collars for  US$5,4 billion for 2021, to cover 62% of our  exposure.

A price compared to the prior year. A positive core earnings still supports our cash flow generating ability from our foundation businesses.\n\nThe Sasol Limited Board considers core headline earnings as an appropriate indicator of the sustainable operating performance of the Group.\n\n## Core HEPS (Rand)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignificant operational items include impairments of R111,6 billion and losses on derivative instruments of R7,0 billion. The impairments include R72,6 billion (US$4,2 billion) that has been recognised on our Base Chemicals portfolio within Sasol Chemicals USA (that has been classified as held for sale) and R35,2 billion relating to our integrated South African value chain that has been significantly impacted by the decrease in crude oil prices, a further softening of global chemical prices and refining margins and lower market demand in a post-COVID-19 environment.\n\nThe losses on derivative instruments relate mainly to instruments entered to protect the Company against currency volatility that were negatively impacted by the significant weakening of the rand exchange rate during the second half of the financial year.\n\nTurning to our cost performance, cash fixed cost, as summarised in the graph below, remained flat when compared to the prior year as we implemented our comprehensive response plan focusing on cash fixed cost reduction, which included human capital levers as part of our effort on enhancing cash flow and cost competitiveness in a low oil price environment. The cost reductions realised (R4,8 billion) which together with the impact of adopting IFRS 16 more than offset the increase in cost driven by LCCP ramp up costs of R1,2 billion and the impact of a weaker exchange rate (R1,9 billion). Normalised for these effects, cash fixed cost decreased by 4,6%. We are of the view that our cost management processes remain robust to protect and improve our cost competitive position and still position us in managing our cost base to within our inflation target, while ensuring that we maintain safe and sustainable operations.\n\n## Cost performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our financial position\n\nThe unprecedented set of combined challenges driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant decline in the crude oil price have come at a time when Sasol is in a peak gearing phase as the LCCP is being completed. To protect the balance sheet, Sasol implemented a comprehensive response plan to enhance cash flow and reposition the balance sheet to be resilient in a sustained low oil price environment. The measures undertaken to reposition the company include a cash conservation programme, a valuedriven asset disposal programme, potential partnering for Sasol's US Base Chemicals assets, a rights issue of up to US$2 billion in the second half of financial year 2021  and active balance sheet management to maintain a healthy liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile as Sasol works towards restoring an optimal capital structure.\n\nOur gearing increased to 114,5% during the year given the significantly weaker closing exchange rate of R17,33, the impairments recognised during the year and the capital expenditure on the LCCP.",

This is essential for an industry operating in a volatile operating environment marked by swings in commodity prices and currency rates, as well as the potential for technology disruption.\n\n## Managing our funding\n\nThe immediate focus is to bring leverage back in line with our target levels and mitigate the impacts of the current market volatility to preserve the underlying value in the business. To create flexibility in Sasol's balance sheet during our peak gearing period we have successfully engaged with our lenders to waive our covenants as at 30 June 2020 and to lift our covenants from 3 times to 4 times net debt: EBITDA at 31 December 2020. This additional flexibility is consistent with Sasol's broader capital allocation framework and subject to conditions which are customary for such covenant amendments. These include provisions to prioritise debt reduction at this time, commitments that there will be no dividend payments nor acquisitions while our leverage is above 3,0 times Net debt: EBITDA and that the 2021 capital expenditure will not exceed the forecast level of R21 billion by more than 10%. Sasol will also reduce, while continuing to maintain a strong liquidity position, the size of its facilities as debt levels reduce. Our net debt: EBITDA ratio at 30 June 2020, based on the revolving credit facility and US dollar term loan covenant definition, was 4,3 times.\n\nDuring the year we secured incremental US dollar liquidity through a US$1 billion syndicated loan facility for up to 18 months, and bilateral facilities (with a combined quantum of US$250 million) with a tenor of two years, enhancing our US dollar liquidity position. In the South African market, we have both bank loan facilities and an R8,0 billion Domestic Medium-Term Note (DMTN) programme which was established in 2017. In August 2019, we issued our inaugural paper to the value of R2,2 billion in the local debt market under this DMTN programme.\n\nAs at 30 June 2020, our liquidity headroom was in excess of US$2,5 billion well above our outlook to maintain liquidity in excess of US$1 billion. We continue to assess our mix of funding instruments to ensure that we have funding from a range of sources and a balanced maturity profile.\n\nDepending on the progress made on other elements of the response plan, Sasol will pursue a rights issue of up to US$2 billion in the second half of financial year 2021.\n\nNet debt increased by R50 billion in 2020 to R175 billion mainly due to the funding of the LCCP and the impact of the weaker exchange rate on our US dollar debt funding, with 93% of our debt now US dollar denominated due to the funding of the LCCP. Our long-term capital expansion projects are financed by a combination of floating and fixed-rate long-term debt, as well as internally generated funds.\n\n|                                                | 2020 Rm   | 2019 Rm   | 2018 Rm   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Long-term debt                                 | 147 511   | 127 350   | 89 411    |\n| Short-term debt*                               | 43 468    | 3 783     | 14 709    |\n| Lease liabilities                              | 15 825    | 7 445     | 7 280     |\n| Bank overdraft                                 | 645       | 58        | 89        |\n| Total debt & lease liabilities                 | 207 449   | 138 636   | 111 489   |\n| Less cash (excluding cash  restricted for use) | 32 932    | 13 387    | 15 148    |\n| Net debt                                       | 174 517   | 125 249   | 96 341    |\n\n* Include short-term portion of long-term debt of R19 686 million\n\nLong-term debt maturity profile (R'bn) *Debt funding mix (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo fund our future growth ambitions, we aim to have a gearing ratio of at least 30%. This will mean having to source the appropriate funding mix at the most attractive rates in the market. We have implemented a dynamic funding plan which is based on our latest assumptions and capital requirements. We review the plan on an ongoing basis and report on it to the Audit Committee to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity and headroom on the balance sheet in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Cash generation\n\nOur foundation business is capable of generating positive cash flows in a low oil price environment with cash generated by operating activities of R42,4 billion during the year, decreasing 18% compared with R51,4 billion in the prior year. This is largely attributable to the unfavourable Brent crude oil prices and lower sales volumes. This was partly offset by another strong working capital and cost performance from the foundation business. Working capital decreased by R5,8 billion during the year mainly as a result of focused management actions.\n\nOur free cash flow generated before growth capital decreased by 45% from the prior year as a result of the lower cash flow from operations of R12,4 billion, partly offset by a decrease in working capital and reduced sustenance capital spend.\n\nFree cash flow per share (before growth) (US$)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capital portfolio\n\nOur increase in leverage is mainly due to our increased capital spend where we have made capital investments of R282 billion over the past five years, mainly in projects in South Africa, Mozambique and the United States. Capital expenditure in 2020 of R35 billion has come down from its peak as the LCCP nears completion, with R16 billion related to growth capital, including R14 billion (US$0,9 billion) on the LCCP, and R19 billion related to sustenance capital to ensure safe and reliable operations.\n\n## Capital expenditure (R'bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowth capital spend will be reduced post the LCCP in support of our strategic objectives to deleverage the balance and to grow shareholder value through increased dividend returns. We target to prudently manage the sustenance capital basket for the foundation business at approximately R20 billion per annum in real terms, however safe and reliable operations remain sacrosanct.\n\nRefer to our Annual Financial Statements AFS for details of additions to our non-current assets in notes 19 to 20.\n\nWe have reviewed our asset portfolio to focus only on assets that can generate attractive returns through the cycle and are core to our long-term strategic focus, identifying assets for disposal with proceeds exceeding US$2 billion. The process to accelerate our asset disposal programme has yielded good progress for several of these assets despite the macro environment volatility, with transactions that make a substantial contribution to our targeted divestments already agreed and the potential of other disposals being assessed. We are being highly disciplined and will execute any disposal in line with the balance sheet, shareholder value and strategic objectives.\n\n## Hedging activity\n\nOur hedging programme is a key component of our financial risk management framework to provide certainty as we manage peak gearing and ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group. We follow a probabilistic approach to hedging our key exposures to exchange rate, oil and ethane. In the second quarter of financial year 2020, we were unable to secure oil hedges at acceptable premiums. For the first quarter of 2021, approximately 80% of SSO's liquid fuels exposure was hedged, translating to six million barrels. For our hedging programme relating to rand/US dollar, US$5,4 billion of our rand/US dollar, exposure as at 30 June 2020 have been hedged. Similarly, 49% of our ethane price exposure has already been hedged out of a target of 65%.\n\n## Solvency and liquidity\n\nThe Group meets its financing requirements through a combination of cash generated from its operations and short- and long-term borrowings. However, as a result of the liquidity constraints, weak trading environments and the risk of a second COVID-19 outbreak, the Board undertook a comprehensive assessment of the Group and Company, including their solvency and liquidity statuses.\n\n## Solvency\n\nAt 30 June 2020, after impairments, the valuations of the Group's assets indicate that their fair values exceed their carrying values as well as the external debt. The asset base of the Group comprises mainly tangible assets with significant value, reflected in the records of the underlying businesses.\n\nAs such, the Board is of the view that given the significant headroom in the fair value of the assets over the fair value of the liabilities (including contingent liabilities), the Company and Group are solvent as at 30 June 2020 and at the date of approving the Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nAlthough still cash positive, the Group has limited cash flow available to cover operating expenses, interest and capital expenditure at 30 June 2020. As outlined, this was mainly due to the oil price collapse and COVID-19 economic impacts which came at a time when the balance sheet was at peak gearing. Additionally, the Group's credit rating was downgraded as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global growth and the volatility in the oil price. The ability of the Group to meet its debt covenant requirements at 31 December 2020 and 30 June 2021 and repay debt as it becomes due is dependent on the timing and quantum of cash flows from operations, the ability to realise cash through a combination of asset disposals, or part thereof, and the successful raising of equity.",

        "page_content": "## PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW (continued)\n\nTo address the risk of short-term cash pressure, management has taken the following steps to stabilise the business and improve the liquidity position:\n\n- \u00b7   Revising the strategy - Clear portfolio choices, including a decision to stop all oil growth activities in West Africa has resulted in immediate cash and capital savings which will be sustainable, beyond 2020;\n- \u00b7   Weekly 'cash war room' - On a weekly basis, management reviewed the monthly cash forecast relative to actions being taken to reduce or defer cash outflows, and understand the forecast cash position of the Company for the next six months;\n- \u00b7   Hedging  activities - The Group continued to execute on its hedging programme and focused on covering its exposure to oil, the Rand/US dollar exchange rate and ethane prices as the three key drivers which impact on profitability;\n- \u00b7   Cost  reduction - The necessity and quantum of expenditure in this fiscal year was challenged on a top down and bottoms up basis and a substantial cost reduction work stream was implemented to reduce external spend with a focus on all discretionary expenditure;\n- \u00b7   Human capital levers - A moratorium was implemented on external recruitment to fill non-critical vacancies and on the use of hired labour and consultants for non-critical activities. In parallel, short-term incentive payments were ceased for 2020 whilst salary sacrifices were implemented on a sliding scale with suspension of employer contributions to the various  retirement funds for an initial period of eight months up to December 2020;\n- \u00b7   Capital  optimisation - Capital expenditure was reduced substantially by curtailing discretionary capital whilst keeping sustenance capital at the minimum level required to ensure safe and reliable operations. Capital in excess of R5 billion was deferred in 2020 through prioritisation using a risk-based approach and use of digitalisation;\n- \u00b7   Working  capital - The Group has been able to contribute positively to cash on hand through the recovery of long outstanding debtors, managing of payables and maintaining an optimal inventory levels. Working capital is, and continues to be, tracked and measured on a monthly basis; and\n- \u00b7   Tax - Certain tax payments were deferred as part of a COVID-19 cash relief measures as agreed with the relevant tax authorities.\n\nWe remain focused on and committed to the strategic reset (Future Sasol) that is aimed at sustainably unlocking cash through gross margin improvements, cash cost reduction, significant reduction in overheads at the Corporate Office and optimisation of capital expenditure by 2025. The planned asset disposals combined with a rights issue and Future Sasol are expected to result in a more sustainable and resilient capital structure and improved shareholder returns.\n\nSasol's credit rating was reduced to sub-investment grade given the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, weaker commodity prices, increased volatility and an uncertain demand outlook. On 30 March 2020, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Sasol's credit rating to a 'BB' with a negative outlook. Similarly Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded Sasol's global scale long-term issuer ratings on 31 March 2020 to 'Ba2', placing the company under review for a downgrade. Sasol's national scale long-term rating was changed from Aa1.za to Aa2.za\n\nWe signed a covenant waiver with our lenders in June 2020. In the waiver agreement, the lenders agreed to waive the covenant at June 2020 and lift the December 2020 covenant from a Net debt:EBITDA of 3,0 times to 4,0 times. The Net debt: EBITDA covenant at 30 June 2021 is 3,0 times. This additional flexibility is consistent with Sasol's broader capital allocation framework and subject to conditions which are customary for such covenant amendments.\n\n## Rehabilitation provisions\n\nWe recognise rehabilitation provisions for the full future restoration and rehabilitation of production facilities to the end of its economic lives. The majority of these activities will occur in the long-term and the requirements that will have to be met in future might be uncertain. Judgement is required in estimating future cost and cash outflows, discount rates, settlement dates, technology and legal requirements. At 30 June 2020, our rehabilitation provisions increased from R14,9 billion to R18,7 billion mainly attributable to changes in discount rates.\n\n## Capital allocation principles\n\nAs we consider capital allocation decisions, we are guided by key financial risk and return metrics such as our gearing and liquidity levels, as well as the return on invested capital, with the ultimate objective to deliver maximum sustainable return to shareholders. The two key overarching objectives in the capital allocation framework are, to protect and strengthen the balance sheet and then to focus on value-based capital allocation.\n\nProtecting our licence to operate and ensuring the integrity and reliability of our assets is our first priority. After deleveraging the balance sheet our next priority will be to evaluate where we will derive the most value for our shareholders, considering the following levers that will be competing equally for capital:\n\n- \u00b7  value-based growth through projects or merger and acquisitions transactions;\n- \u00b7  value returned to shareholders through a targeted dividend payout ratio from 2,5 times (40% payout) to 2,2 times (45% payout); and lastly consider further\n- \u00b7  value returned to shareholders through special dividends and/or share buy-back programmes.\n\nBefore we consider investing in large projects with long lead times, in the short to medium term, we will rather pursue small- to medium-sized projects (either organic or inorganic) which require capital of less than US$500 million and US$1 billion respectively. Mega projects are not within our short- to medium-term focus and in future will only be considered in partnerships and once we have built a track record of successful smaller- to medium-sized investments.\n\nWe are committed to a more balanced approach in returning value to shareholders through the ups and downs of the commodity cycle. This includes stepping up dividend payments on a sustainable basis to the lower end of the dividend cover range, as well as pursuing a consistent share buy-back programme to counter the effects of any corporate actions, ensuring that share dilution impacts on shareholders are minimised.\n\n## Outlook for 2021\n\nThe current economic climate is highly volatile and uncertain, with it remaining difficult to reliably estimate the evolving impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as future measures to contain it. Consequently, there is significant uncertainty regarding our near term outlook for prices and product demand. While these factors that may impact our results are outside our control, our focus remains firmly on our comprehensive response plan to strengthen our finances.\n\n## Our guidance is based on the following assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7  Rand/US dollar exchange rate to range between R16,00 and R17,00 and average Brent crude oil price to remain between US$35/bbl and US$45/bbl;\n- \u00b7  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to drive short-term to near-term volatility; and\n- \u00b7  Management achieving the targets set in terms of our comprehensive response plan to generate at least US$6 billion by the end of 2021\n\n## We expect an overall solid operational performance for the year ending 30 June 2021, with:\n\n- \u00b7  SSO volumes of 7,7 to 7,8 million tons;\n- \u00b7  Liquid fuels sales of approximately 54 to 55 million barrels;\n- \u00b7  Natref production units of between 520 to 550 m 3 /h;\n- \u00b7  Base Chemicals overall sales volumes to be 3% to 5% higher than 2020. Excluding US polymers products, sales volumes to be 1% to 2% higher than 2020;\n- \u00b7  Performance Chemicals overall sales volumes to be 3% to 5% higher than the prior year. Excluding LCCP produced products, sales volumes to be flat or slightly below the prior year;\n\n## Shareholder returns\n\nSasol's shareholder base consists primarily of large institutional shareholders, with varying investment styles, concentrated in South Africa. Our aim is to achieve a broad correlation between the distribution of our shareholder base and the sources of cash-generation for the Group. As our international portfolio is expanding with the LCCP we will specifically target a larger number of US-based investors in future.\n\nWe aim to return value to our shareholders by way of both dividends and share price appreciation over time, measured as total shareholder return (TSR). Sasol's TSR for the five-year period ending 30 June 2020 was -58% in rand terms and -70% in US dollar terms, which is in the bottom range of our peers.\n\nSasol's share price fell to its lowest level in over 20 years as the economic fallout from the spread of COVID-19 placed further strain on Sasol's financial position. The collapse in crude oil prices, impacted by a price war between global producers, further contributed to the lower share price performance. To maximise TSR, the Group has put measures in place to:\n\n- \u00b7  actively manage the balance sheet to address shortterm liquidity requirements;\n- \u00b7  execute on our response plan and self-help measures to restore financial stability;\n- \u00b7  accelerate and expand our asset disposal programme;\n- \u00b7  advance our strategic reset to deliver long-term value creation; and\n- \u00b7  execute per our disciplined capital allocation framework for improving shareholder returns.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend payments are an important part in our capital allocation framework. However, given our current financial leverage and the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, the Board believes that it would be prudent to\n\n- \u00b7  The LDPE unit is expected to reach beneficial operation before the end of October 2020 and therefore all LCCP units online during 2021;\n- \u00b7  Gas production volumes from the Petroleum Production Agreement licence area in Mozambique to be 114 to 118 bscf;\n- \u00b7  We expect to achieve a utilisation rate of 75% to 80% at ORYX GTL in Qatar due to an extended planned shutdown;\n- \u00b7  Normalised cash fixed costs to remain within inflation;\n- \u00b7  Capital expenditure of R21 billion for 2021. Capital estimates may change as a result of exchange rate volatility and other factors; and\n- \u00b7  Net debt: EBITDA to be below covenant. Macroeconomic volatility may continue have an impact on the covenant level if a sudden further unexpected deterioration is experienced.\n\ncontinue with the suspension of dividends. This will allow us to continue to protect our liquidity in the short-term and focus on reducing leverage in order to create a firm platform to execute our strategy and drive long-term shareholder returns. In addition, in accordance with the covenant amendment agreement with lenders, we will not be in a position to declare a dividend for as long as net debt: EBITDA is above 3,0 times. We expect the balance sheet to regain flexibility following the implementation of our comprehensive response plan.\n\n## Change in accounting standard\n\nThe Group adopted the new accounting standard IFRS 16, Leases, effective 1 July 2019, resulting in an increase in the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets, negatively impacting our financial leverage ratios. On implementation, additional lease liabilities of R8,3 billion have been recognised in the statement of financial position with corresponding right-of-use assets of R8,6 billion. The additional lease liabilities added approximately 4% on gearing.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nI would like to thank the Board and the Group Executive Committee for their continued support and leadership as we deal with the unprecedented impact of this exceptionally challenging environment. I also would like to acknowledge the finance team for its hard work and dedication in supporting the business to manage liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet and reducing cost. Finally, to our shareholders I would like to confirm that we are actively working towards addressing the short-term factors impacting the Company so that we can unlock sustainable value for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaul Victor\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n21 August 2020",

Projects capitalised that moved from assets under construction to property, plant and equipment amounted to R127,9 billion, this includes the ethoxylates (ETO) expansion that achieved beneficial operation in January 2020, the alcohol expansion and the alumina expansion, as well as the new Guerbet unit that achieved beneficial operation in June 2020.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nThe unprecedented set of combined challenges driven by COVID-19 and the significant decline in the crude oil price triggered impairments tests to determine whether the carrying value of our assets are recoverable:\n\n- \u00b7  Base Chemicals recognised a total of R18,1 billion of impairments related to our foundation business and in the US, an impairment of R53,2 billion, (US$3,1 billion) relating to a combination of assets within Sasol Chemicals USA which have been classified as held for sale at 30 June 2020.\n- \u00b7  Energy recognised impairments of R3,8 billion and R8,6 billion respectively in relation to our Synref and Sasref cash generating units.\n- \u00b7  Performance Chemicals' South African and Eurasian wax businesses recognised impairments of R4,6 billion and R2,8 billion respectively. An impairment of R19,6 billion (US$1,1 billion) has been recognised on our proportion of the shared assets related to the Base Chemicals portfolio with Sasol Chemicals USA.\n\n## Assets in disposal group held for sale\n\nWe targeted assets for divestment in 2020 including:\n\n- \u00b7   16 air separation units, located in Secunda;\n- \u00b7   Base Chemicals assets in the US for a potential partnering arrangement; and\n- \u00b7 Our  50% shareholding in Republic of Mozambique Pipeline Investment Company.\n\n## Working capital\n\nWorking capital decreased by R5,8 billion during the year mainly as a result of focused management actions.\n\n## Equity\n\nShareholders' equity was negatively impacted by the decrease in earnings for the year.\n\n## Debt\n\nOur total debt was R189,7 billion compared to R130,9 billion as at 30 June 2019, with approximately R174,6 billion (US$10,1 billion) denominated in US dollar. The balance sheet is highly geared, requiring a reduction in US dollar denominated debt in order to achieve a targeted net debt: EBITDA of less than 2,0 times and gearing of 30%, which we believe would be sustainable with oil at approximately US$45 per barrel (in real terms). Through our comprehensive response plan we have taken immediate steps to reset our capital structure by targeting to generate at least US$6 billion by the end of 2021.\n\n## Income statement analysis\n\nfor the year ended 30 June\n\n|                                                                                            | 2020 Rm   | 2019 Rm   | 2018 Rm   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Turnover                                                                                   | 190 367   | 203 576   | 181 461   |\n| Materials, energy and consumables used                                                     | (90 109)  | (90 589)  | (76 606)  |\n| Selling and distribution costs                                                             | (8 388)   | (7 836)   | (7 060)   |\n| Maintenance expenditure                                                                    | (10 493)  | (10 227)  | (9 163)   |\n| Employee-related expenditure                                                               | (30 667)  | (29 928)  | (27 468)  |\n| Exploration expenditure and feasibility costs                                              | (608)     | (663)     | (352)     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                                              | (22 575)  | (17 968)  | (16 425)  |\n| Other expenses and income                                                                  | (27 376)  | (19 097)  | (15 316)  |\n| Translation gains/(losses)                                                                 | (6 542)   | 604       | (11)      |\n| Other operating expenses and income                                                        | (20 834)  | (19 701)  | (15 305)  |\n| Equity accounted profits, net of tax                                                       | (347)     | 1 074     | 1 443     |\n| Operating(loss)/profit before remeasurement  items and Sasol Khanyisa share-based  payment | (196)     | 28 342    | 30 514    |\n| Remeasurement items affecting operating profit                                             | (110 834) | (18 645)  | (9 901)   |\n| Sasol Khanyisa share-based payment affecting  operating profit                             | -         | -         | (2 866)   |\n| (Loss)/earnings before interest and tax  ((LBIT)/EBIT)                                     | (111 030) | 9 697     | 17 747    |\n| Finance income                                                                             | 922       | 787       | 1 716     |\n| Finance costs                                                                              | (7 303)   | (1 253)   | (3 759)   |\n| (Loss)/earnings before tax                                                                 | (117 411) | 9 231     | 15 704    |\n| Taxation                                                                                   | 26 139    | (3 157)   | (5 558)   |\n| (Loss)/earnings for the year                                                               | (91 272)  | 6 074     | 10 146    |\n| Attributable to                                                                            |           |           |           |\n| Owners of Sasol Limited                                                                    | (91 109)  | 4 298     | 8 729     |\n| Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries                                                  | (163)     | 1 776     | 1 417     |\n|                                                                                            | (91 272)  | 6 074     | 10 146    |\n| Per share information                                                                      | Rand      | Rand      | Rand      |\n| Basic (loss)/earnings per share                                                            | (147,45)  | 6,97      | 14,26     |\n| Diluted (loss)/earnings per share                                                          | (147,45)  | 6,93      | 14,18     |\n\n## Loss attributable to shareholders\n\nSasol's earnings for the year were severely impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19 and lower oil prices coupled with the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) still being in a ramp-up phase. This resulted in a further decline in both our sales volumes and margins in an already softer macroeconomic environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLoss for a year\n\nR91,3\n\nbillion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commentary\n\n## Turnover\n\nTurnover decreased by 6% mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7  Liquid fuels and natural gas sales volumes decreased by 12% and 8% respectively due to lower market demand resulting from the decline in the South African economy and the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown;\n- \u00b7  8% increase in total sales volumes in Performance Chemicals compared to the prior year, mainly due the advanced materials portfolio that benefitted from higher sales of green coke (carbon) as well as higher hard wax sales; and\n- \u00b7  19% increase in sales volumes in Base Chemicals mainly as a result of the linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) plant achieving beneficial operation in February 2019 and the new ethane cracker achieving beneficial operation in August 2019, negated an 18% decrease in the US$/ton basket sales price.\n\n## Materials, energy and consumables used\n\nDecrease of 1% mainly due to lower feedstock costs and lower sales volumes in the Energy Business.\n\n## Employee-related expenditure\n\nExcluding the impact of the share based payment, our employee costs decreased by 1% compared to 2019, mainly due to the non-payment of short-term incentives to middle management and higher in 2020, salary sacrifice for May and June, negated by inflationary salary increases.\n\n## Other operating expenses and income\n\nIncrease of 6% mainly relates to derivative losses of R7 billion partly offset by decrease in rehabilitation provisions (R2,1 billion) and rentals previously classified as operating leases (R1,3 billion) that are now capitalised.\n\n## Remeasurement items\n\nFor remeasurement items analysis refer to property plant and equipment and assets under construction.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur effective corporate tax rate decreased from 34,2% to 22,3%. The effective corporate tax rate is 5,7% lower than the South African corporate income tax rate of 28%.",

This was largely due to the softer macroeconomic environment during the first six months of the year which was further impacted by the economic consequences from the pandemic and lower oil prices during the second half of the year coupled with the LCCP still being in a ramp-up phase. The decrease was partially negated by another strong working capital and cost performance from the foundation business.\n\n## Additions to non-current assets\n\nActual capital expenditure, including accruals, amounted to R35 billion. This includes R14 billion (US$0,9 billion) relating to the LCCP and is in line with our internal targets.\n\n## Proceeds on disposals and scrappings\n\nIncludes proceeds received from the disposal of our investment in Sasol Huntsman GmbH & co KG (R1,5 billion), partial disposal of Explosives business (R991 million) and our investment in EGTL (R875 million).\n\n## Proceeds and repayment of debt\n\nRelates mainly to loans raised to fund US growth projects and the US$1,5 billion repayments on the revolving credit facility of Sasol Financing International. Proceeds from short-term debt includes R17 billion relating to the US$1 billion syndicated loan facility raised in November 2019, repayable in June 2021.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nOur net cash on hand position increased from R15,8 billion as at 30 June 2019 to R34,1 billion mainly due to proceeds received from the US$1 billion syndicated loan as well as draw downs on the revolving credit facility negated by LCCP capital expenditure for the year.\n\n## OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n\n## Performance Chemicals\n\nBase Chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExploration and Production International\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance                                  | 2020     | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Turnover (Rm)                                | 68 333   | 67 389  |\n| Loss before Interest and Tax (LBIT) (Rm)     | (24 455) | (7 040) |\n| Total assets (Rm)*                           | 160 419  | 151 956 |\n| Number of employees                          | 5 815    | 5 667   |\n| Safety (Recordable Case Rate)                | 0,21     | 0,12    |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2  equivalents) (kilotons) | -        | -       |\n| Water use (1 000m 3 )                        | -        | -       |\n\n| Turnover (Rm)                                | 51 868   | 48 113   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Loss before Interest and Tax (LBIT) (Rm)     | (70 804) | (1 431)  |\n| Total assets (Rm)*                           | 123 057  | 160 638  |\n| Number of employees                          | 7 923    | 8 090    |\n| Safety (Recordable Case Rate)                | 0,24     | 0,40     |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2  equivalents) (kilotons) | 5        | 6        |\n| Water use (1 000m 3 )                        | 3        | 1        |\n\n| Turnover (Rm)                                            | 66 994   | 82 977   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| (Loss)/earnings before Interest and Tax (LBIT/EBIT) (Rm) | (6 678)  | 16 566   |\n| Total assets (Rm)*                                       | 71 063   | 87 052   |\n| Number of employees                                      | 5 094    | 5 118    |\n| Safety (Recordable Case Rate)                            | 0,10     | 0,10     |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2  equivalents) (kilotons)             | 5        | 6        |\n| Water use (1 000m 3 )                                    | 1        | 1        |\n\n| Turnover (Rm)                                | 1 343   | 3 222   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT) (Rm) | 2 756   | 4 701   |\n| Total assets (Rm)*                           | 29 265  | 28 294  |\n| Number of employees                          | 7 433   | 7 402   |\n| Safety (Recordable Case Rate)                | 0,59    | 0,43    |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2  equivalents) (kilotons) | 804     | 822     |\n| Water use (1 000m 3 )                        | 1 431   | 1 520   |\n\n| Turnover (Rm)                                            | 1 829   | 1 815   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Earnings/(loss) before Interest and Tax (EBIT/LBIT) (Rm) | 1 197   | (889)   |\n| Total assets (Rm)*                                       | 19 847  | 16 017  |\n| Number of employees                                      | 424     | 419     |\n| Safety (Recordable Case Rate)                            | 0,14    | 0,12    |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2  equivalents) (kilotons)             | 261     | 261     |\n| Water use (1 000m 3 )                                    | 99      | 85      |\n\n| Safety (Recordable Case Rate)                | 0,23    | 0,27    |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| GHG emissions (CO 2  equivalents) (kilotons) | 64 940  | 65 440  |\n| Water use (1 000m 3 )                        | 141 080 | 132 572 |\n\n- *   Excluded deferred tax assets and post-retirement benefit assets.",

        "page_content": "## Chemicals\n\nBase Chemicals markets commodity chemicals from our upstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) ethylene and propylene value chains. Performance Chemicals markets commodity and differentiated chemicals including organics, advanced materials and wax value chains.\n\n## Salient features\n\n- \u00b7 Robust volume performance despite soft macroeconomics and headwinds from COVID-19 impacting the global economy \u00b7 Safety performance deteriorated with two tragic fatalities \u00b7  Declared beneficial operation on the ethane cracker, ethoxylate expansion, Ziegler and Guerbet alcohol units in Lake Charles\n- \u00b7  Supported South Africa in its fight against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a unique alcohol-based chemical blend and partnering with other organisations to produce and distribute hand sanitisers within South Africa and Mozambique\n- \u00b7  Continued to progress on execution of plastics sustainability work including reducing waste at our Sasol sites, introducing KwaZulu-Natal waste management concepts, concluding the PACKA-CHING recycling partnership and supporting various clean-up campaigns\n- \u00b7  Made excellent progress on digital initiatives such as use of data analytics for improved process efficiency, joining the new Knowde online marketplace and continuing the roll out of our customer relationship management tool\n\n## Performance summary\n\n## Operations\n\nProduction volumes from our North American Operations increased by more than 100% following the start-up of the LCCP ethane cracker in August 2019 and the ethoxylates (ETO) expansion units in January 2020. In addition, the Ziegler and Guerbet alcohols units reached beneficial operation (BO) in June 2020. The cracker produced at an average rate of above 80% of nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter while the linear lowdensity polyethylene (LLDPE) unit produced at nameplate capacity during the same time.\n\nProduction volumes from our Eurasian assets, normalised for the mid-year disposal of the Sasol Wilmar Joint Operation, increased by 0,3%. These were supported by additional alkylate production from our Italian operations and improved surfactant volumes from all facilities, notably the new ETO unit in Nanjing. COVID-19 did however impact production at our Terranova and Nanjing facilities, with both units temporarily shut down.\n\n## Performance Chemicals\n\nSales volumes increased by 8% as the LCCP EO/EG plant produced as planned while the new LCCP ETO unit ramped up smoothly, facing robust demand. The increased volumes were especially\n\n## Performance Chemicals\n\nvisible in our advanced materials portfolio which benefitted from higher sales of green coke (carbon) and in our wax division with higher hard wax sales supported by a competitor's unplanned outage. Sales of organics and other parts of advanced materials were impacted by the lockdowns, especially in end-market segments such as automotive, energy and construction, partly offset by the stronger demand seen in detergent and cleaning products.\n\nLBIT in the prior year of R7,0 billion increased by R17,5 billion to R24,5 billion mainly due to higher impairments recognised during the year (R27,7 billion) compared to R13,1 billion in the prior year, the COVID-19 impact on an already soft global economic environment and R2,6 billion of losses attributable to the LCCP while in the ramp-up phase. Our South African wax business recognised an impairment of R4,6 billion mainly due to higher gas feedstock cost outlook deriving from increased long-term gas purchase prices. Our Eurasian wax businesses recognised an impairment of R2,8 billion mainly due to a lower wax selling price outlook and increased competition. An impairment of R19,6 billion (US$1,1 billion) has been recognised on the assets within Sasol Chemicals USA which have been classified as held for sale.\n\n## Base Chemicals\n\nBase Chemicals' sales volumes increased 19% largely as a result of the LLDPE plant achieving beneficial operation in February 2019 and the new ethane cracker achieving BO in August 2019. The Base Chemicals foundation business (excluding Polymers US products) sales volumes for 2020 were 3% below the prior year mainly as a result of lower last quarter 2020 sales. The fourth quarter of 2020 sales were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in lower market demand and associated lower SSO production rates. Base Chemicals' average sales basket price for 2020 decreased by 18% compared to prior year putting downward pressure on margins. Softer commodity chemical prices were experienced across most of our sales regions and products, largely attributable to weaker global demand, increased global capacity, particularly for polymers and more recently in the last quarter of 2020 the low oil price environment and COVID-19. As a result of lower prices offset by a weaker rand exchange rate, losses of R2,3 billion attributable to the LCCP while in the ramp-up phase and impairments of R71,3 billion, LBIT for the year of R70,8 billion increased by R69,4 billion compared to the prior year. Impairments were recognised within both the South African and US integrated value chains. The impairments in South Africa were equal to R18,1 billion and recognised across a number of cash generating units mainly attributable to softer international sales prices in the short to medium term and higher costs associated with feedstocks and utilities. In US, impairments of R53,2 billion (US$3,1 billion) has been recognised on the assets within Sasol Chemicals USA which have been classified as held for sale, reducing the carrying value to its fair value less cost to sell.\n\n## Base Chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety update\n\nWe recorded two tragic work-related fatalities in the year, one at Sasolburg and the other at Secunda operations, despite our commitment to zero harm. We undertook a holistic review of our safety approach and established a fatality and high-severity injuries elimination task force to develop processes and systems aligned with our safety focus areas.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 and response\n\nLockdown restrictions, temporary shutdowns and reduced run-rates impacted production, however we ensured reliable supply to the market by shifting production to other sites where possible, reducing inventory and continually moving our product to storage facilities close to customers. Where necessary, we also introduced different channels to market, including selling to large distributors to manage logistics bottlenecks. Throughout, we remained close to our customers while seamlessly transitioning our employees to safely working from home, without disrupting our value chains. Demand for various products changed depending on the application and geographic location: demand was lower for polymers (e.g. construction industry) and explosives (e.g. non-coal mine closures) while demand for solvents remained strong especially for pure alcohols sold into the hygiene market. In US, lower oil production in the US shale basins led to higher ethane prices, negatively impacting ethylene costs and associated downstream margins. Through it all, the value of a balanced product portfolio and global sales presence was reinforced.\n\n## Delivering on our strategic objectives\n\n2020 was a significant year for our Chemicals portfolio, which reached important milestones at the LCCP. Our world-scale 1,5 million ton per year ethane cracker we had commissioned five of the six downstream chemical units. The start-up of the Ziegler and Guerbet units in June brought the online capacity of the LCCP's specialty chemicals units to 100% and the LCCP's total online nameplate capacity to 86%. Only the LDPE plant still needs startup with BO expected in the second half of calendar year 2020.\n\nThe Ziegler unit is an extension of the existing Ziegler plant in Lake Charles and is the largest of its kind in the world, strengthening Sasol's significant economies of scale and leveraging our deep technical and operating experience.\n\nThe additional alumina capacity from the unit will enable Sasol to supply the increasing market demand for tailor-made, high purity alumina products used in a variety of market applications such as catalysts, coatings, ceramics and abrasives. The new Guerbet unit is Sasol's second - the other one is in Brunsb\u00fcttel, Germany. Having a Guerbet alcohol production site in Europe and in North America is a key competitive advantage as it provides our customers with expanded access to a more efficient global supply chain.\n\nOther ways in which we delivered on our strategic objectives included the transfer of our explosives business as a going concern to a new joint venture with Enaex S.A.. This was part of our partnering and accelerated asset divestiture programme.\n\nWe also continued to identify areas of growth and innovation in key end-markets where we have industry-leading technologies, competitive feedstocks and market applications. In addition, we progressed various plastics sustainability efforts across our sites and geographies.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n- \u00b7 Expect the negative impact of COVID-19 on demand, prices and value chains to continue in automotive, energy and construction markets, but this should be partly offset by stronger demand in the markets for detergents, cleaning and hygiene products.\n- \u00b7   Focus  on ramping-up the new LCCP Ziegler and Guerbet units and placing all product in the market, as well as starting-up the LCCP's LDPE unit, supporting sales.\n- \u00b7   Streamline the business to drive efficiency and cost discipline, without losing focus on customer-centricity.\n- \u00b7   Continue to prioritise growth and innovation initiatives, including digitalisation efforts, enhancing the customer experience and optimising decision-making across operations, planning, and marketing and sales.\n- \u00b7   Deliver on our partnering and accelerated divestitures programme to unlock value and generate cash for growth in high-value chemicals.",

We undertook a holistic review of our safety approach and established a fatality and high-severity injuries elimination task force to develop processes and systems aligned with our safety focus areas. We appointed DuPont Sustainable Solutions to assist with the implementation of a safety coaching programme for our leadership team and support our operational teams in fostering risk reduction and continuous improvement.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 and response\n\nCommitted to ensuring that our employees, contractors and communities remain safe during this uncertain time, we implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan including preventative measures and scenario-based plans. Our response plans and mitigating protocols enabled us to continue operations with minimal interruption in 2020.\n\n## Performance summary\n\nProductivity improved during the second half of the year, with the full year productivity rate of 1 148 t/cm/s, in line with previous market guidance. Overall, this was 4% lower than the previous year due to infrastructure downtime, safety incidents and the ongoing geological complexity challenges at our Syferfontein and Sigma Collieries.\n\nOperational improvements during the last six months, together with the temporary reductions in demand from both internal and external customers enabled us to increase our inventory levels to above our internal target levels. This allowed us to cease additional external purchases during the last quarter of the year.\n\nEBIT decreased by 41% to R2,8 billion compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of a deterioration in export coal prices,\n\nSaleable production\n\nSasol Integrated Report 2020 98\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExternal purchases\n\nmm tons\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Delivering on our strategic objectives\n\nSasol is committed to reducing our greenhouse gas footprint and has developed a roadmap to achieve a 10% reduction in emissions from South African operations by 2030. However, in South Africa, we are heavily dependent on coal as a feedstock and as such have to ensure that we can sustainably source and deliver coal to our operations at the lowest cost.\n\nIn 2020, we obtained approval to incorporate over 9 000 hectares of additional reserves into the existing Secunda mining area, significantly extending the life-of-mine and in so doing completing our 2050 reserve acquisition initiative.\n\nWe continued to prioritise our community relationships, assisting municipalities with various infrastructure projects. We also extended home ownership among employees to bring the total number of beneficiaries to 233.\n\nTo further improve the efficiency of our mines and increase productivity, we continued with our Siyenza initiative. This programme is aimed at mitigating the greater complexity of mining geology as well as the complex mining processes impacting on productivity. It entails creating integrated operations, introducing 24/7 operations, fundamentally changing our operating system and organisational culture to improve safety, increase productivity and reduce our cost base.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n- \u00b7 Identify opportunities to improve our safety performance, focusing on preventing falls of ground and improving the effectiveness of proximity detection systems\n- \u00b7 Implement a new integrated operating model centred around 24/7 operations\n- \u00b7 Deploy new stonework equipment to improve our capacity and modernise our planning and scheduling systems\n- \u00b7 Continue to monitor and manage the impact of COVID-19 on our people and our business\n- \u00b7 Conclude wage agreement with unions to ensure labour stability\n\nlower export sales volumes and higher external coal purchases early during the year which were partially negated by the strong operational performance during the second half enabling us to build-up stockpile levels. External sales were 41% lower compared to the prior year due to the diversion of export quality coal to our Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) value chain during the first half and a temporary reduction in customer demand in second half due to the pandemic. Internal customer demand returned to pre-COVID-19 levels during June 2020. Our normalised mining unit cost increased by 11% to R347/ton due to lower overall production levels, above-inflation labour related cost increases and higher depreciation for the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sourcing of upstream gas\n\nGas is central to our revised strategy. By securing affordable gas feedstock, we aim to reduce our GHG footprint and supply sustainable lower-carbon products in Southern Africa\n\n## Salient features\n\n\u00b7    Strong safety performance, with RCR of 0,14\n\n- \u00b7 EBIT increased more than 100% to R1,2 billion due to lower asset retirement obligation cost, lower depreciation and increased volumes from Gabon offset by lower prices and lower gas off-take in Mozambique as a result of the spread of COVID-19\n- \u00b7 Social investment of R110,2 million in Mozambique, including restoration of Inhambane ferryboat damaged in Cyclone Dineo and repair of a key national road\n- \u00b7 Delivered three successful development wells in Etame Marin Permit asset in Gabon, increasing production from 12 000 bpd to 20 000 bpd, exceeding expectations\n- \u00b7 Completed and submitted PSA field development plan, paving the way to securing additional gas to our value chain and delivering good returns on this integrated gas, LPG and oil development\n\n## Adopting a gas-centric strategy in Southern Africa\n\nAs supply from our existing gas reserves start to decline from financial year 2024, we are investigating options to optimise current Southern Mozambique upstream assets as well as secure new affordable gas supplies such as importing LNG in the transition towards securing more pipeline gas from Mozambique. With our upstream exploration and development efforts focused on southern Mozambique gas supply in line with the revised strategy, we have decided to no longer pursue oil growth in West Africa. This supports our need for a more sustainable portfolio, focused on core activities and with lower emissions.\n\n## Progressing our strategic objectives in 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Commenced drilling campaign in southern Mozambique to drill new infill wells, repair existing ones and plug and abandon wells that are considered unsafe or which had reached the end of their economic lives. COVID-19 lockdown restrictions led to a temporary suspension of the campaign, which will restart during the first half of the new year when these restrictions are lifted\n- \u00b7 Completed seismic data acquisition of the PT5-C block in southern Mozambique, early indications are encouraging for potential new gas discoveries that can be quickly and easily tied back to our existing production plant\n- \u00b7 Submitted field development plan for Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) licence to the government of Mozambique, progressing our plans to augment our current gas supplies\n- \u00b7 Established a new dedicated team to confirm alternative gas supply options and initiated engagements with key private and public sector stakeholders to enable growth of the Southern Africa gas delivery system. Focusing on securing affordable additional gas supply through development of cost-effective gas import infrastructure (LNG importation and/or gas supply from Rovuma via pipeline), promoting stakeholder alignment and regional gas cooperation, promoting larger gas utilisation anchored on new gas to power facilities, proposing and maintaining an enabling regulatory framework and promoting development of cost-effective gas import infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Worked extensively on the potential conversion of Secunda Synfuels Operations to facilitate greater use of natural gas in its processes\n- \u00b7  Actively pursued the divestment of assets that are not aligned with our updated strategy\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 and response\n\n## Volumes\n\nOur production volumes were negatively impacted by COVID-19 in Mozambique.\n\n## Production volumes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTravel restrictions under the COVID-19 regulations led to a suspension of our Mozambique drilling campaign in March 2020. By implementing a rigorous business continuity plan and strict hygiene protocols, our production facilities in Mozambique and Gabon continued to operate. By year-end, one employee had been infected with COVID-19. In support of the government of Mozambique's fight against the pandemic we donated 60 000 litres of hand sanitiser as well as 500 000 litres of fuel for emergency vehicles in Inhambane.\n\n## Earnings of producing assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n## Securing gas for our operations from 2024+\n\nOur new alternative gas supply team got to work to understand alternative gas supply options for our markets and operations in Southern Africa to address the forecast decline in production from our fields in Mozambique from the 2024 financial year which informed the development of the Group's revised gas-centric strategy.\n\nOn the demand side, within Sasol, our teams carried out extensive work on the potential conversion of Secunda Synfuels Operations to use more gas as feedstock,in line with our emission-reduction framework, including a 10% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and further reductions up to 2050. We also considered the potential external gas demand outlook for among others industrial transportation and power generation in South Africa.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n- \u00b7   Develop a detailed business and execution plan for affordable gas supply options\n- \u00b7   Continue external engagement with potential gas import infrastructure developers and gas suppliers to promote higher utilisation of gas, and the government of Mozambique and South Africa\n- \u00b7   Progress front-end engineering and design for third tranche of infill wells in the Petroleum Production Agreement (PPA) licence area, extending current gas supply\n- \u00b7   Continue to engage with government of Mozambique on the PSA field development plan\n- \u00b7   Take final investment decision on the integrated PSA project and begin its execution\n- \u00b7   Restart Mozambique drilling campaign once COVID-19 restrictions are eased\n- \u00b7   Complete data processing on PT5-C block onshore Mozambique, providing first estimate of gas potential\n- \u00b7   Deliver on development agreement targets for the fenceline communities in Mozambique",

Internationally, we manage Sasol's gas-to liquids (GTL) investment in Qatar.\n\n## Salient features\n\n- \u00b7 Opened five new retail convenience centres\n- \u00b7  Progressed our efforts to develop a cost-effective solution to meet new clean fuels requirements\n- \u00b7 Advanced our renewable energy activities - issued a request for information from potential bidders to supply 600MW of renewable energy to our Secunda facilities\n- \u00b7   Unprecedented drop in demand for liquid fuels due to COVID-19 required drastic measures\n- \u00b7 Engaged with NERSA on methodology for maximum gas prices\n- \u00b7 Reported LBIT of R6,7 billion from 2019's EBIT of R16,6 billion\n- \u00b7 ORYX GTL capacity utilisation declined to 57% after extended shutdown\n- \u00b7  Disposed of our indirect equity investment in Escravos GTL\n\n## Performance summary\n\n## Operations\n\nTotal liquid fuels and chemical production volumes at SSO decreased compared to the prior year due to reduced liquid fuels and product demand during the last quarter of the year. During this time, SSO successfully completed certain maintenance activities, which allowed for the postponement of the September 2020 shutdown. Natref production was 22% lower compared to the prior year, mainly due to the temporary suspension of production with effect from 9 April 2020 resulting from the decrease in fuel demand in South Africa.\n\n## Energy\n\nLiquid fuels and natural gas sales volumes decreased by 12% and 8% respectively due to lower market demand resulting from the decline in the South African economy and the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown. Liquid fuels sales volumes of 52,7 million barrels exceeded the previous market guidance of approximately 50 to 51 million barrels due to a quicker recovery in fuel demand as a result of the earlier than anticipated easing of the lockdown regulations.\n\nWe recorded a loss before interest and tax (LBIT) of R6,7 billion for the year which is R23,2 billion lower compared to the prior year EBIT of R16,6 billion. Our gross margin percentage decreased from 43% to 38% mainly due to lower average Brent crude oil prices, lower sales volumes resulting from the impact of the\n\n## Retail convenience centres\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NERSA matter\n\nWe submitted comments to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) on the possible approaches it may take to establish a new methodology to determine maximum gas prices. We also participated in public hearings. These followed the decision in 2019 by the Constitutional Court that overturned NERSA's price methodology, in place since 2014. The contractual agreements with Sasol Gas customers remain in place until a new framework is approved. However, the implementation of a new NERSA-approved maximum gas price - which would apply retrospectively from March 2014 - could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Safety update\n\nRegretfully we recorded one tragic work-related fatality at Secunda Synfuels Operations, despite our commitment to zero harm. Our recordable case rate (RCR) improved to 0,10 for the year. The fires, explosions and releases severity rate (FER-SR) improved by 15% to 6,0 compared to 7,1 in the prior period.\n\nextended COVID-19 lockdown, a weak Southern African economic performance and lower refining margins which was partially offset by the impact of a weaker rand/US dollar exchange rate. Cash fixed cost were 1% below inflation due to focused management actions.\n\nWe recognised an impairment of R3,8 billion related to our Synref cash generating unit (CGU) mainly due to a significant decrease in our crude oil prices outlook for the short to medium term, an increase in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate and gas feedstock cost due to increased prices. For our Sasref CGU an impairment of R8,6 billion was recognised mainly due to lower assumed refining margins over the longer term and a loss in margin as a result of structural change where fuel components previously provided through to the Sasref CGU will be utilised within the Synref CGU.\n\nORYX GTL contributed R338 million to EBIT, a R793 million decrease from R1 131 million the prior year and achieved a utilisation rate of 57% due to the extended shutdown. Train 1 resumed operation at the beginning of June 2020 and is currently in stable operation. Inspection work performed at the start of the train 2 shutdown in January 2020 resulted in an extension of the required shutdown duration, therefore we expect train 2 to be back in operation during the second quarter of 2021.\n\n## (Loss)/Earnings before interest and tax (LBIT)/EBIT)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 and response\n\nWe moved swiftly to address the dramatic impact of COVID-19 on liquid fuels demand by suspending production in early April at our Natref joint venture and by reducing the production of Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) by 25%. In June we restarted Natref production and ramped-up SSO to full capacity.\n\n## Delivering on our strategic objectives\n\nDuring the year, we opened five new retail convenience centres (RCCs) in South Africa. This is despite challenging market conditions due to increasing prices and reduced petrol demand. Sasol remains one of the strongest retail fuels brands in South Africa, supported by our advertising campaign 'This is GlugGlug \u00ae' . We marketed a third of Sasol fuels' production through our own retail outlets and commercial channels, benefitting from the wider associated margins. We are reviewing our customer offering and evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour as well as advanced mobility.\n\nWe made significant progress in developing a cost-effective solution to meet new market and regulatory requirements for cleaner fuels from SSO and started work on the first of numerous projects. We are confident that we will be ready for the cleaner fuel specifications at a cost that is acceptable to all of our shareholders.\n\nWe are also reshaping our portfolio. In 2017, Sasol announced that it will not be investing in new gas-to-liquid greenfield projects therefore, we have disposed of our indirect equity interest in the Escravos GTL facility.\n\nIn July 2020 we signed an exclusive negotiation agreement with Air Liquide for the sale of our 16 air separation units, including the cooling tower linked to the train 16, located in Secunda, the proceeds will total approximately R8,5 billion.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n- \u00b7 Progress organic retail growth by opening ten new retail sites in 2021\n- \u00b7   Improve retail offering with greater focus on customer needs, advanced mobility solutions and leveraging our infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Ensure reliable supply to our customers in line with increasing demand as lockdown restrictions are eased\n- \u00b7   Increase value proposition to commercial customers by offering fit-for-purpose, targeted segmental solutions\n- \u00b7   Respond and manage implications of NERSA decisions on Sasol Gas prices and trading margin\n- \u00b7 Advance the procurement of 600 MW of renewable energy\n- \u00b7   Execute Clean Fuels 2 and octane solutions for Secunda and Natref facilities, within cash flow constraints\n- \u00b7   Maximise value from Southern African gas business",
