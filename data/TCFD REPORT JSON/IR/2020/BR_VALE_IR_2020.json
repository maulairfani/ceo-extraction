These three words inspired us to outline the direction that we believe is essential to build a better Vale.\n\nWe are determined to fully repair and compensate for the damage caused by the tragedy, and I will never get tired of saying that we will never forget Brumadinho. We are committed to contributing more and more to the improvement and development of the communities in which we operate. We know that there is a way to go. But we remain /firm in establishing a New Pact with Society, a strategic pillar that we will adopt in 2019.\n\nIn February 2021, we took an important step towards the commitment to the full reparation of Brumadinho. We entered into a BRL 37.7 billion Global Agreement, which includes reparatory and compensatory projects, with the State of Minas Gerais, the Public Defender's O/ffice of the State of Minas Gerais and the Federal and State of Minas Gerais Public Ministries. This Agreement brings greater transparency, legitimacy and legal certainty to all those involved. We will remain\n\nGRI 102-14\n\ncommitted to entering into individual indemnity agreements, which already reach 9 thousand people.\n\nAs we progressed in repairing and resuming our iron ore operations, we saw, from 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic changing lives around the world.\n\nWe immediately started to do our part to contain the spread of the coronavirus, with the implementation of safety measures in all of our operations. We created internal prevention processes and instituted the use of equipment and technologies capable of mitigating the risk of contagion, following world-class protocols.\n\nRemote work was adopted by us on March 13, 2020 and, in December, we had more than 15 thousand people working in this regime. There is no challenge of this size without change. We have already allocated more than USD 109 million to combat Covid-19. Everything we could was made available: cargo planes, millions of quick tests, masks, gloves and aprons, ambulances, tons of alcohol gel. We help expand the number of beds and /field hospitals and renovate existing hospitals. In addition, we advance payments to small and medium-sized suppliers. We maintained all\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this sense, in addition to the forums that are established in our governance model, such as the Advisory Committees to the Board of Directors (focused on Sustainability; Finance; Operational Excellence & Risk; People, Compensation & Governance and Audit, Nomination and Innovation), we have multi-disciplinary thematic groups, with the participation of members from outside Vale, which function as a sounding panel and which support us on strategic themes, such as Climate Change, Diversity & Inclusion, Social Action, among others). We believe that this approach has contributed to the maturing of these agendas, bringing greater e/fficiency and competitiveness to the company.\n\nVale's material topics help inform the company's ESG agenda. These topics are connected to the pillars of the business strategy that directs our focus on risk management, /finding opportunities and developing measures aimed to prevent and/or mitigate negative impacts, and creating positive value for the people and locations where Vale operates (read more about Vale's strategy on page 36 and Vale's risk management on page 68).\n\nVale updated its materiality matrix in 2020. The study was conducted according to the Integrated Reporting Guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), to identify priority topics that signi/ficantly impact the organization's value creation in the short, medium and long term.\n\nIt also followed the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), thus involving the main stakeholders in identifying and prioritizing these topics, with /final approval of the materiality matrix by the company's Sustainability Committee.\n\nFor each topic, GRI indicators, Metals & Mining indicators of the Sustainability Accounting Standard (SASB) and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were identi/fied. The materiality study involved the steps presented below.\n\nThe limit of the impact of material topics considers Vale, the companies over which the company has operational control and its activities.

For the Global target, information may vary due the changes in the volume and source of electricity consumption projected for 2030, as well as energy declarations. For the Brazilian goal, information may vary due to changes in electricity consumption projected for 2025 and the projection of hydroelectric generation depending on hydrological conditions.\n- 3.  The future energy generated from wind projects under implementation by partners (Acau\u00e3, Gravier, Folha Larga, among others) will only be accounted for in this indicator when declarations are obtained from suppliers attesting to the renewable origin of the energy intended for Vale.\n- 4.  Self-production estimated in Brazil in 2025, considering the additional energy from the wind projects destined to be used by Vale and the energy from the Sol do Cerrado project. The wind projects and the solar project add 16 p.p. to the baseline. The increase of the remaining 6 p.p is due to the variation in hydroelectric generation in the current portfolio due to hydrological conditions.\n- 5.  Throughout 2020, Vale revised its social positioning with a focus on becoming an inducer of social capacity in governments, communities and the private sector, aiming to drive the company's investments to meet the real needs for local development. Thus, from 2021, new indicators may be de/fined for better monitoring by theme, to increasingly contribute to Vale's commitments to sustainable development and to the New Pact with Society.",

It is usually conducted by a company hired by Vale that is a reference in senior management appraisals and with the participation of an Independent Consultant.\n\nIn addition to the performance appraisal, the Board of Directors also conducts the annual performance self-assessment. Based on both of these projects, they draw up the development plan for the Board and its members, to promote the evolution of Vale's governance.\n\nThe 2020 mid-term evaluation was carried out by the Board in the last quarter of the year. Among the results obtained, the following are noteworthy:\n\n- \u00b7 Evolution in Most of the Items Evaluated: only 2 of the 22 aspects evaluated did not present an improved evaluation in relation to the end of 2019;\n- \u00b7 Greater Involvement in Critical Issues: the Board has increased its engagement and performance in relation to critical issues such as strategy, capital allocation and business portfolio, executive succession and cultural transformation;\n- \u00b7 Advances in Governance for the Transition to \"Corporation\": Implementation of actions relevant to the new corporate structure, resulting from the end of the shareholders' agreement, with the establishment of the Audit and Nomination Committees;\n- \u00b7 Critical Training strengthening for the Board of Directors: To cover the identi/fied gaps regarding the su/fficient presence of board members with knowledge and experience in the mining sector, as well as relevant executive experience in leading large corporations;\n- \u00b7 Improvement in Group Dynamics: The Board of Directors' discussion and deliberation dynamics have improved, the discussions are more objective and productive, there is more balanced participation among members and less competition for protagonism;\n- \u00b7 More Productive Interaction with Executives: A better alignment is noticed between the Board of Directors and the executives, with a richer and more productive exchange in which the BoD contributes more and challenges the executives more in regards to their proposals.\n\nGovernance\n\n## Main opportunities for improvement\n\n- \u00b7 Improvement in Group Dynamics: The Board of Directors' discussion and deliberation dynamics have improved, the discussions are more objective and productive, there is more balanced participation among members and less competition for protagonism;\n- \u00b7 More Productive Interaction with Executives: A better alignment is noticed between the BD and the executives, with a richer and more productive exchange in which the BD contributes more and challenges the executives more in regards to their proposals;\n- \u00b7 Board Member Onboarding: Resume and reinforce the onboarding process for new members, which was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to provide knowledge about the company, the industry, the executives, the company's governance, the priority agenda of the Board and the topics under discussion;\n- \u00b7 Information Provision: Improve and optimize the information submitted for evaluation, seeking greater objectivity and focus on the most important messages;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Meeting Agendas: Optimize the agendas of board meetings, in order to allocate more time to the debate and deepening of strategic issues for the company's business;\n- \u00b7 Critical competencies: The de/finition of the required competencies set for the Board and the committees, being addressed by the Nomination Committee, will potentialize the reinforcement of Vale's Board, through the college composition, in line with the mapped competencies; Regarding the individual assessment of board members, there was a positive evolution, with a higher overall assessment by most board members.

De-characterization (or decommissioning) is the process that eliminates the characteristics or function of the dam, mitigating the risk to neighboring communities and the environment. After the works have been completed, the structure loses its capacity to retain tailings and water, and is reincorporated into the local environment.\n\n## Status of the de-characterization plan\n\nThe upstream structure de-characterization plan was updated in September 2020, based on information and studies on Vale's structures that are being continuously updated, considering 29 geotechnical structures, comprising: 14 dams, 13 dikes and 2 drained stacks. In addition to the structures to be de-characterized, we have adopted another plan to build containment structures downstream from some dams to reduce their impacts on people and the environment. These structures act as a barrier to contain tailings in the event of dam failure.\n\nIn 2019, the de-characterization of the 8B Dam and Dikes 2 and 3 at Kalunga were completed. In 2020, Vale completed other important milestones:\n\n- \u00b7 De-characterization of the Pondes de Rejeitos Damcompleted in September 2020, currently awaiting the evaluation of the de-characterization by the National Mining Agency.\n- \u00b7 De-characterization of the Rio de Peixe Dike, completed in December 2020, waiting for the evaluation of the decharacterization by the National Mining Agency and the State Environmental Foundation;.\n- \u00b7 Construction of the B3/B4 dam containment, a structure 33 meters high with the capacity to retain all tailings from the B3/B4 Dam in case of rupture, completed in October 2020.\n- \u00b7 Phase 1 of the containment structure downstream from the Forquilhas and Grupo Dams, completed in September 2020, reaching the elevation 949 (77 meters) high with the capacity to retain all tailings of Forquilhas III or Forquilhas I and IV Dams, or Forquilhas II and IV Dams, in case of rupture. Phase 2 will be completed in 2021, with a height of 95 meters and the capacity to retain all the tailings of Forquilhas I, II, III, IV and Grupo Dams, in case of simultaneous rupture of all structures.\n- \u00b7 Commencement in third quarter 2020 of preliminary and infrastructure works, which launch the decharacterization of the Sul Superior Dam, and the commencement in fourth quarter 2020 of the decharacterization of B3/B4 Dam with the /first stage of the removal of PDE X, a structure upstream from this dam.\n\nThere are in the dam decharacterization plan:\n\n29 geotechnical structures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 drained stacks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSerra Norte Dam, Caraj\u00e1s (PA) Photo: Ricardo Teles\n\n<!-- image -->",

Raising is built in the opposite direction of the water /flow (upstream). The dam requires coarse tailings so that the shell can be built. 2 Dam Level: Indicator for the volume of the material conditioned in the dam and its safety conditions. Currently, there are four: Level 0: It indicates the normal status. Level 1: It indicates some instability. The 24-hour reinforced monitoring begins. Level 2: It indicates everyone shall evacuate the Self-Rescue Zone as soon as the sirens are actuated. This evacuation procedure will be assisted by Vale and the Civil Defense. Level 3: This level indicates that the people in the Secondary Safety Zone shall be provided with assistance through educational measures and evacuation training. These trainings are scheduled by the Civil Defense and previously communicated to the local population. The sirens are also actuated to certify that there is no one in the Self-Rescue Zone.

The CPI remains active, with periodic sessions in the Espirito Santo Legislative Assembly.\n\nAt the same time, as a result of an environmental investigation conducted by the Federal Police through Police Inquiry 523/2014, investigating the practice of environmental crime, an injunction was /filed against the company. In a precautionary measure in which the Federal Police requested the temporary suspension of the exercise of economic activity by Vale, in the Port of Tubar\u00e3o, until e/ffective measures were applied to avoid potential environmental damage resulting from the fall of iron ore and emission of particulate matters into the atmosphere and the maritime area.\n\nThe Federal Justice of Espirito Santo ordered the suspension of Vale's activities at Pier II and Coal Pier of Tubar.o Port. Vale's operations were paralyzed for four days, when, after a judicial appeal /filed by Vale, the Federal Regional Court of the Second Region suspended the e/ffects of the injunction. Due to the environmental control measures implemented by Vale, and mainly due to the signing of the Environmental Commitment Term, which will be explained in more depth below, both the Police Inquiry and the Precautionary Measure were closed.\n\nVale acts and invests continuously in the improvement of environmental control systems. The entire production system at Tubar\u00e3o Complex - from the arrival of the ore to loading onto ships - is carried out using available environmental control technologies. To improve atmospheric emissions control, in 2018 Vale voluntarily signed an Environmental Commitment Term with the Public Ministry of the State of Espirito Santo, the Federal Public Ministry and the State Government to implement 48 dust reduction targets, as recommended by the Environmental Company of the State of Sao Paulo (Cetesb) and the State Environmental Agency, after a technical assessment of the Tubar\u00e3o Complex.\n\nVale will invest, until 2023, approximately USD 200 million for the implementation of these measures, which foresee the implementation of more than 6 km of new wind fences in the product storage yards; adequacy and/or enclosure of around 40 km of conveyor belts and more than 1,000 transfer points. The company will also invest in the installation of 14 fog cannons with a range of up to 150 meters in the pellet yards; coverage of more than 13,000 m2 of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduct and input handling areas; and sprinkling, with a cellulose-based product, on ore and coal stockpiles. With these investments, Vale expects to reduce, in comparison to 2010, 93% of its dust emissions from di/ffuse sources, such as yards, piers, belt conveyors, among others, going from an emission rate of around 300 kg/h (2010) to 21 kg/h in 2023. For the pelletizing plant chimneys, although complying with legal limits, Vale is seeking, as an emission limit, a concentration standard lower or equal to 15 mg/Nm3 from the European Community, much more restrictive than the national limit (70 mg/ Nm3) and the one established in the Operation License - LO 123/18, of 40 mg/ Nm3.\n\nLearn more about the actions taken on the QR Code below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learn more\n\nhttp://www.vale.com/brasil/PT/sustainability/ vale-nas-comunidades/espirito-santo/Paginas/ default.aspx",

        "page_content": "## Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions GRI 103 | 303\n\nIn 2020, Vale's activities resulted in the emission of approximately 490.8 million tons of CO2e1 . The company acknowledges that it is only possible to lead the mining industry towards a low-carbon economy if we transform the value chain to meet this objective.\n\nVale's Scope 3 emissions (from our suppliers and customers) represent most of its total emissions, but they are not under our direct control. They represent almost 98% of the total emissions of 2020.\n\nScope 1 direct emissions (fuels, industrial processes and other smaller sources) and Scope 2 indirect emissions Market-based2 (purchase of electricity) totaled around 10.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020, a reduction of 14.9% in relation to the previous year and of 27.2% in regards to 2017, the base year of Scope 1 and 2 reduction goal. GRI 305-1 | 305-2 | 305-5\n\n1 Sum of Scope 1, Scope 2 Marked-based (the \"purchasing choice\" approach), and Scope 3 Emissions.\n\n2 Considering Scope 2 Location-based approach, the emissions of Scope 1 and 2 added together totaled 10,6 tCO 2 e in 2020, since Scope 2 Location-based in 2020 resulted in 1.0 million tCO 2 e. Scope 2 Locationbased is based on grid emission factors (interconnected electrical system), of a country or region. to calculate the emissions from the electricity purchased, while Scope 2 Marked-based is based on free market electricity contracts, considering speci/fic emission factors for the type of generation technology and energy source, when applicable.\n\nThe reduction in total emissions observed between 2019 and 2020 is due, especially, to the fact that the company still has a re/flection in production volume as a result of the Brumadinho dam collapse and the Covid-19 pandemic e/ffects. However, the emissions intensity per ton of iron ore equivalent3 in 2020 was 25.9 kg CO2e/t MFe-eq. It was slightly lower than the intensity in the year 2017, which was 26.6 kg CO2e/t MFe-eq. This shows that Vale's emissions pro/file is still strongly correlated to production, despite a marginal improvement in energy intensity. GRI 305-4\n\nThe company's emissions are also expected to peak by 2023, due to the 400 Mtpa expected production of iron ore capacity by the end of 2022. Thereafter, the absolute emission reduction trajectory and its consequent decouple from the production process will occur with the implementation of the new initiatives of larger scale emission reduction under development.\n\n3.  The iron ore equivalent indicator takes the production of iron ore, our main product, as a parameter to account for the production of the company's other products, such as coal, nickel and copper.

With an installed capacity of 766 peak megawatts and scheduled to come on stream in the fourth quarter of 2022, the project will produce approximately 193 average megawatts (MWmed) of energy per year for Vale's operations. The solar project is part of a total of USD 2 billion in investments made by Vale to reduce carbon emissions, which will be one of the largest in Latin America.\n\nVale's roadmap of self-production projects also includes participation, through Alian\u00e7a Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Energia S.A., in the Gravier and Acau\u00e3 wind projects in Cear\u00e1 and Rio Grande do Norte states, respectively, which total 181 MW of installed capacity, with 55% of their output going to Vale, starting in 2022.\n\nVale also has an option to purchase 60% or 100% of the shares of the Folha Larga Sul wind project in Campo Formoso (Bahia State). It has an installed capacity of 151.2 MW and is already in operation, with 60% of its production destined for Vale or its subsidiaries by 2023.\n\n## Generation of solar energy with storage in lithium-ion batteries\n\nIn 2020, at the Ilha Gua\u00edba Port Terminal (in Mangaratiba, Rio de Janeiro state), Vale installed the largest energy-storage system with lithiumion batteries in the country to supply its electrical demand. In addition to strengthening energy supply management and reducing costs, this initiative is part of our strategy to replace fossil fuels.\n\n## Electric locomotive GRI 103 | 302\n\nAs part of Vale's Powershift* program to replace energy sources with clean sources, the company has developed a new, 100% electric, battery-powered shunting yard locomotive in partnership with Progress Rail. It is currently in the testing and commissioning phase. The equipment also reduces noise emissions.\n\n- 1  A structured program to coordinate and execute initiatives and strategies to achieve the company's GHG goal.\n\n## Energy-E/fficiency Program\n\nA large part of GHG emissions is directly linked to our operations' energy consumption, so we know that energy e/fficiency is a key factor for reducing GHG emissions and optimizing costs.\n\nVale's Energy-E/fficiency Program aims to include the topic of energy e/fficiency in a structured way into operational routines, making employees think systematically about initiatives that promote energy e/fficiency in their processes. This work is being developed globally through multidisciplinary groups in each operation and supported by SmartEnergy, the platform responsible for managing electricity consumption throughout the company, providing automated energy-e/fficiency indicators.\n\nIn addition to making a signi/ficant contribution to reducing GHG emissions, the Energy E/fficiency Program also addresses ESG issues by creating indicators of energy intensity consumed by product, as well as by setting targets for increasing energy e/fficiency, which will occur throughout 2021. In 2022, with centralized governance and energy-e/fficiency indicators in the management routine, the goal is to obtain certi/fication in ISO 50,001, the main international reference in energy management.\n\nAiming to ensure transparency, traceability and reliability of the data needed to manage energy consumption, by 2021 we intend to automate both the collection and monitoring of indicators for 80% of Vale's energy matrix.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The VNC plant was not a/ffected, located 7 km away from the area.\n\nOperations were halted until safe working conditions and community conditions prevailed. There were no victims, environmental damage or industrial accidents. After the evacuation of the VNC, the operation was protected by military forces (Gendarmes).\n\nVale repudiates these acts of violence and rea/ffirms its commitment to the safety and protection of the unit's employees and the local community, and unconditionally supports e/fforts to resolve this situation peacefully.\n\n## Fatalities and causes\n\nEven with advances in implementing health and safety measures, there were four fatalities at Vale in 2020. These incidents show that we still have a long way to go to create a fatality-free environment.\n\nOf a total of four fatalities, one involved a direct employee (in Salobo) and three involved outsourced employees (in Moatize, Salobo and Mina do Feij\u00e3o).\n\nThe following table shows the number of fatalities of our own and outsourced employees at Vale in 2018, 2019 and 2020, followed by a brief description of the accidents that occurred in 2020.\n\n## Fatalities\n\n|   Year |   Contractors |   Employees |\n|--------|---------------|-------------|\n|   2018 |             1 |           1 |\n|   2019 |           118 |         124 |\n|   2020 |             3 |           1 |\n\nIn January, at the Tete Mine in Moatize (Mozambique), a fatal accident occurred when a contractor's employee was making cuts on the edge of a conveyor belt near the tensioning car drum.\n\nIn November, a fatal incident was reported in the mine equipment workshop at Salobo, Par\u00e1 (Brazil), during the replacement of a dump truck's weighbridge cylinder.\n\nIn December, another fatal accident occurred in the centralized maintenance workshop at Salobo, Par\u00e1 (Brazil), during a hydraulic cylinder change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA worker operating a hydraulic excavator to perform berm/ slope cleaning was also hit by a landslide from the localized and contained slope at the C\u00f3rrego do Feij\u00e3o Mine in Minas Gerais (Brazil) in December.\n\nAll investigations were conducted by internal investigation teams, led by an executive from another operation in a neutral and impartial position. Global subject matter experts, employees and the Internal Commissions for Accident Prevention (CIPA) were directly involved.\n\nThe cases and lessons learned are shared in a webcast session and, following these incidents, mandatory comprehensive actions now must be executed across Vale as a whole. These actions are now the focus of round table discussions involving all leaders and their work groups.",

The company adopts performance-based compensation that balances growth opportunities among employees.\n\nVale respects the local minimum wage and base wages do not di/ffer between men and women who perform the same function, according to our Human Resources Policy. Variations may occur due to employees' seniority and maturity levels.\n\nVale's remuneration, paid to employees, complies with each country's legislation. It consists of salaries and the following bene/fits (which vary according to legislation): medical assistance; dental care; life insurance; private pension; personal accident insurance; transportation assistance; educational assistance; food assistance and the employee assistance program. With the new COVID-19 pandemic scenario, some additions and adaptations were made to the bene/fits package.\n\n## Employees covered by collective agreements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collective Negotiation Agreements GRI 103 | 102-41\n\nTo seek a balanced and productive relationship with the entities that collectively represent its employees, Vale has participated in meetings with these institutions' representatives to address the relevant issues. These meetings strengthen dialogue and transparency and contribute to our operations' stability for the company. All Vale employees are free to join the unions. This commitment is stated in the company's Code of Conduct. In some localities, the percentage of voluntary association with unions exceeds 50% of the workforce.\n\nVale does not impose any restriction or discrimination on employees who join labour unions, in accordance with the company's Code of Conduct. In some locations, the percentage of voluntary association exceeds 50% of the workforce.\n\nVale negotiates and concludes collective agreements with all representative unions. Company representatives build balanced\n\nand productive relationships with unions, with regular meetings throughout the year to discuss relevant issues. Vale believes that these meetings strengthen dialogue and transparency and contribute to the stability of operations.\n\nIn Brazil, 100% of our employees were reached through collective agreements with unions in 2020. Considering all the countries where Vale operates, the percentage remained above 95%. 55 Collective Work Agreements (National ACTs, Specific ACTs and PLR ACTs) were forged with 14 unions in 2020. Many of these were to change procedures to prevent COVID-19.\n\nWe also concluded labour negotiations related to the collapse of the tailings dam in Brumadinho (Minas Gerais state), with the participation of State inspection bodies, such as the Labour Prosecutor's Office. Collective negotiations were carried out by video call, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By providing this technological solution and updating some internal instructors to use these technologies, Vale made it possible to keep on track with the training plan by delivering massive amounts of training in virtual formats. This increased the average number of training hours compared to 2019 for the leadership (14%) and specialist (11%) audiences with the massive delivery of training in virtual formats.\n\nAn example that conveys how quickly we adapted to the new scenario was the Annual Meeting of Experts and Operational Improvement. Presented in a 100% virtual format, it attracted about 8 thousand participants over two days and included project presentations, lectures, an exhibition fair, and networking.\n\nIn 2020, we maintained our focus on the technical specialization of engineers and geologists through post-graduate programs adapted for virtual formats. Topics included Geotechnics, Open Pit Mining, Mining Process Automation, Maintenance, Process Safety Management and Operational Risks, in addition to Master's degrees in the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Instrumentation and Control and Automation of Mining Processes, aimed at around 170 employees globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Drivers of this strategy include promoting a safe environment and respecting the singularities of each person. The objective is to become an inclusive and authentic company, grounded in open and transparent dialogue, where all employees are respected and can be proud of who they are, feel recognized, have a voice and have the opportunity to develop their potential - regardless of race, ethnicity, skin color, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, religion, social condition, origin or disability. In addition, Vale seeks to guarantee transparent, fair and prejudice-free processes for hiring, evaluating, promoting, and involving a diverse workforce; to prohibit any type of harassment, discrimination or prejudice; and to stimulate discussion about and increase awareness of diversity.\n\nIn this sense, Vale has adopted the goal to double the number of women working in the company from 13% to 26% by 2030, and increase their presence in senior leadership from 12% to 20%. This commitment is in line with our Global Policy on Diversity and Inclusion, Global Human Rights Policy and Code of Conduct.\n\n- \u00b7  We reached 16.3% representation of women in 2020 compared to 13.5% in 2019.\n- \u00b7  We reached 15.9% of women in senior leadership (executive manager positions and above) compared to 12.4% in 2019, a 28% increase of women in senior leadership positions.\n- \u00b7  We reduced the rate of voluntary termination of women by 33.5%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To do this we must establish a relationship of respect and inclusion, anchored in an open and transparent dialogue, which are also essential for constructing psychologically healthy environments and for sustainably developing our business.\n\nIn September 2020, we launched the Ethnic-Racial Equity A/ffinity Group. Formed by Vale's employees, it aims to promote ethnic-racial discussions and propose practical actions.\n\nThe group's strategy focuses on four guidelines: starting employees on the learning journey at Valer Digital to reduce stereotypes about our ethnicracial population; holding Vale events in an ongoing agenda to raise awareness to help people understand inequalities; engaging leadership in ethnic-racial equality; and carrying out a recruitment program, career progression, training and talent development based upon ethnic and racial inclusion and diversity. Among the initiatives and results of 2020, these are our highlight accomplishments:\n\n- \u00b7 Launched the Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy, formalizing our commitment to building psychologically healthy, respectful, inclusive environments and equal access to opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Conducted workshops, campaigns, webinars and conversation circles on topics such as gender, racism, sexual orientation and disability, which reached more than 15 thousand participants;\n- \u00b7 Conducted a workshop on diversity and inclusion with Vale's senior leadership to broaden the vision of our leadership on the agenda and make it possible to identify opportunities for projects and actions in the company;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Trained more than 2,580 leaders on issues related to diversity and inclusion, such as unconscious biases, inclusive leadership and gender intelligence;\n- \u00b7 Hosting reverse mentoring sessions for conceptual deepening with the Executive Board on gender, racial-ethnic equity and LGBTQIA+;\n- \u00b7 Formed the Ethnic-Racial Equity A/ffinity Group and an LGBTQIA+ a/ffinity group that have been fundamental to accelerating Vale's Diversity and Inclusion journey;\n- \u00b7 Implemented training programs for the HR team.;\n- \u00b7 Implemented the Trainee Program with a blind selection process - thinking of a pipeline of future leaders, 50% of the vacancies were allocated to men and 50% to women;\n- \u00b7 Created a Professional Training Program exclusively for women in operations in Brazil and Canada, and hired approximately 500 women;\n- \u00b7 Professionally trained Indigenous people to work in our Voisey's Bay operations, increasing their representation by 41% in the workforce of this location;",

It also monitored the status of the plans' actions and carried out quarterly reports to the Board. GRI 103 | 410\n\nAlso, in 2020, based on feedback from the operational areas, and seeking alignment with Vale's Business Risk Management model, the evaluation process was revised and optimized.\n\nThe Bowtie method of risk analysis was adopted to structure the risk of Human Rights Violations, allowing its registration and monitoring in Vale's operations through the new global uni/fied risk management platform, the BWise system.\n\nThrough the Bowtie method, the risk situations analyzed in 2019 were reorganized in 2020, in a list of causes of the risk of Human Rights Violations. The causes were grouped into six critical human rights themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Degrading Work Conditions and Modern Slavery; GRI 103 | 409\n- \u00b7 Child Labor and Child Sexual Exploitation; GRI 103 | 408\n- \u00b7 Violation in Labor Relations;\n- \u00b7 Violation of Communities;\n- \u00b7 Violation Resulting from the Private or Public Security Conduct;\n- \u00b7 Large-scale violation.\n\nIn 2019, 82% of operations carried out the Human Rights risk assessment. In 2020, 100% of Vale's operations inserted their risks in the Company's risk management system. The causes considered applicable by Vale's operations have preventive or mitigating control measures, or an action plan to review existing controls or adopt new controls. GRI\n\n## 412-1\n\nWhen assessing the risk, calculating its probability of occurrence and the severity of its impact, if the result presents a high or very high criticality, the operation is obliged to develop and implement an action plan with the objective of reducing its risk exposure for keeping it within an acceptable level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Due diligence GRI 103 | 412\n\nIn 2020, as part of the Human Rights management, Vale developed a methodology for carrying out verification or due diligence processes.\n\nDuring the year, four types of operational due diligence were carried out - one in an operational site (still in progress), another with critical suppliers (pilot project considered the verification and evaluation of 15 suppliers), a third in the Brumadinho Reparation process (MG) (expected to be completed in 2021), and another in 127 Vale's worker's lodging, in Par\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, and Minas Gerais. GRI 102-9\n\nThe results of these evaluations are integrated into the management of Vale and its projects, in a process of continuous improvement.\n\nRegarding critical issues such as forced labor, child labor, child sexual exploitation and human tra/fficking, Vale establishes risk management at all stages of the life cycle of its projects. There is a special focus on respecting and promoting the human rights of children and adolescents and vulnerable groups. To this end, the Company prioritizes and establishes a continuous engagement process with communities in the areas\n\nof in/fluence of the projects, implements partnerships with Childhood Brasil and InPacto with preventive and mitigating actions, acts through Vale Foundation in structuring social programs, contributes to the strengthening of the public social protection network and works directly with children and their families.\n\n## GRI 103 | 408\n\nIn 2020, there was no record or complaint involving Vale and child labor or modern slavery, nor young people exposed to dangerous work, forced or compulsory labor and human tra/fficking in any of the Company's operations.

In this regard, Vale acknowledges the importance of respecting the rights of these populations and the management of risks and impacts of the Company's activities on these communities.\n\nVale's relationship with indigenous peoples and traditional communities is aligned with the main industry and international standards and commitments such as the ICMM position statement on Mining and Indigenous Peoples, Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), and the United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nIn Brazil, the Company has a multidisciplinary Indigenous relations team, with more than 20 professionals dedicated to the engagement, dialogue, and active listening. In other countries, Vale has di/fferent structures, always with quali/fied professionals who work guided by the above-mentioned references and the Global Human Rights Policy.\n\nVale incorporates the indigenous and traditional communities' topic in a transversal manner in the various internal analysis processes regarding project risks and feasibility, seeking to consider the rights and interests of these communities in the decision making.\n\nWhen planning its projects, we seek to encourage the active participation of Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities in resolving issues related to Vale's activities that generate risks and/or impacts on these populations, allowing free, prior and informed consultation and consent, as well as monitoring compliance with control and/or mitigation measures.\n\nWith a presence in di/fferent countries, cultures, and legal requirements, one of the Company's challenges is to de/fine operational procedures, training, and tools to guide its performance on the topic. To face this challenge, in 2020, a management area was created to standardize the theme globally, to act as the 2nd Line of Defense, providing support, training, and visibility to the relationship processes with indigenous peoples and traditional communities.\n\nCurrently, Vale has relationship plans for all indigenous peoples and traditional communities that inhabit the areas of in/fluence of its activities. In addition to Brazil, in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, Vale partners with the Canadian government and others through the Labrador Aboriginal Training Partnership, to develop skills and training opportunities for hiring. This program has helped more than 2,000 Aboriginal participants explore their career choices and paths and help improve their employment prospects. The Voisey's Bay mine, in Labrador, also conducts a Job Readiness Training Program to help qualify and prepare Aboriginal participants to enter the job market.\n\nCommitted to this agenda, Vale de/fined as one of the pillars of its strategic planning to expand engagement in the indigenous agenda, consisting of three main fronts of action: Preservation of cultural memory; Support for Indigenous Protagonism; and implementation of Sustainable Programs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more\n\nhttp://www.vale.com/esg/en/Pages/\n\nIndigenousPeoplesAndTraditionalCommunity.aspx",

Vale's commitment is that the execution of the process guarantees the return of livelihoods in conditions equivalent to or better than those veri/fied before the involuntary resettlement. The process follows guidelines and standards from international organizations such as International Finance Corporation - IFC, World Bank, UN and ICMM.\n\nIn Brazil, 637 families were served in 2020 in the North (Maranh\u00e3o and Par\u00e1) and South (Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais) Systems. Dam de-characterization led to the care of 171 families in the municipalities of Rio Preto, Itabirito, Bar\u00e3o de Cocais, Mariana and Nova Lima, all located in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\nAt EFVM (Estrada de Ferro Vit\u00f3ria \u00e0 Minas), the involuntary resettlement of 73 families that are irregularly occupying the EFVM domain, in the municipalities of Nova Era and Antonio Dias, in Minas Gerais, is in progress.\n\nVale is committed to carrying out existing agreements with resettled communities in Indonesia. Near the Sorowako mine, Vale has renovated 7 houses for residents of the Ledu-Ledu resettlement area, is improving infrastructure to support social and economic activities like road and drainage facilities, and is helping with the availability of clean water for residents.\n\nIn Mozambique, Vale invested USD 2 million to improve resettlement in Moatize, helping to restore the livelihoods of 712 families resettled in Cateme and 289 resettled in 25 de Setembro. Highlights include urban infrastructure projects, strengthening food security, income generation and a project to provide technical support, quality inputs and access to markets for more than 600 families.\n\nIn 2021, the preparation of the Involuntary Resettlement Assistance Plan (PAR) will be continued, involving the negotiation of agreements with 154 families residing in 2020 in the expansion area of the Moatize Coal Mine Section 2 PIT 3, a process that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Engineering alternatives were found to minimize the resettlement of 1,349 families in Section 5. A new physical and socioeconomic survey will be initiated this year to update the number of families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the Nacala Corridor, in a partnership between Nacala Logistics and the World Food Programme* (WFP), an initiative linked to the United Nations (UN), school lunches are distributed to more than 25,000 elementary school students in the province of Nampula, northern Mozambique (activity partially suspended due to the pandemic, but resumed in March 2021). In addition, farmers supported by the Livelihoods Restitution Program, which is promoted by Vale and includes more than 13 thousand families, are being included in the list of suppliers for this program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021 the development of the Involuntary Resettlment Assistance Plan (PAR) for 154 families in the expansion area of the Moatize Coal Mine will be continued\n\nA program for restoring livelihoods for the /fishermen impacted in Nacala Bay is also being developed, with the engagement of 400 families, who migrated from artisanal /fishing to safe and responsible o/ffshore /fishing and to complementary income generation activities, such as commerce, poultry farming, and agriculture.\n\n* World Food Programme (WFP), which operates within the UN system and is the world's largest humanitarian organization that addresses hunger and promotes food security.",

        "page_content": "## Independent Reader's Letter\n\n## Dr. Rosa Maria Fischer,\n\nSenior Full Professor, School of Economics, Business Administration and Accounting Department of Administration, USP (University of S\u00e3o Paulo)\n\nAs per their commitment of 2019, Vale presents the Integrated Report 2020 (IR) in line with the ESG precepts, which, according to the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), must be di/fferent from their annual Sustainability Report. The IR does not replace the usual corporate reports, but complements them and expands their transparency, as it proposes to explain the narrative of how the company generates value over time for itself and for the various stakeholders in its relationship universe. To this end, it must integrate information about the strategies that have been adopted to manage /financial, natural, manufactured, human, intellectual and social capital - and explain the goals and metrics that have allowed Vale to measure the challenges it faced and the interventions it implemented.\n\nIt must be recognized that, by adopting the Integrated Report, Vale is moving positively towards increasing transparency in its internal and external communications. At the same time, the IR establishes the integrated thinking paradigm that is the foundation\n\nof Vale's management mode, which governs the company's process of reporting on the actions and decisions of each and every one of its managers and also extends their responsibility.\n\nThe text has not yet acquired the most suitable format and content for /fluid reading, as much important information is communicated in other documents and reports, making it di/fficult to understand details. However, since this is the /first time that this type of report has been published, it is understandable that its preparation requires a herculean e/ffort to systematize data, considering the size of the company that operates in /five continents and more than 20 countries.\n\nIt is very signi/ficant that the narrative, right at the beginning with the Repair chapter, opens with the sentence \"We will never forget Brumadinho,\" which reinforces the purpose expressed in the CEO's letter - \"to improve the lives and transform the future of people and communities.\" The meaning goes far beyond the mission of generating prosperity through the transformation of natural resources. It indicates that the painful events of 2019 generated irrevocable learning for the entire company: that Life is the essential and priority value among all its assets. And, by adding to the phrase the vocative \"Together,\" he\n\ncalls on all people to carry out a process to transform the organizational culture, favouring the attitude of generating shared value and seeking to eliminate the connotation of omnipotence in relation to the company's communities and nature.\n\nHowever, it is necessary to point out that, in the business model and in the formulation of the strategy that guides Vale's performance, technical aspects with a focus on engineering and product prevail, without incorporating socio-environmental dimensions, even though these are disseminated throughout the report. In this sense, it is recommended that socioeconomic dimensions be integrated into the core of the company's worldview, expressing that they are intrinsically linked to its business and management models. Although the design of the model clari/fies the relationship between its processes and the respective impacts, it is not clear what the company's value proposition is. This absence allows questions such as: what is the socio-environmental value contributed to the communities a/ffected by Vale's operations? What is your value proposition to customers? Or, to suppliers belonging to your production chain; and so on, in relation to your various stakeholders?\n\nIt cannot be ignored, however, that the Report describes the company's multiple e/fforts to improve the formulation of these guidelines. In this sense, the strategic pillar de/fined as 'New Pact with Society' is the one that best summarizes the progress of this integrated thinking. It materializes, simultaneously, in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVale's role as a facilitator of sustainable development in the locations under its in/fluence and in its high safety and sustainability standards that have been established in its operations.\n\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that this engagement with society in constructing a common future does not happen automatically, with the simple manifestation of an innovative purpose. And here, Vale has a learning path to follow along which it needs to divest itself of its dominant position, and to value the knowledge and experiences of community members to recognize and legitimize their empowerment. It needs, with them, to build solutions to the social, economic, environmental and cultural problems they experience, as well as to outline the possible routes to achieve multidimensional sustainable development in the territories.\n\nThe company's e/fforts to improve its business and management strategies are evident in some of the aspects highlighted in this report. They include constructing a materiality matrix from the opinions and expectations of various stakeholders, which allows Vale to direct and prioritize actions; active listening and technical diagnoses to guide its social investments; maintaining and strengthening commitments to global agreements; and, making investments in innovation, especially those aimed at carbon-neutral mining and technologies that reduce dependence on dams.\n\nThe topic most frequently highlighted by the",

        "page_content": "stakeholders consulted was the one that deals with managing and controlling the safety risks of geotechnical structures. Attesting to its political commitment to the sustainability strategy, Vale declares that it intends to exceed legal requirements, replacing dams with safer processes in line with international practices. This statement provokes relief and enthusiasm, mainly because it presents a decommissioning schedule for these structures; however, it is recommended that Vale share its goals to implement these practices with the populations involved, allowing them to monitor this solution and collectively build this future scenario.\n\nSome points to be highlighted in the company's environmental goals are: to use 100% renewable energy in its production by 2025 in Brazil and by 2030 in other countries; to achieve carbon-emission neutrality by 2050; and, to recover and protect relevant areas in biodiversity. Vale is expected to assume a leading position, appropriate to its size and representativeness in the business world, going beyond mitigating the impacts generated by its operations. It is suggested that the company should assume more ambitious goals, such as the one mentioned in the letter from the CEO to join the most recent movement of international companies to limit the growth of global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Or it is suggested that they incorporate biodiversity regenerative practices into\n\nLetters\n\nVale\n\ntheir strategies in their own areas and those of third parties, especially those in the Legal Amazon region. Currently, such strategies have only developed within the scope of the Vale Fund.\n\nWith regard to risk management, the role of the Operational Excellence and Risk Committee, which advises the Board of Directors and the Executive Committees, are emphasized in the IR. These are responsible for disseminating preventive monitoring and the culture of continuous management, as well as the model of lines of defense referenced by strict standards. In this context, the implementation of Hazard Identi/fication and Risk Assessment (HIRA) shows a tendency for the company to invest in raising the level of the parameters used to analyze operational safety, although it is not clear what types of critical controls have been identi/fied and what respective solutions have been implemented.\n\nThe IR highlights important advances Vale has implemented in damage recovery measures, such as improving technical and operational safety strategies and relationships with communities, mainly from the tragedies experienced in Mariana and Brumadinho. However, speci/fic information is scarce in the text, which indicates what remains to be done, as well as when and how it will be done. In short, complete information is very necessary in this topic. For example,\n\nwhen justifying the delay in works in Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu due to the epidemic, it would be necessary to design updated targets and schedules to highlight the company's commitments to the families a/ffected by the evacuation of the damaged territories. Or, when reporting on actions to support the small farmers of Brumadinho, it would be enlightening to indicate the increase in income generation that has been achived for these bene/ficiaries, the perspectives of expanding this type of service to the other workers a/ffected, and the e/ffective possibilities of promoting new local small and medium-sized enterprises. As well as admitting the complexity inherent in paying indemnities, this is not su/fficient justi/fication for omitting more precise and agile schedules and goals to accelerate these processes.\n\nAlso noteworthy is Vale's improved communication channels that facilitate quali/fied listening and agile responses. In communicating with shareholders through the ESG Portal, the recommendations for the criteria to establish managers' remuneration should be weighted by the executives' adherence to collective goals and their ful/fillment of individual goals. In this sense, one of the answers was to attribute a signi/ficant percentage of managers' remuneration to their e/fforts to achieve the collective goal of cultural transformation, which indicates the importance attributed to this process of change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt would be advisable for the company's people management practices to contemplate the prospect of gradually increasing the weight of adherence to the desired cultural standards when grading employee performance, using objective metrics to assess 'key behaviours.' It is also important, to internalize the company values, that Vale invests in personal and professional development actions focused on the themes of generating socio-environmental value, biodiversity conservation, and respect for diversity and human rights.\n\nThis is because the company's organizational culture faces a process of transformation that is quite bold and that may su/ffer from slowness and obstructions if it is not promoted in a persistent manner and politically legitimized by the leadership. With investments in citizenship training for its employees, Vale will be able to advance in improving its ESG agenda and consolidate the cultural transformation announced in this Integrated Report.",

In the same chapter, Vale also presents information on the actions taken in relation to the dams that o/ffer the greatest risk (Alert Level 3);\n- \u00b7 In the course of our Assurance the inconsistencies found in the Report, regarding one or more principles of the GRI and the sector supplement, were satisfactorily corrected;\n- \u00b7 Vale published data or justi/fied the absence of data regarding the indicators associated to material aspects of the GRI and the sector supplement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Findings Against The Mining Principles Of The International Council On Mining & Metals (ICMM)\n\n- \u00b7 During the documentary veri/fication of compliance against the Mining Principles, we found su/fficient evidence regarding the adherence to the policies and procedures adopted by Vale, through a selfassessment process carried out by the company;\n- \u00b7 Regarding the information prepared to comply with the ICMM Mining Principles, we are of the opinion that the forms assessed by our team are complete and clear, with respect to the content de/fined for each Principle;\n- \u00b7 We evidenced that the self-assessment carried out demonstrates su/fficient compliance to all ICMM Principles.\n\n## Our Findings Against The International <IR> Framework\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic focus and future orientation: The Report presents in a very brief way the creation of Vale's value, whereas the IR requires a demonstration, for each of the 8 capitals, in the short, medium and long term. We recommend discussing with stakeholders the need for an approach to each of Vale's business separately, since the IIRC aims to focus on stakeholders with predominantly economic interest;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Connectivity of Information: IR requires analysis towards the future with a certain emphasis on economic issues, related to the capitals. The current model of Report is largely focused on accountability and does not, systematically, project future scenarios based on information connectivity;\n- \u00b7 Stakeholders Relationships: Although we have evidenced a mature stakeholder consultation process for de/fining material topics and addressing internal actions, the Report does not demonstrate the interests and needs detailed by engaged stakeholder groups. The IR focuses on this accountability and requires insights about the nature and quality of relations with key stakeholders, including how and to what extent Vale responds to their demands;\n- \u00b7 Materiality: The materiality assessment could further analyze the value perspective, guiding the engagement process always in the short, medium and long term vision, since this issue of temporality is applicable to several IR requirements;\n- \u00b7 Conciseness: Considering to the material topics reported and recommendations described in this Statement, we understand that there is great adherence to this Principle;\n- \u00b7 Reliability and Completeness: We understand that the information in the Report is consistent with the Principle of reliability and Completeness,\n\nwith due regard for the other recommendations in this Statement;\n\n- \u00b7 Consistency and Comparability: We are of the opinion that the Report is adequately consistent. Regarding Comparability, we understand that there is still space to analyze and report information with a focus on the IR Content Elements, such as risks and opportunities and Outlook, where the uncertainty factors shall be taken into account.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n- \u00b7 Deepen the understanding and disclose in a consistent way the signi/ficant indirect economic impacts (indicator GRI-203-2);\n- \u00b7 Report the number of cases of work-related ill health and the number of fatalities as a result of work-related ill health, related to workers who are not employees (GRI 403-10 indicator);\n- \u00b7 Improve the disclosure of data on the signi/ficant negative impacts of Vale's activities (indicator 413-2), extracting information from the existing system of control and treatment of communication (complaints, questions etc) of local communities;\n- \u00b7 Continue the installation of water meters at points that are relevant to water resources indicators (GRI 303), reducing the use of estimates;\n- \u00b7 Plan actions to increase adherence to the IIRC Guideline.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs a result of our assurance, the evidence presented to us and in accordance with the scope of work de/fined in this statement, nothing has come to our attention that would indicate that:\n\n- \u00b7 The information presented in the Report is not balanced, consistent and reliable;\n- \u00b7 Vale has not established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data used in the Report;\n- \u00b7 The Report does not adhere to the Comprehensive option and does not comply with the Principles for de/fining content and ensuring the quality of the GRI Standards, including the Mining & Metals Sector Disclosures;\n- \u00b7 Vale does not comply with the ICMM Mining Principles, based on a de/fined process of selfassessment.\n\n## Declaration of Independence and Impartiality\n\nBureau Veritas Certi/fication is an independent professional services /firm specializing in Quality, Health, Safety, Social and Environmental Management, with more than 185 years' experience in independent assessment.\n\nBureau Veritas has a quality management system that is certi/fied by a third party, according towhich\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npolicies and documented procedures are maintained for the compliance with ethic, professional and legal requirements.\n\nThe assessment team has no links with Vale and the assessment is performed independently.\n\nBureau Veritas implemented and follows a Code of Ethics throughout its business, in order to assure that its sta/ff preserve high ethical, integrity, objectivity, con/fidentiality and competence/ professional attitude standards in the performance of their activities.
