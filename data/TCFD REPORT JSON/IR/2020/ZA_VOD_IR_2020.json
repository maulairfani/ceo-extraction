These SDGs articulate what a better future means and help us set a clear long-term plan to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for everyone by 2030. We contribute to SDGs that we signed up for to uplift societies in conjunction with governments. We aim to sustainably create value through our core business of increasing access to reliable and accessible data and voice services, and we continue leveraging our mobile network services to help us achieve the goals envisaged by the UN. This also enables us to meet national and global developmental objectives, such as rebuilding economies severely affected by COVID-19, while simultaneously promoting inclusive and sustainable action as we start to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Refer to https://sdgs.un.org/goals for more information on the UN SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe identified and prioritised eight SDGs that are most aligned with our core business - those we believe, we can contribute to the most.

In this report, we provide context on why we believe the Vodacom Group (hereafter referred to as the Group or Vodacom) is a good long-term investment. We also reflect on the past year's performance and take a look at our vision for the future.\n\nOur integrated report tells the story of how we create long-term value, our approach to achieving strong financial growth and how we deliver on our core purpose to connect for a b etter future . It also provides qualitative and quantitative information about how we positioned Vodacom for success across all our markets in a rapidly changing world.\n\nWe recognise that our ability to deliver value ultimately depends on maintaining the quality of our relationships with our key stakeholders, as well as the health of the societies and economies where we operate. It is equally important to understand how we\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS\n\nakumzi\n\nMacozoma\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Ott y\n\nLeanne Wood\n\nPierre K l otz\n\nC l ive Thomson\n\nAnne O'Lear y\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detail on our Board, refer to page 96.\n\nWe are accountable for our actions, and by holding us to this, we can continue creating value for the next 25 years. We encourage our stakeholders to share their views on this report, our performance and our strategic roadmap for delivering sustainable value.

To this end, we unpack our system of advantage to explain how we create meaningful and tangible value in pursuit of our purpose.\n\nAs the Board, we acknowledge our responsibility to ensure the integrity of this integrated report. We collectively prepared and interrogated the content included in this report and ensured that it materially complies with the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC's) International <IR> Framework. We believe this report addresses all material matters and presents a balanced and fair account of the Group's performance for the financial year ended 31 March 2021. It is an accurate reflection of our strategic commitments for the short (less than 12 months), medium (one to three years) and long term (beyond three years). We applied our judgement regarding the disclosure of the Group's strategic plans and ensured these disclosures do not place Vodacom at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nGuided by the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee, the Board approved the integrated report and the consolidated AFS on 04 June 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhuthi Mahan\n\ny\n\ne\n\nl\n\ne-\n\nDa\n\nb\n\nengwa\n\nS\n\nhamee\n\nl\n\nJoosu\n\nb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## out    this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting b oundar y and scope\n\nThis report provides a holistic yet succinct overview of Vodacom's strategy (page 42) and business model (page 20), principal risks and associated opportunities (page 36), operational performance (page 88) and governance practices (page 94) for the financial year ended 31 March 2021. The information included in this report relates to our activities at Group level, and those of our operating subsidiaries. Both financial and non-financial data from subsidiaries are fully consolidated.\n\nWe assessed issues significantly impacting value creation and examined areas beyond financial reporting. This is to identify and address all risks and opportunities to our business, and the effects of our activities. In making these assessments, we must consider short, medium and long-term implications.\n\n## Reporting frameworks\n\nOur reporting process was guided by the principles and requirements in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); the International <IR> Framework, the King IV Report on Corporate Governance TM for South Africa, 2016 (King IV) 1 ; the JSE Limited Listings Requirements (JSE Listings Requirements); the Companies Act, 2008, as amended (Companies Act); and the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI's) Sustainability Reporting Standards. We also provided extracts from the consolidated AFS in this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full set of consolidated AFS and a suite of additional reports are available online or can be requested from our Company Secretary.\n\nVodacom's Social and Ethics Committee fulfilled its mandate as prescribed by the regulations to the Companies Act, and there are no instances of material non-compliance to disclose.\n\n## Materia l it y\n\nThis report provides information on all matters we believe could substantively affect our value creation in a structured narrative. Our materiality determination process helps\n\nidentify and prioritise the material matters to be included in this report. The process undertaken to identify the material matters is outlined on page 3.\n\nWe also review who we are and how we create value (page 14), identify matters that significantly impact on value (pages 6 and 7) and outline our strategy, performance and governance practices in ensuring long-term value creation (pages 42 to 79).\n\n## Integrated thinking\n\nIntegrated thinking is a fundamental part of managing our business, developing our internal strategy, and reporting on our activities. We developed our system of advantage to ensure we effectively manage the resources and relationships needed to create sustainable value. A considered assessment of the six capitals (as referred to in the International <IR> Framework) informed both our strategy and the materiality determination process used to compile this report's content and structure.\n\n## Com b ined assurance\n\nWe use a combined assurance model for assurance from management and internal and external providers. Ernst & Young Inc. audited our consolidated 2021 AFS and subsequently gave an unmodified opinion thereon. While sections of our consolidated AFS included in this report were extracted from audited information, such sections are not audited herein.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. undertook a limited assurance engagement on selected elements of our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in South Africa. This is detailed in our 2021 sustainability report. The symbol ^ indicates external assurance.\n\nOur Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee provides assurance to the Board annually, in line with the combined assurance plan. The Group's internal audit function assesses financial, operating, compliance and risk management controls. The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee oversees the assessment.\n\n## Our reporting b oundaries\n\nWhere only data for Vodacom South Africa is available - which represents 72.7% of service revenue and 78.2% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) we indicate this with #. We use * to indicate normalised growth. Normalised growth presents performance on a comparable basis. This adjusts for trading foreign exchange, foreign currency fluctuation on a constant currency basis (using the current year as base) and excludes the impact of merger, acquisition and disposal activities, at a constant currency basis where applicable, to show a like-for-like comparison of results.\n\nAll growth rates quoted are year-on-year and refer to the year ended 31 March 2021 compared with the year ended 31 March 2020, unless stated otherwise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our commitment to our purpose and our Social Contract - guided by three core principles - trust, fairness and leadership - helped us to strategically and systematically mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our stakeholders. Our overarching objectives were the following:\n\nConnected our governments and societies by maintaining our network resilience and quality during increased network traffic during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nWe pursue digital inclusion through our price transformation strategy by reducing the cost of data and providing access to affordable products and services. On 1 April 2020, we introduced price cuts on data bundles in South Africa which provided a R3 billion benefit to consumers. We also provided affordable data prices to the 2 000 poorest towns in South Africa.\n\nWe provided free peer-to-peer (P2P) M-Pesa transactions to customers in our international markets which is a benefit of R2 billion to customers. This intervention supported accelerated customer adoption and platform growth. In the fourth quarter, the value of M-Pesa monthly transactions increased 64.5%.\n\nWe have partnered with AUDA-NEPAD to build digital infrastructure to manage the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations in up to 55 countries, following successful deployments in South Africa, leveraging our mVacciNation platform.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe implemented our response strategy in two phases, focusing on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in our society. Each phase of our response strategy followed a detailed six-point plan to provide rapid, comprehensive and coordinated support to society through strategic partnerships that enabled sustained connectivity.\n\nConnected hea l thcare providers to ensure they are digitally equipped to support COVID-19 virtual consultations, data collection and testing.\n\nAlongside the Vodafone Foundation, we recently announced an R87 million financial pledge to support the roll-out of cold-chain technology, and provide logistics support to ensure the safe delivery of COVID-19 vaccines through our mVaccine platform.\n\nThrough the ConnectU platform, we zero-rated access to social media, education, government and employment platforms.\n\nWe donated 20 000 smart phones, 100 terabytes of data and 10 million voice call minutes to the South African Department of Health to collect and transmit data for resource planning purposes.\n\nConnected educationa l institutions and b usinesses to facilitate learning and skills development in a digital world.\n\nOur e-schools programme has over one million registered learners. We also provided significant discounts to our Big Data offerings for universities and schools, so that lessons could continue online.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConnected b usinesses, particu l ar ly sma ll and medium enterprises ( S MEs) , through remote working solutions, advice and best practice information. We aim to ensure SMEs survive the economic impacts of COVID-19 by facilitating the adoption of safe and secure digital solutions utilising advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data analytics and financial services platforms.\n\nConnected governments and societies through Big Data capabilities.\n\nConnected host countr y governments to disseminate critical COVID-19-related information to the public.\n\n## Our six-point COVID-19 plan in two phases\n\nPhase 1 of our response focused on the immediate health crisis brought on by the pandemic and details our swift response and the interventions we implemented to save lives and provide societal support during the year. During phase 2, we built on the successes of phase 1 to help restart the economy and stimulate employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor detailed information about our Social Contract and two-phased six-point plan, refer to our sustainability report.",

Having taken the he l m from m y esteemed predecessor, Ja b u Mo l eketi, in Ju ly 2020, we faced unprecedented disruption as a b usiness.\n\nCOVID-19 compounded the severe economic cha ll enges a l read y underwa y in man y of our markets, resu l ting in depressed economic growth, growing fisca l deficits and overwhe l ming socia l vu l nera b i l ities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI frequently reflect on how COVID-19 has forever distorted our concept of 'normal' and caused devastating turmoil for communities, lives and livelihoods. Despite these challenges, people have remained resilient and moved outside of their comfort zones. I view resilience as a positive outcome of this pandemic and beam with pride when I think about the dedication shown by our Vodacom family this past year.\n\nThe pandemic has compelled us to be mindful of the interconnectivity of people because every citizen has been impacted in some way. It has reinforced the idea of an undivided humanity, which requires equitable access to opportunities. As we enter our second year of navigating this pandemic, our purpose offers insight into how we can promote socio-economic recovery and help curb the spread of COVID-19 through the power of technology and connectivity.\n\nBy leveraging the power of voice and data connectivity, and financial services and digital platforms, we can enhance financial inclusion and promote equal digital access. This purpose has helped Vodacom navigate the complexities of the past year, guiding our strategy and directing our responses.\n\nCOVID-19 has exacerbated already existing societal challenges, thus increasing inequalities and mobility constraints. It has required us all to look beyond ourselves to see how we can serve others because not only are we interconnected, but our future depends on what we do today. We need to enhance our positive behaviours and embed consciousness about the finite world, because its sustainability of the world is currently under threat by the way we all live, consume, organise political policies and operate our businesses in general.\n\nAs a business and a leadership team, Vodacom is committed to supporting our stakeholders and to address the challenges presented by COVID-19. We remain committed to operating responsibly by preserving our natural resource base and using technology to enable more sustainable business practices. We understand that the legacy we leave for future generations is determined by how we operate today. res tec un det\n\n## De l ivering on our S ocia l Contract De\n\nWe are firmly committed to delivering on our Social Contract, which is aimed at enabling the delivery of broad societal value through enhanced customer trust, improved service offerings, and increased collaborations with government, regulators and other stakeholders. We is a en col\n\nThe Social Contract, and our commitment to being a purpose-led organisation, are informed by three guiding principles: to build trust with our customers , ensure fairness through digital inclusion, and maintain a reputation for responsible leadership in driving transformation to a digital society. Th org tru and tra\n\nVodacom has a 27-year track record of innovation and commitment to delivering societal value - our technology and communications services enable businesses and connect people in ways that have never been more important. As social distancing remains part of life to halt the spread of COVID-19, enhanced connections can provide a better future by improving the overall quality of life of our customers, promoting efficiency and facilitating greater social inclusion.

        "page_content": "We have chosen to take a strategic and systematic approach aligned to our purpose of connecting society for a better future through the three purpose pillars, namely digital society, inclusion for all and the planet. Our response to the pandemic was implemented in two phases, with phase 1 of the six-point plan focused on the health crisis, while phase 2 of the plan addressed economic recovery. In addition to our COVID-19 response plan, various initiatives were introduced throughout the year as part of our commitment to delivering on our Social Contract. I believe these commitments will go a long way in assisting customers in these tough economic times and driving digital inclusion for all.\n\n## Our response to COVID-19\n\nAlongside the Vodafone Foundation, we recently announced a R87 million financial pledge to support the roll-out of cold-chain technology and provide logistics support to ensure the safe delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable and hard-to-reach communities in South Africa, the DRC, Mozambique, Ghana and Tanzania. We also made a R13 million donation to Lesotho to assist with securing vaccines for the Basotho people. We partnered with AUDA-NEPAD to build digital infrastructure to manage the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations across up to 55 countries, following successful deployments in South Africa, leveraging our mVacciNation platform.\n\n## Governance that supports va l ue creation and preservation\n\nThe need for inclusive and ethical leadership has never been stronger. As a Board, we understand that our role extends beyond oversight. Vodacom is an important corporate citizen in the markets where we operate. It is critical that we ensure a strong culture of ethics and that good governance is embedded across the organisation.\n\nVodacom conducted a Board evaluation in FY20. Good progress was made with the actions arising from this evaluation. Our next Board evaluation is scheduled for the fourth quarter of FY22.\n\nThis year, to support our strategic ambitions to be a leading technology company, we simplified our governance framework to allow the necessary management oversight. As a business, we embed all regulatory compliance into our corporate culture, planning, decision-making and activities.\n\nFollowing the recent expansion of our oversight responsibilities in Africa, and our accelerated growth ambitions on the continent, including financial and digital services, we have elected to split the South African and African operations. The Vodacom South Africa operating company remains a structure with its own board, and is led by Balesh Sharma as Managing Director. Shameel Joosub will operate as Group CEO, with Balesh reporting directly to him. We believe this will enable Shameel to focus on the broadened scope of South Africa, International Business and Safaricom, with the added responsibility of managing Vodafone Ghana and accelerating the growth of our financial and digital services offerings on the continent. Balesh will focus on the execution of our strategy and capturing the numerous opportunities that exist from both our traditional telco and our technology-focused company (techco) growth acceleration units.\n\n## Changes to our directorate\n\nI was fortunate this year to work alongside my Board colleagues as we focused on delivering against our mandate and ensuring we protect and preserve value for our stakeholders. Following my appointment, David Brown was appointed as lead independent non-executive director (NED).\n\nVodacom has a self-imposed 10-year tenure for a director, and after 11 years of dedicated service, Jabu stepped down. On behalf of the Board, I extend our appreciation to Jabu Moleketi for his leadership, insight and commitment to both the Board and Vodacom, and wish him well on his future endeavours. Other changes to the Board included Vivek Badrinath, who resigned during the year. We thank Vivek for his valuable contribution.\n\nDuring the year, Pierre Klotz, Clive Thomson, Khumo Shuenyane, Raisibe Morathi and Anne O'Leary joined the Board, adding immense value and insights.\n\nThe Board comprises a carefully selected team that offers the necessary diversity of skills, experience and outlook to ensure accountability and drive strategic thinking. We were well supported in our oversight function by the boards in our international markets and subsidiaries, which bring further depth and diversity in ensuring good governance and oversight of the Group's performance and strategic direction.\n\n## Out l ook\n\nIt is an extremely exciting time for Vodacom as we accelerate our transition from a traditional telco to a digital techco. We remain committed to building a resilient business that promotes digitalisation, innovation, connectivity, transformation, inclusivity, equality and sustainability - all of which help us strengthen our system of advantage.\n\nWe covered a lot of distance in our digital transformation journey this past year, buoyed by exciting new partnerships formed, which assisted us in developing new innovative products and services to meet our specific customer needs and demands. Due to this progress, I believe we are well positioned to continue delivering value and supporting our stakeholders.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nMy sincere gratitude goes to my colleagues on the Board for their wisdom and counsel. I would like to thank the Vodacom executive team and our employees for their resilience in a trying year. To all our stakeholders  - thank you for your unwavering support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS aki Macozoma Chairman\n\n04 June 2021",

        "page_content": "As we entered the fiscal year, it was imperative that we responded to COVID-19 by living our purpose and supporting governments in the countries where we operate, as well as our communities, and then ensuring we created an enabling environment for people to work, educate and entertain from home. We focused on expanding our network coverage to improve resilience, accelerate support to governments, enhance digital accessibility and digital adoption, support the strategies of our customers as they adapt to the new normal, and promote financial inclusion. Our initiatives included free devices and airtime for healthcare workers; accelerating support to governments via donations of handsets, connectivity and medical equipment; making contactless payments more accessible through zero-rated services and expanding the M-Pesa ecosystem to address social distancing challenges.\n\nWe assisted governments in implementing effective response measures by enhancing their capacity to deliver critical services and ensuring that accurate information was shared timeously. We zero-rated over one thousand key government and other essential websites across our markets, thereby providing free access to ambulance services, home affairs, education and health sites and government communication services throughout the pandemic. In South Africa, the mVacciNation solution helped the National Department of Health administer vaccinations.\n\nAlongside the Vodafone Foundation, we announced a R87 million financial pledge to support the roll-out of cold-chain technology and provide logistics support to ensure the safe delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable and hard to reach communities in South Africa, Tanzania, the DRC, Mozambique and Ghana. We also made a R13 million donation to Lesotho to assist with securing vaccines for the Basotho people.\n\nWe are proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder with the African Union and national governments to provide practical support for what is an enormous logistical challenge for resource-limited African countries with significant rural populations.\n\nThese latest initiatives are over and above the R2 billion service revenue impact of zero-rating P2P M-Pesa payments in our International markets, the R3 billion service revenue impact of lowering data pricing in South Africa, and the R176 million cash and in-kind donations made by the Vodacom and Vodafone Group Foundations in response to the pandemic. We believe these interventions were the right thing to do for our customers.\n\nAs schools closed and more people worked from home, the demand on network capacity and data services increased substantially. To address this, Vodacom invested R13.3 billion in network infrastructure - including R10.1 billion in South Africa - to expand our capacity and increase our resilience during the year. We continuously monitored the increased demand and managed congestion as traffic increased. The additional high-demand spectrum temporarily assigned by governments to ensure ongoing customer availability was effectively implemented. In South Africa, this additional spectrum also enabled us to launch 5G base stations across the country.\n\nIn responding to the crisis, we sought innovative solutions that leveraged our strategic partnerships and core competencies. Vodacom South Africa donated R10 million towards our\n\npartnership with Discovery to provide citizens with access to an online COVID-19 healthcare platform.\n\nThrough our ConnectU platform, we provided Vodacom customers with free access to various online resources, including job portals, and educational and health content. The platform saw 15.5 million unique users visits during the year, with over 20 million sessions initiated in a month - a testament to the success of the platform.\n\nWe aimed to ensure SMEs - the backbone of our economy survived the economic fallout of the pandemic by extending payment terms. In a world that required businesses to work from home, we stepped up to provide customised and affordable data packages to our SME customers. Through our VodaLend platform, we extended credit to more than 330 SMEs across all platforms, thereby supporting them in maintaining a reasonable level of financial viability. Furthermore, we continued to provide SMMEs support through our merchant lending solutions on M-Pesa.\n\n## Imp l ementing our strateg y through our s y stem of advantage\n\nWe are transforming Vodacom from a traditional telecommunications company (telco) to a fully fledged digital technology communications company (techco). This transformation forms the foundation of our strategic outlook, Vision 2025. Our Vision 2025 strategy is guided by eight connected pillars that operate together and are designed to deliver exceptional value to our customers. We implement these pillars and our strategy through our system of advantage, which is designed to meet our customers where they are today and grow with them as we strive to be a strategic partner of choice and an integral part of their lives, homes and offices.\n\nAs we implement our system of advantage, we will leverage our scale, connectivity and innovative partnerships to create more value for our customers and society at large. This scale is built on a foundation of trust with our customers, and having been in the business of connectivity for almost three decades now, we continue to strive to be a trusted brand and partner in the markets in which we operate.\n\nOur strategic journey, Vision 2025, recognises that the world continues to change and evolve at a blistering pace. To empower our customers, we must look beyond our roots as a telco and increasingly harness the power of technology. We believe that, by creating an ecosystem that better serves our customers, we can create a unique competitive advantage.\n\nWe continually seek to create opportunities in new growth vectors, such as fibre, IoT and financial and digital services. Through our innovative digital offerings, unique behavioural insights and Big Data, as well as exciting new partnerships, we are able to develop innovative products and services that meet the specific needs and demands of our customers. As we grow with our customers, and adopt a lifestyle approach to our product development, we believe that we will connect them for a better future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how we performed against our strategy, refer to our strategic dashboard on page 42 as well as our strategy sections, starting on page 44.",

Group revenue increased by 8.3% to R98.3 billion, with service revenue up 5.8% to R77.6 billion. These results were supported by the recovery in our International portfolio in the second half of FY21 and strong growth from our prepaid and Vodacom Business segments, financial services and other new services in South Africa. Group EBITDA increased by 4.5% to R39.3 billion, and headline earnings per share was up 3.7% to 980 cents per share (cps). As a result, our final dividend per share was 825cps.\n\nOur International portfolio reported muted service revenue growth of 1.6%, with a stronger second half offsetting the significant impacts of COVID-19 earlier in the year. This performance was characterised by currency volatility, increased pressure on consumer spend, free P2P M-Pesa transactions and the impact of service barring in Tanzania due to biometric registration compliance. Through M-Pesa, we process US$24.5 billion (R366.4 billion) a month in the fourth quarter, up 63.5% in transactions across our international markets, including Safaricom. We serve 57.7 million financial services customers, including Safaricom, which generated revenue of R19.3 billion in FY21. Our strategic investment in Safaricom accounted for close to 13% of our operating profit in FY21. Safaricom's local currency results reflected the impact of depressed economic activity and free P2P M-Pesa transfers due to COVID-19. Safaricom's commitment to its strategic goals supported strong platform growth for M-Pesa and higher connectivity usage. This supported a notable recovery in service revenue growth with fourthquarter growth at 6.4%.\n\nIn South Africa, despite economic disruption and the substantial data price cuts in April 2020, we reported strong revenue growth of 10.3% to R76.7 billion, with service revenue growth of 7.0% to R56.4 billion. This is on the back of increased data usage, the highly successful Shake-Up Summer campaign and demand for financial services. Combined, these helped offset several initiatives aimed at delivering greater value to our customers. Some of these initiatives include reducing data tarrifs by up to 40%, and launching VodaBucks, our behavioural loyalty programme in April 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our segment performance refer to page 88.\n\nIn addition to our ongoing COVID-19 response efforts and our investment into our network to accommodate rapid shifts in customer behaviour, we support the swift proceeding of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa's (ICASA) high-demand spectrum (HDS) auction. We believe that awarding high-demand spectrum is critical to reducing input costs and, by extension, the cost of data. Assigning additional spectrum is crucial to expanding broadband services and promoting digital inclusion in South Africa. As such, further delays to the auction process could negatively impact South African consumers.\n\nWe remain focused on entrenching Vodacom as a leading pan-African technology company through our investments into fibre, IoT and financial, digital and lifestyle services, as these increasingly provide opportunities to enhance our relationships with the 123.7 million customers we serve across our footprint. In particular, we are excited about the growth of financial services in South Africa, as well as our partnership with Alipay and the imminent launch of our single lifestyle app, VodaPay, in South Africa. Our super-app will offer services ranging from loans and savings, seamless QR and person-to-person payments, to entertainment and personalised shopping experiences, promoting greater financial inclusion. We see this super-app as a precursor to",

We are equally excited by the opportunity presented by processing merchants payments through our platform payment gateways, point of sale (POS) and the merchant lending and trading platforms.\n\n## Creating a b etter future for a ll\n\nI believe we have an important role to play in creating and enabling a better digital future for all. Vodacom strongly believes that improved connectivity is a powerful tool for achieving socio-economic development and promoting sustainable growth. Through the Vodacom Foundation, we continue to leverage our technology solutions to address societal challenges. This year, we invested R157 million in enhancing access to education and supporting the fight against gender-based violence (GBV).\n\nAs part of our focus on preventing GBV, the Vodacom Foundation launched the zero-rated Bright Sky education and resource mobile app that provides support and information for anyone who may be in an abusive relationship or those concerned about someone they know. We also invested R4.5 million in digital skills training for GBV survivors in South Africa.\n\nWe continue to leverage our technology to help bridge the digital divide and promote education to prepare the next generation for a digital society. The Vodacom e-School platform proved to be an invaluable resource for learners studying at home during COVID-19. User registrations increased tenfold, with over 1.25 million registered users on the platform.\n\nOur commitment to building an inclusive society is embodied in our transformation performance in South Africa. This year, we retained our Level 1 score in terms of BBBEE, the highest score available, and also a testament to our investment in enterprise development, preferential procurement, skills development and employee diversity.\n\nWe take great pride in being recognised by Sustainalytics for our efforts to drive digital and financial inclusion while reducing our carbon footprint. In September 2020, the agency ranked Vodacom second out of almost 200 companies in its Telecommunications Service industry grouping and in the top 5% of its Global Universe of 13 000 companies. We also maintained our AAA rating from MSCI. As a further commitment to our purpose and integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations across our business, we started integrating ESG measures into our long-term incentives from June 2020.\n\nOn 26 April 2021, Vodacom participated as a minority investor in a consortium, controlled by Safaricom, bidding for a mobile telecommunication licence in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. In May, the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, through the Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) confirmed that our consortium's bid was successful. We were delighted with this outcome, and are focused on building a world-class network in Ethiopia to support the country's digital transformation and positively enhance the lives of its citizens.\n\n## Our emp l o y ees - the S pirit of Vodacom\n\nOur employees are the driving force of our strategic objectives, and maintaining a safe working environment is one of Vodacom's fundamental responsibilities. Sadly, I have to report one fatality during the year, when a cyclist tragically lost his life in Mozambique when a Vodacom contractor collided with him. The incident was\n\ninvestigated and, to mitigate against any future occurrence, we will align and enhance driver behaviour monitoring systems through various interventions. Safaricom will also draft a zero-harm plan to drive a safety culture throughout their business.\n\nThrough our Spirit of Vodacom initiatives, we continue to instil the culture needed to realise our business strategy, create a better future for customers, encourage collaboration, and enable innovation to help us fulfil our Social Contract. To truly infuse our Spirit across the Group, we created Big Conversation moments where all employees could learn, discuss and connect to bring life to our purpose and strategy. A total of 4 000 employees participated in Big Conversation initiatives across our markets.\n\nVodacom supports employee training and development and encourages employees to acquire the capabilities, commitment and enthusiasm to achieve business goals. Vodacom South Africa invested R472 million in continuous skills development - this included R317 million invested in black employees, of which R141 million was invested in black women. As part of our vision of transitioning from a traditional telco to a techco, we understand the importance of reskilling and repurposing our current employees. We therefore, launched the #1MoreSkill strategy to drive reskilling and upskilling across the organisation to give every employee the opportunity to grow into new targeted roles that support our strategic direction.\n\n## M y appreciation and c l osing\n\nWe are positive that we can combat the many unforeseen impacts of COVID-19. As we await the roll-out of the vaccine campaign, we will continue positioning the business to weather the anticipated headwinds. We know that our role as a company is critical to supporting a more resilient and inclusive future. Our immediate priorities remain to protect the well-being of our employees and contractors and ensuring the resilience of our services, which are critical in enabling individuals, communities, businesses and governments to operate, and to provide support to governments to assist with vaccine roll-out and economic recovery.\n\nWe have revised the Group Executive Committee to provide a functional Group structure that will enable us to accelerate our growth ambitions of being a leading techco in Africa. I welcome the following colleagues to the Group executive team:\n\n- \u00b7  Raisi b e Morathi: Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO);\n- \u00b7  Peter Ndegwa: CEO of Safaricom;\n- \u00b7  Ba l esh S harma: Managing Director: Vodacom South Africa;\n- \u00b7  Dejan Kaste l ic: Chief Technology Officer; and\n- \u00b7   Puso Manthata: Chief Officer Strategy  and New Business Development.\n\nMy sincere thanks go out to our employees worldwide, the executive team and the Board for their collective contribution. To our business partners, shareholders and other stakeholders thank you for your ongoing support.\n\nFor almost three decades, our products and services have helped to positively transform the lives of millions of people. In this time of uncertainty, delivering on our purpose has never been more critical. Looking ahead, we will continue to provide affordable internet access for the next 100 million people in our markets as we connect for a b etter future .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## S hamee l Aziz Joosu b\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n04 June 2021",

This is further supported by increased uptake of smart devices, improved network coverage and more affordable data bundles. We are actively diversifying our revenue to include new services such as fixed, IoT, IT, digital and financial services. These services provide new growth vectors and access to attractive markets. While our revenue mix is largely consumer driven, strong growth within Vodacom Business increased its contribution to 23.2% of Group service revenue. Our Vision 2025 strategy aims to meaningfully scale the contribution of new revenue streams while continuing to increase the penetration of our core connectivity solutions.\n\n## Ke y revenue differentiators\n\n- Consistent investment in infrastructure, resulting in being rated first or second in network quality in the countries where we operate.\n- Industry-leading customer value management systems, people and processes.\n- A widespread distribution network and investment into digital channels.\n- Effective use of Big Data to ensure personalised offers for our customers to better suit their needs and behaviours.\n- Rewarding and incentivising customers through our behavioural loyalty programme, which offers competitive and compelling products targeted by segment.\n- Ability to offer vertically integrated solutions in both the consumer and business segments.\n- M-Pesa, Africa's largest mobile payment platform which incorporates services such as person-toperson payments, lending, bill and bulk payments, savings, e-commerce and merchant payments.\n- Financial service growth in South Africa, as we scale our existing Airtime Advance and insurance business into a fully fledged fintech offering for merchants and consumers with our Alipay powered super-app, VodaPay.\n- Leveraging our global enterprise relationships for pan-African service delivery.\n- Best-in-class customer service support systems.\n- Ability to leverage our relationship with Vodafone, driving global best practice in performance.\n- Harnessing our Big Data platform and insights, powered by AI and machine learning, to deliver nano and large bundle offers to the segment of one through our Just4U platform.\n- Behavioural loyalty to incentivise and reward customer engagement and reward customer engagement, across our products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have achieved significant results in limiting cost growth through our fit-for-growth programme, driving efficiencies in staff expenses, publicity spend and other operating expenses through an influential culture of cost containment across the business. This focus enables us to invest in new growth areas ahead of commercialisation, such as 5G. Furthermore, we are embracing new technologies and, in many ways, pioneering the use of robotic process automation (RPA), Big Data and AI to optimise costs. As a result, our steady cash flow enables us to maintain a high level of capital reinvestment to protect our leading position in network coverage, call quality and data speed in our markets. In addition to investing in the future of the business, cash generated from our activities allows us to maintain our shareholder returns, with our dividend policy of at least 90% of pre-Safaricom headline earnings plus flow-through of Safaricom cash dividend (net of withholding tax).\n\n## Our investment case\n\n## Our costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Ke y  cost differentiators                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leveraging global best practice on cost optimisation, benefiting from  and sharing best practice with Vodafone.                                          |\n| Ability to optimise costs through our leading use of RPA, Big Data and AI.                                                                               |\n| Benefiting from the global purchasing power of Vodafone Procurement  Company.                                                                            |\n| Consistent investment in our network, delivering continuous  improvement in operating costs through more efficient technologies  and network innovation. |\n| Robust governance processes in place to approve investments and  review product, cost and investment decisions.                                          |\n| Shared services and initiatives with Vodafone and across our own  African footprint to optimise back-end costs.                                          |\n| Optimal network deployment using AI.                                                                                                                     |\n| Optimising power utilisation across our building and sites using the  IoT.nxt platform.                                                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## S upported by our s y stem of advantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeaningfu l growth opportunities across connectivit y , digita l and financia l services\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Data and smartphone penetration upside.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Expanding addressable market in fintech.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Targeting mid-to-high single digit operating profit growth over the next three years.\n\nWe have a trusted management team\n\nWe are a responsi bl e corporate\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Incentivised to create value and deliver on key ESG variables.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Strong execution track record.\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Purpose-led model.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Recognised as an ESG leader.\n\nFor more information, please visit\n\nhttps://www.vodacom.com/investor-re l ations.php.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are a market l eader across our footprint, with an attractive return on capita l emp l o y ed (ROCE)\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Access to 123.7 million customers.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z ROCE of 22.0%, well above weighted average cost of capital.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Strategic mindset to enhance value creation and leverage scale.",

We also effectively implemented the spectrum provided by governments to ensure ongoing customer availability.

This has led to regulatory intervention in South Africa increasing markedly over the past few years. Following an agreement with the Competition Commission, we committed to a range of initiatives to further reduce our data prices and increase access to free data services - resulting in R3 billion benefit for customers during the financial year.\n\n## Our response\n\nTechnology and connectivity have the potential to create a more equitable and inclusive society, with internet access being a powerful enabler for economic participation and financial inclusion. Accordingly, we recognise the need to decrease our data prices without compromising the quality of our network infrastructure or the services we provide. Despite delays in HDS access in South Africa, we introduced several initiatives to strengthen our Social Contract with our stakeholders to ensure we address societal challenges across all our markets. We pursued digital inclusion through our price transformation strategy by reducing the cost of data and providing access to affordable products and services. As part of this, we implemented the following measures:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Whilst our effective rates are comparative by international standards, our monthly data bundle pricing was reduced to deal with pricing perceptions. Our monthly data bundle volumes account for around one quarter of our total data bundle volumes. We reduced the price of our 1GB data bundle from R149 to R99 and, on 1 April 2021, by a further 14% to R85.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We supported social inclusion through ConnectU, by providing free access to job portals, educational content and health and wellness information, zero-rated access to more than 1 000 government sites, expanding our zero-rated offering to educational institutions across South Africa, provided a comprehensive zero-rated internet search function, and offered free access to other essential information such as local and international headlines, trends and weather updates.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We also provided employees with additional data bundles to make working from home easier. For our SME customers, we provided data and voice minutes at a reduced rate and, for a limited time, also offered them unlimited data bundles, among other special offers.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We identified 2 000 of South Africa's most vulnerable towns, suburbs and villages, where customers will enjoy further discounted bundle offers. Our rural coverage acceleration programme prioritises the expansion of network coverage to rural communities. We introduced 192 new network sites in rural communities across South Africa, with 97.3% of the population covered by our 4G network. We recognise the important part we can play to create possibilities that will ensure that a better digital future is accessible to everyone, and believe that encouraging financial inclusion is especially critical in these challenging times.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We have launched a 4G-enabled low-cost smart device priced at R299 to provide access to all our customers and to ensure that no one is left behind.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We gave massive discounts on data bundles for students in co-operation with the Department of Education and the universities, to enable education from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo differentiate ourselves, remain competitive and ensure positive consumer sentiment, it is critical that we maintain and improve the quality of our extensive network. We are also legislated to ensure that the quality of our service is in line with government regulations. Negative consumer sentiment occurs when we experience unplanned disruptions in network performance and poor quality network coverage. Consumers sharing their dissatisfaction via their social media pages further compounds negative sentiment.\n\nThe business felt the pressure of the increased demand for digital products during COVID-19. In South Africa, this was further exacerbated by load shedding, which adversely affects our electricity supply and thereby increased our dependency on backup diesel generators and batteries. Sporadic vandalism and battery theft at network sites also impede business continuity, network quality and overall customer experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We invested R1 billion in lithium-ion batteries, which have a longer useful life than lead-acid batteries, and are less harmful to the environment.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Vodacom invested R13.3 billion to maintain and increase network resilience and expand network capacity during the year.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We are exploring new ways to build more resilient and sustainable networks with the help of our suppliers, business partners and energy experts.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Our rural coverage sites technology, supplies solar power and network coverage to millions of people in previously unconnected rural parts in the DRC, achieving a 12% penetration to date.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We actively engage with regulatory authorities regarding access to spectrum - a key component in our ability to provide quality network coverage and to reduce data costs. By using the temporary spectrum assigned to us during the COVID-19 crisis, we launched 190 5G sites in South Africa.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Across our Vodacom International markets, we have 8 294 2G sites, 6 497 3G sites, 3 744 4G sites and two 5G sites, with high-speed transmission extended to 91.5% of sites.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nOne of our customers' main pain-points is around data usage and the lack of transparency  around data consumption. The increased speed of our network, increased usage of social media, updated on apps and the downloading high definition videos, lead to higher mobile data usage and has resulted in a perception that data is disappearing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to be a trusted partner to connect for a better future. We commit to operating honestly and with integrity and maintaining robust ethics. We aspire to be a brand our customers love by earning their trust and providing brilliant experiences.

Our brand value ensures that our customers receive the best experience that is convenient and hassle-free.\n\nWe understand that our success starts and ends with our customers, and we protect their trust through transparent pricing and personalised solutions. We work hard to simplify things for our customers and deliver what they want and need every day. Our Detailed Data Usage solution was designed to provide customers with a comprehensive breakdown of their data usage. This helps customers understand their consumption habits and transparently discloses pricing information. About 7.1 million customers are provisioned to use this service.\n\n- In Mozambique, we introduced a speed choice service where customers have the power to control the speed of their data consumption-based on their desired usage on various applications such as social media platforms and videos.\n\nCustomers are also able to manage their mobile data spend through the MyVodacom app, proven to be a valuable customer resource during lockdown as people stay at home and use digital platforms for essential services.\n\n## Vendor risk and related sanctions\n\n## The issue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur network and systems depend on a wide range of international suppliers. Geopolitical influences could potentially impact our IT and technology vendor strategy - which was further affected by COVID-19 - and placed our operational costs under pressure during the year. Trade  tensions between the USA and China, and sanctions against Huawei's 5G network equipment in the USA and UK, highlight specific vendor risk, which could disrupt the pace and cost of 5G roll-out over the medium term. Furthermore, if key suppliers experience a lack of supply, it could negatively impact our operational activities and our ability to deliver quality service to our customers. Implementing our multi-vendor strategy is crucial to sustain our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Vodacom monitors the geopolitical status of our suppliers and engages with governments, experts and suppliers so that we are adequately informed to respond accordingly and comply with the latest regulations, economic sanctions and trade rulings.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We deployed a vendor risk management tool during supplier reviews to ensure suppliers meet our privacy and security policy requirements.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Vodacom reduces dependency on single suppliers by risk profiling.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We implemented our multi-vendor strategy in critical categories.\n\n## S takeho l ders\n\nCustomers\n\nGovernment\n\nRegu\n\nl\n\nators\n\nEmp\n\nl\n\no\n\ny\n\nees\n\n## The safety of 5G technology\n\n## The issue\n\nMobile phones transform people's lives and improve communication worldwide by creating access to digital services and enabling economic development. Vodacom has been developing and improving mobile technology for over 25 years. Protecting the health and safety of our customers and the general public has always been a priority. While scientific research over several decades eased public concern about the safety of mobile devices and masts, the onset of the pandemic brought with it concerns suggesting a connection between COVID-19 and 5G technology. There is no scientific evidence that exposure to the 5G network can cause COVID-19, as supported by many health and telecommunication authorities such as ICASA, the International Telecommunication Union and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Our mobile devices and masts operate within guideline safety limits and, according to the WHO, there is no evidence to suggest that our masts pose any risk to human health.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We continue to monitor, support and publish links to the latest scientific research.\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Vodacom supported the government's efforts in preventing the spread of fake news around 5G technology.

We are committed to promoting our transformational role within South Africa, as demonstrated by our commitment to the fundamental principles of BBBEE, our leadership diversity and our level 1 BBBEE contributor score. BBBEE ideals also form an integral part of our employee recruitment and supplier selection processes. We also strive to create an inclusive and diverse employee culture that celebrates our unique differences and achieves gender balance, supported by our zero-tolerance approach to bias, harassment, discrimination and abuse.\n\nTo promote gender equality in the workplace, we prioritise equal pay, support work-life balance, enable access for women to managerial positions and strive for gender balance across all levels and areas of the business - particularly technical roles. However, female representation remains a challenge for our business and the broader telecoms sector.\n\n## Our response\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z We recognise that we have strong local roots in South Africa and resolve to help the government achieve meaningful change in the racial composition of ownership and management structures. We remain focused on skills development and helping the country achieve its transformation agenda.

We completed 872 health and safety training hours for 63 SMEs during the year.\n- -  We implemented our retail transformation strategy to encourage black ownership in our franchise channel.\n- -  We achieved black representation of 77.1% of our workforce, with 62.0% in senior management level and 66.7% at Exco level.\n- -  We developed the skills of historically disadvantaged people, investing R324 million in black employees - R141 million in black women - across our South African workforce.\n- -  Through the Female Leadership programme, a strategic future talent pipeline programme, 25 Black women outside of Vodacom have been placed in various roles.\n- -  Vodacom's youth development volunteer programme gives graduates from the Vodacom Youth Academy programme an opportunity to practise their new skills and gain valuable work experience.\n- -  We invested R14 million in the development of black youth with disabilities - of the 69 graduates selected, 45% were female.\n- -  We trained 1 672 Code Like a Girl graduates.\n- -  Our workforce comprises 43.6% women. Female representation at senior management level is 34.9% against our 36% target.\n- -  We review our internal pay ranges annually across the organisation, including fair-pay analysis. We are committed to fair pay and responsible remuneration across all employee levels and all our markets.\n- -  We have built an inclusive culture that celebrates our differences by institutionalising our LGBTQ+ support, creating an accessible workplace for employees with disabilities and creating an ethnically diverse company.\n- -  In Tanzania and Lesotho, Vodacom localised several senior executive roles.",

Our Board reviews and approves the risk appetite for each principal risk identified, ensuring informed and risk-based decision-making.\n\nVodacom's principal risks heatmap (included as Figure 1 below) depicts our top 10 risks as identified through our risk management processes. The heatmap shows residual risk after taking into account mitigating actions. We also disclose our risk speed of impact report (included as Figure 2), reflecting the rate at which the Group would experience adverse impacts if the risk materialised.

Below are just a few examples from our markets.\n\n## Youth segment ( S outh Africa)\n\nOur youth proposition, called Vodacom NXT LVL, targets consumers under the age of 25 and focuses on giving them access to affordable connectivity, skills to enable their future careers, and tools and technologies for a better future - thereby enabling their economic inclusion. We aim to provide our youth segment with affordable devices and preferential rates on value bundles by offering the best value rates to popular uniform resource locator service bundles for WhatsApp and social tickets. We also offer zero-rated platforms to help enable the youth to gain access to opportunities via the internet. These platforms include, among others, the Vodacom e-School and the Future Jobs Finder, a career guidance and training content portal. We offer reduced subscriptions to music and gaming services to attract the youth and keep them engaged, among other lifestyle benefits. We provided significant discounts to our Big Data offerings for universities and schools, so that lessons could continue online.\n\n## Mass segment\n\nThis year, we have continued with our strategy to democratise data by designing compelling customer propositions. Through this platform, acting as a storefront we can offer customers cheaper access to voice, data, digital lifestyle and financial services, i.e. Airtime Advance. Our smart targeting capabilities allow us to build innate journeys to enable us reach our customers via multiple platforms. This year, 15.5 million unique users per month interacted with our free-to access ConnectU platform.\n\nWe further create value by leveraging our digital propositions driven by deep customer intelligence. Our nano-lending and microloans platforms continue to drive growth in our international markets, giving 15 million first-time borrowers access to basic needs, including food and electricity. Songesha, our overdraft facility in Tanzania, offers not only customers, but its agents the overdraft facility as well, ensuring that our agents are liquid at all times, and able to serve our customers timeously. In Kenya, 1.4 million customers use our overdraft facility, called Fuliza. Through M-Pesa, our nano-loans of up to US$10 continue to be popular among our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## High-va l ue segment ( S outh Africa)\n\nWe differentiate ourselves through our value proposition and best-in-service RED VIP plans. We designed each VIP plan with customer usage preferences in mind, including premium rewards and benefits. Our RED VIP 10GB, 25GB and 100GB come standard with unlimited minutes and SMSes, as well as access to our 24/7 concierge-type service called Platinum Resolution Centre.\n\nThe Platinum Resolution Centre ensures that our customers receive first-in-line priority service through an exclusive service help desk, where calls are attended to immediately. Customers on these packages receive high allocations of voice and data and have access to the RED VIP Club. These plans are available as 24-month or 36-month contracts.\n\nDuring the year, our RED customers' data usage increased by 7%, the number of 4G users is at an average of 94%, and smartphone penetration amounted to 99%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe focus on removing barriers for job applicants, especially considering the high youth unemployment rate in South Africa. By providing access to Future Jobs Finder and the ConnectU platforms, we facilitate creating a digital resume and direct applicants to job opportunities based on their unique personalities. These portals also offer access to world-class online learning without incurring additional data costs.\n\nDuring the year, we reduced data prices through our company-wide price transformation strategy. We also continued to offer our device subsidies, resulting in an 56% increase in data usage and an 8% improvement in smartphone penetration. We saw a 6.7% year-on-year increase in our customer base, with data ARPU up by 29%.\n\nIn the DRC, Vodacom introduced a savings and loans solution in partnership with microfinance FINCA Bank, enabling M-Pesa customers to save and access microloans. By introducing this solution, called Vodacash, people living in remote areas of the country can now access payment, loans and savings on their mobile devices. Vodacom Tanzania partnered with TPB Bank to introduce M-Koba, a group savings solution that enables community members particularly women - to mobilise savings, investments and microloans.",

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched the home internet broadband proposition (@home) based on the LTE and 5G access technologies together with the Vodacom Fibre offering. This created a singular proposition that addressed customer value expectations around pricing, network excellence and experience.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 significantly increased the demand for broadband @home. As a result of our @home strategy, Vodacom Fibre had the third-largest connected customer base among fibre internet service providers in South Africa. Our connectivity enabled customers to work and study from home.\n\n## S pecia l needs segment\n\nWe remain committed to providing easy access to a range of offers and services suitable for persons living with disabilities to ensure all customers can stay connected. Our product development team collaborate with organisations for persons living with disabilities to ensure our offerings meet their needs. These solutions have considered the needs of senior citizens, persons with visual impairments and persons who experience communication barriers such as being deaf, hard of hearing, hearing impaired, blind or having a speech impairment.\n\n## S pecia l needs S outh Africa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVodacom continues to drive digital inclusion through our specific needs office. The office team is led by people with disabilities who design and drive our digital inclusion strategy for consumers with disabilities. Vodacom South Africa has provided accessible products and services for people with disabilities since 2004, when we launched the first accessibility initiative. Along with a dedicated call centre for people with disabilities, our products and services include, among others, special monthly discounted contract deals exclusive for people with disabilities, text-based emergency services and special voicemail option for deaf customers, and an easy-to-use phone for elderly people.\n\nOn 3 December 2020, Vodacom became one of the first signatories to the GSMA principles for driving digital inclusion of persons with disabilities. The principles will play an important role in ensuring that mobile operators implement accessibility strategies that promote digital inclusion of consumers with disabilities. We are committed to developing more relevant products and services for our customers with disabilities in 2022. Vodacom is currently the only South African operator with personalised offers for the special needs segment.\n\nWe also intensified our focus on creating converged customers who use mobile and fixed-line services, thereby increasing the average revenue per account. We aim to continue driving convergence with improved value propositions, along with targeted value-added services.\n\nWe combine Big Data insights with a detailed analysis of the family segment and associated sub-segments to understand our customers' needs and expectations better. This analysis enables us to improve efficiencies and provide customers with practical value and excellent customer journeys.\n\n## Democratising internet access\n\n## Rura l ro ll -out and device penetration\n\nVodacom's rural coverage acceleration programme focused on expanding coverage to rural communities that have never been connected to the network. We introduced new network sites in rural communities across South Africa, and 82.9% of the rural population is covered by the 4G network in the country.\n\nVodacom South Africa has 23.2 million smart devices on our network, a 9.5% increase from 2020. The number of 4G devices increased by 22.0% to 15.7 million in South Africa. Sales of South Africa's most affordable 4G smart feature phones, the 'Vibe' and Nokia 215, which retail at R299, continues to grow - 133 200 devices were sold in 2021.\n\nWe improved our customer proposition by offering customers both 3G and 4G devices, selling over 3.5 million of these devices in South Africa. We trialled our prepaid device financing solution with customers without credit facilities, who were able to pay for 4G devices in instalments. We believe this will reduce barriers to entry and ensure that all South Africans have access to a high-quality network.\n\nTo further subsidise device prices and migrate our customers from 2G to our 4G network, we offered network-locked devices. We sold over 3.7 million units since April 2019 - primarily to our mass emerging customer segment. By increasing our customers' accessibility to 4G devices, we can expand digital inclusivity for our customers through plans ranging from zero-interest 12-month contracts to 36 months, as well as offer contracts to ease the burden of monthly payments. Our 36-month contract option is popular with customers, contributing 23% of all contract gross add acquisition this financial year.",

        "page_content": "To remove any barriers to 4G adoption, we partnered with Google on the Android Go operating system to offer customers a simple and seamless user experience. By implementing a comprehensive marketing plan in partnership with Google, we sold over 1.7 million Android Go 4G devices.\n\nAfter launching the Samsung eSIM capable watches and the One Number service in March 2019, we extended the same capability to Apple devices during the year to further reinforce our leadership position. We sold more than 5 000 watches per month and have successfully entrenched Vodacom as one of the largest tablet distributors in South Africa - sales increased by 76% during the year. Our customers can now buy and pay for accessories in instalments linked to their postpaid plans. This proposition offers customers an easy, flexible and affordable way to enhance their lifestyle experiences. This led to a 226% increase in wearable sales volume. Furthermore, sales revenue from accessories increased by 106% year-on-year.\n\nIn our international markets, smartphone users increased by 8.0% to 11.0 million, representing 32% of our customer base. In Tanzania, over 500 000 low-cost smart-feature devices were sold since the introduction of the smart Kitochi at the cost of US$25 in 2019, leading to a 14.6% increase in 4G mobile data traffic. In Mozambique, 750 000 low-cost devices, priced at R299, were sold. Vodacom Lesotho registered a 38% growth in 4G devices year-on-year.\n\nSafaricom launched innovative device funding in the year, supporting an acceleration in smartphone sales. Active 4G devices grew 39.8% to 8.5 million while 4G network coverage reached 94% of the population.\n\n## Bund l e engagement: S outh Africa\n\nData revenue-generating customers as a percentage of total revenue-generating customer increased from 66% to 69% since the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, resulting from 890 million bundle sales over the same period. This was further accelerated by our pricing transformation strategy, which delivered R3 billion in value primarily driven by the price reduction of our monthly data portfolio.\n\nVoice bundle sales increased 4.4% and data bundle sales increased 15.8% due to commercial initiatives that leveraged our personalisation engines and data portfolio set to the market. Data bundle sales from our Just for You personalisation platform grew by 38.1% as customers were drawn to the value propositions in these bundles.\n\n## How our segmented propositions support the system of advantage\n\nWe aim to embed ourselves in the lives of our customers and continue to expand our ecosystem of products to address their needs. With the combination of our segmented customer approach and our pricing transformation journey, we successfully reduced pricing between 34% and 40% year-on-year, returning R3 billion in price cuts to South African consumers. Looking ahead, our ambition is to grow with our customers across our markets and further reduce the digital divide. We will do this by leveraging behavioural insights to develop personalised segmented propositions, as well as attractive loyalty rewards through VodaBucks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B y remaining customer-centric, we can:\n\n- Focus on our pricing transformation journey to reduce the digital divide and enable access for more South Africans. Our goal is to ensure everyone can connect affordably;\n- Enable a seamless system for customers to use their mobile phones to connect, access entertainment, pay bills, invest, lend and insure;\n- Humanise technology, simplify and transform the customer experience to achieve true convergence of our multi-product offerings;\n- Democratise data and design compelling customer propositions, embed our loyalty programme and enhance regional execution; and\n- Deliver a multi-product omni channel digital experience.",

Our M-Pesa platform was instrumental in facilitating economic activity during COVID-19 lockdowns when we zero-rated P2P M-Pesa transactions. While this intervention negatively impacted our financial results, it was the right thing to do for our customers and it supported accelerated platform adoption. Looking ahead, we are particularly excited about our partnership with Alipay and the imminent launch of our single lifestyle app for customers and merchants in South Africa. We see this super-app as a precursor to M-Pesa's evolution, supporting us in connecting the next 100 million African customers so that no one is left behind.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY21 at a g l ance\n\n## 100% b asis (inc l uding S afaricom)\n\n## 58 mi ll ion\n\nFi\n\nnanc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nser\n\nvi\n\nces\n\nc\n\nu\n\ns\n\nt\n\nomers\n\n(m\n\nilli\n\non)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSA\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\nIB M-Pesa\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\nSF M-Pesa\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\n50% penetration\n\n## U S $24.5 b n\n\nM-\n\nPesa\n\nmon\n\nt\n\nh\n\nly\n\nt\n\nransac\n\nti\n\nons\n\n($\n\nb\n\nn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM-Pesa (IB + SF)\n\n64% YoY growth\n\n## R19.3 b n/U S $1.3 b n\n\nFi\n\nnanc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nser\n\nvi\n\nces\n\nre\n\nv\n\nen\n\nu\n\ne\n\n(R\n\nb\n\nn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM-Pesa free P2P impact\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\nM-Pesa (IB + SF)\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\nSA\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\n17% of service revenue\n\nProportionate b asis (exc l minorities, inc l associates) 1\n\n## R10.0 b n/U S $680 mi ll ion\n\n## Financia l services revenue (R b n)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSA\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\nIB M-Pesa\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\nSF M-Pesa\n\nQglyph<c=3,font=/AAECHC+ZapfDingbatsITC>\n\n12% of service revenue\n\n## R4.4 b n/U S $290 mi ll ion\n\nFY 2 1 Fi nanc i a l ser vi ces PB T 1 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSA\n\nM-Pesa (IB + SF)\n\n17% of Group 40% PBT margin\n\n- 1.

It has its own board, management team and budget. This independence is important for a high-growth company and it supports our agile culture.\n\n## We are particu l ar ly excited a b out the upcoming l aunch of our l ifest yl e super-app, VodaPa y .\n\nVodaPay will be supported by the world-class technology of Alipay, and zero-rated for consumers. Our super-app will offer services ranging from loans and savings, seamless QR and person-to-person payments, to entertainment and personalised shopping experiences. The shopping platform will be supported by South Africa's leading retail brands across all key verticals.\n\nWe are also building out the merchant side of the platform with our own point-of-sale devices and FMCG trading platform, called VodaTrade. This platform already processes R200 billion of transactions in South Africa, and will facilitate products like invoice financing. In addition we will provide merchant lending via our VodaLend product, where SMEs can borrow up to R1.5 million, supporting financial inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/LIHVW\\OHglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>VXSHUglyph<c=16,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>DSSglyph<c=15,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>glyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold> Dglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold> \u0225UVWglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold> LQglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold> $IULFD /LIHVW\\OH\n\n<!-- image -->",

The business reported pleasing results: revenue was up 14.2% to R927 million year-on-year, profit increased by 9.7% to R255 million and the EBITDA margin was 24.2%.\n\n## The compan y 's stead y growth during the y ear is attri b uta bl e to:\n\nIncreasing uptake of device insurance and contract cover, which increased to 2.1 million active policies;\n\nLaunching a new funeral insurance product, achieving sales of 5 000 per month;\n\nDeveloping a variable pricing model to adjust pricing according to a customer's risk profile, which resulted in accumulated revenue of R30 million and contributed to affordable insurance product offerings for VodaSure customers; and\n\nDelivering a healthcare platform providing online doctor consultations and education on COVID-19, supporting the fight against COVID-19 while avoiding overcrowding South Africa's healthcare facilities.\n\n## Trading Bridge\n\n## Lending\n\nOur Trading Bridge portfolio services a large base of enterprise and SMEs, enabling annual trade of R200 billion. During this past year, Trading Bridge achieved 7% year-on-year revenue growth despite difficult trading conditions due to restrictions and lockdowns.\n\nTo ensure SMEs are not left behind in their digital journey, Trading Bridge launched VodaTrade, which enables small suppliers to seamlessly transact with large organisations using more complex systems. This creates a one-stop interface for businesses to integrate their trading operations and expand their partner networks. Key features include receiving orders, managing catalogues, confirming or rejecting fulfilment and sending invoices.\n\nAirtime Advance continues to provide airtime without immediate payment, improving accessibility of connectivity. This year, we advanced R12 billion in airtime - an increase of 21.1% - growing our customer base to 10.8 million customers - an increase of 17.3% - as we helped South Africans who were impacted by COVID-19 during the months of hard lockdown. Airtime Advance has been expanded to be accessible to customers across all of Vodacom's channels, such as ConnectU, VodaBucks and Just4You, and continues to provide convenience to our customers. Vodacom launched Voucher Advance to supplement the Airtime Advance offerings, affording qualifying customers the opportunity to have a third-party restaurant or store voucher advanced to them seamlessly through the MyVodacom app.\n\nVodacom's small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) focused lending solution (Vodalend Business Term Advance) continued to grow after its recent launch, advancing over R74 million in funding to 330 small businesses during a period in which COVID-19 had impacted so many small businesses across South Africa. In addition to growing this product, the Business Cash Advance product was launched, allowing seamless advances to POS customers with a few clicks, and daily repayment through POS transactions.\n\n## Pa y ments\n\nTop-ups of airtime and data through Vodacom digital payment channels grew 25% year-on-year. In total we processed just over R1 billion in sales through these channels. Results are attributable to promotional deals that provided customers with additional value when purchasing through the digital channels. To further leverage the increased use of digital payment solutions, Vodacom Financial Services launched several value-added services through the MyVodacom app and Vodacom Express Recharge. These include prepaid utilities and bill payments.\n\nVodacom launched its very first POS device. The 'Max' Android POS device enables merchants to process debit and credit card payments while also offering them the ability to vend a range of value-added services to their consumers. To date, Vodacom processes in excess of R92 million per month in payments through the devices and has over 1 700 actively trading merchants.\n\nThis growth was achieved through helping customers when they needed it most in hard lockdown, by providing innovative payment solutions and propositions that provided greater value through direct engagement through our digital channels.",

The platform processed more than US$24.5 billion in transactions a month in the last quarter, making it the biggest financial services provider in Africa. It has evolved into a broader payments platform that offers access to life-enhancing personal services such as healthcare, education, employment, transportation and social protection - including enterprises, financial services and mobile commerce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## M-Pesa empowers women\n\nM-Pesa empowers women in Mozambique through access to approximately 13 000 banks.\n\nMaria Carla Chico, one of our agents in Mozambique, lost her livelihood after her grocery store was destroyed by fire. M-Pesa came to the rescue when she became an agent, which helped her build a thriving business again and continue to support her family with instant cash transfers to a remote part of the country.\n\nAnother agent, Jennifer Fernandes Lyimo, who runs her own dry-cleaning business, had to close her office and wait in queues at the bank whenever her husband sent money from the UK. M-Pesa made life easier for her and her customers.\n\nC A S E S T U D Y\n\n## Product growth\n\nRevenue from M-Pesa increased 4.5% to R16.9 billion, including Safaricom. Our International markets contributed R4.5 billion of this revenue. The platform's financial services offering is considered a key driver of socioeconomic growth and is becoming a gateway to the digital economy. M-Pesa (including Safaricom) is used by more than 900 enterprises to collect and disburse payments, and over 170 000 retail and online merchants accept M-Pesa.\n\n## Be l ow are examp l es of ongoing product expansion which is acce l erated and directed by our strategic hu b , M-Pesa Africa.\n\n## Nanol ending p l atforms\n\nOur nano-lending platforms continue driving growth in our International markets, providing easy, secure and almost instant access to cash.

In Kenya, 1.4 million customers use our Fuliza overdraft facility.\n\n## S avings and l oans\n\nIn the DRC, Vodacom introduced a savings and loans solution in partnership with microfinance FINCA Bank that enables M-Pesa customers to save and access microloans through Vodacash. People in remote areas can access payment, loans and savings on their mobile devices without having to travel to access traditional banking services. Over 4.3 million customers have used Vodacash since its launch.\n\nWe launched our savings offering, Mokhatlo, enabling M-Pesa customers to save for a common goal. It gives a group of M-Pesa registered customers controlled access to a shared account that pays for goods and services. In Mozambique, over 70 000 community members save money through the virtual Xitique wallet. Vodacom Tanzania partnered with Tanzania Postal Bank to create M-Koba, a group savings solution that enables community members, particularly women, to mobilise savings, investments and microloans. More than 20 000 groups have activated M-Koba since its inception. In 2021, Vodacom Tanzania made the product interoperable so that subscribers from other mobile network operators can save through M-Koba.\n\nIn Lesotho, Vodacom launched Vodasurance free funeral cover for customers who reach a monthly spend threshold. The customers receive covers ranging from M1 000 to M4 000.\n\nIn Mozambique, M-Pesa has extended beyond basic financial transactions in its portfolio and now offers a savings product, bank interoperability functionality that further promotes inclusion as the banked can transfer funds to M-Pesa wallets, and functionality that allows M-Pesa payments onto approximately 13 000 bank POS terminals countrywide. M-Pesa has more than 4.9 million customers in Mozambique with a bank interoperability of approximately 13 000 banks.\n\n## Merchant capa b i l ities\n\nAs part of our Vision 2025 strategy we are actively building out our capabilities across the value chain, including in the merchant space.

In the DRC, Vodacom partnered with Equity Bank to introduce a foreign exchange product for customers, enabling them to seamlessly convert between the Congolese franc and the US dollar the country's dual currencies through M-Pesa. In Lesotho, our partnership with Hello Paisa enables migrant workers to send money home to their families, which was particularly important during COVID-19-related travel restrictions and lockdowns.\n\n## ,PSURYLQJglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>\u0225QDQFLDOglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>LQFOXVLRQ\n\nIn Lesotho, M-Pesa is used to drive socioeconomic projects, such as the school feeding and COVID-19 relief project partnership between M-Pesa and the World Food Programme (WFP). M-Pesa is used to disburse funds to the WFP's 9 800 beneficiaries in different districts of the country. In the DRC,  we partnered with the WFP to bring assistance, via M-Pesa, to 23 000 vulnerable members of society to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 over a period of nine months. At the height of the pandemic, Vodacom Lesotho zero-rated P2P and merchant fees on M-Pesa to ease the burden of transacting.\n\nAlso in Lesotho, and through our International Finance Corporation team, we engaged with and registered 9 664 customers of whom 55% were women. This is a great step in improving women's financial inclusion. Since the inception of this phase of the programme we have registered over 83 000 customers, of whom 51.7% are female. Over the course of 2020, we registered 955 new merchants and over 1 000 M-Pesa agents, creating jobs across the M-Pesa ecosystem and providing financial independence for the Basotho citizens.\n\nVodacom Mozambique launched its M-Pesa Women's Forum, with events in two cities providing financial management information as well as HIV testing and counselling, child immunisation and the issuing of national identities in partnership with the government.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Cash in/cash out (including ATM) Across our markets we are working to ensure  that a ll  markets are at

        "page_content": "## Consumer digita l content\n\nWe adopt a platform approach to digital content, and enhance our customer propositions through strategic partnerships across our markets. Our content offerings span key verticals, and we provide some examples below.\n\nOur mobile gaming platform, PlayInc, continues to grow steadily. The service features one of the largest mobile game subscription-based libraries in South Africa, with several titles licensed by some of the world's largest mobile publishers. These include recognisable brands such as Jetpack Joyride, Lara Croft: Relic Run, Subway Surfers and Disney's Frozen Free Fall: Icy Shot.\n\nDespite the pandemic affecting live football, once the season resumed, Premier Soccer League fans were again able to enjoy checking scores and news for free on Vodacom Soccer's USSD portal.\n\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on marketing spend across industry verticals, Vodacom Advertising focused on managing costs and realigning the product roadmap. Developing a competitive product set to drive considerable return on investment in client marketing spend is central to our new strategy. Core capabilities remain focused on enabling data and technology platforms.\n\nOur ecosystem business continued to strengthen our partner framework and enhanced billing and security of our direct carrier billing payment platform.\n\nUnchanged from 2020\n\nNot achieved\n\nAchieved\n\nWe continued to provide access to consumer digital services across our markets through various digital solutions. In Tanzania, we offer VLive and Video Play. In Mozambique, consumer digital services such as video (Vuclip), local music (Mozik) and sports (VLive Sports) continue to grow and keep our customers entertained. In the DRC, we launched several digital platforms, including video (VuClip and VodacomTV), music (MUSKA) and gaming (Gameloft). These solutions offer subscription packages to customers for entertainment, helping to relieve stress during the pandemic. We will also launch our VLive services portfolio in the future. In Lesotho, Video Play offers subscription video and TV, including locally developed content on demand.\n\nWe introduced our Mum & Baby platform in 2017. It is a zero-rated service providing 1.9 million registered South African subscribers with information on maternal and child health and well-being. In 2021, the DRC introduced Mum & Baby to 3 300 registered users with a view to reaching 200 000 by 2025. We partnered with local retailers to reward customers with coupons for relevant lifestyle products, including nappies and baby food. In Tanzania, the Healthy Pregnancy Healthy Baby platform is locally known as Wazazi Nipendeni and provides maternal health information to 1.3 million registered users. The platform also provides COVID-19 assessments.\n\n## Fi b re in S outh Africa\n\nThe past financial year has been characterised as challenging due to high levels of change and uncertainty. In a very price-competitive and saturated market, our fibre to the home and business (FTTx) footprint continued to expand, positioning Vodacom Fibre for success in a dynamic market. The number of homes connected to Vodacom Fibre increased by 103%, with the number of connected businesses increasing 48% year-on-year.\n\nWe constantly review our strategy to ensure it remains relevant in our rapidly changing operating environment, which is increasingly complex and challenging, and we have implemented several efficiency measures to improve the customer experience. These measures included improving our time to connect, targeting our sales focus and addressing customer connectivity needs through multiple bitstream providers. By doing this we continued to strengthen the quality of our customer engagements.\n\nVodacom's e-School has 1.25 million registered learners with access to digital education content. When learners were at home during lockdown, user registrations increased fourfold from an average of 37 500 to a peak of nearly 150 000 student events every day. Content use increased substantially with mathematics, natural sciences and accounting the most popular subjects.\n\nTo date, 15.5 million unique users have visited the ConnectU platform and 20 million sessions were initiated per month. ConnectU's job portal enabled 3.1 million people to access seven job search websites for free (over a third of the users were in the low-income group). During lockdown, we expanded our platform to enable customers to purchase electricity and water.\n\nVodacom and Mezzanine's electronic health record solution, mVacciNation, supported South Africa's Department of Health in administering COVID-19 vaccines. Alongside the Vodafone foundation, we recently announced a pledge of R87 million to support the roll-out of cold-chain technology, and support the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable and hard-toreach communities. We donated R13 million to Lesotho to secure vaccines and partnered with AUDANEPAD to build digital infrastructure to manage vaccinations across 55 countries. We were able to do this due to the platform's success in South Africa.",

We increased connectivity, thereby ensuring the sustainability of our society and protecting the livelihoods of people during a particularly disruptive time.\n\n## 2021 at a g l ance\n\nWhile the outbreak of COVID-19 significantly changed the socioeconomic landscape in 2020, we continued to ensure our customers were able to operate remotely during the various stages of lockdown in our markets.

We have adjusted our strategy accordingly to ensure we capture opportunities to grow our business further while supporting our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n23.2% contribution to Group Service revenue from enterprise\n\nSouth Africa Vodacom Business service revenue up 11.3%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSouth Africa Vodacom Business IoT underlying revenue increased\n\n32.8%\n\n## Vodacom Business s y stem of advantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the current year, we introduced a dedicated strategic pillar for this segment.

SME is a very big market opportunity for us, with over two million SMEs in South Africa alone. Most of these SMEs operate in the informal sector, which is key to our economic growth outlook.\n\nIn the financial services space where we compete across the value chain, we believe that merchant capabilities are core to a fintech business model, and as such, are embedded in our VodaPay and M-Pesa journeys.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also developed solutions to support the rebuilding of customer businesses and implement return-to-workplace solutions that leveraged our IoT capabilities, such as vital signs, thermal screening, social distancing, personal protective equipment monitoring, and employee track and trace.\n\nOur Vodacom Business (VB) team supported the South African government in a number of projects to enable the day-to-day management of COVID-19 challenges. We offered and collaborated on solutions that enhanced sustainability and promoted continuity to protect livelihoods and promote education.\n\nThrough a transversal contract (RT15), we could digitise various governmentrelated services. Our collaboration with municipalities centred on internet, APN, security and asset management services, as well as smart metering services.\n\nWe collaborated with the South African departments of education and health in their response to the pandemic. We launched an online education platform in partnership with Microsoft to support remote learning at both higher and basic education levels. Looking ahead, we will continue to develop connected education solutions in collaboration with the government. For the next financial year, Vodacom Business will focus on connectivity for users, content accessibility, device availability and funding solutions. These digital solutions support education and ensure inclusion for students who would otherwise have been excluded. In addition to the platform we provided highly discounted offers to universities to enable educate from home options.\n\nVodacom IoT assisted the South African government by developing the Mpilo app. This patient engagement platform eases communication between patients, doctors and the Department of Health and improves service delivery at provincial health facilities. The mobile app's latest features aim to help healthcare workers trace people who have tested positive for COVID-19. The app has 61 467 active users.\n\nWe deployed our pre-existing health app solutions to support the government's fight against COVID-19. Through mVacciNation, more than 95 000 patient records have been created and more than 315 000 immunisations administered, while over 140 000 COVID-19 tests were processed through eLABS in South Africa, Zambia and Nigeria. Through the Stock Visibility Solution (SVS), more than 41 million reports were submitted in South Africa. The AitaHealth platform, which supports government to quantitatively understand the state of healthcare in communities, has registered and screened more than 571 000 households and 1.6 million individuals since its launch in 2014. We also donated data lines and 20 000 devices to community health workers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, refer to our 2021 sustainability report.\n\nNational Treasury awarded Vodacom Business a five-year transversal contract (RT46) to provide fleet management services relating to drivers, vehicle bookings and traffic fines.\n\nWe diversified our client mix by focusing on additional enterprise sectors - including the mining, manufacturing, retail and services industries. To achieve this, we leveraged our IoT.nxt solutions and expanded our geographic reach through Vodafone, rest of Africa and USA markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe acquisition of IoT.nxt yielded positive results for our IoT business. MachNation - a leading independent benchmarking firm recognised IoT.nxt as best-in-class among its peers. IoT.nxt also benefited from revenues earned in the USA and other Vodafone markets, thereby increasing our IoT revenue. We are encouraged by Vodafone's adoption of IoT.nxt as a centre of competence for key IoT end-to-end solutions like smart base stations, smart buildings and energy management. Our COVID-19 solutions were driven through IoT.nxt and Nexio, with health solutions driven through Mezzanine.\n\nOur partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to position VB as a digital transformation partner of choice. It enables us to leverage machine learning (ML), Big Data and AI to provide Fourth Industrial Revolution, digital and data-driven insights to our enterprise and SME customers.\n\nOur managed security services division continues to grow, with our Nexio-led Microsoft business expanding our service offering. During the COVID-19 lockdown, we launched Microsoft Teams and VoIP, which became a key value driver for our Microsoft Virtual Classroom Education offering and work-from-home cloud bundles.\n\nOur Digital Smart Service offering partnerships, launched in collaboration with Accenture, Deloitte, Letsema and Urbian, positions VB as a competent digital transformation partner in the market.\n\nWe revised our SME segment strategy to enable us to service this market better and unlock further value.\n\nThe changing trend to work from home placed additional demand on our network. This challenge has been exacerbated by Eskom's load shedding, and sporadic battery theft and vandalism at our network sites. We are driving investment to mitigate this risk to ensure connectivity for our corporate clients. For example, we spent R1 billion on lithium-ion batteries, which have a longer useful life than lead-acid batteries and are less harmful to the environment.",

Our performance was also impacted by launching ConnectU, a platform to provide free access to basic internet and essential services, and significantly reducing data packages for more than 2 000 low-income suburbs across South Africa. To date, 15.5 million unique users have visited the ConnectU platform, with 20 million sessions per month.\n\nDue to the constrained operating environment, it became critical that we adopt an agile approach to safeguarding our customers. South Africa's lockdowns and Eskom's power challenges required a rapid response for our agent network and customer-facing employees. Our prior investment in digital channels and further investment in our social media command centre provided additional resilience. While our customer propositions, network resilience and behavioural loyalty programme reinforced our ability to create value for our customers through our innovative products and services, this became critical with the dramatic shift in demand due to the new trends of work, entertainment and education from home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCall volumes reduced by 21%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaunched TOBi Voice in January 2021, the first voice chatbot in South Africa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPredictive analytics generated a total financial impact of R25.3 mi ll ion.\n\nLaunched an ultra-high value call centre, offering a private banker-like experience to our high-value customers.\n\nTOBi, our chatbot, conducted 6.1 mi ll ion chat sessions with an average containment rate of 74% and generated revenue of R5.5 mi ll ion.\n\nCost savings amounted to R65.8 mi ll ion , driven by digitalisation.",

Gartner's IT for Customers yearly report ranked us as the leader in digital channels in South Africa.\n\nActive customers on the MyVodacom app grew by 70% year-on-year to 3.6 million unique users. Revenue generated by the app increased by 70%. Customer frequency also increased to 13 times per customer per month (from seven times per customer in 2020). These improvements are a direct result of the app enhancements we made during the year, including simplifying the customer navigation journey, introducing easy-to-use self-service features and launching our VodaBucks loyalty programme - a digital first. Prepaid customers who use the MyVodacom app increased by 141%, while the number of contract and hybrid customers increased by 16% and 48%, respectively.\n\n## Measuring customer experience and de l ivering l eadership on our NP S\n\nWe use the NPS to quantify the quality of each customer's experience with our brand compared to competitors. The NPS is based on one question: 'Would you recommend Vodacom to a friend, family member or colleague?'.\n\nIn South Africa, Vodacom's NPS ranked second place in 2021, while we led the market scores in 2020.\n\n## Our NP S performance rating\n\n| Country      | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| South Africa | 2nd    | 1st    | 1st    | 1st    |\n| Tanzania     | 1st    | 1st    | 1st    | 1st    |\n| DRC          | 1st    | 1st    | 1st    | 1st    |\n| Mozambique   | 2nd    | 3rd    | 2nd    | 1st    |\n| Lesotho      | 2nd    | 2nd    | 1st    | 1st    |\n\nOur touchpoint (tNPS) reached customer satisfaction highs of 56ppts, and our Android store ratings were a strong 4.4 stars. Our Digital ID and single sign-on functionality enabled customers to register a unified profile across our app and website. The introduction of this functionality also streamlines our fibre customers' experience by enabling them to easily manage their accounts and remain updated on relevant information about new offers and features.",

Mobile digital sales contributions increased by 46% on volume, while revenue contributions increased by 67% year-on-year. Unassisted sales remained a key focus area to ensure customers experience seamless and intuitive journeys 24/7. Key fixed sales and service capabilities were delivered via the MyVodacom app and our online platform to ensure the accessibility of our fibre offering. As a result, our online sales contributed 17% of total fibre sales, with further potential growth. Following this resilient performance from our digital channels throughout the various COVID-19 lockdown levels, we intend to continue accelerating our digital sales and capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe successfully completed the first phase of our e-commerce platform, enabling customers to purchase a range of consumer electronic products with their credit cards. Guest checkout journeys are also available for non-Vodacom customers who choose to access our technology products and services at competitive prices.\n\nAcross our international markets, we continued driving customer engagement through the 'lite' version of the MyVodacom app by focusing on improving customer experience, despite device compatibility challenges with lower-end devices in some markets.\n\nRPA was launched in our international markets to enhance back-office automation. This ensured we could handle customer queries more efficiently, and ultimately improve our customer experience. We have rolled-out our RPA use cases in our COPS (finance and tech) departments.\n\nWe believe the launch of TOBi Voice, our digital chatbot concierge service, will be a gamechanger for the market and industry because of its ability to handle 6.1 million customer engagements. Chatbots provide customers with instant services available 24/7 and offer them the option to talk to a live agent through smart routing, which uses AI and ML to route a query to the best agent. Chatbots were launched via the MyVodacom app, website and social media platforms in Tanzania, and via social media platforms in Lesotho.\n\n## A l wa y s great and persona l ised va l ue with our tai l ored p l atforms and pricing transformation ( S outh Africa)\n\nWe continued to accelerate personalisation and contextual marketing engines to mitigate the impact of our macroeconomic environment. By driving hyper-personalisation, we create value for our consumer and solidify Vodacom as the brand of choice for all consumers and all consumer segments. We achieve this by leveraging our Big Data platform, which generates appealing customer offerings relevant to a specific consumer profile and their geographic area. In doing this, revenue from steered sales increased to 32% of total prepaid revenue, contributing to the 8.5% prepaid growth in the year. Through geographic targeted offers and campaigns, sales revenue from our Just4U Town platform increased by 19% year-on-year, yielding a 6% increase in market share within low-share regions.\n\n## Creating great and persona l ised va l ue with our active da y s management ( S outh Africa)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo safeguard our existing consumer base in this hypercompetitive market, we continued to ensure our consumers remained active on our network. We used a focused management framework that incorporates extensive personalisation engines, our loyalty programme and targeted segmented campaigns to increase active days. This approach led to a 5.5% increase year-on-year in active days per consumer.\n\n## S ustaining great and persona l ised va l ue with our postpaid b ase management and churn\n\nNew entrants in the fixed connectivity space such as fibre, along with the rapid price reduction in mobile broadband products, drove several changes within the mobile connectivity market. Because of this, as well as increased competitive pressures, we aimed to solidify postpaid consumer retention and base management. Specifically, we focused on favourable proactive upgrades. CVM-steered upgrade volumes increased by over 100% compared with the prior financial year, with an incremental subscription uplift of more than 12% per upgrade. Additional sales also saw a 25% increase in bolt-on bundles and 14% additional lines through the transition from line-based base management to account-based base management.\n\nSeveral innovative solutions, including COVID-19-related relief plans and special payment holidays, as well as the increased focus from our retentions department, saw a 19% decrease in the number of lines churned year-on-year, with an additional 35% reduction in outflow revenue. The movement to accountbased base management has laid the foundation for future convergence and multi-product penetration, which will remain a key focus area for 2022.",

Since launching in September 2020, the programme has attracted 23.5 million unique customers who earn, bank and spend their VodaBucks via our MyVodacom app. We have given away a retail value of over R6.5 billion in lifestyle rewards to all South Africans platform customers. In addition, one billion VodaBucks was redeemed and 38.3 million personalised goals were completed by our customers since the launch.\n\nThe VodaBucks loyalty platform has over 500 partner networks, enabling us to reward customers with tangible rewards through our loyalty e-commerce store. The ShakeOff2020 summer campaign further increased engagement on the MyVodacom app, with over 50 million daily shakes.\n\nOur fraud prevention initiatives performed well during the year because we used innovative methods to identify fraud patterns, locate syndicates geographically and successfully block more than 5 400 devices and 110 000 SIM cards.\n\nThe perceived disappearance of data is a significant challenge for Vodacom and one we actively try to address through education and our #Datawyze campaign. We continue to emphasise, educate and empower customers to understand their data settings and usage. While this trend is decreasing, it remains a challenge and continues to be a negative perception driver for customers.\n\nOur new VodaBucks loyalty programme is aimed at all South African consumers across the socioeconomic spectrum. In this way, we build customer loyalty by ensuring each consumer has the best possible experience when engaging with our brand.\n\nIn the past, we offered consumers a range of loyalty programmes, including our Talking Points and My Contract Rewards. However, it is increasingly important that we drive innovation to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our research shows that our competitor loyalty platforms scale successfully; however, they are primarily targeted at higher-income consumers and do not cater to or give value to the mass consumer segment of South Africa. Through VodaBucks, we intend to give tangible value to every South African customer within the entire socioeconomic landscape - regardless of their income status.\n\nC A S E S T U D Y\n\nWe blend physical and digital experiences to create an immersive 'phygital' environment, where technology, digital and traditional capabilities are integrated seamlessly to create new and better ways of accomplishing everyday activities. We are the first techco in South Africa to launch a self-service retail kiosk, through which we empower customers to complete express, unassisted sales journeys that are customer responsive, paperless and seamless, leveraging internal solutions and capabilities. This allows customers to complete various transactions effortlessly, including account payments, SIM vending, and purchasing of airtime and data bundles.\n\nWe introduced a future-ready digital content management solution (CMS) into our franchise stores and Vodacom World. The CMS supports a paperless marketing environment that offers dynamic digital marketing content that is both agile and responsive and drives customer experience, sales, service and brand affinity. The solution also acts as a central marketing hub, through which our retail channels can access a single platform for digital content management. This enables us to execute real time or scheduled digital marketing content that can be segmented and customised by region, country, cluster and store - as well as designated screens within a single store. The solution further offers the speed to respond to competitor offerings with the click of a button and assist the customer with their decision-making.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We remain supportive of the HDS auction proceeding as soon as possible. We believe that the allocation of HDS is critical to reducing input costs and, by extension, the cost of data. The assignment of additional spectrum is also vital to expanding broadband services and promoting digital inclusion in South Africa.\n\nWe concluded an agreement with Cell C to provide 2G, 3G and 4G roaming services to Cell C's postpaid subscriber base. The subscriber migration process is still ongoing.\n\nOur overall mobile network performance improved through our ongoing efforts to modernise our network to support the latest features and capabilities. This was further driven by expanding our 4G+ footprint, where possible, and our investment in our new 5G network.\n\nWe increased the percentage of base stations with self-provided transmission to 97.51%. A total of 48.6% of sites have fibre and 48.9% have self-provided high-capacity microwave transmission.\n\nWe accelerated our fibre footprint during the year - expanding to 146 401 homes and businesses - with new capabilities built into our digital channels to place an order, schedule installations and manage services.\n\nWe mitigated some of the negative impact on our consumer and enterprise customers by accelerating the installation of new backup batteries and standby power solutions, and implementing high-security shelters to reduce battery theft and damage. The network availability improvement plan accelerated battery deployment to our base stations and we reached 10 025 sites, as well as 818 first-priority enterprise business unit sites. We installed over 38 000 new lithium-ion batteries and improved security measures at more than 10 025 sites in the network.

This contributed to between 10% and 20% run-time reduction in airconditioning in our base station containers. We rolled out this technology to more than half of our South African base stations and will continue with the project during 2021. We are also extending the project to our international markets, starting with Vodacom Mozambique.\n\n## Addressing c yb er threats to maintain customer securit y and privac y\n\nVodacom continues to mature our extensive set of cyber security controls and mechanisms across our markets, with continuous status reviews regarding the adequacy and coverage.

We moved selected analytical workloads into the public cloud, enabling delivery of analytics at scale to steer investments into beneficial channels, price plans and devices. At the end of the first year of our AWS cloud programme we created more than 180 AWS workloads, of which over half were cloud-native workloads.\n\nBy using Big Data and ML in our operational areas, we improved our investments, especially in identifying new network sites and offering ongoing targeted campaigns to meet our customers' needs.\n\nBased on the principle 'build once and reuse many times', we deployed an analytical engine that only required configuration for our Shake-Up Summer or ShakeOff2020 Summer campaign. The same capability will be deployed in our African markets to accelerate analytics.\n\nTOBi, our chatbot, uses the latest AI technology to provide customers with a conversational experience that can solve queries without human interaction via SMS, WhatsApp, the Vodacom website and the MyVodacom app. TOBi handled up to 20 000 chats per day and over six million interactions during the year, in total.

By encouraging employee skills development, we can encourage employees to seize opportunities to transition into new targeted roles, thereby ensuring that Vodacom's employees have the requisite skills in an ever-changing world.\n\nMore than 5 000 employees participated in agi l e programmes, which equip them with working techniques via an instructor-led classroom/virtual classroom. To date, 476 employees have completed one or more of the following programmes: agile fundamentals, agile bootcamp, product owner, release train engineer and scrum master. This equates to a total of 5 944 hours of formal training.\n\n## Fostering workp l ace inc l usivit y and diversit y\n\nDriving an inc l usive emp l o y ee cu l ture, which fosters tolerance and embraces diversity, is a key component of our human capital strategy. We ensure that different viewpoints, backgrounds, ethnicity, ages and genders are respected and included. Vodacom has instituted multiple diversity and inclusion initiatives and forums, such as the Disability Forum, LGBTQ+ Network, National Consultative Committee, the Women's Network Forum and the Youth Exco, among others.\n\nOur new parenta l l eave po l ic y positions us as a top employer, which underlines our commitment to diversity and gender equality. This policy ensures that all employees - from partners giving birth, adopting a child or becoming a parent through surrogacy - can enjoy four months of paid parental leave. This gives employees more time with their families when welcoming new children and shows how our inc l usion for a ll philosophy comes to life. The policy was launched on 1 September 2020 in all markets we operate in, and, since then, 72 employees have enjoyed this benefit across our footprint.\n\nWe review our internal pay ranges annually and consistently apply them throughout the organisation. All operating companies in Vodacom are required to conduct an annual fair-pay analysis to ensure they are committed to fair pay and responsible remuneration across all employee levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOffering training to deve l op ICT ski ll s among unemp l o y ed y outh in S outh Africa is a key opportunity for Vodacom to give back to our communities. We invested R30 million in training 117 Vodacom interns and 81 learners, of which 71 are youth with disabilities. These young people receive ICT-related training courses, and selected learners were transitioned into an entrepreneurship programme while others were offered permanent positions, both within Vodacom and outside the organisation.\n\nWe continued our jo b shadow programme to support high school pupils' science, technology, economics and maths programmes. Our job shadow programme is incorporated as part of their Life Orientation curriculum. Due to COVID-19, pupils connected with and shadowed their identified mentors virtually. Each identified mentor is a graduate alumnus involved in different Vodacom business units. Altogether 15 job shadow roles were available this financial year, increasing from seven  in the previous financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVodafone Universit y offers our permanent employees access to online learning opportunities across multiple training platforms such as LinkedIn Learning, O'Reilly, Udemy, Coursera and UiPath. During the financial year, 64 535 online courses were completed - with each employee completing at least one course at a reach of 96%. Employees completed 28 600 online training programmes this year, equal to 114 431 hours.\n\nIn 2020, we launched Project Renaissance to drive a targeted transformational focus through a dedicated Group structure. This enabled the introduction of new leadership capabilities for Vodacom South Africa and the Group. We aim to be a strong pan-African player by introducing a central Group function that enables sharing opportunities, thereby embedding a growth and innovation framework that has the potential to create new revenue streams and offer other benefits for the business. Our Group CEO drives this opportunity and has end-to-end responsibility for the African continent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe WeThinkCode programme trains Africa's top tech talent and drives the digitisation of African businesses. Talented youth are recruited and moulded into exceptional software engineers. Vodacom is proud of its collaboration with the WeThinkCode programme and has invested R2 million to sponsor 20 students to complete their NQF 5 programme.\n\nTo promote diversity and inclusion, we create forums that consider various employee views, ideas and perspectives to help inform our decision-making process. Our y outh counci l (Youth Exco) forum was created to assist the business to evolve and understand the digital needs of an increasingly younger target market. Millennials approach the technology industry unconventionally, and we view their unconventional approach as a business opportunity.\n\nOur flagship fema l e l eadership programme in S outh Africa seeks out high-potential black females with deep commercial, technological and digital experience for strategic roles in our future talent pipeline. The programme seeks out internal opportunities to advance black women into leadership roles within the business. Achieving our goal tackles the national skills development and the emancipation of black women in the technology industry.",

We hosted 30 virtual fireside chats with our Group CEO and Exco, which were designed to keep staff updated on COVID-19 developments and critical business announcements, as well as question and answer sessions with business leaders. On average, 3 000 employees attended each of these sessions.\n\nEmployee Douw Briel was hospitalised, and placed in a medically induced coma after testing positive for COVID-19 in January 2021. The Vodacom health and well-being team, managed by Gerda Holmes, offered care and assistance to Douw's wife and family while he was hospitalised and recovering.\n\nC A S E S T U D Y\n\nDouw said, 'I was overwhelmed by the support, care, love and attention my family received from the Vodacom wellness team while I was in hospital. Gerda went out of her way to ensure that my family received support from the Vodacom Employee Assistance Programme. During this time, Gerda personally contacted my wife for regular check-ins to offer support and advice. I am extremely grateful and proud to be associated with an employer who goes the extra mile for its employees.'\n\nAs we navigate the pandemic, we hope to keep employees engaged and boost staff morale by creating a fun organisational culture. We launched our S PIRT of FUN campaign, which included virtual activities such as a comedy show, a virtual employee party and a virtual pop quiz.\n\nDuring the year, we accelerated our digital transformation journey and unlocked new opportunities. Our Vodacom Engage app is a mobile employee engagement platform we used extensively throughout the pandemic. Ultimately, it has evolved into the primary communication gateway for the business, offering users a seamless and connected experience. We used the Engage app's self-assessment functionality to aid the issuance of movement permits to critical employees during the hard lockdown, as well as to offer employees working from home a 24/7 well-being support tool.\n\nWe set aside over R2 million from our Disaster Fund to assist more than 170 permanent South African employees financially impacted by COVID-19. Eligible employees may have experienced a loss or reduced household income resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations, COVID-19 related medical expenses not covered by their medical aid, or the tragic death of a family member.\n\nWe offered employees the opportunity to contribute to the Solidarity Fund and other charities and non-profit organisations (NPOs) via our payroll platform. Money was donated from their monthly salaries to various causes. Vodacom matched all donations by 50%, thereby making it easier for our business and employees to give back together. This is an excellent example of how Vodacom demonstrated our Spirit pillar, 'getting it done, together'.\n\nDuring 2021, Vodacom was recognised as a Top Employer in all our operating markets. Vodafone was similarly recognised in Egypt and Ghana. In addition, the Vodacom Group earned third place in the Top Employer Africa category. This certification recognises our efforts to create a nurturing environment where employees can thrive, and enables us to reflect on our progress to become an employer of choice. It is also a reflection of our continued commitment to improving people efficiencies and driving employee experience excellence.\n\nTo embed the Spirit of Vodacom across the business, we aligned our rewards programme, Vodacom S tar Awards, with our strategic culture pillars. During the financial year, over 1 500 employees received a Star Cash Award, with more than 3 200 employees nominated for a thank-you award. We use our rewards programme and organisational culture to encourage employees to demonstrate our S pirit b ehaviours in their daily work activities - thereby ensuring that employees deliver the desired results for our business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Vodacom has investigated all incidents and, to mitigate against any future occurrence, will align and enhance driver behaviour monitoring systems with various interventions. Road risks remain our principal risk especially for contractors, who accounted for 72% of the road incidents reported during the year, up from 62% in 2020. Furthermore, we noted that contractors account for 75% of all reported incidents. During the year, vehicle incidents represented 54% of all safety incidents (2020: 46%), followed by electrical fires (9%) and criminal activity (5%). These incidents are known as high-potential incidents and comprise 82% of our total incidents. South Africa is accountable for 88% of all safety incidents (2020: 76%).\n\nWe remain committed to providing a healthy work environment. We achieve this by implementing initiatives that promote both physical and mental health, as well as employee well-being. The ICAS well-being programme was integrated into our business in January 2018. Since its integration, 110 well-being ambassadors have been trained and serve as well-being ambassadors.\n\nWe introduced a COVID-19 special leave policy for South African employees on 1 February 2021. The goal of this policy is to support employees impacted by the virus through two types of leave - special illness leave that enables employees who have been booked off or hospitalised to take the necessary time to recover without depleting their standard sick leave benefit, as well as special family responsibility leave that enables employees to take additional time off to attend funerals or care for immediate and extended family members who are ill as a result of COVID-19. This leave supplements the standard family responsibility leave already allocated to employees, and may only be utilised once the standard family responsibility leave has been depleted.\n\n## How a digital organisation and culture supports the system of advantage\n\nWe are a purpose-led business that fosters an innovative and agile employee culture, which we call the Spirit of Vodacom. By embedding this culture throughout the business, we prioritise high-performance, customer-focused and respectful behaviours from our employees. We also value inclusivity, diversity and employee engagement, because engaged staff feel understood, heard and appreciated. This, in turn, is reflected in their behaviours and enables employees to succeed and thrive - thereby creating value for our stakeholders and ensuring our sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue to expand our digita l organisation and cu l ture agenda by :\n\n- Embedding a culture of inclusivity by promoting our commitment to workforce diversity and localisation;\n- Promoting skills development and youth empowerment;\n- Building the coaching capabilities of our leaders;\n- Driving the digital transformation agenda by embedding agile structures and RPA;\n- Differentiating the work environment through positive employee engagement;\n- Ensuring the physical and mental well-being of our employees;\n- Identifying requisite future skills and aligning our graduate and bursary programme to attract these skills; and\n- Having a female empowerment programme, where we identify high performing black females leadership in these candidates through a training\n- in the market to develop future skills and programme, from which we then recruit.",

It was also our commitment to South Africa that Vodacom would stop at nothing until everyone was connected to the abundant potential of a digital society. We thrive on ensuring access to all critical services from education to health, the fight against GBV, empowerment of small businesses, financial inclusion and more.

We measure the quality of our customers' experiences through the tNPS. We also commission an independent research company to conduct an annual reputation survey across our markets to measure how stakeholders perceive our performance against our competitors and non-telcos. The reputation index is measured against five metrics, which provide deeper insights into our reputation performance: overall impression, overall trust, favourability, quality of products and services, and economic or financial success.\n\nThe most recent survey conducted found that Vodacom continues to be a reputational leader in the telco sector, with stakeholders rating us higher than our competitors - which is comparable with non-telco benchmark brands. According to the survey, three of our five markets perform above the global telecommunications index average of 69, and we are in the top 33 percentile of mobile services globally.\n\n| Our reputation index  performance in 2021 1   |      | Re l ative to  competitors   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------------------------------|\n| South Africa                                  | 87.5 | 1st                          |\n| Tanzania                                      | 92.7 | 1st                          |\n| DRC                                           | 85.6 | 1st                          |\n| Mozambique                                    | 62.4 | 1st                          |\n| Lesotho                                       | 65.1 | 1st                          |\n\nThe survey and regular engagements provide deeper insights into the hot topics our stakeholders are concerned about. We regularly engage with stakeholders to ascertain their interests and implement various initiatives aimed at building mutual trust.\n\nWe are also proud that Vodacom was ranked first by companies and NPOs for having the most significant developmental impact within South Africa, according to Trialogue's corporate development impact 2020 rating. It was the fourth consecutive year that Vodacom was ranked first by companies and the first time we received this ranking from NPOs, which ranked us third in the past three years.

This positioning empowers us to realise our purpose to connect for a better future and enable an inclusive and sustainable digital society. Our brand position is inspired by insights that reveal the role of technology in profoundly transforming people's lives. Research findings have identified how technology has evolved from something that simply excites people on a personal level into a tool that can be used to play a more meaningful part in the world at large. Technology is particularly able to make a difference in education, gender empowerment and sustainability.\n\nAt the centre of our strategy is Vodacom's Social Contract, which emphasises partnerships and good relationships with our stakeholders - based on trust, fairness and leadership. Our Social Contract also served as the foundation of our COVID-19 response strategy, helping us build our reputation and deliver our promises to our stakeholders. Our COVID-19 interventions delivered significant levels of success with respect to our reputation, which strengthened our resolve to deliver on our Social Contract in the middle of the crisis. An independent study rated Vodacom among the top 10 South African brands consumers perceived as leading the field in protecting them and making a positive impact during the COVID-19 lockdown. We continue to strengthen our reputation by securing the trust of our stakeholders and ensuring that our ongoing COVID-19 efforts leverage our network, digital platforms and data analytics capabilities to deliver economic value for society, government and business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our Social Contract, refer to our 2021 LC sustainability report.",

Vodacom South Africa demonstrated the biggest improvement, while Nexio (Pty) Limited and IoT.NxT (Pty) Limited declined.\n\n## S ki ll s deve l opment\n\nThe Group's combined spend for skills development increased by R48.9 million from the previous year - an increase that resulted in R324 million spend on training of black employees and black people, of which over R18 million was spent on training for persons living with disabilities. In addition, the Group retained 45 learners more than the previous year, ensuring that 89 unemployed persons on learnerships obtained full-time employment.

The Group's performance was underpinned by South Africa, which captured increased demand for connectivity, particularly in prepaid and VB, and new growth streams such as IoT and financial services. Also, in line with our expectations, our International portfolio recovered in the second half of the year.\n\nNew growth streams include fixed, IoT, digital and financial services. Vodacom's Financial Services business and M-Pesa delivered service revenue of R6.9 billion, up 15.0%, and contributed 8.9% of consolidated service revenue. Our digital, fixed and IoT businesses delivered service revenue of R1.7 billion, R3.7 billion and R1.1 billion respectively. In aggregate, these new services amounted to R13.4 billion and contributed 17.2% of Group service revenue.\n\nEBITDA grew by 4.5% to R39.3 billion in a year that tested the resilience of our business model and rewarded consistent execution. Group operating profit decreased by 0.2% to R27.7 billion, impacted by a R745 million prior year one-off gain related to the M-Pesa Africa joint venture acquisition.\n\nSouth Africa's contribution to operating profit increased to 74%, with the Group delivering normalised growth of 2.2% year-on-year. The growth in South Africa was diluted by our International portfolio and Safaricom, which were materially disrupted by COVID-19 and free P2P M-Pesa transactions. We are, however, optimistic about the growth prospects of International and Safaricom, and from 1 January 2021, resumed P2P charging across all markets on a significantly bigger M-Pesa base. o o h h 2 2 n n C C e e a a m m\n\nHEPS was up 3.7%, subdued by the performance of our International operations and the impact of free P2P M-Pesa transactions on Safaricom results. Vodacom's 2021 tax expense of R6.7 billion was 4.6% higher than the prior year (FY20: R6.4 billion) due to increased profit before tax for the Group and its subsidiaries.

From operating free cash flow, we paid cash taxes and finance costs, but were a net receiver of dividends. On this basis, we generated free cash flow of R15.0 billion, down 8.0%. The growth rate of free cash flow was negatively impacted by a R1.1 billion special dividend received during the year from our associate investment in Safaricom. The R1.1 billion special dividend boosted the prior year free cash flow of R16.3 billion. Excluding the impact of the special dividend from Safaricom, free cash flow declined by 1.2%.\n\nNet debt decreased by R0.9 billion to R34.2 billion from March 2020. The year-on-year movement was supported by free cash flow exceeding cash dividend payments in the year. We ended the year with a comfortable net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.9 times. Our low gearing, relative to telecommunication peers, positions us to manage the risk of a still uncertain economic outlook, while also supporting investment in our system of advantage.\n\n## 6KDUHKROGHUglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>UHWXUQVglyph<c=29,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>glyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>GLYLGHQGglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>JURZWKglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>UH\u0226HFWVglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold> EBITDA growth\n\nWe declared a final dividend of 410 per share (cps). Our total dividend for the year was 825cps, supporting a dividend yield of 6.5% in a period where most corporates have postponed dividends. Dividends are payable on 28 June 2021 to shareholders recorded in the register at the close of business on 25 June 2021. The number of ordinary shares in issue at the date of this declaration was 1 835 864 961. The dividend is subject to a local dividend withholding tax rate of 20%, which will result in a net final dividend to shareholders, not exempt from paying dividend withholding tax of 328 cents per ordinary share.\n\nThe Board maintained a dividend policy of paying at least 90% of adjusted headline earnings, which excludes the contribution of the attributable net profit or loss from Safaricom and any associated intangible amortisation. In addition, the Group intends to distribute any dividend it receives from Safaricom, net of withholding tax.\n\n## Out l ook: anticipated economic improvement\n\nAs the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, the economic outlook for our markets remains uncertain. We do, however, expect GDP growth to improve over the forthcoming financial year. This assumption of economic improvement, combined with the growth potential from implementing our system of advantage, supports our mid-single-digit medium-term growth target for service revenue.\n\nFor operating profit growth, which includes the profit contribution from our associates, we upgraded our medium-term target growth from mid-single-digit to mid-to-high single digit. The upgrade reflects operational leverage and improved prospects for our international markets and Safaricom, in particular. Our Group capital intensity ratio remains in a range of 13% to 14.5% of revenue.\n\nThese targets apply on average, over the next three years, and on a normalised basis in constant currency, excluding spectrum purchases, exceptional items and any merger and acquisition activity.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nOn a personal note, when I took over as CFO, I looked forward to joining Vodacom at a time when it had simplified its structure to increase focus across its International markets. I am excited to lead a high-performing finance team, driving the function's strategic digital transformation and contributing to the future success of the Group.\n\nI am grateful for the strength and capacity of the finance teams across our seven markets (including Safaricom), who have ably supported the Group through the difficult COVID-19 environment of remote working and changing business risks. The regular rolling forecasts intense and increased reporting to keep internal and external stakeholders informed, managing operating costs, capital and liquidity management, as well as the expertise in Big Data, AI and data analytics - which continue to inform some of the strategic decisions in the business - are all testament to the quality of our skills base. We are cognisant of the increasing demand on our role of business partnering to protect value, improve controls and lead an efficient and effective finance role in future.\n\nFinally, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my colleagues for their support over the past few months. They set and maintained high standards of financial management. As we look ahead, we remain steadfast in serving our stakeholders and delivering on our purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRaisi b e Morathi CFO\n\n4 June 2021",

The combined decrease is as a result of net additions of R16.3 billion, offset by net foreign currency translation movements of R4.1 billion, and depreciation and amortisation of R15.1 billion.\n\nInvestment in associate and joint ventures represent our effective 34.94% interest in Safaricom and a 50% stake in M-Pesa Africa Limited, our M-Pesa joint venture with Safaricom. The year-on-year reduction reflects the impact of a weaker periodend Kenyan shilling rate, which resulted in lower translated rand value for these investments.\n\nThe decrease in total equity related to a reduction in foreign currency translation reserves. The move in this reserve captures the year-on-year change in period-end exchange rates to which the Group is exposed. Notably, the period-end Kenyan shilling rate weakened materially from the prior year closing rate.\n\nBorrowings, including non-current and current, decreased by R2.3 billion to R49.4 billion. Net debt decreased by R0.9 billion to R34.2 billion from March 2020. The year-on-year movement was supported by free cash flow exceeding cash dividend payments in the year.",

During the year, 15.5 million unique users visited our zero-rated ConnectU platform to access a wide range of websites - including job and e-learning portals and discounted offers for vulnerable communities. Looking ahead, our Mezzanine platform will provide critical support for the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, South Africa reported strong service revenue growth of 7.0% to R56.4 billion. The growth was fuelled by increased demand for connectivity, particularly in prepaid, Vodacom Business and new services such as IoT and financial services. Furthermore, the performance was enabled by our industry leading investment into new services, networks and digital IT capabilities such as business and AI. Revenue increased by 10.3%, underpinned by service revenue growth, a recovery in equipment sales and growth in tower sharing revenue.\n\nMobile contract customer revenue increased by 5.0% to R20.8 billion, a resilient performance given the economic backdrop. Within the mobile contract segment, VB continued to deliver growth in the fourth quarter while consumer contract revenue remained broadly unchanged year-on-year. We recorded positive contract customer net additions of 133 000 in the year while ARPU increased by 2.1% (adjusted growth 1.4% 1 ) and 7.0% (adjusted growth 3.1% 1 ) in the year and the fourth quarter, respectively.\n\nIn the prepaid segment, mobile customer revenue increased by 8.5%. Prepaid net additions for the year were a substantial 2.6 million, reflecting our summer campaign's success and a new behavioural loyalty programme - which provided more reasons to consume and facilitate our active days management initiative. ARPU increased 13.0% to R61 supported by increased usage of\n\nour connectivity and digital services, as well as the accessibility of airtime via our Airtime Advance product. In the fourth quarter, Airtime Advanced amounted to 43.0% of total prepaid recharges in the quarter (4Q20: 35.9%).\n\nData traffic increased by 55.6%, as the growth trend normalised in the last two quarters of the financial year with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Data customer net losses were 0.2 million in the year, ending on 21.7 million customers, as we focused on optimising gross additions. Smart devices on our network were up by 9.5% to 23.2 million, while 4G devices on our network increased by 22.0% to 15.7 million. The average usage per smart device increased by 38.9% to 2.1GB per month. We accelerated our fibre roll-out during the year, more than doubling the total number of homes and businesses connected 2 to 126 765. Our own fibre passed 146 401 homes and businesses as at 31 March 2021.\n\nService revenue generated from Vodacom Financial Services was up by 18.9% to R2.4 billion, while customers increased by 15.4% to 13.3 million. Vodacom Financial Services' result reflects our execution capability in this space. Revenue growth was underpinned by our Airtime Advance product, where we advanced R12.0 billion in airtime during the year, an increase of 21.1%. The number of Airtime Advance customers increased 17.3% to 10.8 million. Insurance policies increased by 8.3% to 2.1 million.\n\nVodacom Business service revenue increased by 11.3% to R15.9 billion, supported by our innovative work-from-home solutions. Our VB fixed service revenue grew by 6.5%, excluding wholesale transit, supported by strong growth in cloud as well as hosting and connectivity revenue. IoT connections increased by 6.4% to 5.6 million with revenue growth of 32.8% to R1.1 billion 1 .\n\nEBITDA grew 5.7%, while margins contracted 1.7ppts in the year. The EBITDA performance was supported by strong service revenue growth but was moderated by COVID-19-related bad debt provisions and investment in future growth areas, such as a 5G roaming deal with Liquid Intelligent Technologies (Liquid). Excluding the impact of our roaming deals with Rain and Liquid, the EBITDA margin was broadly flat year-on-year. Operating profit growth at 4.2% was driven by EBITDA growth, although partially offset by higher depreciation. Depreciation and amortisation increased 10.2% as a result of capital expenditure phasing and asset mix.\n\nIn the forthcoming financial year, we expect South Africa to deliver service revenue growth in line with our medium-term Group target. We are particularly excited about the launch of our lifestyle companion app, VodaPay. We expect that the app and the ongoing expansion of our financial service offerings will promote digital and financial inclusion and provide a growth platform for consumers and merchants in South Africa.\n\n## Notes:",

The impact of zero-rating P2P payments for our International markets, including Safaricom, was equivalent to R2.0 billion of service revenue. We also deployed R3.2 billion in capital investment to expand our 4G network, enhance our IT infrastructure and maintain data availability at a time when many customers worked from home. Leveraging the Mezzanine platform helped to deploy COVID-19 vaccines and work with governments to support a resilient and just recovery for our markets.\n\nOur International operations reported muted service revenue growth of 1.6% in the year. This performance reflects disruption to our commercial activities due to the informal structure of the economies in which we operate, increased pressure on consumer spend, free P2P M-Pesa transactions and the impact of service barring in Tanzania due to biometric registration compliance. On a normalised basis, service revenue declined by 1.9% during the year. Positively, normalised service revenue improved in the second half of the year, and we delivered normalised service revenue growth of 4.3% in the fourth quarter. The growth inflection in the quarter was supported by double digit M-Pesa and data revenue growth.\n\nOur customer base increased by 3.0% to 39.8 million, with net additions of 1.2 million in the year. In addition to subdued commercial activities resulting from COVID-19, the customer base growth rate was negatively impacted by the barring of service to 2.9 million SIM cards in Tanzania in the previous financial year. The latter impact, relating to the barring of service, was largely reflected in our first quarter customer base, in line with our 90-day churn policy. Customer growth across our International operations is critical for us to achieve our 2025 ambition of improving the lives of the next 100 million customers.\n\nData services remain a key lever of growth and central to our commitment to connecting for a better future. We added 661 000 new customers during the year to end the period at 20.6 million data customers. Of these customers, only 11 million were on smartphones - highlighting the potential for further smartphone penetration. We continue to drive the adoption of affordable smartphone devices, and support digital inclusion, by leveraging partnerships with global technology firms and innovative financing options. Data revenue grew 6.5% in constant currency during the year, with data revenue growth in constant currency improving to 11.0% in the fourth quarter. Overall data traffic growth for the year was buoyant at 51.6%, due to network investments and affordable commercial propositions.\n\nM-Pesa revenue was up 13.0% (5.8%) to R4.5 billion in the year, contributing 20.4% of International service revenue. Pleasingly, platform growth and the reintroduction of P2P charging across all our markets from 1 January 2021 supported a meaningful acceleration of normalised M-Pesa revenue growth to 21.0%, in the fourth quarter. Accelerating platform adoption measured by customer and transaction growth, and product expansion, provide a robust growth outlook for M-Pesa. International M-Pesa customers were up 9.6% to 16.1 million, representing 47.4% of our total International customer base. The M-Pesa ecosystem in all our International markets, including Safaricom, processed US$24.5 billion a month in transactions in the fourth quarter, up 63.5%.\n\nInternational EBITDA was up 1.2%, in line with revenue growth of 1.1%. Consistent with the service revenue and revenue profile, EBITDA margins recovered during the second half and offset the margin decline of 2.7ppts reported in the first half. The full year margin performance reflected disciplined cost containment, despite inflationary cost pressures.\n\nOperating profit declined 16.3%, with the prior year period boosted by a purchase gain of R532 million. This gain was a result of the acquisition of the M-Pesa brand, product development and support services from Vodafone through a newly-created joint venture, M-Pesa Africa. M-Pesa Africa coordinates and implements our M-Pesa strategy, driving product expansion and leveraging best practices across the portfolio. On a normalised basis, operating profit declined 5.0%. This reflects the pressure on normalised EBITDA, which declined 2.2%.\n\nOur capital investment of R3.2 billion was focused mainly on expanding our 4G network. Our network reach improved by 322 3G and 1 072 4G base stations, and we continued to invest in our transmission networks to enhance our network leadership in all our markets.\n\nLooking ahead, we are optimistic about improved growth prospects for our International operations. We expect operating profit growth in the forthcoming financial year to track ahead of the medium-term Group target.",

Customers are based on the total number of mobile customers using any service during the last three months. This includes customers paying a monthly fee that entitles them to use the service even if they do not actually use the service, as well as those customers who are active while roaming.\n- 2.   Total ARPU is calculated by dividing the sum of the customer and incoming revenue for the period by the average monthly active customers during the period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safaricom\n\nSafaricom's results reflect a challenging year and were impacted by depressed economic activity and free P2P M-Pesa related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Service revenue and EBITDA declined 0.3% and 2.8% respectively in the financial year. Despite growth pressures, Safaricom ensured that its network, operations and maintenance and financial services were prioritised to limit disruptions. Capital expenditure was KShs35.0 billion (R5.2 billion) for the year, representing an intensity ratio of 13.2%, supporting its digital technology journey and the evolving consumption patterns of its customer base.\n\nSafaricom's commitment to its strategic goals supported platform growth for M-Pesa and higher connectivity usage. Safaricom added 3.4 million M-Pesa customers and 4.3 million total customers for the year ended 31 March 2021. Mobile data grew 11.5%, sustaining the recovery from the prior year, with 4G devices using more than 1GB per month up to 4.7 million. Fibre-to-the-home customers grew 31.5% as Safaricom supported work and learn-from-home with higher bandwidth.\n\nM-Pesa revenues declined 2.1% in the year, impacted by free fees for P2P transaction values of less than KShs1 000 until 31 December 2020. M-Pesa service revenue growth recovered to 21.2% in the fourth quarter, supported by platform growth, product adoption and updated P2P pricing from 1 January 2021. M-Pesa customers grew 13.6% and the total annual value of M-Pesa transactions were up 58.2% to KShs22.0 trillion (R3.3 trillion). Safaricom's updated P2P pricing promoted affordability, with low-value transaction charges reduced by up to 45.0% from pre-COVID-19 levels. Safaricom's overall service revenue profile improved through the year, and was up 6.4% in the fourth quarter.\n\nOn a rand reported basis, Safaricom contributed R3.5 billion to the Group's operating profit, declined 2.1% year-on-year, but increased 2.5% on a normalised basis. Safaricom accounted for 12.8% of the Group's operating profit in the year.\n\nGrowth rates are in local currency and year-on-year, unless otherwise stated.

This report includes our remuneration philosophy and policy for executive and non-executive directors (NEDs), and describes how the policy was implemented. It also discloses payments made to NEDs and executive directors during the year.\n\nAlthough we had to adapt to the operational challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature of our business - which thrives on connectivity and keeping the world communicating and working despite severe curtailment of movement and freedom meant that we did not need to change our reward framework dramatically. We were therefore able to reward and sustain our people throughout this challenging period. The only significant change we implemented this year was to remove the service revenue condition used in our short-term incentive (STI), and re-weight the earnings before interest, tax (EBIT), cash flow and customer appreciation measures to cover the overall performance measurement for the year. We were still able to provide competitive salary increases, STI awards and provide for the vesting of long-term incentive (LTI) awards with no other changes to our normal remuneration framework.\n\nIn line with our commitment to fair and responsible remuneration, we continuously review our remuneration policies and practices to ensure they remain fit for purpose and align with Vodacom's strategic objectives. As noted in the key focus areas identified in my letter last year, we:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Redesigned our recognition programme, using the global Vodafone Stars programme to provide 'in the moment' recognition for Spirit of Vodacom behaviours;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Implemented a new benchmarking framework for the senior leadership team (SLT), where we target the 75th percentile of comparator information. This is necessary for us to attract and retain skills in the core and new areas of our business in a particularly competitive market;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Enhanced our ability to recruit and retain new skills, using this improved market positioning - as well as our employee value proposition, which we continuously enhance - to ensure that Vodacom is a great place to work; and z Enhancen positioo enha\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Embedded the Spirit of Vodacom in our reward framework by reflecting customer satisfaction, thereby creating an environment to encourage experimentation, increasing our focus on collective rewards and reinforcing all the behaviours using our recognition programme. z E cu e\n\nAlthough we received tremendous support from shareholders in terms of the high-voting percentages on our remuneration policy and implementation report, we have not rested on our laurels. We implemented a malus and clawback policy and introduced an environmental, social and governance (ESG) vesting condition to govern 10% of our 2020 LTI awards. With these enhancements, and to keep pace with best practice, the committee is satisfied that our current remuneration policy remains relevant and fit for purpose. We are committed to maintaining a strong relationship with our shareholders, built on trust and a clear understanding of our remuneration policy and the practices that were implemented.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhuthi Mahan y e l e-Da b engwa Remuneration Committee (RemCo) Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman capital\n\n## Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman",

These principles exemplify fair, responsible and transparent remuneration policy practices and disclosure in terms of the Companies Act, 2008, as amended (Companies Act) and the JSE Listings Requirements as prescribed by King IV principle 14. In addition, we discuss the remuneration principles applicable across all employee groups.\n\nVodacom launched the Spirit of Vodacom in January 2020, a culture shift necessitated by our Vision 2025 strategy of transitioning from a traditional telco to a techco. We reviewed our reward arrangements guided by supporting business strategy, purpose and Spirit. We are a performance company and have to ensure our reward structures recognise, support and reward teams and individuals, and differentiate top performers and top talent.\n\n## A l ignment of reward changes to S pirit b ehaviours\n\nWe developed the new reward framework to support our Spirit behaviours, comprising four pillars:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Earn customer l o y a l t y : Retaining the customer satisfaction metric in the global short-term incentive plan (GSTIP);\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Experiment, l earn fast: Creating an environment to encourage experimenting;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Get it done, together: Increasing our focus on collective reward; and\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Reinforcing a ll the b ehaviours: Using Vodafone Stars (our global recognition programme) for 'in the moment' recognition.\n\n## Ke y enhancements to our remuneration po l ic y\n\nWe restructured our reward structures and processes to encourage and reward behaviours that support our Spirit. These structures and processes ensure we consistently and appropriately recognise outstanding performers and talent, driving greater engagement and a culture of innovation .\n\nWe are a performance-driven organisation, and the different components of our reward structures recognise, support and reward collective and individual performance.\n\n## How leading remuneration and reward practices support the delivery of our purpose\n\nVodacom's core purpose is to connect for a better future and create a better future for all. Our purpose is brought to life by our strategy, which is then rolled out throughout the business to ensure all our efforts as a team are directed at delivering this strategy and ultimately our purpose. Guided by the Spirit of Vodacom, our employees are the custodians of our purpose and strategy, which is enabled through our people's commitment, efforts and dedication.\n\nWith a focus on aligning organisational and employee goals, our remuneration and reward practices are designed to ensure we:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAttract high-calibre talent in the market;\n\nReward employees for living the Spirit of Vodacom; and\n\nMotivate our people to achieve our strategy and live our purpose.\n\nAs an ethical employer, we ensure our remuneration and rewards policy is discrimination-free, fair and market-related to reflect employee skill levels, functions and roles.\n\nThe S pirit of Vodacom defines the beliefs and behaviours we believe we need to successfully transform into a techco and deliver on our strategy and purpose.",

The Group CEO, Group Chief Human Resources (HR) Officer and any other executives invited for specific discussions attend meetings by invitation, but recuse themselves before any decisions are made that relate to them. RemCo operates according to a charter approved by the Board. This charter is regularly reviewed. RemCo ensures the Group's remuneration is fair and responsible.\n\n## RemCo's ro l e and responsi b i l ities inc l ude, b ut are not l imited to:\n\n- Determining and agreeing the remuneration and overall compensation package for the Vodacom Group CEO, CFO and any other executive director appointed to the Vodacom Group Board and the members of the Vodacom senior leadership team (SLT);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Determining, agreeing and developing the company's overall policy on remuneration;\n- Ensuring fair competitive reward strategies and programmes are in place to facilitate recruiting, motivating and retaining high-performance employees at all levels to support realising corporate objectives and to safeguard stakeholder interest;\n- Reviewing and recommending to the Board the relevant criteria necessary to measure the executive management's performance in discharging its functions and responsibilities;\n- Reviewing the fairness of executive remuneration in the context of overall employee remuneration and recommending how this should be addressed and disclosed in the annual remuneration report;\n- Developing and implementing a policy of remuneration philosophy for disclosure to enable a reasonable assessment of reward practices and governance processes to be followed by stakeholders;\n- Considering other special benefits or arrangements of a substantive financial nature;\n- Reviewing the promotions, transfers and termination policies for the Group;\n- Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and codes;\n- Appointing external remuneration consultants from time to time;\n- Ensuring the remuneration policy and implementation report are put to a non-binding vote at the annual general meeting (AGM);\n- Reviewing the engagement of investors in the event Vodacom does not achieve the required number of votes for either of the remuneration policy or implementation report or both; and\n- Determining and recommending the level of NEDs' fees to shareholders for approval.\n\nThe RemCo Chairman provides feedback to the Board after each RemCo meeting, including key decisions and relevant discussions, and attends the AGM to address shareholders' questions on RemCo's responsibilities.\n\n## Remuneration governance\n\n## Regu l ator y context\n\nWhen RemCo considers the remuneration policy, it ensures the policy supports the company's purpose and strategy of Vision 2025. Further, RemCo ensures our remuneration principles and guidelines align with the Companies Act, King IV principles and recommended practices, and the JSE Listings Requirements.\n\nRemCo considers regulatory and corporate governance requirements as set out in Vodacom's operating markets and incorporates these into our remuneration governance. Each operating market Board, with input from the country Managing Director and its local RemCo, makes final decisions regarding remuneration, merit increases, annual bonus allocations and LTI awards.\n\n## Achievement of po l ic y o b jectives\n\nOur new reward structure implemented supports our Spirit behaviours.\n\nWith the Spirit reward changes, a key element of change is that the individual multiplier for STI and LTI has been removed. Despite this change, our performance development process remains robust with objectives set, performances reviewed, and performance and talent ratings allocated. These changes were effective from 1 Apri l 2020 for the 2021 financial year GSTIP cycle (i.e. for bonuses paid in June 2021) and the June 2021 share awards (forfeitable share plan (FSP)).\n\n## Business performance and the impact on our S TIs and LTIs\n\nWith the outbreak of COVID-19, management reviewed the measures and targets for STI and LTI objectives.\n\nThe Group faced certain challenges in achieving our targets. These include COVID-19 - particularly in our International Business - and load shedding in South Africa. Due to the national lockdown in South Africa, emergency spectrum was issued in April 2020, which has since been extended to the end of March 2022, when the spectrum auction process is expected to take place. More details on the actual achievement are provided elsewhere in this report. The targets and their achievement directly impact the STIs and LTIs payable to executives.\n\n## RemCo's ke y decisions during 2021\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Approved increases and adjustments for executives, senior management and employees;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Reviewed the metrics of the variable short-term incentive plan (STIP) and the variable long-term incentive plan (LTIP), and made changes where appropriate;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Approved STIs for executives, senior management and employees;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Evaluated the LTIP vesting conditions for the 2017 scheme and approved final vesting ratios;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Set performance conditions for STIs and LTIs by including an ESG measure for LTIs;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Implemented a malus and clawback policy for executives and key senior management; and\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Recommended the NED fee increases to the Board.",

Our reward programmes should be designed to assist us in achieving this.\n\n## Competitive pa y l eve l s\n\nWe are committed to remuneration packages that are competitive relative to the target market as defined in each country. To deliver effective reward management across all Vodacom markets, we need to undertake localised benchmarking of guaranteed pay and target total cash (TTC) at least every other year.\n\n## Pa y for performance\n\nWe structure remuneration around pay aligned with performance. This allows us to reward strong corporate and individual performance. We apply malus and clawback provisions to variable pay awards for senior management.\n\n## Interna l equit y\n\nAs far as possible, remuneration differentiation between employees is based on fair and objective criteria.\n\n## S ustaina bl e\n\nWe manage the total cost of employment for all employees and ensure the benefits provided are affordable, sustainable and aligned with shareholder expectations.\n\n## Benefits\n\nWhere possible, we offer benefits that align with local market trends.\n\n## Ho l istic approach\n\nVodacom adopts a holistic approach to reward, which incorporates guaranteed pay, variable pay, recognition and employee development.\n\n## Re l evance\n\nWe recognise that the reward philosophy and each component of the reward policy are dynamic and should be reviewed regularly to ensure we keep abreast of Vodacom's objectives and market trends. We also need to ensure our practices comply with legislative and regulatory requirements in the markets where we operate.\n\n## Communication\n\nWe are committed to providing transparent and understandable information about our reward programmes, policies and processes to employees. All our markets must provide clear and effective communication of the total reward package offered. This ensures employees understand what they receive, why and when they receive it, and how their performance can influence the value of what they receive.\n\n## How remuneration and rewards support the system of advantage\n\nOur system of advantage is designed to deliver exponential value to our stakeholders through an ecosystem that better serves our customers and differentiates our offerings. This differentiation helps us retain customers, grow our market share and create value for stakeholders.\n\nOur remuneration and reward policies and practices are designed to support these goals by promoting appropriate employee behaviours that drive innovation, optimise the customer journey, create economies of scale, increase our market share and ensure superior investor returns.\n\n## Our remuneration phi l osoph y\n\nVodacom adheres to a total cost to company philosophy, which we refer to as a guaranteed package (GP). All employees in South Africa, including executive directors, receive a GP based on their roles. The GP includes contributions to medical aid, retirement funding and insured benefits.\n\nOur STI is an annual cash bonus linked to achieving financial, strategic and operational objectives. The Group's financial performance, measured against previously set and agreed targets, determines the cash pool available for STIs.\n\nOur LTI is an annual share allocation that encourages ownership and loyalty, and supports our objective to retain valued employees. It is designed to align executives' performance to shareholders' interests, as a portion of the award for Senior Leadership Team is subject to Group performance conditions. The scheme is a full ownership scheme and, as a result, participants receive dividends from the award date. However, the value of the shares can only be realised after a three-year vesting period, to the extent that the vesting conditions were met.\n\n## Vodacom's reward framework\n\nVodacom's reward framework comprises financial and non-financial elements, and applies to all employees, including executive directors.

Each element is linked to creating shareholder value and the strategic progress made in the year.\n\nThe ratio of guaranteed versus variable pay differs for each level in the organisation, with the weighting on variable performancebased pay higher at executive and senior levels compared with lower-level employees, in line with our remuneration principle of paying for performance and encouraging and rewarding behaviours that support our Spirit.\n\nRemCo reviews targets and the on-target values for each element to ensure they remain relevant and competitive, drive the right behaviours and enhance overall shareholder value.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nTo ensure we apply the right pay mix and competitively remunerate our executives, we use industry and country-specific benchmarks. Fair and competitive rewards are vital to being an employer of choice. RemCo sets the remuneration and GPs of executives by looking at peer group data from the JSE telecommunications sector and other listed companies of similar market capitalisation and revenue.\n\nIn addition, Vodacom subscribes to remuneration surveys (Remchannel and the Mercer top executive survey). We consolidate the remuneration information to ensure we have a comprehensive view of remuneration across different industries and an understanding of how to appropriately and competitively reward our executives.\n\nBenchmarking for executive directors in Vodacom is done for all elements of targeted remuneration, namely GP, target STI and target LTI. For executive directors, Vodacom targets the 75th percentile of the market for GP and 75th percentile of the market for GP plus STI.\n\nVodacom benchmarks the Group CEO and CFO against industryspecific comparators, information from peer group disclosure and Mercer's executive remuneration survey. We benchmark the remaining Vodacom SLT members against Mercer's annual executive survey and industry-specific comparators where available.\n\nAccurate benchmarking further reinforces our remuneration principles to attract, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre which, in turn:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Aligns their remuneration with shareholder interests;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Creates sustainability; and\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Follows best practice in a holistic approach to deliver fair and responsible remuneration.\n\nWhen determining the salary for an executive, we consider:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Job grade: Vodacom uses the Willis Towers Watson Job Evaluation system, a global job evaluation system that correlates with all the major job evaluation systems;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Job-specific competence and skills and the marketability and scarcity of the skills;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Industry knowledge and experience; and\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Their contribution to achieving the business's strategy.\n\n## LTIP T S R peer group\n\nVodacom utilises the Indi25 index as the most representative list of companies from the perspective of industry competitors, labour market and company size.\n\n## NEDs' remuneration\n\nVodacom annually benchmarks NEDs' remuneration against fees published by a peer group of companies in their most recent AGM notices. The peer group of companies for NED benchmarking is different from the TSR peer group, since the skills required of NEDs come from a pool of more appropriately sized companies, including financial services companies. We excluded banks from the pool since their NEDs' fees are noticeably higher than other industries.",

Vodacom offers benefits that are best practice and comply with legislation. In terms of our total cost to company philosophy, any change in the price of a benefit or contribution level will not have a cost impact on the employer but will affect the employee's net remuneration. As a standard, we offer the benefits detailed below to all our South African employees, including our executive directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Retirement funding\n\nThe Vodacom Group Pension Fund, a defined contribution pension scheme, is compulsory for all permanent employees. Executives are also required to participate in the Vodacom Group Provident Fund, which is also a defined contribution scheme. Other employees can choose to join the Vodacom Group Provident Fund. Employees have the option to choose their level of contribution to the pension and provident funds. Contributions to the pension fund are based on pensionable salary and employees can select their pensionable salary at either 70% or 85% of GP. They can also choose where they would like their money to be invested based on their individual risk profile. The normal retirement age is 60 for executive directors and other executives, and 65 for all other employees.\n\n## ,QVXUHGglyph<c=3,font=/AACLAA+VodafoneRg-Bold>EHQH\u0225WV\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe offer a tailored and segmented risk benefit programme to move away from a one-size-fits-all package. This enables our employees to select benefits that suit their circumstances. The options allow employees more flexibility in selecting benefits. The insured benefits include group life assurance, an education benefit, spouse's death benefit, critical illness benefit and disability benefit. These contributions are calculated as a percentage of pensionable salary and funded from the GP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Disa b i l it y\n\nIf an employee cannot perform their duties because of disability, they will receive a monthly income of 75% of their monthly pensionable salary. The disability premiums are also funded from the GP. This benefit is payable until the employee recovers sufficiently to return to work, or if not, up to normal retirement age, whereafter the employee will retire. During the period of disability, payment to the retirement fund and Group life insurance continues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Medica l aid\n\nEmployees can choose to participate in any nominated medical aid scheme. The schemes available at Vodacom were selected to address the needs of the diverse Vodacom workforce. We annually review the medical aid schemes to assess their appropriateness for our employees. As part of the medical aid benefit offering, we have a full-time Alexander Forbes consultant on site to assist with any medical aid-related queries. We do not offer post-retirement medical benefits, and we have no such liabilities.\n\n## S TI\n\nAll employees, including executive directors, but excluding employees on commission, or quarterly or bonus structures, participate in the annual STIP. STI payments are discretionary and are based on the achievement of financial and strategic measures. Payments are made in cash in June each year.\n\nWhere annual targets are achieved in full, 100% of the on-target STI will be paid. Where target goals are exceeded, the STI is capped at a percentage of GP. Where the STI targets are not achieved in full, a reduced STI is paid. Where performance is below threshold, no STI is payable. In addition, executives assessed as top performers as part of the performance dialogue process will receive an award of shares in November equivalent to 25% of their target share percentage with 24 months' vesting.\n\nAs indicated previously, the individual multiplier for FY2021 was removed in the calculation of the STI and this change is aligned to our Spirit behaviours.\n\nThe on-target and maximum STI percentages are set out below:\n\n|                    | On-target  % of GP   | Maximum  % of GP   |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Role               | FY2021               | FY 2021            |\n| Group CEO          | 100%                 | 200%               |\n| Previous Group CFO | 60%                  | 120%               |\n| New Group CFO*     | 75%                  | 150%               |\n\n- * Following a review of the market benchmarks, it was agreed to increase the on-target STI for the new CFO.\n\nFor FY2021, the STI will be based on business performance only and is capped at 200% of target, which is the maximum business multiplier with no personal performance multiplier.",

The uncertainty caused by COVID-19 made it difficult for the company to set an appropriate or reliable target for service revenue. As a result, Vodacom decided to remove it as a measure for the STI for FY2021 only and continued using the remaining three measures of earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT), operating free cash flow (OFCF) and customer appreciation, with these measures being equally weighted. These measures are more directly under our control and we can influence them as the external market evolves.\n\n## EBIT\n\n## OFCF\n\n## Customer appreciation\n\nEarnings before interest and taxation, impairment losses, profit/loss on disposal of investment, property, plant and equipment (PPE), and intangible assets, profit/loss from associate and joint venture, restructuring cost and black economic empowerment (BEE) income/change.\n\n-2.5%\n\nof service revenue target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+2.5%\n\nof service revenue target\n\nCash generated from operations less additions to PPE, intangible assets and proceeds on disposal of PPE and intangible assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor executives, Vodacom splits business performance between the relevant operating company (70%) and the Group (30%).

However, we will continue assessing individual performance based on the achievement of their objectives.\n\nAs in the past, the Group CEO did not have a personal performance multiplier.

These incentive plans aim to retain key skills and motivate executives over the long-term, which is essential for sustainable performance. The awards are made using a combination of Vodacom and Vodafone awards. Only certain executives receive Vodafone awards. These awards may be made in retention shares (only time-based vesting), performance shares (performance vesting conditions in addition to time-based vesting) or a combination of these award types.\n\nThe Vodacom awards are FSP where the maximum number of shares are granted at the time of award. Dividends are received on the maximum potential unvested shares from the time of award. Vesting conditions will determine how many of the original awards are forfeited on final vesting. The Vodafone awards are conditional shares, where shares are settled at the time of vesting and dividends only accrue from that point onwards.\n\n## Vodacom performance FSP shares\n\nThe Vodacom performance FSP shares vest in a range of 0% to 100% of the number of shares awarded, being the maximum that can be achieved in the case of stretch performance, where 50% is the target vesting level.\n\n## Vodacom retention FSP shares\n\nVodacom operates in highly competitive markets, where competitors are local and international and span industries beyond telecommunications. An element of the LTIP award for employees, other than the Group CEO is retention awards. Therefore, they only have time-based performance vesting conditions.\n\n## Vodafone retention and performance conditional share plan (CSP) awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails regarding performance conditions and vesting periods for the Vodafone awards can be found in the Vodafone annual report 2021 on https://investors.vodafone.com/reports-information/ resu l ts-reports-presentations\n\n## On-target and maximum LTIP FY2021\n\nThe on-target and maximum LTIP percentages are set out below, The CEO's on-target LTI was increased from 190% to 225% with effect from the LTI award in June 2020:\n\n| Role           | On-target  % of GP   | Maximum  % of GP   |\n|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Group CEO      | 225%                 | 400%               |\n| New Group CFO* | 100%                 | 150%               |\n\nVodacom removed the individual multiplier for the allocation of LTIP awards and will allocate the on-target percentage to all employees eligible to participate, based on their band.\n\n## Split of awards\n\nOn-target awards are split between Vodacom FSP and Vodafone CSP awards, as well as between retention and performance awards.\n\n| Scheme                   | Group CEO   | Group CFO   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Vodacom FSP retention    | -           | 50%         |\n| Vodacom FSP performance  | 77.79%      | 25%         |\n| Vodafone CSP retention   | -           | -           |\n| Vodafone CSP performance | 22.21%      | 25%         |\n\nThe Group CEO does not receive Vodacom FSP retention awards or Vodafone CSP retention awards.\n\n## Performance conditions for LTIP\n\n|                               | Weighting  award 2020   | Weighting  award 2019   | Weighting  award 2018   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Metric                        | Vesting 2023            | Vesting 2022            | Vesting 2021            |\n| OFCF                          | 60%                     | 70%                     | 70%                     |\n| TSR relative to a  peer group | 30%                     | 30%                     | 30%                     |\n| ESG target                    | 10%                     | 30%                     | 30%                     |\n\nVodacom determines the targets for OFCF according to the achievement of the three-year budget plan.

Ma l us refers to the reduction of unvested or unpaid awards before the end of the vesting period (LTI) or prior to payment (STI).\n\nThe Board adopted this policy to further align the interests of our executives and senior management with the long-term interests of the Group. Furthermore, this policy ensures that excessive or inappropriate risk-taking is not rewarded, stipulates that any errors can be corrected, and ensures a fair outcome when variable remuneration is awarded.\n\nThe policy sets out the circumstances where the Board, following the advice of RemCo, may apply its discretion to reduce or clawback incentive awards (in whole or in part) in line with the policy. Currently, Vodacom's executive directors and SLT will be subject to the provisions of this policy. This limited scope of application will be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it is appropriate and in line with market practice for South African-listed companies. This policy is applicable to variable remuneration - STIs and LTIs.\n\n## Vodacom S i y anda Emp l o y ee Trust\n\nWe established the Vodacom Siyanda Employee Trust to benefit eligible employees. The trust holds its equity investment in Vodacom Group through its interest in YeboYethu (RF) Limited (YeboYethu).\n\nEmployees participated in the transaction by being allocated units in the trust based on a varying percentage of GP, considering their employment level, race and gender. We created one unit for each share that the trust holds. The units representing vested rights to the underlying YeboYethu ordinary shares will have a service condition that will lift in three equal tranches at the end of years three, four and five, but will only become fully tradeable in the BEE segment of the JSE in three equal tranches over three years starting from the end of the fifth year of the scheme (i.e. years six, seven and eight).\n\nWhen the units are converted to shares in YeboYethu, Vodacom will be required to deduct employee tax on the full value of units as at that date and pay it over to the South African Revenue Service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nP\n\nl\n\nanet\n\nReduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n\n## Fair and responsi bl e remuneration\n\nKing IV recommends that companies should ensure all employees are fairly, responsibly and transparently remunerated. Vodacom applies the principle of fair pay based on the value of the job relative to other jobs of similar value (internal equity). Our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across all levels of the Group's employees.\n\nVodacom supports eliminating discrimination regarding remuneration by applying the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value. Any difference in remuneration will be discrimination only if the differences are directly or indirectly based on race, sex, gender, disability or any other arbitrary ground established in terms of section 11 of the Employment Equity Act, 1998 (EE Act).\n\nWe base our reward decisions on merit and we do not discriminate based on gender, race, religion or belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, or gender identity and expression.\n\nRegulation 7 of the EE Act lists several grounds that are commonly considered in determining remuneration. It is not considered discrimination if the difference is fair, rational and based on any one or a combination of the following:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z The employee's seniority or tenure;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z The employee's qualifications, ability, competence or potential above the minimum acceptable level required for the role;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z The employee's performance, quantity or quality of work, provided that the performance management system is consistently applied;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Where an employee is demoted for any legitimate reason, without a reduction in remuneration;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Where an individual is temporarily employed in a position to gain experience or training and, as a result, receives different remuneration or benefits from different terms and conditions of employment;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z A shortage of relevant skills in a particular job classification; and\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z Any other relevant non-discriminatory factor.\n\nWe review our internal pay ranges annually and consistently apply them throughout the organisation. All operating companies in Vodacom are required to conduct an annual fair-pay analysis to ensure they are committed to fair pay and responsible remuneration across all employee levels. We adopted this approach across our businesses.",

As a result, we implemented a shareholding guideline policy for our executives. Executives are required to build up minimum levels of personal shareholding in the Group. Additionally, executives, excluding the CEO, are required to hold 1.0 times GP as a minimum individual shareholding.\n\nAs an incentive, Vodacom will award additional FSP performance shares to executives who exceed the minimum requirements over a three-year vesting cycle (six years). The participants will be granted a performance share for every three additional shares held. This award will be capped so that holdings of no more than double the minimum requirements will be recognised. The period over which the executives are permitted to build up this shareholding is based on the vesting of three cycles of the annual awards under the FSP.",

The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information in understanding the performance of the Group or the Group's businesses because they provide measures used by the Group to assess performance. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, although these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed in isolation or as replacements for or alternatives to, but rather as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures.\n\n## Norma l ised growth\n\nAll amounts in this Integrated report marked with a * represent normalised growth, which presents performance on a comparable basis. This adjusts for trading foreign exchange, foreign currency fluctuation on a constant currency basis (using the current year as base) and excludes the impact of merger, acquisition and disposal activities, at a constant currency basis where applicable, to show a like-for-like comparison of results. We believe that normalised growth, which is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to reported growth, provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons:\n\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z It provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business;\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z It is used for internal performance analysis; and\n- glyph<c=3,font=/AACDCN+Wingdings-Regular> z It facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies, although the term normalised is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nVodafone, the Vodafone logo, M-Pesa, Connected Farmer, Vodafone Supernet, Vodafone Mobile Broadband, Vodafone WebBox, Vodafone Passport, Vodafone live!, Power to You, Vodacom, Vodacom 4 Less and Vodacom Change the World are trademarks of Vodafone Group Plc (or have applications pending).

In particular, such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: expectations regarding\n\nthe Group's financial condition or results of operations, including the confirmation of the Group's targets and expectations for the Group's future performance generally; expectations regarding the operating environment and market conditions and trends; intentions and expectations regarding the development, launch and expansion of products, services and technologies; growth in customers and usage; expectations regarding spectrum licence acquisitions; expectations regarding adjusted EBITDA, capital additions, free cash flow, and foreign exchange rate movements; and expectations regarding the integration or performance of current and future investments, associates, joint ventures, non-controlled interests and newly acquired businesses.\n\nForward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as 'will', 'anticipates', 'aims', 'could', 'may', 'should', 'expects', 'believes', 'intends', 'plans' or 'targets' (including in their negative form). By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in economic or political conditions in markets served by operations of the Group; greater than anticipated competitive activity; higher than expected costs or capital expenditures; slower than expected customer growth and reduced customer retention; changes in the spending patterns of new and existing customers; the Group's ability to expand its spectrum position or renew or obtain necessary licences; the Group's ability to achieve cost savings; the Group's ability to execute its strategy in fibre deployment, network expansion, new product and service roll-outs, mobile data, enterprise and broadband; changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as changes in interest rates; the Group's ability to realise benefits from entering into partnerships or joint ventures and entering into service franchising and brand licensing; unfavourable consequences to the Group of making and integrating acquisitions or disposals; changes to the regulatory framework in which the Group operates; the impact of legal or other proceedings; loss of suppliers or disruption of supply chains; developments in the Group's financial condition, earnings and distributable funds and other factors that the Board takes into account when determining levels of dividends; the Group's ability to satisfy working capital and other requirements; changes in statutory tax rates or profit mix; and/or changes in tax legislation or final resolution of open tax issues; and changes resulting directly or indirectly from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAll subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to Vodacom, to any member of the Group or to any persons acting on their behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors referred to above. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised. Subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Vodacom does not intend to update these forwardlooking statements and does not undertake any obligation to do so.",
