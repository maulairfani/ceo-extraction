Our  report recognises this and is dedicated to all those whose lives have been disrupted, whose livelihoods have been taken away and who have been robbed of loved ones by the pandemic. The report's design endeavours to show that at a time of darkness, MTN did what it could to bring light to our people, our communities and society at large.\n\n## Changes in reporting and enhancements\n\nAs COVID-19 affected all parts of our business, we refer to it throughout  the  report.  We  also  have  a  dedicated  section  on COVID-19 on page 15. Two other new sections are on our outlook on page 16, and on our key issues on page 31. To address investor concerns  on  remuneration,  we  provide  a  more  detailed remuneration report in line with best practice and benchmarks.\n\nThroughout our report, we detail our new strategy: Ambition 2025 .\n\n## Basis for preparation\n\nOur report reflects integrated thinking at MTN: it is prepared by senior managers under the supervision of the Group Executive: Investor  Relations,  reporting  to  the  Acting  Group  CFO.  In determining  the  content,  we  assess  the  issues  that  materially impact our ability to create and preserve value, as well as those that could erode value. We look at these over three time horizons :\n\n- \u00b7 The short term (less than three years).\n- \u00b7 The medium term (three to five years).\n- \u00b7 The long term (beyond five years).\n\nFor information about these issues, we draw in the first instance on our monthly standardised reports prepared by management across  the  Group  and  submitted  to  the  Board.  These  include details of our operating context, our strategic performance, our stakeholder engagement, as well as risks and opportunities. The budget plan and repositioned Ambition 2025 strategy, approved by the Board in November, also inform the process to determine content. The reporting team interviews executive management and engages with certain non-executive directors for their input. Details of the materiality determination process as well as the material matters are on page 21.\n\nThe  report  is  scrutinised  by  the  Group  CEO  and  Executive Committee, and then presented to the Audit Committee for review, before being recommended to the Board of Directors for review and approval.\n\n## Controls and combined assurance\n\nThe  Board  ensures  an  effective  control  environment  which supports the integrity of our information. We use a combined assurance model which considers the role of management, control functions, internal and external audit and Board committees. For 2020, we assessed our controls to be adequate and effective.\n\n## Scope and boundary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe material matters, as well as our strategy - BRIGHT in place at the start of the year as well as Ambition 2025 adopted at the end of the year - form the anchor of the report.\n\nThe report endeavours to tell the MTN value-creation story clearly and concisely. It explains who we are and where we operate, the context in which we work, our governance and business model, our strategy and investment case, our risks and opportunities, as well as our operational and financial performance in the period 1 January to 31  December  2020.  Financial  and  non-financial  data  from  our subsidiaries are fully consolidated. Please see note 11 of the AFS for restatements arising from a voluntary accounting policy change related to the release of foreign currency translation reserves.\n\nThe report gives commentary, performance and prospects for our main operations: MTN Nigeria and MTN South Africa, which make up  two-thirds  of  the  business,  as  well  as  our  three  operating regions, which make up the other third. In 2020, the regions were:\n\n- \u00b7 SEAGHA (Southern and East Africa and Ghana).\n- \u00b7 WECA (West and Central Africa).\n- \u00b7 MENA (Middle East and North Africa).\n\nIn early 2021, we made changes to the make-up of the regions. Details are on page 03.\n\nThe structure and layout of this report, dated 23 April 2021, draw on the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC) guidance, including  many  of  the  recommendations  of  the  January  2021 version of the <IR> Framework. The 2019 IR was published on 31 March 2020.\n\nNon-financial  information  on  certain  aspects  of  the  business has  been  assured  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  and  is  identified by LA . The assurance statement is online . MTN's definition of the KPIs assured is included in the glossary section.\n\nWe provide supplementary information on our website in associated reports, the icons of which appear on the contents page.\n\nMcebisi\n\nJonas\n\nChairman\n\nPaul Hanratty\n\nShaygan Kheradpir\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStan\n\nMiller\n\nVincent\n\nRague\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur suite of reports complies with the following reporting standards:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe IIRC's <IR> Framework\n\nIR\n\nAFS\n\nCompanies Act, No 71 of 2008 (as\u00a0amended)\n\nIR\n\nAFS\n\nJSE Listings Requirements\n\nIR\n\nAFS\n\nFTSE/JSE Responsible Investment Index\n\nSR\n\nKing IV TM^\n\nIR\n\nAFS\n\nSR\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\n\nIR\n\nAFS\n\nUN Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nSR\n\nGRI\n\nUN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nSR\n\nIR\n\nCarbon Disclosure Project\n\nSR\n\nCDP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Approval by the Board and Acting Group CFO\n\nMTN's  Board  of  Directors  acknowledges  its  responsibility  to ensure the integrity of the Integrated Report. We, as the Board, believe that this report has been prepared in accordance with the IIRC's <IR> Framework. We are of the opinion that it addresses all material matters and offers a balanced view of MTN's repositioned strategy and how it relates to the organisation's ability to create and preserve value in the short, medium and long term, as well as how  it  relates  to  efforts  to  prevent  instances  where  value  is eroded. The report adequately addresses the use of, and effects on, the capitals and the way the availability of capitals is impacting MTN's strategic repositioning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRalph Mupita Group CEO\n\nKhotso Mokhele Lead independent director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAzmi\n\nMikati\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSugentharen Perumal Acting Group CFO\n\nSindi MabasoKoyana\n\nLamido Sanusi\n\nNkunku Sowazi\n\nSwazi Tshabalala\n\n- ^ Copyright and trademarks are owned by the Institute of Directors South Africa NPC and all of its rights are reserved.\n\nTsholofelo Molefe Group CFO\n\nNosipho Molope\n\nNoluthando Gosa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We secure this through a management structure that  reflects  almost  equal  contributions  of around a third to group earnings of each of our operations in South Africa and Nigeria and that of our regions - SEAGHA, WECA and MENA combined.\n\nA  summary  of  our  performance  starts  on page 43.\n\nIn the year we made changes to the operating structure,  as  well  as  to  the  executive  team (page 60). Effective 1 January 2021, MTN Ghana became part of the Group's WECA region and MTN's SEAGHA region became known as the Southern and East Africa (SEA) region.\n\nIn 2020,  the  Group  reported  EBITDA  of R81,3  billion  (2019:  R64,2  billion)  and  an EBITDA margin of 45,3% (2019: 42,3%).

        "page_content": "## The view of our Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf ever there was a year when MTN Group was required to step up, it was 2020. The spread of COVID-19 across the  globe  led  to  widespread  human  suffering  and enormous  damage  to  lives  and  livelihoods.  The pressure  from  the  pandemic  on  economies  and employment profoundly impacted the communities we serve across our markets. Life changed for us all.\n\nAffordability was acutely challenged and MTN played its  part  to  mitigate  this  for  our  customers  through various initiatives. From a more encouraging perspective for our business, the demand for our data and digital services accelerated, dramatically pushing up data traffic. MTN worked hard to ensure that its networks continued to provide market-leading speed and reliability. Supply chains were disrupted, initially\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\ndeferring  network  site  rollouts.  With  heightened currency and commodity price volatility, cash upstreaming was delayed.\n\n## Stepping up\n\nAs the pandemic spread to MTN markets, the Group responded swiftly, creating a dedicated response team reporting to the Board's Risk Committee. Priority was given to MTN's people, customers, communities as well the business - notably network resilience amid the heightened  demand,  and  our  Group-wide  expense efficiency  programme  to  safeguard  the  business against the impacts of a weakening macroeconomic environment.\n\nStrict safety protocols were put in place, and most employees  adapted  quickly  to  working  from  home. Among the Group's 19 295 employees, infections were limited to 1 404. Tragically, 10 employees succumbed to the virus. We mourn their loss and extend our sincere condolences to their colleagues, families and friends.\n\nManagement  established  the  MTN  Global  Staff Emergency  Fund  for  employees,  and Y'ello Hope packages for other stakeholders. (see SR ). Among the Group's many initiatives, MTN worked with host nations to support the Africa COVID Communications and Information Platform and launched the #WearItForMe  mask  campaign  to  encourage  people everywhere to protect each other.\n\nIn a unique public/private partnership in early 2021 the Group led the way in donating US$25 million to the African  Union's  vaccination  programme  to  secure COVID-19 vaccines for the continent's health workers, including  in  our  markets.  We  are,  and  will  remain, focused on the sustainability of the communities and\n\nmarkets we serve, as this lies at the core of everything we do.\n\n## Improving performance, suspending the dividend\n\nDespite  the  upheaval  and  challenging  economic conditions, the Group reported a solid operational and financial performance (see pages 43 to 45). This was driven by the resilience of MTN people, along with the enhanced business model in place over the past few years. Service revenue grew by 11,9%* to R170,1 billion and adjusted headline earnings per share rose 52% to 877 cents.\n\nHowever,  delayed  upstreaming  of  cash  from  MTN Nigeria,  along  with  uncertainty  over  the  timing  of proceeds of the Group's asset realisation programme (ARP)  and  other  COVID-19  impacts,  highlighted  the importance of deleveraging our balance sheet more quickly. This, guided by our capital allocation framework (see page 40), informed our resolution to suspend the 2020  interim  and  final  dividends,  as  well  as  the dividend policy.\n\nThe  Board  anticipates  communicating  a  revised medium-term  dividend  policy  in  March  2022  and expects a final dividend for 2021 of at least 260 cents per share. On assessment of the progress on cash upstreaming from Nigeria, ARP delivery and COVID-19 impacts, we will consider returning any excess cash to shareholders  through  special  dividends  or  share buybacks after the release of 2021 results.\n\n## Repositioning the strategy\n\nIn August 2020, MTN announced plans to focus on African  operations  and  exit  the  Middle  East  in  an orderly manner over the medium term (see page 31). This  decision  was  not  taken  lightly,  considering  the many stakeholders who rely on MTN in the region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This strategy is aimed  to  drive accelerated growth  and  faster deleveraging, positioning MTN for greater relevance ahead.\n\nWith a strategic priority to 'create shared value', there is  a  step-change  in  MTN's  ESG  positioning.  Among many  features,  this  includes  a  commitment  to accelerate digital and financial inclusion, increase trust among stakeholders and work towards achieving net zero emissions by 2040 (see SR ). This is in addition to the Group's pledge to provide greater disclosure on issues such as digital human rights and follows the publishing of MTN's first Transparency Report in 2020.\n\n## Regulatory and legal update\n\nEvolving  regulatory  and  compliance  requirements across  our  markets  as  well  as  complex  litigations remained material matters for the Group in the year. The implications of these on MTN's ability to create value, as well as the Group's strategic response are on pages 21 to 25, with details on the specific key issues on page 31.\n\n## Honing governance\n\nIn 2020, MTN reviewed its governance framework to ensure that it is properly aligned to the new strategy. This led to the establishment of the Directors Affairs and  Governance  Committee  as  well  as  the  Risk Management  and  Compliance  Committee,  replacing the Nominations Committee and the Risk Management, Compliance and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nIn April 2020, we bade farewell to three long-serving non-executive directors - Peter Mageza, Dawn Marole and Koosum Kalyan. September saw the departure of Group  President  and  CEO  Rob  Shuter,  and  the appointment of Group CFO Ralph Mupita to the CEO position.  Christine  Ramon  stepped  down  as  a  nonexecutive director at the end of September 2020, and Sindi Mabaso-Koyana joined, and assumed the chair of the Audit Committee in October.\n\nTowards  the  end  of  2020,  Tsholofelo  Molefe  was appointed Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO), taking up the role on 1 April 2021, when she joined the Board, along with two new non-executive directors - Nosipho Molope and Noluthando Gosa. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all those directors who departed in the year for their valuable contribution and welcome all the new directors.\n\n## Outlook and appreciation\n\nOver  the  past  year,  COVID-19  brought  into  sharper focus the digital divide, particularly in MTN's markets. As  well  as  managing  the  risks  accompanying  the ongoing  pandemic,  the  Group  remains  alive  to  the opportunities  it  presents,  particularly  accelerated digitalisation.\n\nWith the rollout of vaccinations in many parts of the world - including those funded by MTN to inoculate Africa's healthcare  workers  against  COVID-19  economies are starting to recover from the devastation caused by the pandemic in 2020.\n\nSub-Saharan economies are forecast to grow modestly in 2021, but the extent of this expansion will depend on the ability of these markets to secure and dispense\n\nvaccines  swiftly  and  so  achieve  the  population immunity that will allow for a return to a more normal world.  The  agility  and  resilience  of  MTN  and  of  its people will remain key.\n\nMovements  in  commodity  prices  -  also  largely  a function of the world's recovery from the pandemic and the availability and value of the currencies of the markets in which MTN operates will continue to have an important bearing on the ability of the Group to upstream cash from operating companies.\n\nHowever,  with  the  adoption  of  the  revised  strategy (page 10), in the year ahead, MTN is well positioned to drive greater digital and financial inclusion in Africa while  delivering  a  stronger  all-round  performance. As  we  move  ahead  in  hope,  we  look  forward  to continuing to work together to create a better, more inclusive  world.  I  would  like  to  thank  all  MTN's stakeholders  for  their  continued  support  -  we  are #GoodTogether.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Q & A with the CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What were some of the highlights of 2020?\n\nWe  cannot  talk  about  the  highlights  without  first reflecting on the trauma of 2020 and the pandemic that defined it. Our business was also profoundly impacted, and to the end of February 2021, MTN reported 1 404 COVID-19 infections and mourned the loss of 10 MTN employees across our markets. I would like to extend my sincere condolences to those who  lost  friends,  colleagues  and  loved  ones  to COVID-19.\n\nAs the Chairman has outlined in his report, the Group was  quick  to  respond  to  the  many  challenges brought  about  by  the  pandemic.  Key  among  our interventions were the MTN Global Staff Emergency\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\nFund, the Y'ello Hope packages for our customers and  communities  and  contributions  to  various government-led initiatives. Together, these provided approximately R1,8 billion in value to stakeholders. We  were  also  very  pleased  to  be  able  to  donate US$25  million  in  support  of  the  African  Union's COVID-19 vaccination programme.\n\nThrough  the  many  challenges,  including  tough trading  conditions,  we  delivered  solid  commercial momentum across our markets which is reflected in our  strong  financial  results.  Beyond  this,  MTN remained alive to the opportunities presented by the pandemic,  particularly  the  accelerated  need  for digitalisation evidenced in the greater adoption and usage of our services. This, in turn, played a part in shaping our repositioned strategy: Ambition 2025 .\n\nThe year also highlighted the incredible resilience of MTN's business model and people, as well as the important responsibility that we have to assist in facilitating and driving digital and financial inclusion across our markets.\n\n## How was MTN able to remain resilient?\n\nThe  pandemic  led  to  restrictions  on  people's movements in most of our markets and these were generally most severe during April 2020. MTN's agility and  responsiveness  saw  us  transform  quickly. In mid-March 100% of our people were in the office and within weeks no more than 10% were. By quickly rolling out various communication and collaborative tools as part of our work-from-home programme, staff across our markets were able to work remotely, thereby ensuring the continuity of our operations.\n\nResponsiveness to the needs of our customers was also very important. To accommodate the transition to work, learn and entertain from home, we ramped up our digital channels as a service alternative for\n\ncustomers  to  purchase  airtime  and  access  our products and services seamlessly. We also zero-rated educational  websites  and  reduced  or  zero-rated transaction fees on Mobile Money (MoMo) in support of our customers through the challenges presented by COVID-19.\n\nAs  our  core  connectivity  services  became  more critical, our priority was to safeguard the capacity and  resilience  of  our  networks.  We  were  able  to ensure  this  by  implementing  various  measures, including building up an inventory of equipment and critical spares. The resilience of MTN's networks, the headroom  available  on  these  networks  and  the allocation of temporary additional spectrum in South Africa in particular enabled the Group to meet the 110% surge in data traffic in the year.\n\nThe work we had done over the past few years to ensure  balance  sheet  strength  and  resilience positioned us well to weather the volatility. During 2020,  we  fast-tracked  and  closed  R18,2  billion  in funding to mitigate refinance risks around upcoming maturities.  We  maintained  a  prudent  approach  to liquidity management  and  a  focus  on  cash preservation and at year-end, our Holdco liquidity headroom stood at R41,0 billion.\n\n## Tell us about Ambition 2025.\n\nWe are very excited about Ambition 2025 at MTN, not only in the way that the strategy will support the socioeconomic progress of Africa but also in the way that we will be able to reveal and crystallise the value that we believe is embedded in our core business.\n\nWe  are  enthusiastic about the opportunities presented in our markets to win in digital services and accelerate growth Ambition 2025 has been developed to seize on these. In sub-Saharan Africa there  are  800  million  people  who  are  still  not connected  to  the  mobile  internet.  COVID-19  has\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This will provide the Company with greater financial flexibility to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities that we have identified. Our ARP is a key part of our objective to accelerate our Holdco  deleveraging  and  reduce  the  level  of  US dollar debt in particular. In terms of our work to simplify and reduce the risk profile of the Group, we are also driving a transformation of our portfolio that will focus on our pan-African strategy with an orderly exit from the Middle East over the medium term.\n\nAs mentioned, Ambition 2025 provides opportunities to unlock value within the MTN Group. We want to reveal  and  crystallise  the  value  that  we  see  as inherent in the Group, particularly in our infrastructure  assets  and  our  platforms.  In  this respect, we have commenced a structural separation of some of these businesses that will enable us to manage  them  better  and  accelerate  their  growth through selective strategic partnerships and investment  where  it  makes  sense.  We  are  very energised  about  the  future  and  delivering  on Ambition 2025 , which we describe in more detail on page 10.\n\n## How will achieving Ambition 2025 set MTN apart?\n\nThis is really about our investment case (page 13), which is a compelling African growth story. MTN is Africa's  leading  connectivity  and  infrastructure business; we have #1 and #2 positions in all our markets;  and  our  networks  are  second  to  none. MTN is a trusted brand across Africa and we have deep expertise and experience in the industry. There are exciting demographic opportunities in Africa: a young  population  with  low  internet  adoption  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\npenetration. Given the digital acceleration we see, we are very well positioned for the long-term. We believe we can enhance  our  return  profile, underpinned  by  a  strong  risk  and  regulatory framework,  as  well  as  a  very  disciplined  capital allocation  framework  that  informs  the  decisions we make.\n\nWith  our  industry-leading  and  scale  connectivity business as a base, we will build the largest and most valuable platforms business that is distinctly African and set MTN apart as a growth company, delivering improving returns. We believe that we have a duty to our people, customers and communities to continue to lead from the front in providing digital solutions by speeding up the development of our products and services. This embodies our belief statement and strategic intent.\n\n## Tell us about making 'ESG at the core' a key part of your priorities.\n\nOne of the focus areas within the strategic priorities is  to  place  ESG  at  the  core.  We  aim  to  make  a meaningful  contribution  to  sustainable  societies across the markets in which we operate.\n\nIn addition to raising the visibility of shared value through  the  business  and  being  the  partner  of choice of nation states for socioeconomic development, we target a step-change in the ESG positioning of the Group to stakeholders. This will place the Group as a leader in ESG and drive the ongoing improvement in stakeholders' trust in MTN and in our reputation.\n\nIn  2020  we  made  good  progress  in  ESG.  Ecoresponsibility is an important area of focus and we have set some challenging ambitions for ourselves in, for instance, targeting a 47% reduction in absolute emissions (tCO 2 e) for scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2030 and net zero by 2040. This is part of our Group-wide Project Zero initiative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  continue  to  work  towards  creating  more sustainable societies by continuing to address the gaps in access to connectivity. In 2020, we extended our network, which now covers more than 500 million people  and  we  improved  the  affordability  of  our services by further reducing our average data tariff by  a  third  and  our  effective  voice  tariff  by  15%. We  continued  to  advance  financial  inclusion  and recorded transactions worth US$152 billion on our MoMo.  In  terms  of  diversity  and  inclusion,  we increased  the  representation  of  women  on  the Group  Board  to  33%  and  women  at  senior management level to 29%.\n\nOur  work  on  continuously  improving  governance was reflected in an increase in reputation and trust with stakeholders and captured in our reputation index  score  of  79%.  We  continued  to  participate meaningfully in the development of the economies and markets we serve. In 2020, we invested more than R50 billion in overall expenditure on networks in support of fixed investment in our markets and contributed more than R35 billion in taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe SR gives details of all these developments, and I urge you to read it for more information.\n\n## What does the future hold for MTN?\n\nWe  are  very  excited  about  this  next  chapter  and evolution  of  the  MTN  story  and  we  have  already started to execute on our exciting strategy, Ambition 2025 . At the heart of our ambition is to continue leading the drive for digital and financial inclusion  in  Africa,  aligning  to  the  development agendas of nation states, and being their partner of choice for socioeconomic development.\n\nThere  are  far  too  many  Africans  who  remain unconnected to the internet and we want to play our part  in  supporting  digital  and  financial  inclusion. We truly believe that we can be a successful force for good and continue to support Africa's progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The environment in which we operate is complex, presenting exceptional challenges as well as exciting opportunities. By considering our market context, we are better able to determine our material matters; to understand the impact these have on our business model; and to develop and execute our repositioned strategy by leveraging off our competitive advantages. We are also able to better align our priorities to those of our stakeholders and, in particular, to the development agendas of nation states as we strive to create greater shared value. In this way, we can reposition the business for growth and greater relevance ahead.\n\nFor details of the ways in which we are responding to these factors, see page 10 where we discuss how our repositioned strategy is making the most of the opportunities.\n\nPolitical, regulatory and economic environment\n\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 is placing strain on governments, hurting economies, exacerbating inequality and putting a pause on reforms. A return to higher growth in our markets is expected albeit amid higher inflation and unemployment, challenging affordability. A global slowdown could change this, particularly in commodity-reliant economies where hard currency is scarce and local currencies are depreciating.\n- \u00b7 In many markets the overall quality of governance is improving.\n- \u00b7 Economic nationalism and deglobalisation are on the rise with more protectionism evident. A new US administration may reduce trade tensions, with implications for network equipment vendors, but this remains to be seen.\n- \u00b7 Prolonged conflicts continue, impacting Middle East markets in particular.\n- \u00b7 Regulations are dynamic. Governments are intent on increasing connectivity and digitising societies. Data sovereignty and privacy are topical. | Framing our strategic priorities\n\n'Everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life'\n\nAmbition 2025: 'Leading digital solutions for Africa's progress'\n\nSocial and technology environment\n\n- \u00b7 Populations across our markets are youthful: two-thirds are under 24 and born digital and mobile, making them fast adopters.\n- \u00b7 Lockdown restrictions accelerated the transition to work and learn from home, with greater digitalisation resulting in growth in data traffic, progressing digital and financial inclusion. The lockdowns have sown greater social discord and many markets have insufficient resources for an appropriate medical response.\n- \u00b7 More than 65% of Africans are financially un- or underserved. The need for mass market digital financial products and commerce remains unaddressed.\n- \u00b7 Over 60% of Africans are not connected to the internet. The cost of data is a barrier to the uptake of social apps and digital advertising is nascent. Less than a third of Africans use the most popular instant messaging platforms.\n- \u00b7 Spectrum is often constrained. Rapid growth in data traffic requires an increase in the African fibre footprint.\n- \u00b7 Africa's enterprise services market is small, as is the API market: accessing APIs is slow and costly for developers.\n- \u00b7 Operators rely on a handful of reputable network equipment vendors. Some are the subject of US-China trade tensions.

For more than a quarter of a century, we have played a bold and prominent role in accelerating Africa's development. When we started our journey, it was our ambition to brighten lives through the power of connectivity, and this continues to be a priority for us. Africa is young, dynamic and ambitious. We see an opportunity to continue harnessing the power of MTN - not only through our brand strength, our footprint and best-in-class connectivity infrastructure, but by offering technology platforms that are second to none, through Ambition 2025 , our integrated platform strategy. This is an evolution from the BRIGHT strategy, which enabled us to lead the race to connect Africa and its people, towards accelerating and delivering a range of platforms to further digitise the lives of all.\n\n## MTN journey thus far - A foundation of commercial and operational excellence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

MTN has built strong core operations, which are underpinned by the largest fixed and mobile network in Africa; a large, connected, registered customer base; an unparalleled registration and distribution network, as well as one of the strongest brands in our markets. This is our starting point.\n\nIn the wake of COVID-19, the challenges of reducing the Group's risk profile and Holdco leverage have been brought into sharper focus. The pandemic has also highlighted the opportunities presented by the shift in the global operating environment. These factors inform the case for change and the need to revise our strategy. In light of the digital acceleration taking place globally, MTN recognises the opportunity to win in digital services in our markets as customers come online for the first time. In so doing, there is also an opportunity for MTN to align our priorities more closely with the development agendas of our operating markets.\n\nOur revised strategy, Ambition 2025 , is anchored in building the largest and most valuable platform business with a clear focus on Africa. This will rest on a scale connectivity and infrastructure business, making use of both mobile and fixed access networks across the consumer, enterprise and wholesale segments. The implementation of this growth strategy will be accelerated though selective partnerships and leveraging MTN's brand as the most trusted and valued in Africa, while it will be supported and funded through enhanced cost and capex efficiencies. The execution of Ambition 2025 is embodied in four clear strategic priorities. We have identified five vital enablers to assist in operationalising our strategy.\n\n025 | Framing our strategic priorities\n\nur strategic priorities\n\nAmbition 2025 | Framing our strategic priorities\n\nBelief statement\n\nStrategic intent\n\nBuild the\n\nlargest\n\n& most\n\nindustry-leading\n\nconnectivity operations\n\nvaluable\n\nplatforms\n\n25\n\nstrategic\n\npriorities\n\nBest talent, culture &\n\nfuture skills Vital enablers\n\nLeading customer\n\nexperience\n\nLeadership\n\nIntegrity\n\nRelationships\n\nInnovation\n\nCan-Do\n\nIntegrity\n\nRelationships\n\nInnovation\n\nCan-Do\n\nValues\n\nLeadership\n\nIntegrity\n\nRelationships\n\nInnovation\n\nCan-Do\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerate portfolio\n\ntransformation\n\nTechnology\n\nplatforms second to\n\nnone\n\n10\n\nValues\n\nLeadership\n\nIntegrity\n\nRelationships\n\nInnovation\n\nCan-Do\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our markets are growth markets.

Restrictions were most severe in April 2020 after which they began to ease. However, this state of flux and uncertainty continued for the rest of the year, and indeed well into 2021.

Economies start to recover.\n\n## Telecommunications industry\n\n- \u00b7 Considered as an essential service.\n- \u00b7 People spent more time at home working, entertaining and educating, resulting in a surge of data usage.\n- \u00b7 Increase in data traffic and data revenue, enterprise revenue.\n- \u00b7 Pressure on voice revenue.\n\nRefer to page 08 for our market context and pages 21 to 25 for our material matters\n\n## MTN acted swiftly to address various challenges resulting from the crisis:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Social (Our people and  communities)   | Impacts \u00b7 Economic slowdown \u00b7 Lockdowns \u00b7 Health and wellbeing \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7                                                                                                                                 | Managing the crisis Future focus /Y\\_e\\_l\\_l\\_o Hope packages Work from home Safety measures \u00b7 Agile working \u00b7 Support staff and communities \u00b7 US$25m donated in support of  AU's vaccination programme   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Digital channels ramped up \u00b7 Zero-rated sites and discounts  on mobile financial services \u00b7 Innovative offerings -  university deals \u00b7 Focus on resilience and  capacity \u00b7 Capacity investments/ | \u00b7 Accelerated digitalisation \u00b7 Stimulate usage \u00b7 Home connectivity                                                                                                                                    |\n| Commercial (including our customers)   | Affordability pressure Lower transactions Shift from voice to data Site rollout delayed Data payload surges Supply chain disruption                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Network and   supply chain             | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 spectrum \u00b7 Built 12-month buffer \u00b7                                                                                                                                                               | \u00b7 Resumption of rollout \u00b7 Modernisations/spectrum \u00b7 Supply chain management                                                                                                                           |\n| Funding   and liquidity                | Cash upstreaming delayed \u00b7 Currency volatility \u00b7 Volatile capital markets \u00b7 Built financial resilience \u00b7 Cash conservation and  liquidity headroom \u00b7 2020 refinancing completed                        | \u00b7 ARP readiness for execution \u00b7 Cash upstreaming from  Nigeria \u00b7 Reducing leverage and   US$ debt                                                                                                     |\n\nFor details, including stakeholders' perception of our response, see SR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlso refer to our governance section page 51, risk section page 33 and remuneration section page 63 for COVID-19 impacts.\n\n## Internal environment\n\n## Ensuring business continuity and seamless communication\n\nA COVID-19 response project team was put together to manage risks and ensure that we continue to create value and assist stakeholders\n\n## COVID-19 across our footprint\n\n## Cases in MTN footprint\n\nInfections: 4 319 560\n\nDeaths: 125 969\n\nCases in MTN\n\nInfections: 1 404\n\nDeaths: 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opcos with the most cases\n\n- \u00b7 South Africa\n- \u00b7 Iran\n- \u00b7 Ghana\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Cameroon\n- \u00b7 Nigeria\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This growth is going to be impacted by COVID-19 if there are third waves, and by the speed of the vaccine rollout across markets to create the herd immunity that will enable us to move back into a normal cycle. Currencies and commodities are important in how they impact the economies and how we translate cash back to the Group.\n\nIn 2021 mobile and digital acceleration will continue. We believe that this is going to be fairly sustained as we have a huge population base that is still not connected to the internet and there is still scope to drive our services more broadly, not just connectivity but the services that sit on top of connectivity. We remain cautiously optimistic as we look ahead, and the caution is around how COVID-19 impacts countries. Our business is ready and well invested to be able to capture growth.\n\nOur target over the next five years is to grow our total subscriber base to 300 million , our mobile data users to 200 million data subscribers and our home broadband users to 10 million . This objective forms the connectivity foundation upon which we aim to leverage our platform ambition, in terms of which we aim to scale our MoMo and ayoba user bases to 100 million .\n\nWe will continue to invest in the capacity and resilience of our networks as well as scaling our platforms to drive accelerated growth in our business. Our guidance for capex in 2021 is R29,1 billion, which is a slight increase of 1,8% on our 2020 capex.\n\n## Macro context in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Currencies and commodities\n\n|                    | 2020                    | 2021F       |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Average rand/US$:  | R16,46/US$              | R15,23/US$  |\n| Average naira/US$: | N382,28/US$ N445,55/US$ |             |\n| Brent crude US$:   | US$41,3/bbl             | US$50,0/bbl |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COVID-19\n\nEmerging from 2nd wave of infections, potential for 3rd\n\nwave ?\n\nAU securing vaccines through COVAX facilities with 670m doses secured for 2021\n\nInfections reported of 2,7m , deaths of 71k as at 28 February 2021^\n\n-\n\n2,6%\n\n2,2%\n\ncase fatality rate vs\n\nglobal case fatality rate\n\nSource: Johns Hopkins (excludes Reunion and Western Sahara). ^SSA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mobile and digital acceleration\n\n800m people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) still not connected to mobile internet\n\nSSA mobile internet users to grow\n\nto\n\n475m\n\nby 2025 from\n\n272m\n\nin 2019\n\nSSA smartphone penetration to\n\ngrow to\n\n65%\n\nin 2020\n\nSource: GSMA\n\n16\n\nby 2025 from\n\n50%\n\n<!-- image -->",

Negotiated rearranging the 1800MHz allocation to prevent fragmentation.\n- \u00b7 Ghana: Obtained additional 900MHz and 1800MHz which fell above respective spectrum caps after the Airtel Tigo merger. Obtained 5MHz of temporary 2600MHz spectrum during pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Guinea-Conakry: Started negotiations with regulator on licence renewal (which will see significant expansion of spectrum reserves).\n- \u00b7 Congo-Brazzaville: Obtained 10MHz of 800MHz earmarked for 4G.\n- \u00b7 Syria: Both operators had to give up 900MHz spectrum to make this available for a new entrant.\n- \u00b7 Afghanistan: Assisted regulator with preparations for auction for additional 1800, 2100 and 2600MHz spectrum.\n- \u00b7 Improved engagements with stakeholders on sustainability matters.\n- \u00b7 Continued driving efficiencies to ensure our technical infrastructure supports service delivery using the least energy.\n- \u00b7 Donated US$25m in support of the African Union's programme to secure COVID-19 vaccines for member states.\n- \u00b7 Contributed R168m (CSI spend) and provided ongoing support through the MTN Global Staff Emergency Fund for employees; Y'ello Hope packages for our customers, communities and other stakeholders as well as through contributions through MTN foundations and government-led initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Enhanced management structures and revised key ethics structures and policies to support regulatory compliance.\n- \u00b7 Monitored staff morale through annual culture survey.\n- \u00b7 Extended MoMo services to more people.\n- \u00b7 Reduced effective data price by 32,9% and voice rates by 15%.\n- \u00b7 Improved engagements with various regulators resolving key matters.\n\n- \u00b7 Payment for spectrum and the capital outlay required to maintain network puts pressure on financial capital in the short term.

As such, their role in the sustainability of the Company, and of its stakeholders, cannot be overstated. For 2020, MTN's material matters were revised as part of the repositioning of our strategy, aligning them to Ambition 2025: Leading digital solutions for Africa's progress .\n\nThe outlook has been articulated under strategic priorities (see page 12) clearly mapping short-term, medium-term and long-term objectives. Globally, 2020 was shaped by the spread of COVID-19 and its pervasive impact on lives and livelihoods. The effect of the pandemic, therefore, presents a common thread affecting each of MTN's material matters.\n\n## Managing material matters\n\nWe manage material matters by identifying, prioritising, responding and reporting on them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Identify\n\nWe determine our material matters by considering matters of significant importance to our stakeholders and factors that receive the most management and Board attention during the year. These themes take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 The priority interests of our key stakeholders (pages 27 to 30) and the impact of these on our strategy (page 10)\n- \u00b7 The Group's top risks and opportunities (pages 33 to 38)\n- \u00b7 The context in which we operate (page 08)\n- \u00b7 Investor Relations\n- \u00b7 Strategy\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit\n- \u00b7 Treasury\n\nCFO review\n\n## Prioritise\n\nThese central themes then form the basis of discussion at workshops at which representatives of key departments participate.\n\nThey prioritise the Group's material matters by considering the scale and nature of their impact on business operations, financial performance and interest of our stakeholders. These are then scrutinised and ultimately endorsed by the CFO, CEO, the Executive Committee and then the Board.\n\n## Workshop participants\n\n- \u00b7 Risk\n- \u00b7 Company Secretary\n- \u00b7 Human Resources\n- \u00b7 M&A\n\nCEO review\n\n- \u00b7\n- Regulatory and Corporate Affairs\n- \u00b7 Technology\n\n## Respond\n\nWe respond to our material matters by putting in place appropriate management actions to capitalise on those factors that offer opportunity for greater value creation as well as interventions to mitigate those which have the potential to disrupt it.

For this reason, the Group has been on a journey towards achieving greater consistency, governance and impact in its stakeholder management.\n\nAligned with the MTN strategy, the MTN Group stakeholder and reputation management strategy was approved by the Board in 2018. In serving the Group's strategic intent, it distinguishes between 10 stakeholder categories based on their stake in the Company. In this section we provided the views of our material stakeholders. Within our strategic repositioning, strategic priorities inform stakeholder management efforts in all our markets. They are to drive the Company's reputation, respond promptly to stakeholder issues, and build relationships. These strategic priorities also inform the key performance indicators (KPIs) we use to evaluate the impact of our efforts on stakeholder perceptions. (Refer to page 10 for our strategic priorities.)\n\nWorking in tandem with the strategy team, the MTN Group stakeholder engagement policy standardises stakeholder engagement practices across all markets. The policy ensures good governance, adherence to the King IV TM principles for stakeholder management, and sets minimum standards for effective stakeholder engagement. Within the framework of the strategy and policy, operating companies identify, and map key stakeholders in their markets, plan their engagement proactively, and keep record of all official engagements.\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of our engagement, and the accumulated impact on stakeholder relations and corporate reputation\n\nMTN relies on stakeholder feedback as part of everyday engagement, supplemented with mechanisms to survey stakeholders such as the Group Culture Audit (GCA), NPS tracking and the Reputation Index Survey (RIS).\n\nThe 2020 RIS surveyed 4 572 stakeholder representatives in 20 markets (highest recorded number of respondents to date), answering four questions:\n\nStakeholders' assessment of MTN's reputation\n\nStakeholders' rating of their relationship with MTN and their level of trust in the brand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach material stakeholders' rating of the relationship with MTN is shown as below:\n\nStakeholders also rated how MTN showed up in its response to COVID-19, this is indicated with the icon below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrong\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop-line results: 2020 Reputation Index Survey\n\nMTN reputation = 79% Quality of engagement = 74% Responsiveness on issues = 74%\n\nStakeholder relationships = 71% Trust in MTN = 73%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to page 15 for MTN's response to COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholders' experience of MTN's engagement, including perceptions on how MTN showed up during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe issues that matter most to stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->",

Partnerships help us create shared value. We are committed to being transparent with our partners about the key issues we face. These are the issues that are top of mind for our leaders. They affect our ability to create and preserve value and are linked to our material matters (page 21), the concerns of our stakeholders (page 27) and our risks and opportunities (page 33).\n\n## Planned exit from the Middle East\n\n## Nigeria's suspension of SIM sales\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian regulator suspended the sale of all new SIM cards by all operators to allow it to audit the subscriber database. It set various deadlines for operators to re-register the national identity numbers of all subscribers.\n\nOur response: MTN Nigeria embraced the opportunity to play a more meaningful role in driving a solution for this issue and a sustainable and more reliable SIM registration process. By 28 February 2021, 37,2m (or 48,7%) of the MTN Nigeria subscriber base had submitted their NINs. These submissions remain subject to verification against the National Identification Management Commission database.\n\nMTN is committed to supporting efforts to create a secure and sustainable digital economy and to comply with all regulations.\n\nMTN Ghana classified an SMP\n\nIn June 2020, Ghana's regulator classified MTN Ghana as a significant market power and determined that special regulatory restrictions would be enforced to potentially limit the company's growth, performance, innovativeness, and its competitiveness.\n\nOur response: After numerous engagements, MTN Ghana applied to the courts for a judicial review. Given progress made in further engagements, in October 2020, MTN Ghana withdrew its legal challenge. This paves the way for an amicable resolution. Discussions continue.\n\nMTN Ghana is a responsible market player in a highly competitive market and does not engage in anti-competitive behaviour.\n\n## Spectrum\n\nRadio spectrum is the digital highway upon which mobile operators depend to carry increasing volumes of mobile data at more cost-effective prices. South Africa has among the lowest spectrum allocation of all MTN markets.\n\nOur response: COVID-19 led to increased demand on our network across our footprint. MTN motivated regulators to grant additional spectrum temporarily in markets that experienced capacity constraints. We secured additional spectrum in South Africa, Ghana and Zambia. Given the continued high levels of data consumption in South Africa and Zambia, we have sought to secure permanent additional spectrum in auctions in these markets. The release of new spectrum will greatly enhance MTN's ability to service more customers and provide more affordable prices.\n\nMTN is committed to bridging the digital divide and facilitating lower data prices.\n\nIn August 2020, we announced plans to exit the Middle East in an orderly manner over the medium term. Over the years, macro pressures and currency devaluation have led to operations in this complex region contributing less than 4% to MTN Group earnings. However, our colleagues in the Middle East continue to make us proud. In February 2021, a Syrian court placed MTN Syria under a judicial guardian after the Syrian Telecoms Authorities filed a lawsuit against the Company.\n\nOur response: We engaged in discussions to sell our 75% stake in MTN Syria. Until such time as we progress this divestiture, and those in Afghanistan and Yemen, the Middle East operations will remain part of the Group. We realise that our decision to exit will have implications for customers in those markets. We are working closely with our key stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nMTN is committed to an orderly exit.\n\n## Afghanistan anti-terrorism complaint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn December 2019, a complaint for violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act was filed in the US. Families of US soldiers sued MTN for allegedly aiding militant groups in Afghanistan. The complaint alleges that several businesses supported the Taliban by making payments to ensure the protection of infrastructure.\n\nOur response: MTN has deep sympathy for those who have been injured or lost loved ones as a result of the tragic conflict in Afghanistan. MTN is proud of the role it has played in emerging markets, where widening use of mobile has been a major force for good in social, economic and political liberation. MTN has filed a 'motion to dismiss' requesting that the court end the lawsuit and grant a judgment in MTN's favour because the court lacks jurisdiction over MTN, which does not operate in the US, and because the complaint does not allege any conduct by MTN that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\n\nMTN conducts its business in a responsible and compliant manner in all its territories and intends to defend its position.\n\n5G\n\nThere are concerns from some stakeholders regarding the health implications of using 5G technology. There is a misperception that 5G causes cancer, and that 5G-emitted radiation weakens the immune system, enabling COVID-19 to spread.\n\nOur response: MTN works to raise awareness of the fact that there is no reliable scientific evidence of any link between 5G and COVID-19 and we remain focused on our efforts to combat the pandemic and support customers and society. We prioritise the resilience and capacity of our networks, which provide the telecoms services that are vital in the fight against COVID-19 as well as the connectivity that customers need to remain economically active despite lockdown restrictions. 5G mobile technology has undergone extensive research, with numerous studies finding that it has no negative impact on the environment or people. This has been confirmed by leading global experts, including the WHO.\n\nMTN continues to work to raise awareness that there is no scientific evidence of any link between 5G and COVID-19.\n\n31\n\n<!-- image -->",

Topdown and bottom-up risk management results in a profile of the most material risk issues based on residual risk. Residual risk considers the likelihood of identified events occurring, the impact should these materialise and the effectiveness of existing mitigation and controls.\n\nTop risk profiles are discussed at monthly MTN Group Exco meetings as well as at quarterly meetings of the MTN Group Audit Committee and the Risk Management and Compliance Committee. In addition, opco level risks are discussed at opco exco and opco Audit and Risk Committee meetings. At these meetings, changes and new risks are discussed  and  progress  on  agreed  mitigation  actions monitored.\n\n## Principal risk universe and risk appetite\n\nA key component of enterprise risk management entails the use of a focused principal risk universe. In the first instance,  the  risk  universe  provides  two-tiered  risk categorisation  that  enables  uniform  mapping  of  risk issues across all the operating companies for bottom-up integration and consistency. From the top-down perspective,  the  principal  risk  universe  guides  senior management to achieve completeness of risk identification. The principal risk universe is dynamic and is periodically reviewed to reflect changes in strategy, organisation and operations.\n\nThe organisation's risk appetite philosophy and statements are operationalised by applying risk preferences to each principal  risk.  This  helps  guide  the  articulation  of mitigations and resource planning. Furthermore, key risk indicators (KRIs) with tolerance levels are developed for each principal risk to further embed and operationalise the Board's risk appetite guidance.

'Governance' covers risk issues related to governance, compliance, internal control environment, fraud and financial crime and social and ethics.\n- \u00b7 A principal risk for credit was added to the universe, to identify and map risk issues from the evolving fintech business. Credit risk covers all aspects of credit issues including sales and distribution.\n- \u00b7 The previous principal risk 'fraud and internal control' was split into 'fraud and financial crime' and 'internal control'; allowing 'fraud and financial crime' to be assigned a low risk preference in line with the Group's zero tolerance for fraud; and 'internal control' a current medium risk preference to reflect the differing levels of internal control maturity across different markets and the overall direction of the repositioned strategy to drive standardisation of controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Information technology\n- \u00b7 Information security\n- \u00b7 Competition\n- \u00b7 Legal\n- \u00b7 Political and macroeconomy\n- \u00b7 Compliance\n- \u00b7 Internal control environment\n- \u00b7 Fraud and financial crime\n- \u00b7 Governance\n- \u00b7 Social and ethics\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n## Risk category\n\n<!-- image -->",

The compliance maturity  model  is  an  integral  component  of  efforts  to establish leading compliance functions within the opcos and  drive consistency in compliance  management across the Group. In addition, we rolled out a new Group compliance monitoring and testing methodology to ensure standardisation  on  how  our  opcos  test  compliance  to regulatory obligations. In 2020, all opcos were trained on the methodology and over 90% of the planned compliance monitoring  and  testing  reviews,  which  comprises  over 4 300 obligations, were completed.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario planning\n\nIn additional to using risk categories and principal risks to achieve  completeness  of  risk  identification,  as  part  of proactive  forward-looking  risk  management,  we  have incorporated  stress  testing  and  catastrophic  scenario planning exercises into the process. Stress test scenarios are applied to different elements of the budgeting process at an opco and MTN Group level, with high-level mitigations developed for shock scenarios. Examples of catastrophic scenarios considered include: a dramatic depreciation of key market currency; difficulties in renewal of licences or nationalisation in key markets; failure of a major network supplier; cyber-attack crippling large parts of the network; and technology disruption leading to a more rapid move away from voice to data/digital.\n\n## Business resilience\n\nWe implemented a business resilience roadmap, with all opcos achieving at least 80% of the plan and all Tier 1 opcos achieving 100%. As part of operational resilience efforts, we implemented work-from-home (WFH) for all employees and increased our call centre redundancies. Governance  resilience  structures  enabled  the  Group COVID-19  Response  Project  which  comprised  six  subproject streams. We performed credit risk deep-dives to identify and manage credit-related risks and carried out robust stress testing to allow for financial resilience during the pandemic. As part of supply chain resilience, short- to medium-term  contingency  was  built-up,  including  a 12-month buffer for critical spares and capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amid COVID-19 uncertainty, how did MTN's financial performance evolve?\n\nBeyond  managing  the  accompanying  risks  of COVID-19, we continued to strengthen our commercial, operational and financial position while focusing on the resilience of our networks and the expense efficiency programmes in our markets.\n\nWe performed favourably against our medium-term targets, with service revenue growth of 11,9%*. This was driven by the surge in data revenue (+31%*) and data traffic (+110%). Voice revenue (+4,8%*) came under some  pressure from COVID-19-related lockdowns, especially during Q2, but recovered in the  remainder  of  the  year  as  restrictions  eased. Digital  revenue  (+27,1%*)  was  supported  by  the greater  uptake  of  our  services  during  the  year. Wholesale  revenue  (-12,4%*)  was  impacted  by national  roaming  effects  from  MTN  South  Africa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\nFintech revenue grew strongly (+23,9%*), underpinned by the accelerated adoption of mobile financial services.\n\nEBITDA increased by 13,4%* and the Group's EBITDA margin  expanded  by  0,9pp*  to  42,7%*,  benefiting from  the  execution  of  our  expense  efficiency programme. The solid result was supported by the pleasing growth in our larger operations as well as a broad-based improvement across all our regions. See  page  43  for  a  summary  of  our  operations performance.\n\nThe strong underlying earnings growth and profitability was reflected in the 4,0pp increase in adjusted ROE to 17,0%. Group leverage improved to 0,8x, while Holdco leverage was steady at 2,2x. We saw a further improvement in our capex intensity to 16%, from 17,3%. We capitalised R28,6 billion while rolling out a total of 3 342 3G sites and 8 354 4G sites.\n\n## How were the 2020 cost efficiencies achieved, and can these be sustained going forward?\n\nWe  delivered  R2  billion  of  efficiencies,  largely through network savings, a decline in device volumes and costs that reduced during 2020 due to COVID-19, such  as  travel.  MTN  South  Africa  recorded  the majority of efficiencies delivered in 2020. Notably, handset volumes are recovering and some of the cost  reduction  due  to  the  pandemic  are  likely  to reverse, however we remain committed to maintaining and enhancing margins and profitability of the Group.\n\n## What progress did MTN make on the asset realisation programme (ARP), and what is the Group prioritising in 2021?\n\nWe  first announced  our  ARP  and  portfolio transformation  two  years  ago,  aiming  to  reduce debt, simplify our portfolio, reduce risk and improve returns. In Q1 of 2020, we disposed of our ATC Ghana and ATC Uganda tower joint ventures for R8,8 billion. These proceeds were part of the initial phase of our ARP target which was R15 billion over three years this was achieved in the first 12 months.\n\nIn difficult market  conditions over the past 12  months,  we  realised  a  further  R4,3  billion  of proceeds of our revised target of at least R25 billion in  proceeds  over  the  medium  term.  In  H2,  we announced our exit from our 18,9% investment in Jumia for proceeds of R2,3 billion and the localisation of  8%  of  our  shareholding  in  MTN  Zambia  for proceeds  R178  million.  In  February  2021,  we completed our exit from BICS, for net cash proceeds of R1,8 billion.\n\n## How has MTN managed balance sheet resilience and liquidity as well as risks and forex exposure?\n\nOur ability to weather the volatility brought about by COVID-19 is demonstrated in the resilience of our balance  sheet.  During  2020,  we  fast-tracked  and closed R18,2 billion in funding to mitigate refinance risks  around  upcoming  maturities  and  remained focused on managing liquidity as well as preserving cash.\n\nAt  year  end,  our  Holdco  liquidity  headroom  was R41,0 billion: R16,4 billion in cash and R24,6 billion in committed,  undrawn  credit  facilities.  In  an  illiquid forex market,  cash  upstreaming  from  Nigeria remained challenged: we upstreamed the equivalent of R286 million, with R4,2 billion yet to be repatriated as at 31 December 2020. As stated by the Chairman, this  contributed  to  the  suspension  of  the  2020 dividend  as  we  committed  to  the  accelerated deleveraging of the Holdco balance sheet.\n\nOur  focus  over  the  medium-term  remains  on reducing our exposure to US dollar debt, as well as on improving the funding mix at the Holdco level through  greater  cash  flows  from  the  ARP  and portfolio transformation. Our deleveraging strategy will be executed and achieved through:\n\n- \u00b7 Continued  solid  operational  performance  and cashflow generation.\n- \u00b7 Focus on cash upstreaming from the markets.\n- \u00b7 Committed to R25 billion medium-term ARP, which has been slowed by market volatility.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity and liability management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Wholesale declined by 12,4%, with South Africa being the main contributor to this.\n\nEBITDA Drove cost efficiencies, strong operational performance and operating leverage.\n\nNet finance cost Increase was driven by increase in forex losses due to the weakening of exchange rates in Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nShare of results of associates and joint ventures after tax Improvement driven by discontinuation of Jumia which is no longer equity accounted.\n\nInterest expense Decrease in group effective tax rate, driven by non-taxable gain from disposal of the tower companies.\n\n## HEPS\n\nRand depreciation, good operational performance and improved contribution of profits from associates & JVs, benefiting from non-operational items totalling 128 cents.\n\nOther non-current assets\n\nIncludes investment in IHS, fair valued at R27,2bn at year-end.\n\nOther current assets Additional investments in fixed deposits held in Nigeria.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale MTN Syria and BICS have been classified as held for sale at the end of the year.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nMainly driven by an increase in BTS accruals and foreign currency denominated creditors in Nigeria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was despite a challenging macro and  trading  environment  and  volatility  in  the national roaming business.\n\nThe 1,6% growth in service revenue was supported by the prepaid (up  2,9%)  and  total  postpaid  (up  8,6%)  businesses,  which recovered well from the impact of regulation changes in 2019. Overall  service  revenue  was  also  boosted  by  a  resilient performance in the broader consumer business unit (CBU) and growth in the enterprise business unit (EBU). The core mobile\n\nbusiness grew service revenue by 4,6%. MTN SA's results were impacted by lower revenue in the wholesale business. This arose from discontinuation of the roaming agreement with Telkom and the continuing effects of accounting for Cell C revenue on a cash basis. Excluding the impact of national roaming (both Cell C and Telkom), MTN SA would have recorded service revenue growth of 3,2%. Cell C has remained current with payments on the agreed upon plan.\n\nTotal  subscribers increased  by  3,1  million  to  32,0  million  on stronger gross additions and improved churn. The main driver was an increase in prepaid customers by 2,4 million, to a base of 25,3 million - the highest level in about two years. Postpaid subscriber numbers increased by 664 000 to 6,8 million, in a highly competitive  environment  and  limited  by  lockdown restrictions. It was encouraging to note that MTN SA achieved positive net connections for the five months in a row to December 2020. The postpaid subscriber base benefited from short-term university and college deals offered to support students during the height of COVID-19 impacts.\n\nTotal data revenue grew by 15,3%, supported by a 79% rise in traffic and an increase of 1,5 million in active data subscribers to 15,7  million;  the  significant  traffic  growth  was  supported  by ICASA's temporary assignment of high demand spectrum. In the year, the effective data tariff reduced by 35%, due to an increased adoption  of  mobile  broadband  deals,  student  deals  and  SME deals. MTN SA also implemented data price reductions in line with the  agreement  reached  with  the  Competition  Commission (CompCom) and remains committed to ensuring data affordability for its customers.\n\nThe consumer prepaid business continued to deliver pleasing and improving results, especially through H2. Service revenue for the year increased by 2,9%, driven by solid commercial execution of customer value management (CVM) initiatives and enhanced distribution.  Service  revenue  slowed  from  5,7%  in  the  third quarter to 2,5% in the fourth quarter, impacted mainly by the release of loyalty provisions. The consumer postpaid business performed strongly in a highly competitive trading environment, generating solid service revenue growth of 5,3% in the year. This was aided by subscriber growth, well-managed churn and the uptake of Data First offers (Mega Deals campaign). The business has  shown  pleasing  resilience  in  a  challenging  environment, however with South Africa now in the midst of a second wave of COVID-19  infections,  further  macroeconomic  challenges  and pressure on consumers may present some headwinds to the business.\n\nThe enterprise business sustained its progress, achieving growth for the fifth consecutive quarter with service revenue up 14,3% for the year. The business benefited from a record number of\n\ncustomer  additions,  boosted  by  a  surge  in  data  deals  as universities facilitated 'learn from home' initiatives and customers required 'work from home' solutions. Some of the deals were on a short-term basis, leading to a slowdown in the fourth quarter because of university churn.\n\nWholesale revenue declined by 16,4% because of the discontinuation of our roaming agreement with Telkom and the effects of accounting for Cell C revenue on a cash basis. For the year, we recognised R2,0 billion in roaming revenue from Cell C this was up by 10% on the revenue recognised in the previous year. R414 million of Cell C roaming revenue remained unrecognised at December 2020. These payments are anticipated in 2021 upon successful recapitalisation and will be recognised in 2021. MTN SA commenced phase two of the roaming agreement with Cell  C, effective 1 May 2020. The arrangement envisages a three-year transition  towards  a  full  national  roaming  arrangement  under which MTN will carry all of Cell C's network traffic.\n\nMTN SA recorded a solid EBITDA margin of 39,0%, an improvement of  1,7pp,  with  EBITDA  increasing  by  4,5%  YoY.  In  addition  to service revenue growth, the margin performance was supported by  cost  efficiencies  and  channel  optimisation,  reductions  in device volumes, as well as reductions in device subsidies. Based on an assessment of the prevailing macroeconomic environment, we recorded an additional R371 million provision for expected credit losses under IFRS 9.\n\nThe fintech business in SA continued to scale, with 2,5  million registered  users  and  207  000  active  users  at  year-end.  This follows the launch of Mobile Money in South Africa in January 2020. The platform continues to grow transactions driven by innovative and relevant solutions. MTN SA's main focus is around distribution, as well as extending cash-in and cash-out points through both formal and informal channels.\n\nIn the year, our commitment to transformation and improving access to mobile technology across South Africa resulted in the company achieving the significant milestone of level 1 B-BBEE contributor status.\n\nMTN SA continues to deliver and sustain the best network quality in SA on both customer and independent measures. It has been endorsed as the best network by MyBroadband, Tutela, Open Signal  and  P3  for  more  than  three  years  in  a  row.  MTN  SA launched 5G in June 2020 being the first in the MTN Group. We have  over  150  sites  across  several  spectrum  bands  in Johannesburg,  Cape  Town,  Pretoria,  Durban,  Bloemfontein, Centurion, Port Elizabeth and a few towns, with ambitious plans to scale up to more than 1 000 sites upon allocation of 3500MHz high demand spectrum.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was enabled by our expanded customer acquisition touchpoints, rural telephony  initiatives  and  revamped  acquisition  offers.  The suspension of new SIM registration in mid-December did not have a significant impact on voice revenue as we saw an increased level of activity from the existing base.\n\nData revenue rose by 51,7%* for the year, maintaining the positive momentum  from  the  effects  of  COVID-19  lockdowns.  The performance in data was enabled by a combination of increased subscribers,  usage  and  ultimately  traffic,  which  was  in  turn\n\nsupported by increased network capacity and 4G penetration. Data traffic rose by 126,5% and average usage by 64,0%. MTN Nigeria added approximately 8,2 million new smartphones to the network, bringing smartphone penetration to 45,9% of our base, up from 41,9% in 2019.\n\nFintech revenue rose by 27,3%* boosted by airtime lending service, MTN Xtratime. MTN Nigeria expanded its MoMo agent network with the addition of more than 280,000 registered agents during the  year.  This  achievement  was  aided  by  the  conversion  of traditional airtime agents in line with the 'one distribution' strategy. Fintech subscribers increased more than eight-fold to 4,7 million, driving higher transaction volume of approximately 51,5 million and core fintech revenue growth of 28,0%.\n\nThe uptake of digital services continued to gain traction with the revamp  of  MTN  Nigeria's  portfolio  of  digital  products  and services, improved customer journey and increase in the active user  base.  As  a  result,  digital  revenue  recorded  a  growth  of 108,1%*. Active users increased to 2,8 million, from 1,6 million in H1 when the definition was revised (to capture only unique paid subscriptions). This was driven mainly by subscriptions for instant messaging platform, ayoba, which rose by 120,9% to 1,4 million.\n\nEnterprise revenue increased by 0,8%*, supported by growth in revenue  from  devices  and  fixed  connectivity.  The  economic impact of the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly in Q2, led to a decline in the uptake of products and services by the businesses supported by MTN Nigeria. The recovery in H2 was, however, encouraging as restrictions eased and economic activity began to improve. A further uplift in enterprise revenue is anticipated once the USSD pricing dispute is resolved and outstanding fees are recovered from the banks.\n\nDuring the period, MTN Nigeria expanded the scope of its service agreement  with  IHS  Holding  Limited  (IHS)  and  amended  the currency conversion provision for tower services. The changes in the service agreement substantially improve MTN Nigeria's terms and  conditions  for  future  network  expansion.  The  contract adjustment  included  the  movement  of  the  reference  rate  for conversion to Naira from the CBN's official rate to the NAFEX. MTN Nigeria also reviewed the treatment of non-recoverable VAT on lease payments to account for it as an expense over the lease period. These, together with the effects of Naira depreciation, put upward pressure on lease rental costs in the period.\n\nIn addition to this, the combined effect of the 2,5% increase in value-added tax (VAT) and COVID-19-related costs led to a 29,2% increase in operating expenses with knock-on effect on EBITDA. This resulted in the EBITDA margin softening by 3,0pp* to 50,9%* with EBITDA rising by 8,6%*.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMTN's SEAGHA region delivered a healthy performance despite a substantial  downturn  in  economic  activity  resulting  from COVID-19 containment measures. Total subscribers increased by 8,8 million in the year to 57,3 million\n\nMTN Ghana was once again a key driver of the strong performance in SEAGHA, with service revenue growth remaining in the doubledigits (up 16,6%*) driven by improved performances across most revenue curves. Voice revenue (up 8,4%*) was supported by an increase in the number of active subscribers, as well as various CVM  initiatives,  which  helped  to  manage  churn  and  improve usage. The continued robust growth in data revenue (up 21,4%*) was supported by higher active data users and smartphones on the network. The increased usage was partly due to shifts in consumer behaviour amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe growth in MoMo revenue (up 31,3%*) benefited from various promotions  in  the  year,  increased  person-to-person  (P2P) transactional activity and broader penetration of more advanced services  such  as  retail  merchant  payments  and  international remittances.  MTN  Ghana's  EBITDA  margin  improvement  of 2,0pp*  to  52,8%*  resulted  from  ongoing  cost  initiatives  and distribution efficiencies.\n\nMTN Uganda increased service revenue by 9,5%*, with positive growth  delivered  in  most  of  its  revenue  lines  notably,  voice (up  3,9%*),  data  (up  27,8%*)  and  fintech  (up  11,8%*).  MTN Uganda's performance was underpinned by increases in the user base  and  usage,  helped  by  CVM  initiatives.  EBITDA  margin expanded by 2,4pp* to 49,5%*, on higher revenue and effective implementation of cost efficiencies.\n\nThe rest of the SEAGHA portfolio also delivered strong results, with MTN Rwanda and MTN Zambia growing at a double-digit rate. Data growth was strong across all opcos, benefiting from increased traffic resulting in part from the effects of COVID-19. Overall, the SEAGHA portfolio excluding MTN Ghana delivered service revenue growth of 20,9%* for the year, and 24,8%* YoY in Q4. Service revenue continued to grow ahead of costs in most markets,  driving  positive  operating  leverage.  Moving  forward, disclosure of the region will change to reflect the new regional operating structure announced during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  was  supported  by  strong  double-digit  base growth despite the COVID-19 restrictions as well as improved data and fintech activities. Execution of the expense efficiency programme resulted in most WECA opcos improving their EBITDA margins.\n\nMTN C\u00f4te d'Ivoire recorded an increase in service revenue of 8,6%*, supported by net additions of 0,8 million following positive net additions for the eighth month in a row to December. This result  was  also  supported  by  strong  revenue  growth  in  data (up 30,1%*) and fintech (up 16,3%*).

The EBITDA margin declined  by  13,8pp*  to  25,0%*  as  a  result  of  a  material devaluation  in  the  local  currency,  which  put  pressure  on foreign-denominated operational expenditure.\n\nMTN Sudan increased service revenue by 80,8%*, underpinned by growth in voice (up 64,7%*) and data (up 126,3%*) on the back of increase in data bundle prices, active data subscribers and usage.

They use a simplified governance approach in often complex environments as they strive to create and preserve shared value.\n\nMTN is committed to the highest standards of governance, business integrity, ethics and professionalism. Corporate governance is the cornerstone of our business and ensures that we work responsibly as required by the King IV Report.\n\nWe deliver on our belief and ensure the relevance and sustainability of our business by monitoring the macro environment, the availability of appropriate capital inputs and our impact on these, as well as the needs of our stakeholders. All of these inform our strategy. This strategy enables MTN to maintain operational focus, underpinned by good governance, and deliver on our financial targets. Our governance processes ensure that we are a sustainable business and that we create and preserve value for ourselves and our stakeholders.\n\n## Governance in the wake of COVID-19\n\nAs COVID-19 spread, the Board illustrated its leadership  by  actively  engaging  on  the matter and providing the necessary stewardship  to  deal  with  the  related uncertainties and emerging risks as well as\n\nthe opportunities  brought  about  by  the pandemic. It met with management several times to provide direction in managing the situation, taking into account all key stakeholders in all the geographies in which MTN operates. From a governance perspective, we  made  numerous  adjustments  to  enable  the Company to be more agile and take decisions swiftly.\n\nThe health of all our stakeholders was of paramount importance, and therefore MTN heeded calls for social distancing and adhered to all government regulations. The move to entirely virtual meetings, digital signatures and working from home was challenging but necessary.\n\n## New normal\n\nIn addition to health and societal factors, the Board monitored the economic impacts of the pandemic and adjusted  and  enhanced  its  operating  strategies and  governance  processes  to  cope  with  its  effects, while considering the best interests of MTN. The Board believes that MTN is well positioned to overcome the effects of the pandemic.\n\n## Our governance philosophy framework, and ecosystem\n\nThe Board of Directors remains committed to good governance and international standards of best practice. It is committed to ensuring an unequivocal tone at the top that requires a commitment by all directors and employees to the MTN Group values, including that of integrity. More information on our application of the King IV principles is set out in the King IV assessment Report KIV on the website.\n\nThis commitment ensures that MTN monitors and addresses all governance issues within its operating units. Our governance framework facilitates transparency, accountability and sustainability, thereby ensuring success for MTN Group and our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n51\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details of the make-up of the Board and its committees are set out on page 53. The Board is comfortable that it has the requisite skills and experience across its committees to discharge its fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nAs we began 2020, we made a number of changes to the composition of the Board. Some directors, including the Chairman  and  lead  independent  director,  had  stepped down in December 2019. (We reported on these retirements in  our  2019  integrated  report.)  In  April  2020,  we  bade farewell  to  three  other  long-serving  directors,  namely Peter Mageza, Dawn Marole and Koosum Kalyan, all of whom had chaired Board committees.\n\nThe 1 September 2020 saw the departure of Rob Shuter, Group President and Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), who had served since March 2017. The Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO) Ralph Mupita was appointed as the new GCEO effective that date and the Company embarked on a rigorous exercise to fill the GCFO position. In the interim, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board appointed Sugentharen Perumal as Acting GCFO effective 1  September  2020.  Effective  1  April  2021,  Tsholofelo Molefe will take up the GCFO role.\n\nChristine  Ramon,  Chairman  of  the  Audit  Committee, stepped down on 30 September 2020. The Board appointed Sindi Mabaso-Koyana as a director and to assume the role of chair of the Audit Committee with effect from 1 October 2020. Azmi Mikati, who has been a member of the Board since July 2006 has indicated that he will not be available for re-election at the next annual general meeting (AGM).\n\nThe  Board  has  committed  to  fulfilling  the  following responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Delegating the management of MTN to a competent executive management team\n- \u00b7 Ensuring  that  the  management  team  defines  and executes a robust strategy process\n- \u00b7 Ensuring  that  MTN  complies  with  its  MOI  and  with appropriate  laws,  regulations  and  appropriate  best practices\n- \u00b7 Governing disclosures so that stakeholders can assess the performance of the Group\n- \u00b7 Protecting  the  interests  of  MTN's  stakeholders  and ensuring fair, responsible and transparent people practices\n- \u00b7 Overseeing  the  combined  assurance  and  control function  and  ensuring  that  it  informs  management's development and implementation of the strategy\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that innovation remains at the heart of MTN\n\nThe Board is comfortable that it has fulfilled the above responsibilities in the best interests of the Company.\n\n## Committee effectiveness and oversight\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Directors has several Board committees to whom it delegates its authority with the mandate to deal with governance issues and report back to the Board on a quarterly basis. Each committee operates under terms of reference which set out roles and responsibilities, composition and scope of authority. These are reviewed on an annual basis. The operational governance framework and structure has evolved to align with Ambition 2025 being the driving force on how the Company's operational governance should be entrenched to drive effective decision making by Group executives.\n\nIn 2020, following the departure of several directors, the committees were reviewed extensively. The Directors Affairs and Governance Committee and the Risk Management and Compliance Committee were established, replacing the Nominations  Committee  and  the  Risk  Management,  Compliance  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee.  The membership of the committees is carefully considered by the recently constituted Directors Affairs and Governance Committee, taking into account the skills and expertise required for each of them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  model  is  implemented  through  all  subsidiary companies to ensure that value is created for shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of the implementation of combined assurance.\n\nThe  combined  assurance  model  means  there  are numerous lines of defence to identify, prevent and mitigate risks  and  provide  independent  assurance  to  both  the Group Exco and the Board either through the Group Audit Committee or the Group Risk Management and Compliance Committee. The model is implemented as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n02\n\n03\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The details throughout this report give the Board's composition as at 1 April 2021. The Board has a policy evidencing a balance of power, with no individuals yielding unfettered power over the Board as a whole.\n\n## Ethical and effective leadership\n\nThe Board strives to provide effective and ethical leadership to ensure that the Company acts in a responsible manner that will enhance stakeholder value and ensure MTN Group's long-term sustainability. The  directors  understand  that  they  should individually and collectively exercise their fiduciary duties ethically and in good faith and assume collective responsibility for steering the Company and setting its strategic direction.\n\n## Independence of directors\n\nExecutive and non-executive directors The Board is led by an independent Chairman, Mcebisi  Jonas, whose role is separate from that of the Group President and CEO. Most Board members are independent non-executive directors, in line with King IV\u2122 requirements.\n\n\u25cf Independent non-executive \u25cf Non-executive \u25cf Executive 10 1 2 A  lead  independent  director  (LID),  Khotso  Mokhele,  considers, reviews,  evaluates  and  provides  oversight  over  related-party transactions and ensures transactions are fair and in the best interests of MTN. The LID is also appointed to guide the Board should a situation arise where the Chairman is not available or may have a conflict of interest.\n\nExecutive and non-executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diverse set of skills\n\nThe areas identified through our skills assessment process as requiring strengthening are in the digital and fintech space, as well as sustainability. Accordingly, the Board will work to attract and retain more directors with those skills, which are aligned to MTN's growth trajectory.\n\nIn 2021 and beyond, MTN intends to cascade its diversity and transformation  imperatives  to  operating  entities  in  a  phased approach that will ensure that diversity is embedded throughout the opco boards. To enhance the Board's effectiveness, and in keeping with MTN's growth trajectory, the Board wishes to retain additional skills and expertise in the digital and fintech sectors. This is a key focus for the Board.\n\n## Gender and diversity\n\nMTN has a policy on broad Board diversity and understands that the  diverse perspectives of directors allow for proper strategic oversight as well as robust deliberation during Board meetings. Therefore, it has always been the intention of the Board to focus on its diversity and transformation imperatives. This would include broad diversity such as improving the representation of women on the Board and ensuring that an acceptable number of all races/ ages and skills are represented on the Board.\n\nHaving a competent and experienced black African CEO has been a step in the right direction towards MTN's diversity imperatives.\n\nThe Company has also been focused on attracting capable and experienced women to the Board.\n\n## Race\n\nMaintain a mix of race and cultures representing the stakeholders in the various communities who interact with the Company. MTN target is to maintain 50% of historically disadvantaged members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender\n\nTherefore, it has always been the intention of the Board to focus on diversity and the aim is to have at least four women on the Board. The appointment of Sindi  Mabaso-Koyana has been an achievement in this regard. Sindi's appointment also addresses the  directives  from  the  B-BBEE  Commission  to  include  an independent representative of our B-BBEE shareholders.\n\nIn addition to Sindi's appointment, the Company has announced that it has also appointed three other women to the Board. This is as a result of the finalisation of the GCFO recruitment process which has seen the appointment of Tsholofelo Molefe effective in April 2021. The Company has also appointed Nosipho Molope and  Noluthando Gosa as new independent directors, effective 1 April 2021.\n\n## Nationality\n\nPromote an appropriate balance in the views of the Board and to improve the representation of women at MTN. The target is to maintain a minimum of four female Board directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolicit ideas from various parts of the world and provide the Board with a contemporary and global perspective and MTN maintains an appropriate mix of nationalities.\n\n## Age distribution and tenure\n\nTenure of non-executives Ensure that there is an appropriate mix of institutional knowledge and experience and fresh new perspectives. If > nine years on the Board, MTN reviews every year and presents to the shareholders at the AGM for re-election.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Age distribution\n\nEnsure that there is a young and dynamic leadership to complement the experience and institutional knowledge of the seasoned directors.

This is to assess the skills and competencies of individual directors and the efficacy of the Board as a whole on elements that include ethical and effective leadership and culture.\n\nIn 2020, international governance institution IMD performed an external Board evaluation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Board  evaluation,  conducted  by  IMD,  provided confirmation that the MTN Group Board has considerable strengths that serve as a solid basis upon which to build and  leverage,  including  integrity,  diversity,  industry expertise  and  the  high  level  of  commitment  from  its directors.\n\nThe  evaluation  highlighted  a  few  observations  and findings.  MTN  believes  that  effectively  communicating these findings indicates MTN's maturity and commitment to embracing a culture of transparency and accountability.\n\n## People\n\nComposition: The Board is composed of members with strong overall knowledge of the industry and technical expertise,  while  the  Board's  overall  skill  coverage  was considered  strong,  it  was  perceived  as  concentrated, notably in the areas of finance and telecom. It was found that the expertise in fintech, digital and regulatory are potential areas to strengthen the Board's composition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board is looking to retain more skills in the area of fintech and digital.\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\nDiversity: The  quality  of  the  MTN  Group's  Board  is enhanced  by  its  diversity  in  terms  of  professional background, personality and opinion, however gender diversity should continue to be an area of focus, and has demonstrated impact in several important areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the addition of four female directors, in the recent months, the Board is already addressing diversity to a large extent and will continue to review other factors pertaining to diversity.\n\n## Structure\n\nOverall,  there  is  a  perception  that  the  current  roles (scope),  structure  (committees)  and  processes  of  the Board are well aligned with its responsibilities, however moving with the key strategic areas for MTN, more focus will be placed on upskilling directors on ESG and climate change  priorities.  A  technological  committee  on  the Board  should  also  be  considered,  since  technological discussions would benefit from greater focus and more systematic coverage of specific topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis work is already in progress with ESG issues  being  placed  at  the  core  of  the strategy and technology discussions being elevated at Board level for review and discussion. In addition, the Board will be upskilled on various technology-related topics.\n\n## Processes\n\n## Strategy process\n\nThe Board's strategic capability was assessed as strong, with a solid ability to set the strategic direction for the organisation. To enhance the process, the Board needs to build a more systematic way of monitoring execution, with a strong focus on strategic alignment among the Group Board and the subsidiary boards.\n\nSubsidiary  Governance: There  is  a  need  for  greater understanding of the governance challenges of each of MTN's top subsidiary boards. The degree of coordination and congruence of the Group Board and its operating company boards could also be further enhanced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group has designed greater opportunities for interactions between the members  of  the  Group  Board  and  the subsidiary boards to increase exchange across the Group  with  the  introduction  of  the  Chairmen's Engagement  Forum  and  the  strengthening  of existing  committee  workshops  between  Group Board members and subsidiary board members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board recognises that in order to remain effective, it must induct, develop and change its members from time to time to suit the Company's needs. Accordingly, the Group Company  Secretariat  has  a  structured  induction  and development programme that seeks to equip new directors with understanding of the strategy and the complexities of the  business.  The  programme  also  includes  ongoing training for all directors on various matters related to their role to assist them to act with due care, skill and diligence. In 2020, we onboarded one new director and Chairman.\n\nBy keeping informed of developments in the business and global trends, directors are able to exercise courage in taking appropriate risks and capturing opportunities in a responsible manner and in the best interests of MTN Group.\n\nIn 2020, directors adapted well to virtual instead of faceto-face meetings, but this did not compromise the quality of the programmes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each Board meeting follows an agenda that has been set and agreed by the Chairman, CEO and Company Secretary with documents for discussion loaded on a Board pack platform for previewing. Meeting discussions are usually around the current performance, risks and opportunities, governance updates and regulatory matters for consideration, as well as in-depth discussions around execution of the strategy. During the year there were five special Board meetings, one Board strategy session and one budget discussion meeting. The meetings were well attended by Board members.\n\n## Strategic direction\n\nThe Board held its annual strategy sessions in April and July 2020, where it applied its mind and constructively interrogated proposals presented by management. The COVID-19 pandemic was central to the deliberations. It was clear that there was a need to focus not only on managing the risks of COVID-19, and assisting those in our markets, but to also consider the opportunities created by accelerated digitalisation.\n\nStrategy sessions are an important part of the Board's annual workplan and give direction to the Company's long-term and mid-term strategy. More information on the approved strategy is set out on page 10.\n\nBelow is a summary of Board focus areas in 2020. As previously announced, one of the Board's key focus areas in 2020 was the Asset Realisation Programme, which aims to reduce debt, simplify MTN's portfolio, reduce risk, improve returns and realise capital of at least R25 billion over three years.\n\nIn addition, the Board also considered the plans and granted its authority to management to divest the Middle East assets, as well exploring the opportunities to expand into other parts of the African continent in markets such as Tanzania and Ethiopia.\n\n## Q1\n\n- \u00b7 Approved the 2019 AFS, Integrated Report and notice of AGM.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the Group's performance and key priorities.\n- \u00b7 Declared final dividend.\n- \u00b7 Approved Board charter and committees' terms of reference.\n\nQ2\n\n- \u00b7 Approved the COVID-19 strategy and proposed implementation.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the Group's performance and key priorities.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and approved ARP.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed ESG matters, including sustainability reporting and climate change approach.\n\nQ3\n\n- \u00b7 Approved interim financial results.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and approved MTN Group strategy.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the Group's performance and key priorities.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed COVID-19 management.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed implementation of localisation plan.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed ARP and portfolio review.\n\nQ4\n\n- \u00b7 Approved the budget and strategic business plan.\n- \u00b7 Approved appointments to the Board.\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Governance in action continued\n\n## Focus on ESG - ESG at the core\n\nIn 2020, MTN  made  considerable  strides  in better understanding the matters pertaining to sustainability and in ensuring that ESG matters are carefully considered in respect of the way the Group operates. The strategic repositioning reflects this - we adopted 'create shared value' as a strategic priority, a vital enabler of which is 'ESG at the core'.\n\nThe Board took part in training from the JSE Limited on ESG matters, aiming to assist management in better connecting with global ESG issues linked to the day-to-day operations, strategy  and  risk  profile  of  the  Group.  An  important development  in  this  respect  was  the  appointment  of  the Chairman of the Social and Ethics Committee as the Climate Change Director for the Group.\n\nA  significant  ESG  milestone  was  the  publishing  of  MTN Group's first Transparency Report in October 2020, which was well received. This is in addition to the Group's annual Sustainability Report, which is published every year in March.\n\nThe  Board  has  identified  strategic  areas  in  MTN's  ESG credentials which can be improved upon by focusing on the Group's  approved  ESG  framework,  with  clearly  defined priorities  and  target  dates.  This  work  is  ongoing  and  will progress in 2021.\n\nMTN  deems  ESG  management  and  performance  as  an opportunity to implement our vision of creating shared value for all stakeholders through responsible economic, environmental and social practices. MTN's ESG performance is  rated  by  several  firms  and  is  an  important  proxy  for stakeholders  regarding  MTN's  management  of  key  ESG topics, including sector-specific matters. During 2020, MTN established a baseline across priority firms that rate MTN's ESG performance, with the aim of developing an action plan to improve our rating in the coming years. MTN's latest scores across these firms are presented below in relation to peer or industry  performance.  As  a  critical  step  to  ensuring  its progress in the Group, improvement in ESG has been added as a KPI for the Group CEO.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about\n\nMTN\n\nHow we\n\ncreate value\n\nStrategic and\n\nfinancial review\n\nGovernance and\n\nremuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was important to make the change and enhance the way we communicate with our shareholders, within the perimeters of the Companies Act.\n\nHeld on 21 May 2020, overall, the AGM was a success but there were also learnings to implement at the next AGM. There is no doubt that such virtual meetings will continue and we will work on those areas that require improvement.\n\n## Governance roadshow\n\nIn  May  2020,  the  Company  held  a  virtual  governance roadshow  with  shareholders  to  discuss  -  among  other matters - the 2020 AGM notice and to respond to broader governance concerns.\n\nGroup  Chairman  Mcebisi  Jonas  and  Khotso  Mokhele,  the Chairman  of  the  Remuneration  Committee  and  Lead Independent  Director,  attended  the  roadshow.  We  were delighted with the broad participation of shareholders. The interactions were constructive and the feedback was well received. We expect to continue to conduct a governance roadshow annually.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nMTN recognises that the management of conflicts of interest is of high importance in promoting ethical conduct and in protecting the integrity of MTN decision-making processes.\n\nAccordingly, directors and employees are encouraged to act in a responsible and ethical manner, taking into consideration MTN Group's best interests. They are required to complete a declaration of any declarable interest at the start of each year.\n\nFollowing the revision of the conflicts of interest policy in 2019, in 2020 the focus was on embedding the policy throughout the Group, with the Board and management setting the tone from the top.\n\nThe policy provides guidance and mechanisms for the identification of conflicts of interest and provides measures for the disclosure, mitigation and/or management of such conflicts. The policy also regulates the relationship between MTN and its employees, directors, suppliers and service providers.\n\nThere has been significant improvement in the understanding of the process: this has been as a result of the awareness created with the MTN Conduct Passport and the guidance framework provided to employees and rolled out in all operations. https://www.mtn.com/sustainability/our-positions/\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n## Group Secretary\n\nThe Board is assisted by a competent and suitably qualified Group Company Secretary, Thobeka Sishuba Bonoyi.\n\nThe  Group  Company  Secretary  has  an  arm's  length relationship with the Board. Her performance is assessed on an annual basis. Following her assessment in 2020, the Board is satisfied that she has the competency, qualifications and experience  to  provide  the  Board  with  sound  governance advisory and stewardship assistance.\n\nTo  align  with  the  renewed  strategy,  the  Group  Company Secretariat  function  is  re-evaluating  and  improving  its operating  model  across  the  Group  to  ensure  that  the department is fit for purpose, independent and adequately resourced.\n\n## Board appointments\n\nAll our Board appointments for 2020 were conducted through a formal and transparent process, guided by an approved policy and  assisted  by  the  Directors  and  Corporate Governance Affairs Committee in consultation with the Group Secretary.\n\nThe  Director  Appointment  Policy  includes  the  criteria  for appointments and also considers the diversity imperatives for the Company.\n\nThe appointments will be subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM to be held in May 2021.\n\n58\n\n## Directors' dealings\n\nIn  keeping  up  with  good  corporate  governance  practices, MTN strives to protect the organisation and its representations by setting out key share dealing processes. MTN must further ensure that these processes are not only watertight, but they must also be transparent. MTN has a policy that enforces closed periods, during which trading in MTN Group shares by directors, senior executives and employees is prohibited. The closed periods run from the end of the interim and annual reporting periods until the financial results are disclosed on SENS.  All  directors  trading  in  shares  require  the  prior approval of the Chairman of the Board.",

We defined prescribed officers as those who exercise general executive control over and management of the whole, or a significant portion, of the business and activities of the Company; or those who regularly participate to a material degree, in the exercise of general executive control over and management of the whole, or a significant portion, of the business and activities of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group changes:\n\nEbenezer Asante became VP for WECA effective from 1 January 2021; Yolanda Cuba was appointed VP for SEA, effective 1 January 2021; Serigne Dioum assumed the role of Group Chief Digital and Fintech Officer, joining Exco on 1 January 2021; Kholekile Ndamase was appointed Group Chief M&A and Business Development Officer, joining Exco on 1 January 2021; Karl Toriola became MTN Nigeria CEO effective 1 March 2021; and Ferdi Moolman assumed the new role of MTN Group Chief Risk Officer on 1 March 2021.\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending to the Board critical strategic remuneration decisions.\n\nIn ensuring fair and responsible remuneration by the Group, the  committee  comprises  six  independent  non-executive directors (NED). The collective skills and experience profile of the Group  Remuneration  Committee  members  includes telecommunications, finance, managing businesses in Africa and  the  Middle  East,  human  capital,  remuneration  and  risk management.\n\n- *  Copyright and trademarks are owned by the Institute of Directors South Africa NPC and all of its rights are reserved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have also put a lot of work into ensuring our shareholders' concerns regarding remuneration and disclosures are appropriately addressed.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  onset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  created unprecedented uncertainty, impacting lives and livelihoods globally. From early 2020, our focus has been to safeguard the  health  and  wellbeing  of  our  employees  and  their families, while managing the economic and operational challenges facing our business.\n\nIn protecting our employees, multiple interventions across our footprint were implemented, including driving awareness  of  the  pandemic.  We  also  established  a COVID-19 relief fund to provide support for staff who were impacted  by  the  pandemic  and  required  financial assistance.\n\nIt has been a challenging year for the committee, managing the risks and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also placed a big focus on appropriately addressing the remuneration-related concerns of our shareholders.\n\n| Members          | Attendance at applicable  meetings   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Mcebisi Jonas    | 4/4                                  |\n| Khotso Mokhele   | 4/4                                  |\n| Swazi Tshabalala | 3/4                                  |\n| Nkululeko Sowazi | 4/4                                  |\n| Vincent Rague    | 4/4                                  |\n| Azmi Mikati      | 4/4                                  |\n\nCOVID-19 relief funds amounting to R21,8 million were raised through the generous voluntary contributions of our staff across the Group, Group Executive members and Group  Board  Directors.  The  contribution  from  Group Board and Group Exco members amounted to R8,7 million.\n\nIn addition, as it became evident that ordinary workplace practices were no longer practical, we approved and fully supported flexible and remote work options for employees as applicable and within limits to ensure that essential infrastructure services remained running.\n\n## Business performance\n\nFrom a business perspective, our Group results highlighted resilient performance in difficult trading conditions during the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThese  results  were  achieved  against  the  backdrop  of unprecedented  volatility  due  to  COVID-19  as  well  as ongoing flux in our regulatory and legal environments. Notwithstanding  the  challenges,  MTN  continued  to progress in driving further digital and financial inclusion, guided by our belief that everyone deserves the benefits of a modern connected life.\n\n## Performance, reward and culture\n\nBeyond the business performance, our consistent engagements  with  employees  through  various  online platforms bore fruit as reflected in the positive sentiments expressed through the global culture audit (GCA) results. We  achieved  our  highest  ever  perception  ratings  from employees mainly in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable engagement score: 81 percentage points (pp) (improvement of 1pp from previous year; and 2pp higher than the Global Telco benchmarks)\n- \u00b7 Pay & benefits score: 53pp (improvement of 1pp from previous year; reduced gap to 3pp from Global Telco norm)\n- \u00b7 NPS  for  MTN  as  a  great  place  to  work: +41% (Improvement of 14pp from previous year)\n- \u00b7 Employee experience of STI: 2,46 out of 4 (improvement of 1% from the previous year)\n\nManaging staff costs was a particular focus of the business during  2020,  in  light  of  COVID-19  effects.  We  therefore struck a balance between maintaining annual escalations within reasonable ranges, and ensuring that our people are rewarded for their hard work and dedication. No increases were awarded to Group Executive directors, and Group Exco members forfeited their increases.\n\nPaying for performance remained at the core of the Group's philosophy, within the context of business performance. The Board was satisfied with the business financial performance. As a result, the following incentives were declared:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term incentive (STI) - we declared a performance bonus to all of our operations.\n- \u00b7 Long-term incentive (LTI) - the Board approved the performance assessment of the conditions linked to the share allocation made in December 2017. Although the Group share price remained under pressure, resulting in nil achievement  of  total  shareholder  return  (TSR) against the MSCI EM comparator group, satisfactory performance was achieved on cash flow and capital returns i.e. return on average capital employed (ROACE). Overall,  we  achieved  75%  performance  settlement, compared to 25% in the prior year vesting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we\n\ncreate value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report continued\n\n## Shareholder engagements\n\nThe Remuneration Committee (Remco) took heed of the comments, inputs and feedback from various shareholder institutions  received  in  the  2020  AGM  and  from  other investor engagements undertaken during the year.\n\nAs we did not receive the minimum 75% of votes in favour of our remuneration policy and implementation report, we responded by engaging openly with our shareholders on the concerns and feedback. In addition to the Governance roadshow held on 7, 8 and 12 May 2020 - during which the Group  Chairman  and  LID  interacted  with  13  of  MTN's largest institutional shareholders - we also held a follow up meeting on 20 August 2020 that had been announced on the JSE SENS. Over and above discussing the 2020 AGM  notice  and  broader  governance  issues,  the engagements were aimed at identifying any gaps in our remuneration design and disclosures, in order to enhance our remuneration reporting and implementation.\n\nMTN regularly reviews and, where feasible, adopts best practices  and  responsible  remuneration  governance based on local and global benchmarking and research. Aided  by  these  engagements  with  shareholders,  I  am pleased to report the following enhancements to some of our remuneration elements and policy:\n\n- (i) Effective  from  1  January  2021,  we  introduced  the minimum shareholding requirement (MSR) standards for members of the Group Exco.\n- (ii)  While the  malus  and  clawback  provisions  were introduced to our LTI scheme in 2017, we have now introduced similar provisions for our STI scheme as well.\n- (iii) We revised our LTI performance share plan condition by replacing the return on average capital employed (ROACE) with return on equity (ROE), which is aligned with our medium-term guidance framework.\n- (iv) Effective  from  2021,  we  redefined  our  STI  revenue performance  condition  to  be  measured  on  service revenue, which is aligned with targets provided in our medium-term guidance framework.\n- (v)  Effective from the December 2020 share allocation, we excluded the non-performance-based retention element as a condition under the performance share plan for our Group Exco members.\n- (vi) Disclosure enhancements  were  made  on  nonexecutive director (NED) fees and general executive remuneration benchmarking.\n\n(vii) We have increased disclosure detail on both STI and LTI payments by providing a retroactive breakdown of the goals, the achievements against these goals and corresponding payments linked to these goals.\n\nFurther  details  of  these  improvements  are  provided  on pages 68 and 69 of this report.\n\nThe committee is positive that these changes will go a long way to improve shareholder sentiments on remuneration policy,  decision-making  and  implementation.  We  remain committed  to  pursuing  continuous  improvement  and innovation in our reward practices as we navigate 2021.\n\nI further wish to give an outline of the key people outcomes for the year.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nThe representation of women in the broader business as well as senior leadership is a key focus of the committee and the Board. On this front, we have made steady progress at MTN in recent years and women, made up 51% of all MTN company recruits and 58% of the graduates employed in 2020.\n\nWithin our senior management leadership, the representation of women in the top roles (Exco) improved by 19pp to 27%, from 8% in 2018. This figure rises to 29%, with the inclusion of our  new  GCFO.  In  our  recruitment,  we  actively  pursue improvements in women representation as we strive towards our target.\n\n## Leadership\n\nTo support the Group's strategy execution, we announced the following appointments:\n\n- \u00b7 Tsholofelo  Molefe  was  appointed  as  the  new  GCFO effective 1 April 2021.\n- \u00b7 Ebenezer  Asante  was  appointed  the  WECA  VicePresident, effective 01 January 2021.\n- \u00b7 Yolanda Cuba was appointed as the SEA Vice-President, effective 1 January 2021.\n- \u00b7 Serigne Dioum was appointed as the Group Chief Digital and Fintech Officer, effective 1 January 2021.\n- \u00b7 Kholekile Ndamase was appointed as the Group Chief Mergers and Acquisitions and Business Development Officer, effective 1 January 2021.\n\nThese executive changes followed the prior announcement of Ralph Mupita's appointment as Group President and CEO, Karl Toriola as CEO designate of MTN Nigeria, and Ferdi Moolman's as Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n## 2020 pay reviews\n\nFor 2020 pay reviews, we approved 0% increase for executive directors. For non-executive management, an average of 2.5% was approved and for non-management employees an average of 4% was approved. Expatriate employees were allotted 1,11% increase and no increase was awarded for NED  fees  except  for  those  below  the  median  who  were adjusted to the median.\n\nThese decisions were not only aligned to our remuneration philosophy but also cognisant of the expectations of our many stakeholders to manage remuneration cautiously amid COVID-19.\n\n## 2020 STI outcomes\n\nThe  Board  was  satisfied  with  the  2020  performance outcomes.  As  such,  performance  bonuses  were  paid across  all  operations.  Below  highlights  the  Company performance outcomes used to determine the bonuses paid to Group employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Refer to page 78 for details of the awards' conditions for year under review.\n- \u00b7 The proposal from shareholders to disclose performance conditions ex-ante (before the fact) was investigated through the benchmarking of other top JSE-listed companies. The committee found that this was not common practice and resolved that disclosing actual budgets and performance targets presents the risk of publicly disclosing sensitive strategic information.\n- \u00b7 In order to enhance disclosure and transparency on performance against targets, however, the committee resolved that performance conditions would be disclosed ex-post (after the fact) as this information would then be publicly available. Therefore:\n- - For LTIs, once shares are vested, we now disclose the actual three-year budget, the performance against budget and remuneration thereof paid to executives; and\n- - For the STI scheme, we will disclose the broader company performance achievements and corresponding hurdles and remuneration paid thereof.\n\n## Refer to pages 74 and 78 for more details.\n\n- \u00b7 This proposal was considered good practice and found to be common among other companies benchmarked in our research.\n- \u00b7 The committee resolved to replace the ROACE metric in the LTI PSP scheme with the ROE metric.\n- \u00b7 Refer to page 78 for details of share allocation conditions made in December 2020.\n- \u00b7 This concern was noted by the committee who resolved to replace the bundled voting methodology with an unbundled voting methodology in the proxy voting.\n- \u00b7 We wish to clarify that the fee structure on page 82, disclosing both rand and other currencies, is done to accommodate instances where the Company appoints either local or international NEDs. In such circumstances, this approach minimises the need to conduct benchmarks and set fees at each appointment. Each director can only be remunerated under one of the currencies and not both.\n- \u00b7 To attract international NEDs of the calibre required by MTN, an attractive comparable fee payable to international NEDs as benchmarked against international NEDs at local and foreign peer companies is taken. This differentiation, combined with the conversion to rand, however, may present a different impression.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n02\n\n03\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its primary purpose is providing global and/or sector-specific perspectives that may enrich the perspectives of the Group and enhance the manner that it conducts its business and in its interactions with its stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The IAB's role is not intended to be congruent to the role of the Group Board and therefore the remuneration of the IAB members is not comparable to that of the Group Board. Its remuneration is nonetheless based on international benchmark standards of advisory bodies acting in a capacity similar to that of the IAB.\n- \u00b7 Whereas the malus and clawback provisions had been in place for the LTI PSP scheme since 2017, it did not apply to STI awards.\n- \u00b7 The committee approved that these provisions be extended to the STI performance bonus effective for the 2021 plan. A revised policy was approved by the Board. On departure, CEOs will equally be subjected to the malus and clawback provisions.\n- \u00b7 Remco reviewed and recommended to the Board for approval the adoption of the MSR for Group Exco members effective from 1 January 2021.\n- \u00b7 Pursuant to this, the MTN Group Board resolved that the adoption of the MSR for Group Exco members, effective from 1 January 2021, be approved and spread over a period of five years as follows:\n- - Group CEO 250% of annual package\n- - Group CFO 175% of annual package and\n- - Other Group Exco members 150% of annual package.\n- \u00b7 There were no specific changes to the reporting of the details of the pay mix. However, MTN will review its reporting standards and improve on the reporting of the pay mix going forward.\n- \u00b7 MTN maintains targeting the 50th percentile of market data as part of its review of executive and employee pay on a periodic basis. Any anomalies are reviewed, and any required action/s taken through internal salary review processes.\n- \u00b7 We use the information obtained from the Company's approved survey providers to obtain benchmark information.\n- \u00b7 In light of Rob Shuter's move to British Telecom in 2021, MTN reviewed the terms of his contractual restraint of trade agreement. We believe that his future employment will not violate any of these terms, thus there will be no need for any compensation.\n- \u00b7 In addition, Rob was placed on 'garden leave' from 1 September 2020 to 12 March 2021, further reducing any risk posed to MTN, its employees, customers and suppliers.\n- \u00b7 The committee has commenced research on this issue, including benchmarking of its prevalence amongst the top JSE listed companies. This work is ongoing and will include a report to be presented to the Board for consideration.\n- \u00b7 Once this work is completed, the committee will consider it along with its recommendations and pave a way forward which will be duly communicated with shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n02\n\n03\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  2020,  we  approved the  following  key  remuneration  decision  and  policy developments:\n\n## Policies and governance\n\nThe Board approved 17 Group HR policies in 2020, including reviewing and approving the revised acting, sales incentive, performance  bonus,  malus  and  clawback,  minimum shareholder  requirements,  recognition  and  workplace flexibility policy in response to the evolving world of work.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\nWe approved the grant of shares under the performance share plan for employees at managerial level and above. Allocations  were  made  under  the  revised  performance conditions where retention was excluded for Group Exco and ROE replaced the ROACE metric.\n\nThe grant of shares under the employee share ownership plan  (ESOP)  to  nominated  designated  employees  was also approved.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nIn 2017, MTN adopted malus and clawback principles for its performance share plan (PSP) scheme. This policy has now been approved by the MTN Board to be extended and applicable to all employees participating under all MTN's long-term incentive schemes and its short-term incentive performance  bonus  scheme  effective  from  the  2020 financial year.\n\nMalus and/or clawback will be instituted for a trigger event during  a  participant's  employment  and  remains  legally enforceable even after the participant has left the employ of the Company for a period not exceeding ten (10) years from the date of settlement, payment or vesting, as may be applicable.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirements\n\nThe  Board  approved  the  implementation  of  minimum shareholding requirements for Group directors (CEO and CFO) and other members of Group Exco based on the following percentages spread over a period of five years:\n\n- \u00b7 Group CEO 250% of annual package;\n- \u00b7 Group CFO 175% of annual package; and\n- \u00b7 Other Group Exco members 150% of annual package.\n\n## Independent external advisers\n\nAll strategic reward decisions are prepared and guided by our executive management team for approval by the Group Remco. The committee has delegated approval authority at various levels, with its roles and responsibilities. The Remco contracted the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for independent external advice. The committee is satisfied with its independence and objectivity.\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about MTN\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn response to the pandemic, MTN established multiple interventions  across  its  operations.  These  not  only provided financial support but also included programmes to support the wellbeing and safety of employees  and  their  families.  Among  the  many initiatives, MTN implemented the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Established  a  global  staff  care  fund,  funded  by voluntary staff donations, for the benefit of employees in need. Contributions amounting to over R21m were received  from  employees,  executives  and  NEDs. Included in these contributions were salary forfeitures amongst executive and employees.\n- \u00b7 The Company amended certain benefits to enable employees  to  purchase  PPE  and  home  office equipment in supporting and facilitating work-fromhome.\n- \u00b7 At  the  beginning  of  the  lockdown,  around  March 2020,  MTN  immediately  extended  its  work-fromhome  flexibility  programme  across  its  footprint. Alongside this option, in South Africa, MTN increased its data allocation to employees from 30GB to 50GB a month.\n- \u00b7 During the lockdown period, when there was limited movement for sales employees in particular, MTN provisionally revised its sales commission targets for  lower-level  sales  employees  and  reallocated work  schedules  to  ensure  employees  focused  on keeping its core operations functioning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The competitive talent landscape demands a differentiated reward system, capable of competitively matching pay to performance, delivering fairly without bias, and is flexible yet compliant across all markets.\n\nIn aligning with the recommendations of King IV, we aim to continue disclosing the main provisions of our remuneration policies including how such remuneration was earned by prescribed officers and NEDs as defined by the Companies Act. In terms of the Act, a prescribed officer is a person, who:\n\n- (a) exercises general executive control over and management of the whole, or a significant portion, of the business and activities of the Company; or\n- (b) regularly participates to a material degree in the exercise of general executive control over and management of the whole, or a significant portion, of the business and activities of a company.\n\nOur various remuneration policies approved by executive leadership and governed by our Group Remco, guide the decision-making processes and operationalising of all reward matters. It is our intent to deliver a legislatively compliant system aligned with the strategic objectives of the Company.\n\nWe review salaries annually with the aim of remunerating employees competitively within the appropriate occupational ranges and benchmarks. This philosophy is applicable to executive management and other employees against the national and telecommunications industry standards. This guides us in establishing market-related salary benchmarks and maintaining our competitiveness in the market with regards to the remuneration and benefits value proposition.\n\nAligned to the principle of fair and responsible remuneration, we continuously assess the congruence of internal pay differentials, particularly with respect to gender and race, and implementing measures to correct identified anomalies.\n\nFor our NEDs, we consider several factors when determining fair and equitable remuneration. These included the size of the organisation, the industry and complexity of the business, the number of meetings the NED is expected to attend, the time commitment required of the NED as well as the level of experience, skill and knowledge the NED brings to the Board. Further principles governing NED remuneration may be found on page 81.\n\nOur remuneration philosophy and policies are supported by both external market surveys and internal pay data gleaned from our annual human resource budget reviews. This enables us to evaluate internal and external parity, employee performance, knowledge, skills, experience and business affordability to reach an appropriate remuneration figure. We continually review staff costs-to-revenue ratios and the alignment of each opco to approved budgeted ratios. For those markets with hyperinflationary economies this has proved to be challenging and remained an area of focus in 2020.\n\nAssessed against King IV and the amended Listings Requirements, the remuneration policy is based on the following principles:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFair and responsible remuneration\n\nMTN aims to ensure that remuneration provided to all employees is internally equitable and externally competitive. All elements of pay are influenced by market survey data and internal pay comparisons. Ensuring fair pay is based on the value of the job relative to other jobs of similar worth, this is aligned to the principle of responsible, fair and equal pay. We regularly review and benchmark our reward components using performance and level of work as a basis for differentiation and the basis for employee reward.\n\nAn enabler of business strategic objectives\n\nMTN's strategic objectives and our performance-based system through our short and long-term incentives are linked to achieving defined performance measures consistent with shareholder expectations over the short and long term. Both short and long-term incentive plans provide motivation for the achievement of positive outcomes measured using a balanced approach combining both financial and non-financial metrics measured across company, team and individual performance.\n\nStrengthen the culture and core values\n\nAttract, motivate, reward and retain our human capital\n\nOur optimal pay structure comprises fixed and variable remuneration to drive the right focus both in the short and long term. We remain competitive on both elements and create a balanced fixed and variable remuneration providing a fair composition for each position. The ratio of fixed to variable differs, with the weighting of variable pay for executive employees being greater. Our pay mix ensures we deliver an effective performance-based reward system where the achievement of stretch targets is remunerated.\n\nTransparent, consistent remuneration\n\nWe promote transparent and simplified communication across all levels including external stakeholders and consistency across  all operating units; acknowledging differentiation and customisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are a values-based and output-driven organisation. Recognising actions aligned to our vital behaviours is critical to our success.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For each executive, company performance (CP) and team performance (TP) elements (A) are used as inputs to a bonus calculation.\n- 2. Targets for each element are set at the beginning of the performance cycle and measured at the end of the performance cycle where a corresponding 'nominal/multiplier %' is determined.\n- 3. Company performance as a 'qualifier' for bonus declaration is first assessed for each operation.\n- 4. For each weighted element, there is a job level related on-target and maximum earning potential.\n\nUpon assessment of company performance by the Board, a bonus is either declared or not. If declared:\n\n- \u00b7 Step 1: For each element (CP/TP), an on-target bonus amount is calculated as follows: On-target bonus (D) = Annual fixed package (A) x On-target % (B) x Element weighting (C).\n\n## Example for the CEO (illustrative purposes only)\n\n- \u00b7 Annual fixed package (A): R10m\n- \u00b7 On-target bonus % (B): 100%\n- \u00b7 Element weighting (C):\n- -CP (70%),\n- -TP (30%)\n- \u00b7 Actual performance: CP (100%); TP (110%)\n- \u00b7 Bonus multiplier: CP (100%) TP (200%)\n\n## Calculating bonus at target per performance element In respect of company performance\n\nTable on the next pages illustrates the above.\n\n| Annual fixed   package         |                                | On-target   bonus %            | Company performance  weighting %   | On-target bonus  amount        |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| (A)                            | X                              | (B)                            | (C)                                | = (D)                          |\n| R10m                           |                                | 100%                           | 70%                                | R7m                            |\n| In respect of team performance | In respect of team performance | In respect of team performance | In respect of team performance     | In respect of team performance |\n| Annual fixed  package          |                                | On-target   bonus %            | Company performance  weighting %   | On-target bonus  amount        |\n| (A)                            | X                              | (B)                            | (C)                                | = (D)                          |\n| R10m                           |                                | 100%                           | 30%                                | R3m                            |\n\n- \u00b7 Step 2: Actual performance for each element is measured to determine a bonus nominal/multiplier percentage.\n\n| Element             | Actual score      | Multiplier             |\n|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Company performance | (Range: 0 - 110%) | 100% (Range: 0 - 200%) |\n| Team performance    | (Range: 0 - 120%) | 200% (Range: 0 - 200%) |\n\n- \u00b7 Step 3: The total bonus payable will be the on-target bonus amount per element times the element multiplier.

This aims to support and drive the long-term sustainability and performance of the Group. Annual allocations are made based on a multiple of the fixed package which would generally vest after three years.\n\nPerformance would be adjudicated three years after the allocation based on four elements:\n\n- 1. Total shareholder return of MTN viewed against the MSCI Emerging Market Index.\n- 2. Cumulative operating free cash flows over three years against the approved budget for each year.\n- 3. Return on average capital employed (changed to ROE with effect from the December 2020 allocation).\n- 4. Retention element (only applicable to non-group Exco employees).\n- 5. Combination of Black economic empowerment (BEE) and compliance with South African transformation legislation. (This applies to the Group President and CEO and Group COO only).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n02\n\n03\n\nHow we create value\n\nStrategic and financial review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This supports the alignment of strategy and desired individual behaviour. The mix is aimed at ensuring that executives proportionately achieve  an  optimal  balance  of  remuneration  when executing their duties.\n\nThis  pay  mix  varies  with  seniority,  with  an  increasing element  of  variable  pay  at  senior  levels.  The  Group President and CEO and Exco members have the largest proportion  of  total  annual  package  being  subject  to performance  conditions.  This  is  intended  to  create  a significant degree of alignment with shareholder interests, with the aim of driving sustainable value creation over a longer-term period.\n\nKing  IV  recommends  the  disclosure  of  remuneration elements offered in the organisation and the mix of these. The following graphs illustrate the actual payments made to the Group President and CEO and the Group CFO for 2020. These values are expressed as a percentage of total cost of employment.\n\nThe proportion of fixed to performance-based incentives varies  between  the  Group  President  and  CEO  and  the Group CFO. Both roles comprise a higher weighting on performance incentives or 'at risk pay' and less on the fixed  package.  While  the  fixed  package  does  not  vary based  on  individual  performance,  the  variable  portion does.\n\nThe following graphs illustrate the mix of minimum, ontarget and potential maximum compensation for the Group President and CEO and the Group CFO aligned with the 2020 remuneration policy. All illustrations are expressed as a percentage of annual guaranteed package (GP) based on four performance scenarios being below threshold, at threshold, at target and above target.\n\n## Group President and CEO pay mix\n\n## Group CFO pay mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The 24% threshold is the minimum % on the assumption that all the team performance objectives, weighted accordingly, are met at the minimum 80% achievement. If any of the KPIs is below 80%, the calculated minimum bonus % reduces to below 24%. The 24% also assumes that the although the Company performance threshold has been met, it does not contribute to the actual bonus but is only indicative of declaring a bonus in accordance with the performance bonus rules.\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\nAll about\n\nMTN\n\nHow we\n\ncreate value\n\nStrategic and\n\nfinancial review\n\nGovernance and remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

Participating employees who received awards under the ESOP scheme had to retain ownership of their shares for a period of five years until December 2015, when the scheme matured.\n\nDuring 2016, the Board approved a second allocation of shares to designated employees under the 2016 MTN ESOP. This scheme is managed under a trust. The first allocation of awards was made to qualifying employees on 1 December 2017 with subsequent allocations made every six-month period.\n\n## Termination of employment payments\n\nThe following applies in the event of termination of employment:\n\nIncentive\n\n'Fault terminations' - resignation, abscondment, early retirement, dismissal\n\n## 'No-fault terminations' - retrenchment, retirement, restructuring, disability, death\n\n|                                                                                                                                                      | Paid over the notice period or as a lump sum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Fixed pay Paid over the notice period or as a lump sum or as per statutory   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Applicable benefits may continue to be provided  during the notice period.                                                                           | Benefits will fall away at such time that employment ceases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Benefits                                                                     |\n| No payment will be made, unless incentive payment is  due while the employee is serving notice, in which case  it will be paid on the bonus pay day. | Any Board-approved incentive, e.g. annual performance bonus becomes  payable on a  pro rata  basis at the same time as other active employees  subject to the incentive policy.                                                                                                                                              | STIs                                                                         |\n| No payment will be made.

These employment agreements provide for a notice period of six months by either party or payment by the Company in lieu of notice and 12 months restraint of trade. Executives are entitled to standard benefits and participation in the short and long-term incentive schemes, subject to the rules of these schemes.\n\nEmployees are required to retire at age 60 and where their service is terminated as no fault terminations (retirement, retrenchment, disability or death) or at the end of the limited-duration contract, any shares awarded will be pro-rated and will vest under normal vesting conditions according to the pre-set vesting dates (subject to company performance over that future period). In the case of resignations and terminations, these will be forfeited.\n\n## External appointments\n\nThe Group observes sound governance protocols in allowing external directorships to the executive directors and executives across its footprints  as  the  Group  considers  such  participation  a  prudent approach to upskilling executives.\n\nThe following table presents the service contracts for group Exco members.\n\n|                     | Extended  notice period   | Restraint  of trade   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| CEO                 | 6 months                  | 12 months             |\n| Prescribed officers | 6 months                  | 6 - 12 months         |\n| Executives          | 6 months                  | 6 months              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fees reflect the director's role and committee membership. A fee applies for any additional special meetings over and above Board and committee meetings. In addition to the fees, a single annual retainer, reflective of the role and responsibilities being discharged by a non-executive director, forms part of annual earnings.\n\nNon-executive directors do not participate in any of the Company's short or long-term incentive plans, and they are not employees of the Company. MTN provides them with communication devices such as a mobile phone to conduct  their  duties.  The  Company  reimburses  them for out-of-pocket expenses, such as travel and accommodation costs, incurred in the execution of their responsibilities.\n\nThe committee reviews fees annually, requiring approval from  shareholders  at  the  AGM.  Recommendations regarding non-executive director emoluments are informed by independent market data considering market practice with reference to the size of the Company, time, commitment,  and  responsibilities  associated  with  the roles.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2020, management commissioned DG Capital to benchmark the Board, chairpersons and sub-committee fees against selected companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and companies operating in the telecoms emerging markets.\n\n## Benchmarking of NED fees\n\nThe following companies were used to benchmark 2021 NED fees:\n\n## South Africa resident NEDs (JSE listed)\n\n- 1.

The Board agreed that R Shuter's termination be awarded a good leaver status and  that  the  unvested  share  awards  under  the  PSPs awarded during the fixed period will vest in full (no pro rata) on  their  respective  vesting  dates  and  based  on  an on-target achievements for all elements.\n\nThese are summarised as follows:\n\n| Award date   | Vesting  date   | No. of shares  awarded^   | Estimated  market  value* R000   |\n|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 28 Dec 18    | 28 Dec 21       | 436 600                   | 38 124                           |\n| 20 Dec 19    | 20 Dec 22       | 457 100                   | 39 969                           |\n| Total        |                 | 893 700                   | 78 093                           |\n\nNotes\n\n- ^   The 2018 and 2019 share allocations both had TSR, cashflow, ROACE, compliance, BEE and service element as approved by the Board. In the 2020 allocation, the service element was not approved and the ROACE was replaced with a ROE metric.\n\n## Valuation on unvested shares*\n\nIn  valuing  the  shares  that  will  vest  in  2021  and  2022 respectively, the calculated projected values are based on the share price of R87,44. This price is the equivalent price obtained for the shares that vested in 2020 and were settled in 2021. This price is only for valuation purposes of this committed settlement agreement and will be adjusted once  the  shares  have  vested  and  are  settled  in  the respective years. On this basis, the market value of the shares  vesting  in  2021  and  2022  is  R38  million  and R40 million respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  line  with  MTN's commitment to fair and responsible remuneration, from time to time, we review salaries  that  fall  below  the  target  minimum  salary  as  per  the  approved pay scales.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a more prudent approach in the review and awarding of salary increases across the Group. For the year under review, we granted increases of 2,5% for management and 4% for general staff. This budget decision was based on the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of staff costs during the COVID-19 crisis\n- \u00b7 Inflation projections\n- \u00b7 Increases granted by peer-comparator companies\n- \u00b7 Salary survey projections\n\nSurvey data from these sources are taken into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 Kornferry\n- \u00b7 PwC Remchanel\n- \u00b7 Bowmans Reward Advisory Services\n\n## 2020 performance incentive outcomes\n\nShort-term incentives\n\nThe following table shows the extent to which the Company performance element was achieved for the Group.

This allocation was a conditional award of shares dependent on the following performance  conditions:  TSR,  cash  flow,  ROACE  and retention. For the Group President and CEO, CFO and CFO, they each had additional conditions linked to BEE and compliance to ICASA (all ESG related).\n\nAn assessment of the performance conditions was performed. Based on the externally audited results, overall:\n\n- \u00b7 TSR  was  not  achieved  owing  to  the  Group's  share performance during the measurement period\n- \u00b7 The  cash  flow  conditions  were  partially  achieved  at 100%.\n- \u00b7 The ROACE condition was achieved in full at 100%.\n\nThe overall weighted vesting approved by Remco was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 MTN Group directors: 75%\n- \u00b7 MTN Group Exco members: 75%\n- \u00b7 Other participants: 75%\n\nThe above vesting percentages include the 25% retainer as was approved at allocation.
