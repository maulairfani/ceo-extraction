It has an annual production capacity of 90,000 metric tons of acetylene. Around 20 plants in the BASF Production Verbund use acetylene as a versatile chemical component.\n\nFor more information on the acetylene plant, see basf.com/acetylene\n\n## This page:\n\nBASF presented a new, highly efficient process for chemically recycling battery materials at its Research Press Conference in December 2020. This recovers the lithium contained in batteries in high purity and with high yields. The process also reduces waste and greenhouse gas emissions compared with existing methods.\n\nFor more information on battery recycling, see page 37\n\nThe people pictured in this report complied with the local coronavirus regulations in force at the time the photos were taken.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We show how sustainability contributes to BASF's long-term success and how we as a company create value for our customers, employees, shareholders, business partners, neighbors and the public.\n\n## The BASF Report online\n\nHTML version with additional features: basf.com/report PDF version for download: basf.com/basf\\_report\\_2020.pdf\n\n## Symbols\n\nExplanations of the symbols used can be found on page 17.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Content and structure\n\n- \u25aa Integrated BASF Report serves as U.N. Global Compact progress report\n- \u25aa Sustainability reporting in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards\n- \u25aa Financial reporting according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the German Commercial Code and German Accounting Standards (GAS)\n\nThe  BASF  Report  combines  the  major  financial  and  sustain ability-related information necessary to comprehensively evaluate our performance. We select the report's topics based on the following reporting principles: materiality, sustainability context, completeness, balance and stakeholder inclusion. In addition to the inte grated report, we publish further information online. The relevant links can be found at the end of each chapter.\n\nOur sustainability reporting has been based on GRI guidelines and standards since 2003. We have applied the  'Comprehensive' option since the BASF Report 2017.\n\nWe  have  been  active  in  the  International  Integrated  Reporting Council (IIRC) since 2014 in order to discuss our experiences of integrated reporting with other stakeholders and at the same time, receive inspi ration for enhancing our reporting. This report  addresses elements of the IIRC framework by, for example, providing an illustrative overview of how we create value or demonstrating the relationships  between  financial  and  sustainability-related  performance in the sections on the segments. The information in the BASF  Report  2020 also serves as a progress report on BASF's implementation of the 10 principles of the United Nations' Global Compact and takes into consideration the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership of the Global Compact LEAD platform.\n\nThe detailed GRI and Global Compact Index can be found in the online report. It provides an overview of all relevant information to fulfill the GRI indicators, as well as how we contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the principles of the U.N. Global Compact. The results of the limited assurance of this information can also be found there in the form of an assurance statement issued by KPMG  AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft. We also publish additional information on sustainability in accordance with the industry-specific requirements (Chemicals Standard) of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\nThe information on the financial position and performance of the BASF Group comply with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and, where applicable, the German Commercial Code, German Accounting Standards (GAS) and the guidelines on alternative performance measures from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Internal control mechanisms ensure the reliability of the information presented in this report. BASF's Board of Executive Directors confirmed the effectiveness of the internal control measures and compliance with the regulations for financial reporting.\n\nMaterial topics along the value chain form the focal points of reporting  and  define  the  limits  of  this  report.  We  take  three dimensions  into  account  in  identifying  and  evaluating  material topics: the impact on BASF, the impact of BASF and relevance for our stakeholders.\n\n- For more information on our selection of sustainability topics, see page 42 onward and basf.com/materiality\n\nFor a visualization of BASF's business model based on the IIRC framework, see How We Create Value on pages 24 and 25 and basf.com/how-we-create-value\n\nFor more information on our control and risk management system, see page 158 onward\n\n- The 2020 BASF Online Report can be found at basf.com/report\n\nFor more information on the Global Reporting Initiative, see globalreporting.org\n\nFor more information on the Global Compact, see globalcompact.org and basf.com/en/global-compact\n\nThe GRI and Global Compact Index can be found at basf.com/en/gri-gc\n\nThe SASB index can be found at basf.com/sasb",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Data\n\n- \u25aa Relevant information included up to February 22, 2021\n- \u25aa Report published each year in English and German\n\nAll information and bases for calculation in this report are founded on national and international standards for financial and sustainability reporting. The data and information for the reporting period were sourced from the expert units responsible using representative methods. The reporting period is the 2020 business year. Relevant information is included up to the editorial deadline of February 22, 2021. The report is published each year in English and German. It is prepared in German and the German version is authoritative.\n\nBASF Group's scope of consolidation for its financial reporting comprises BASF SE, with its headquarters in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and all of its fully consolidated subsidiaries and proportionally consolidated joint operations. Shares in joint ventures and asso ciated companies are accounted for, if material, using the equity method in the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements and are thus not included in the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe section 'Employees' refers to employees active in a company within the BASF Group scope of consolidation as of December 31, 2020.\n\nOur data collection methods for environmental protection and safety are based on the recommendations of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC). In the section 'Environmental Protection, Health and Safety,' we report all data including information on the emissions and waste of the worldwide production sites of BASF SE, its fully consolidated subsidiaries, and proportionally consolidated joint operations. BASF SE subsidiaries that are fully consolidated in the Group financial statements in which BASF holds an interest of less than 100% are included in full in environmental reporting. The emissions of proportionally consolidated joint operations are disclosed\n\npro rata according to our interest. Work-related accidents at all sites of BASF SE and its subsidiaries as well as joint operations and joint ventures in which we have sufficient authority in terms of safety management are compiled worldwide regardless of our interest and reported in full. Unless otherwise indicated, further data on social responsibility and transportation safety refers to BASF SE and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe disclosures and indicators in the Management's Report on sustainability  in  2020  no  longer  include  data  on  the  divested construc tion chemicals business. Occupational and process safety incidents in the construction chemicals business are reported until September 30, 2020. The integrated polyamide business acquired from Solvay as of January 31, 2020, is included pro rata in the figures for employees, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and  occupational and process safety (LTI and PSI rate). Sales of  products from the business acquired from Solvay have already been  integrated in the portfolio to be evaluated under the Sustainable Solution  Steering method. They will be classified from 2021. All other sustainability indicators for 2020 do not yet include the  acquired polyamide business.\n\n- For more information on companies accounted for in the Consolidated Financial Statements, see the Notes from page 233 onward\n- The list of shares held can be found at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## External audit\n\nOur reporting is audited by a third party. KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungs gesellschaft has audited the BASF Group Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  the  Management's  Report  and  has approved them free of qualification. The audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements  is  based  on  the  likewise  audited  financial statements of the BASF Group companies.\n\nThe limited assurance of the sustainability information  contained in the  Management's  Report  was  conducted  in   accordance  with ISAE 3000 (Assurance Engagements other than Audits or  Reviews\n\nof  Historical  Financial  Information)  and  ISAE  3410  (Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements), the relevant international assurance standards for sustainability reporting. KPMG conducted a reasonable assurance of all disclosures on the most important  nonfinancial  key  performance  indicators,   accelerator sales and CO2-neutral growth. Both steering-relevant indicators and their forecasts are part of the Management's Report and are thus covered  by  the  annual  audit.  The  links  and  additional  content provided on the internet sites referred to in this report are not part of the audited information.\n\nKPMG also conducted a limited assurance of the nonfinancial group statement (NFS).\n\n- The Independent Auditor's Report can be found on page 214 onward\n- An assurance statement on the sustainability information in the BASF Report 2020 can be found at basf.com/sustainability\\_information\n- An assurance statement of the NFS can be found at basf.com/nfs-audit-2020\n\n## Forward-looking statements and forecasts\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates and projections of the Board of Executive Directors and currently available information. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of the future developments and results outlined therein. These are dependent on a number of factors; they involve various risks and uncertainties; and they are based on assumptions that may not prove to be accurate. Such risk factors include those discussed in Opportunities and Risks on pages 158 to 166. We do not assume any obligation to update the forward- looking  statements  contained  in  this  report  above  and beyond the legal requirements.",

The health, social and economic consequences were felt by people all over the world. For industry, and therefore for BASF too, the restrictions associated with the pandemic posed an enormous challenge.\n\nWe reacted quickly and decisively to the crisis. Our crisis teams coordinated the necessary measures at our sites and used the strengths of our Verbund. We were thus able to flexibly adapt our production to the needs of our customers, safeguard the health of our employees and ensure reliable deliveries. In this exceptional  year,  the  BASF  team  demonstrated  remarkable  solidarity  and\n\nflexibility and worked tirelessly to find tailor-made solutions for our customers whether working from home or in the plants. I want to thank all employees for their great work!\n\nIn 2020, there was demand for raw materials and products for the pharmaceutical and cleaning industries in particular. With our 'Helping Hands' initiative, we\n\nprovided assistance from the very beginning of the pandemic.

BASF was especially affected by the downturn in the automotive sector. Our most important customer industry was hit by collapsing demand, production stoppages and supply chain disruptions.\n\nFor the full year 2020, we achieved sales of \u20ac59.1 billion and EBIT before special items of \u20ac3.6 billion. While we had communicated a significantly more positive outlook when we published the BASF Report 2019 on February 28, 2020, we had to withdraw this guidance on April 29, 2020. The indicators had shifted markedly. But at the time, it was impossible to reliably estimate the duration and further spread of the coronavirus pandemic or the future measures to contain it. On October 9, 2020, we gave a new outlook: Sales of \u20ac57 billion to \u20ac58 billion in 2020 as well as EBIT before special items of between \u20ac3.0 billion and \u20ac3.3 billion. Ultimately, a strong fourth quarter enabled us to exceed these forecasts. Thanks to this year-end rally, our full-year sales almost matched the level of the previous year, while EBIT before special items was 23% lower.",

The increase in special items was primarily attributable to the impairments we had to recognize in all segments in the third quarter as a result of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Cash flows from operating activities\n\namounted to \u20ac5.4 billion, down 27.6% compared with the previous year. Free cash flow amounted to \u20ac2.3 billion, after \u20ac3.7 billion in 2019.\n\n\u00bb\n\nThe dividend proposal reflects the high importance we place in a reliable dividend even in difficult times.\n\nThe development of the BASF share price reflected the overall macroeconomic development.  After significant downturns caused by the pandemic in the first half of 2020, BASF's share price recovered and stabilized over the second half of the year. The closing price of \u20ac64.72 was, however, still 3.9% below the level at the end of the previous year. Assuming\n\nthat dividends were reinvested, BASF's share performance rose by 2.3% in 2020.\n\nThe exceptionally strong adverse economic impacts of the coronavirus  pandemic also had a negative effect on the development of BASF Group's free cash flow. Nevertheless, we will propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting a dividend of \u20ac3.30 per share, a payment of \u20ac3.0 billion to shareholders for the 2020 business year. This reflects the high importance we place in a reliable dividend even in difficult  times.\n\nWe continued to drive forward our Excellence Program. Overall, we are well on track to achieve the targeted \u20ac2 billion annual EBITDA contribution by the end of 2021. We were not quite able to achieve an accelerated implementation of all contributions - from increases in sales and from cost savings - in this difficult environment. But we reacted quickly here, and focused even more on efficiency improvements.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic-related restrictions also had a noticeable impact on the preparations for our planned major investment in a new Verbund site in Guangdong in southern China. Nevertheless, we are still on schedule. Last year, we successfully started construction of the first plants. Starting in 2022, these\n\nplants will produce engineering plastics and thermoplastic polyurethane to serve the growing demand in the markets of southern China and elsewhere in Asia.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region, especially China, is the key growth driver of global chemical production. Over the next 10 years, more than two-thirds of global growth in the chemical industry will take place in China. This trend became more pronounced in 2020 with China's rapid economic recovery. With our new, fully integrated Verbund site, we want to further expand our leading position as a western chemical company in the world's most important chemical market.\n\nWe also made progress with the further development of our portfolio in 2020. At the end of January, we completed the acquisition of Solvay's integrated polyamide 6.6 business for \u20ac1.3 billion. This acquisition broadens our polyamide capabilities with innovative products and enhances our access to the most important precursor as well as to growth markets in Asia and North and South America. At the end of September, we closed the divestiture of our construction chemicals business to an affiliate of the global private equity firm Lone Star. Given the challenging environment, this was an outstanding team accomplishment. The purchase price on a cash and debt-free basis was \u20ac3.17 billion. We expect to close the sale of BASF's pigments business to the Japanese fine chemicals company DIC in the first half of 2021, subject to the pending approval of the U.S. competition authorities.\n\nDespite the challenging global effects of the  pandemic, we cannot neglect fundamental long-term challenges such as climate protection. For BASF, climate protection is a key responsibility and a crucial component of our strategy. We want to contribute to a world that offers a future with enhanced quality of life for everyone. We are therefore working closely with our customers and partners to develop even better solutions. With circular economy approaches, we want to further decouple economic growth from resource consump-\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite the pandemic, we cannot neglect challenges such as climate protection.\n\ntion and thus use limited  resources even more efficiently.

In many areas of the chemical industry, however, the use of  resources can be further improved.\n\nWith our Circular Economy Program, we have therefore set ourselves ambitious targets: BASF has committed to transforming 250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials into new products each year as of 2025. And we want to increase our sales generated with solutions for the circular economy to \u20ac17 billion by 2030 - this represents a doubling of the current figure.\n\nIn parallel, we are working on our energy transformation towards carbon  neutrality. This will decisively influence our future profitability and competitiveness. The European Union, with its Green Deal, has set the ambitious target of climate neutrality by 2050. With its strategy, BASF has taken a clear position. For us, reducing CO2 emissions is immensely important. We have therefore committed to climate-neutral growth until 2030. This means that we will further reduce our specific CO2 emissions per kilogram of product sold, by an average of one-third. To reduce CO2 emissions even further, we need the right political framework on the one hand and groundbreaking technologies on the other. These technologies are being developed in our comprehensive Carbon Management Program.\n\nOne important example is our steam crackers. They are currently powered by natural gas. In the future, we want to operate them with electricity from renewable sources. For a world-scale cracker, this could mean an annual reduction of 1 million metric tons of CO2. However, to implement this we need very large volumes of electricity from renewable energies - and at internationally competitive prices. This, in turn, requires a long-term, integrated climate and industry policy with supportive framework conditions at the national and international levels.\n\nthis way, we combine sustainability and digitalization into a highly innovative offering for our customers.\n\nInnovations have made BASF the leading chemical company. I am convinced that our that our innovative power will continue to be an important success factor for\n\nprofitable development in the future. Carbon management and the circular economy are important growth drivers across all industries. With tailor-made solutions, we help our customers to further improve their sustainability profile and that of their products - all the way to carbon neutrality. Innovations therefore fuel BASF's sustainable growth. And this depends on excellent R&D - which is  exactly what we have at BASF.\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon Management and the circular economy are important growth drivers across all industries.\n\nThe coronavirus vaccination campaigns worldwide\n\nmake me optimistic about 2021, but there are still many uncertainties. It will take time for the global  economy to return to pre-pandemic levels. And there is no shortage of new challenges. We will ensure that our customers are always the central focus of all our activities. Together with our customers, the BASF team works passionately to create long-term, profitable growth. I appreciate your support as we pursue this goal and thank you for your trust in BASF.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMartin Bruderm\u00fcller\n\nTo create transparency, by the end of 2021, we will be the first chemical  company worldwide to provide our customers with a product carbon footprint for all of our 45,000 sales products. With our proprietary digital solution, we will be able to determine the overall CO2 values for our products. This product carbon footprint will be reported as CO2 units per metric ton of sales product and include all emissions until the product leaves the factory gate for delivery to the customer. In",

Due to the exceptionally high economic burden caused by the corona virus pandemic, which also impacted the BASF Group's free cash flow, the proposed dividend per share will not be increased for the first time since the 2009 business year.\n\nBased on the year-end share price for 2020, BASF shares offer a high dividend yield of around 5.1%. BASF is part of the DivDAX share index, which contains the 15 companies with the highest dividend yield in the DAX 30.\n\n## Broad base of international shareholders\n\nWith over 700,000 shareholders, BASF is one of the largest publicly owned companies with a high free float. An analysis of the shareholder structure carried out at the end of 2020 showed that, at around 20% of share capital, the United States and Canada made up the largest regional group of institutional investors. Institutional investors from Germany accounted for around 11%. Shareholders from the United Kingdom and Ireland hold 8% of BASF shares, while\n\ninvestors from the rest of Europe hold a further 12% of capital. Approximately 36% of the company's share capital is held by private investors, nearly all of whom reside in Germany.

CDP is an international organization representing around 515 investors with over $106 trillion in assets and more than 150 major organizations with $4 trillion in purchasing power. In 2020, BASF again scored an A- on CDP's Climate List, giving it Leadership  status. In the scoring framework used by CDP in 2020, BASF was ranked among the best 25% of the participating chemical com pa nies. To achieve its climate target of CO2-neutral growth until 2030, BASF is continually optimizing existing processes and is  increasingly using energy from renewable sources. BASF is also developing completely new low-emission production processes. The company bundles this work in its ambitious carbon management.\n\nIn the CDP assessment for sustainable water management, BASF again achieved the top grade of A and thus Leadership status. The assessment takes into account how transparently companies report on their water management activities and how they reduce risks such as water scarcity. CDP also evaluates the extent to which product developments can contribute to sustainable water management for customers of the companies assessed. BASF continues to",

From 2023 onward, the division expects to achieve annual cost savings of over \u20ac200 million.\n\nThe Corporate Center units support the Board of Executive Directors in steering the company as a whole. These include central tasks from the following areas: strategy; finance; law, compliance and tax; environmental  protection,  health  and  safety;  human  resources; communications; investor relations and internal audit.\n\nThe ongoing Excellence Program is expected to contribute \u20ac2 billion to EBITDA annually from the end of 2021 onward compared with baseline  2018,  including  from  the  reduction  of  around  6,000 positions worldwide until the end of 2021. This decrease results from the organizational simplification and from efficiency gains in administration, the service units and the operating divisions. In addition,  central,  functional  and  regional  structures  are  being streamlined in connection with portfolio changes.\n\n- For more information on the products and services offered by the segments, see from pages 72, 78, 83, 89, 94 and 100 onward\n\nFor more information on the segment structure, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 241 onward\n\nThe BASF Group\n\nTo increase reporting transparency, the figures for investments accounted for using the equity method were restated in the first quarter of 2020. Some investments are not an integral part of the BASF Group. These include, in particular, the shares in Wintershall Dea GmbH, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany, and Solenis UK International Ltd., London, United Kingdom. Since the first quarter of 2020, these have been classified as purely financial investments and reported separately from the shareholdings that are integral to the main business activities of the BASF Group. One material equityaccounted interest that has been classified as integral is BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China. Income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method is no longer presented in the BASF Group's EBIT and EBIT before special items, but under net income from shareholdings. Due to its increased significance, this will be presented as a separate subtotal within income before income taxes and is no longer part of the financial result. Integral and non-integral investments accounted for using the equity  method are also presented separately in the balance sheet. The statement of income for 2019 has been restated accordingly.\n\nOn September 30, 2020, BASF completed the divestiture of its construction chemicals business to an affiliate of Lone Star, a global private equity firm, as agreed in December 2019. 1 The purchase price on a cash and debt-free basis was \u20ac3.17 billion. The Construction  Chemicals  division  was  previously  reported  under  the Surface Technologies segment. The divested construction chemicals business had around 7,500 employees and operated production sites and sales offices in more than 60 countries. It generated sales of around \u20ac2.6 billion in 2019. The disposal gain and the income after taxes of the construction chemicals business until closing are presented in the income after taxes of BASF Group as a separate item ('Income after taxes from discontinued operations').\n\n- For more information on this divestiture, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 237 onward\n\nFor more information on portfolio changes, see page 50 onward\n\n- 1 The construction chemicals business was transferred in two steps, on September 30, 2020, and on November 30, 2020.",

We operate six Verbund sites and 241 additional production sites worldwide. Our Verbund  site  in  Ludwigshafen,  Germany,  is  the  world's  largest chemical complex owned by a single company that was developed as an integrated network.  This was where the Verbund principle was originally established and continuously optimized. We then implemented it at additional sites. In 2020, we started construction of the first plants at the planned integrated Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China.\n\n## BASF sites\n\n- Regional centers\n- Selected sites\n- Verbund sites\n- Planned Verbund site\n- Selected research and development sites\n\nBASF Report 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nThe Verbund system is one of BASF's great strengths. We add value by using our resources efficiently. The Production Verbund  intelligently links production units and their energy supply so that, for example, the waste heat of one plant provides energy to others. Furthermore, one facility's by-products can serve as feedstocks elsewhere. This not only saves us raw materials and energy, it also avoids emissions, lowers logistics costs and leverages synergies.\n\nWe also make use of the Verbund principle for more than production, applying it for technologies, the market and digitalization as well. Expert knowledge is pooled in our global research divisions.\n\n- For more information on the Verbund concept, see basf.com/en/verbund",

We want to be the world's leading chemical company for our customers, grow profitably and create value for  society.  Thanks  to  our  expertise,  our  innovative  and entrepreneurial spirit, and the power of our Verbund integration, we make a decisive contribution to changing the world for the better. This is our goal. This is what drives us and what we do best: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nThe world is facing major challenges. Climate change is advancing, the world's population is growing and so is its need for food. More and more people live in cities and the demand for individual mobility is rising. At the same time, natural resources are limited. More than ever  before,  we  need  solutions  that  make  sustainable  growth possible. Chemistry plays a key role here. It can help to overcome global  challenges  in  almost  all  areas  of  life.  By  combining  our expertise with our customers' competence, we can together develop sustainable and profitable solutions.\n\n## Our corporate purpose\n\nWe create chemistry for a sustainable future\n\nOur innovations, products and technologies help to use natural resources  more  efficiently,  produce  enough  food  for  everyone, reduce  emissions,  enable  climate-smart  mobility,  improve  the capabilities of renewable energy, and make buildings more energy efficient, among other things. Our purpose reflects what we do and why we do it: We create chemistry for a sustainable future.\n\nCorporate Strategy\n\n## Global trends provide opportunities for growth in the chemical industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to continue to grow profitably and make a positive contribution to society and the environment. We see disruptive changes in the chemical industry - like the advance of digitalization, the development of circular economy models or the transformation to climate-neutral production - as an opportunity. We have set ourselves ambitious targets along the entire value chain (see page 32). Our customers and their needs are at the core of our strategy. We want to  maintain  our  leading  position  in  an  increasingly  competitive environment. To achieve this, we are accelerating our innovation processes and deepening cooperation with our customers. We are systematically aligning our portfolio with growth areas and  integrating sustainability into our value chains even more strongly. Our Verbund\n\nSources: U.N., IEA, Conversio, UBS Foresight, BASF\n\nstructure is the basis for efficient, safe and reliable production both now and in the future.

        "page_content": "2\n\nManagement's Report\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Customer focus\n\nOur customers are our number one priority. BASF supplies products and services to around 90,000 customers 1 from various sectors in almost every country in the world (see page 23). Our customer portfolio  ranges  from  major  global  customers  and  small  and medium-sized enterprises to end consumers. Our comprehensive product portfolio means that we are active in many value chains and value creation networks. We use various business strategies, which we adapt to the needs of individual industries and markets. These range  from  cost  leadership  in  basic  chemicals  to  tailored, customer-specific system solutions.\n\n## Innovations and tailored solutions\n\nin close partnership with our customers\n\nWe  want  to  be  our  customers'  most  attractive  partner  for  all challenges  that  can  be  solved  with  chemistry.  This  is  why  we continue to drive forward our focus on customers and their needs. We are refining our organizational structure so that our operating divisions can flexibly address specific market requirements and differentiate themselves from the competition (see page 20). In addition, we are simplifying and digitalizing our processes to make the way we work more effective, more efficient and more agile.\n\nWe are continuously increasing transparency for our customers and improving our customer service with a range of measures. For instance, we have used the Net Promoter System \u00ae since 2019. We are constantly improving our problem-solving skills, product quality and delivery reliability based on customer feedback. In 2020, we also started the global rollout of Salesforce, a new, integrated ITbased customer relationship management system. The user-friendly\n\napplication helps sales employees deliver even better customer support and simplifies their work.\n\nAbove and beyond this, we want to intensify cooperation with our customers and leverage growth potential together with them. For instance, we have created interdisciplinary teams in our business units to even better and more quickly address the needs of our most important customers. Cooperation and innovation are also the focus at our Creation Centers in Ludwigshafen, Germany; Mumbai, India; Shanghai, China; and Yokohama, Japan. These creative centers bring  together  our  comprehensive  materials,  design,  and  -  in particular - our digital development expertise in high-performance plastics using the latest visualization and collaboration technologies. This enables us to transform our customers' ideas into tailored products and applications even more quickly - everything in one place, from initial inspiration to solution.\n\n## Customer awards\n\nWe again received awards from a number of satisfied customers in 2020. In North America, for example, BASF was recognized by General Motors (GM) in June as a 2019 Supplier of the Year for the fifteenth time since 2002. The award is presented to suppliers who exceed GM's expectations around quality, execution, innovation and total enterprise cost. GM also honored us with the Overdrive Award for our sustainable construction solutions. BASF products help GM to meet key sustainability targets - such as a smaller carbon footprint and water and energy savings - at two of its plants.\n\nIn Europe, the global surface treatments business in our Coatings division, which operates under the Chemetall brand, received the Airbus Supply Chain & Quality Improvement award in February for the sixth time. It acknowledges Chemetall's performance, strong continuous improvement and customer-oriented approach in line with Airbus' targets and expectations.\n\n- 1 The number of customers refers to all external companies (sold-to parties) that had contracts with the BASF Group in the business year concerned under which sales were generated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ultrasim \u00ae : Shorter development times thanks to virtual simulation\n\nTechnical progress requires innovative materials. This is why engineering plastics are being used in more and more sectors and  applications.  They  are  often  significantly  lighter  than conventional materials, are usually easier to process and offer advantages such as heat and impact resistance or mechanical strength. As a leading manufacturer, BASF not only offers a comprehensive portfolio of high-performance plastics, but also has extensive expertise in computer-aided engineering (CAE). Ultrasim, our virtual simulation tool, covers the entire process chain - from the selection of suitable materials and the development of virtual prototypes to the optimal production process for the component. Our customers find out quickly, precisely and reliably how our materials behave in specific applications. This reduces development times and saves costs for complex tests.\n\nFor more information on Ultrasim, see basf.com/en/ultrasim",

        "page_content": "2\n\nManagement's Report\n\nIn Asia Pacific, we received an award from Godrej Interio, India's leading home and commercial furniture brand, in the category 'Best Overall  Performance'  in  July.  BASF  has  supplied  Godrej  with Elastoflex and Ultramid products since 2008. The award particularly recognizes delivery reliability and innovation. In September, this was followed by the CIIF New Materials Award, presented by the organizers of the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai. The award recognizes BASF for its modification of the intermediate PolyTHF, which is used to produce elastic spandex textile fibers. The next generation offers our customers easier processing and products with improved stretch characteristics.\n\nIn Brazil, we received several awards in 2020. BASF's Coatings division markets a broad portfolio of decorative paints here under the Suvinil brand. The national association of construction material traders (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional dos Comerciantes de Material de Constru\u00e7\u00e3o) selected Suvinil as the most popular brand for wall, ceiling and exterior paints with the Anamaco award in the wholesale category.  The  award  was  based  on  a  survey  of  more  than 1,600  traders conducted by the industry association. The market research institute Instituto Melhores Empresas em Satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o do Cliente (MESC) also confirmed that Suvinil customers are satisfied customers.  According  to  a  poll  of  over  250  companies  and 41,000  customers conducted by the institute, Suvinil is one of the brands with the highest customer satisfaction ratings in the construction  and   decorative  materials  segment.\n\n## Quality management\n\nOur customers' satisfaction is the basis for our success, which is why quality management is of vital significance for BASF. We strive to continually improve processes and products. This is also reflected in our Global Quality Policy. The majority of our production sites and business units are certified according to ISO 90011. In addition, we\n\nalso meet industry and customer-specific quality requirements such as IATF 16949 certification for the automotive industry.\n\n## Our strategic action areas\n\nInnovation is the bedrock of our success. BASF is an innovation leader in the chemical industry, with around 10,000 employees in research and development and R&D spending of around \u20ac2.1 billion (see page 35). We continue to build on these strengths by bringing research and development closer together and making our customers' demands a greater part of our innovation process. We involve them at an earlier stage and are expanding our partnerships with customers and external partners. Our balanced innovation pipeline lays the foundation for future growth: We are working intensively on pioneering product, process and business model innovations, for example in chemical recycling, battery technologies, the low-carbon production of basic chemicals and the digitalization of agriculture. At the same time, we are driving forward incremental product improvements in all business units that offer our customers sustainability and/or cost advantages, such as in lightweight construction for the automotive industry and energy-efficient building materials.\n\nA key driver here is sustainability . We want to create value for the environment, society and business with our products, solutions and technologies. We pledged our commitment to sustainability in 1994 and since then, have systematically aligned our actions with the principles of sustainability. We want to further cement our position as a thought leader in sustainability, which is why we are increasing the relevance of sustainability in our steering processes and business models (see page 42). This establishes us as a key partner supporting our customers, opens up new growth areas and secures the long-term success of our company. Our approach covers the entire value chain - from responsible procurement (see page 113) and safety and resource efficiency in production (see page 121) to sustainable solutions for our customers (see page 35). We have already almost halved our carbon emissions since 1990 while simul-\n\ntaneously doubling sales product volumes. We want to achieve CO2-neutral growth until 2030 with our ambitious carbon management (see page 135). In addition, we have set ourselves the target of significantly increasing sales of products that make a  substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain (Accelerator products) to \u20ac22 billion by 2025 (see page 45). A particular focus is the circular economy. For instance, we want to increase the use of recycled raw materials in production, close materials cycles with  innovations and develop new, circular business models (see page 30).\n\nOur core business is the production and processing of chemicals. Our strength here lies - both now and in the future - in the Verbund and its integrated value chains. The Verbund offers us many technological,  market,  production-related  and  digital  advantages.  Our comprehensive product portfolio, which ranges from basic  chemicals to custom system solutions, enables us to meet the increasingly diverse needs of our customers with a differentiated offering. This is complemented by our global presence and our many decades of experience, which have allowed us to develop an in-depth understanding of the needs and landscape of local markets. At the same time, value chains in integrated Verbund structures can be steered efficiently to conserve resources and optimize CO2. Thanks to our Verbund structures, we were able to avoid 6.2 million metric tons of CO2 globally in 2020 (see page 133). We want to invest around \u20ac22.9 billion worldwide between now and 2025 to expand capacities based on market demand and to increase the availability, efficiency and flexibility of our plants. Our aim here is to be close to our customers and to grow with them.\n\nDigitalization is an integral part of our business. We want to significantly improve the availability and quality of our process data. To achieve this, we will digitalize processes at more than 420 plants worldwide by 2022. We will systematically analyze this data to further automate processes and in this way, increase efficiency, for example with predictive maintenance. In addition, combining  internal and external data provides many new opportunities to manage our",

We are already using artificial intelligence to collate data from various sources, for example to accelerate innovation processes, optimize our supply chains and logistics concepts, and to simulate product applications for our customers. The combination of products, services and digital offerings also gives rise to new business models and advantages for our customers, such as in agriculture or 3D printing. We want to leverage this growth potential and seize the opportunities offered by digitalization to the benefit of our customers. To do so, we are making digital technologies and practices an even more integral part of our processes, extensively promoting digital skills among our employees, and cooperating with external partners on specific topics.\n\nThe acquisitions and divestitures made in the past few years have oriented our portfolio toward innovation-driven growth areas. The acquisition of the integrated polyamide business from Solvay and the purchase of various businesses from Bayer further strengthened our position in engineering plastics and in the agricultural sector. We completed the divestiture of our construction chemicals business to Lone Star in 2020 as planned and aim to close the sale of our pigments business to DIC in the first half of 2021 (see page 50). The Asian market will play a key role in our future growth. With a share of more than 40%, China is already the world's largest chemical market and drives the growth of global chemical production. We expect this share to increase to around 50% by 2030. Our strong innovation, production and sales base in China enables us to respond to the needs of our customers in a differentiated way. To further strengthen our position in this dynamic growth market, we plan to build an integrated Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Construction of the first plants started in 2020. We are also systematically expanding our battery materials business to serve the fast-growing e-mobility market. We steer our six segments along the value chain. This creates a high level of transparency around our business activities. Our operating divisions drive forward our industry and customer orientation with differentiated strategies.\n\nOur employees are key to BASF's success. That is why we believe that it is important to have a working environment that fosters employees' individual talents and enables them and their teams to perform at their best. We are pursuing three action areas to make our high-performance organization even more so: empowerment, differentiation and simplification. We are giving our employees more individual freedom. At the same time, we encourage and promote a leadership culture that empowers our employees to respond to customer needs quickly and efficiently with a solution orientation. We are simplifying our processes and continually refining our organizational structure. Significant parts of the functional services that were previously performed centrally by a total of around 20,000 employees have been integrated into our 11 operating divisions. This and greater entrepreneurial freedom enable our business units to take a differentiated, flexible approach to market requirements with tailored business models. The aim is to increase both customer satisfaction and the profitability of our business. We value diversity in people, opinions and experience as being crucial to creativity and innovation.  We  embrace  bold  ideas,  help  our  employees  to implement them and learn from setbacks. This is why we foster a feedback culture based on honesty, respect and mutual trust.\n\n## The BASF brand\n\nWe want BASF to be seen as a leading brand in the chemical industry.  Our  corporate  purpose  -  We  create  chemistry  for  a sustainable future - and our values (see page 31) together form the basis of BASF's brand value proposition. This is connectedness, which  embodies  one  of  BASF's  core  strengths:  our  Verbund concept. The BASF Verbund is what makes innovative solutions for a sustainable future possible. We want to communicate this worldwide and make it tangible. The claim 'We create chemistry,' as stated in the BASF logo, helps us embed our solution-oriented strategy and our expertise in the public perception. Wherever our stakeholders encounter our brand, we want to convince them that BASF stands for innovation and sustainability. This builds trust with\n\nour customers, contributes to our reputation and to our company value. We regularly measure our brand and communication success. This gives us relevant and meaningful insights into how the BASF brand is perceived among target groups. This enables us to further refine the brand profile and develop strategies and measures to continually improve our brand status.",

It describes the transition from a linear 'take-makedispose' model to a system of closed loops. We want to actively drive this transition forward and make our value chains, processes, products and business models more circular. By 2030, we want to double our sales of solutions for the circular economy to \u20ac17 billion. Sales of circular solutions include products based on renewable or recycled raw materials, that close new material cycles or increase products' resource efficiency or service life. In addition, we aim to process 250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials in our production plants annually from 2025, replacing fossil raw materials.\n\nThe core elements of a circular economy include reusing resources, avoiding waste and optimizing product features with respect to the entire product life cycle. BASF's Circular Economy Program focuses on three action areas: increasing the use of recycled and renewable feedstocks, innovative material cycles and new business models for the circular economy, including digital and service-based models.\n\n## Core elements of the circular economy at BASF\n\nWe are driving forward the use of recycled raw materials with projects such as ChemCycling TM , in which we use the pyrolysis oil extracted by our technology partners from mixed plastic waste or used tires to produce new products. The project is currently in the scale-up phase. We already have many years' experience in the industrial recycling of mobile emissions catalysts, where we recover precious metals and use them to produce new mobile and process emissions catalysts. We are working on other innovative material cycles in over 20 initiatives. These include our chemical recycling process for used polyurethane foam  mattresses and the development of plastic additives to improve the quality of mechanically recycled plastics. In addition to these projects, we established a Groupwide co-funding program for circular economy projects. It supports our employees in developing new business models for the circular economy - from the initial idea to market launch. The program aims to create additional products and solutions that close loops, establish new loops or extend the life of a product.\n\n## Using plastics responsibly\n\nOur circular feedstock target is part of our commitment to the Ellen MacArthur  Foundation's  New  Plastics  Economy  initiative.  This explores the design, use and reuse of plastics in the transition toward a circular economy. BASF has been a member of the nonprofit organization since 2017 and is working on various cooperative projects together with other members. In 2020, we were in  continual contact with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation on topics such as our target on the use of recycled raw materials or the mass balance\n\n## Core elements of the circular economy at BASF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napproach.

Human Rights Covenants\n\nOur values and global standards\n\n- - The core labor standards of the ILO and the Tripartite Declaration of  Principles  Concerning  Multinational  Enterprises  and  Social Policy (MNE Declaration)\n- - The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n- - The Responsible Care \u00ae Global Charter\n- - The German Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe stipulate rules for our employees with standards that apply throughout the Group. We set ourselves ambitious goals with voluntary commitments and monitor our performance in terms of environmental protection, health and safety using our Responsible Care Management  System.  We  mainly  approach  our  adherence  to international labor and social standards using three elements: the Compliance Program including our Code of Conduct and  compliance hotlines, close dialog with our stakeholders, and the global management process to respect international labor norms. Our business partners are expected to comply with prevailing laws and regulations and to align their actions with internationally recognized principles. We have established appropriate monitoring systems to ensure this.\n\n- For more information on responsible conduct along the value chain, see page 110 onward For more information on corporate governance and compliance, see page 167 onward\n\n## Our targets\n\nBusiness success tomorrow means creating value for the environment, society and business. That is why we have set ourselves ambitious global targets along our entire value chain and the three dimensions of sustainability. We report transparently on our target achievement so that our customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders can track our progress.\n\nWe want to grow faster than the market, further increase our profitability, achieve a return on capital employed (ROCE) considerably above the cost of capital percentage and increase the dividend per share every year based on a strong free cash flow. In addition to these financial targets, we pursue broad sustainability targets. For example, we have resolved to limit total greenhouse gas emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases to the 2018 level while growing production volumes. We want to strengthen the sustainability focus of our product portfolio and significantly increase sales of Accelerator products. We also strive to strengthen sustainability in our supply chains and use natural resources responsibly. We want to further improve safety in production. In addition, we aim to promote diversity within the company and create a working environment in which our employees feel that they can thrive and perform at their best.\n\nThe objective of these targets is to steer our business into a sustainable future, and at the same time, contribute to the implementation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see page 42). We are focusing on issues where we as a company can make a significant contribution, such as climate protection, sustainable consumption and production, and fighting hunger.",

This is why we encourage and support all employees in thinking and acting entrepreneurially in line with our valuebased management concept. Our key financial management indicator is the return on capital employed (ROCE). Based on our corporate strategy and the global targets  derived from this, we have used CO2-neutral growth and Accelerator sales as additional key performance indicators since January 1, 2020. These are the BASF Group's most important nonfinancial key performance indicators.\n\n## The BASF Group's steering concept\n\nWe follow a value-oriented steering concept with our financial  targets. We  use  the  return  on  capital  employed  (ROCE)  for  operational steering as a key target and management indicator for the BASF Group, its operating divisions and business units. As stated in our strategic goals, we aim to achieve a ROCE considerably above the cost of capital percentage every year. With ROCE, the same logic and data is used for internal management, external communication with the capital markets and variable compensation. This improves the consistency of the indicators used for BASF's value-based management with variable compensation and pension systems, and our shareholders' objectives.\n\nAs part of our corporate strategy and the global targets derived from this, we have also used CO2-neutral growth and Accelerator sales as the most important nonfinancial key performance indicators since the 2020 business year. Two targets are based on these indicators: sustainability-oriented portfolio management with our Sustainable Solution Steering method and CO2-neutral growth.\n\nValue-Based Management\n\n## Calculating ROCE and cost of capital\n\nROCE is calculated as the EBIT of the segments as a percentage of the average cost of capital basis at each month-end.\n\nTo calculate the EBIT of the segments , we take the BASF Group's EBIT and deduct the EBIT of activities recognized under Other, which are not allocated to the divisions.\n\nThe cost of capital basis consists of the operating assets of the segments and is calculated using the month-end figures. Operating assets comprise the current and noncurrent asset items of the segments. These include tangible and intangible fixed assets, integral investments accounted for using the equity method, inventories, trade  accounts  receivable,  other  receivables  and  other  assets generated by core business activities and, where appropriate, the assets of disposal groups. The cost of capital basis also includes customer and supplier financing.\n\nThe cost of capital percentage , which we have integrated into our ROCE  target  as  a  comparative  figure,  is  determined  using  the weighted cost of capital from equity and borrowing costs (weighted average cost of capital, WACC). To calculate a pre-tax figure similar to EBIT, it is adjusted using the projected tax rate for the BASF Group for the business year. In addition, the projected net expense of Other is already provided for by an adjustment to the cost of capital percentage. The cost of equity is ascertained using the capital asset pricing  model.  Borrowing  costs  are  determined  based  on  the financing costs of the BASF Group. The cost of capital percentage for 2021 is 9% (2020: 9%).\n\n## Calculation of the indicator 'CO2-neutral growth until 2030'\n\nWe calculate the indicator CO2-neutral growth on the basis of CO2 emissions, which are the sum of direct emissions from production processes and the generation of steam and electricity, as well as indirect emissions from the purchase of energy. Direct emissions\n\nfrom the generation of energy for third parties are not considered here. Relevant emissions include other greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents. We aim to grow CO2-neutrally until 2030 compared with baseline 2018.\n\n- For more information on CO2-neutral growth, see page 130 onward\n\n## Calculation of Accelerator sales 1\n\nAccelerator sales refer to sales generated by the BASF Group from products in our strategic portfolio to third parties in the business year concerned. As part of our corporate strategy, we set ourselves the global target of achieving \u20ac22 billion in Accelerator sales by 2025.\n\n- For more information on sustainability-oriented portfolio management, see page 45 onward\n\n## Value-based management throughout the company\n\nAn important part of our value management is the target agreement process, which aligns individual employee targets with BASF's targets. As of 2019, the most important financial performance indicator in the operating units is ROCE. The other units' contribution to value is also assessed according to effectiveness and efficiency on the basis of quality and cost targets. To assess this, we use metrics such as BASF's internal service score in the service and research units.\n\nWe use ROCE as the BASF Group's most important financial key performance indicator for measuring economic success as well as for steering the BASF Group and its operating units. EBIT before special items and capex (capital expenditure) are key performance indicators for BASF that have a direct impact on ROCE and as such, support its management.\n\n- -EBIT before special items is used to steer profitability at Group and segment level. This is calculated by adjusting the EBIT reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements for special items,  making  it  especially  suitable  for  assessing  economic",

Special items arise from the integration of acquired businesses, restructuring measures, certain impairments, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities.\n\n- -Capital expenditures (capex) comprise additions to property, plant and equipment excluding additions from acquisitions, IT investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases. It is used to manage capital employed in the BASF Group. Capex is not just relevant to ROCE management, but also supports our long-term goal of increasing our dividend each year based on a strong free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, we comment on and forecast sales at Group and segment level in our financial reporting as a significant driver for EBIT before special items and thus ROCE.\n\n- For more information on the development of these indicators, see Results of Operations from page 56 onward\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements\n- 5 Overviews",

Innovations based on chemistry play a pivotal role in overcoming these. New, resource-efficient solutions  and  business  models  are  needed  to  decouple growth from the consumption of finite resources. Together with our customers from almost all sectors, we are working on innovative processes, technologies and products for a sustainable future. This is how we ensure our long-term business success and that of our customers.\n\nInnovation has always been the key to BASF's success, especially in a challenging market environment. The knowledge and skills of our highly qualified employees is our most valuable resource here and the source of our innovative strength. We had approximately 10,000 employees  involved  in  research  and  development  worldwide  in 2020.\n\nOur three global research divisions are run from our key regions Europe,  Asia  Pacific  and  North  America:  Process  Research  & Chemical Engineering (Ludwigshafen, Germany); Advanced Materials  &  Systems  Research  (Shanghai,  China);  and  Bioscience Research (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). Together with the development units in our operating divisions, they form the core of our global Know-How Verbund. BASF New Business GmbH and BASF Venture Capital GmbH supplement this network with the task of developing new technologies, attractive markets and new business models for BASF.\n\nIn 2020, we generated sales of around \u20ac10 billion with products launched on the market in the past five years that stemmed from research and development activities.

NORA focuses on materials science and biosciences, catalysis research, digitalization and cooperation with startups. The computer models developed together with our partners suggest new synthesis pathways  for  molecules  and  enable  us  to  better  predict  molecular proper ties,  for  example  for  selecting  test  substances  for  crop protection products. Big data from BASF and novel algorithms were used to optimize these models. Teams at the interdisciplinary CARA research  center  are  working  on  new  functional  materials, formulations, digital methods, catalysis, chemical synthesis, and in engineering sciences and biosciences. As part of this cooperative venture, BASF researchers and partners are investigating catalyst nanoparticles made of palladium and platinum, among other things. With the help of computer-based calculations, the team developed a completely new understanding of how catalysts work, enabling us to produce new, more powerful catalysts.\n\nThe Joint Research Network on Advanced Materials and Systems (JONAS) research center is active in Europe. Research here concentrates on supramolecular chemistry, polymer chemistry and the incubation of sustainable technologies. Biopolymer synthesis and research into the full biodegradability of biopolymers in various biospheres have been a focus area of BASF's research for many years.\n\nInnovation\n\nIn cooperation with ETH Z\u00fcrich, we have developed an analysis tool that can be used to evaluate biodegradable polymers with respect to both their technical properties and stakeholder acceptance at an early stage of our innovation process. The aim is to concentrate on the development of such sustainable, biodegradable polymers.\n\nAt the Network for Asian Open Research (NAO) in the Asia Pacific region, research focuses on polymer and colloid chemistry,  catalysis, machine learning and smart manufacturing.\n\nWe are working on innovative components and materials for electrochemical energy storage with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) at the Battery and Electrochemistry Laboratory (BELLA). At the joint Catalysis Research Laboratory (CaRLa), BASF is researching homogeneous catalysis in cooperation with the University of Heidelberg. Researchers there have discovered a new approach to using CO2 as a chemical feedstock. They identified the catalysts and process conditions to produce sodium acrylate from ethylene and CO2, a crucial step toward scaling the process for industrial use. BasCat is a joint laboratory operated by the UniCat cluster of excellence and BASF at the Technical University of Berlin, where new heterogenous catalysis concepts are being explored together with the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society. The iL (Innovation  Lab)  in  Heidelberg,  Germany,  focuses  on  functional printing, printed sensors and IoT (internet of things) applications.\n\nOur eight Academic Research Alliances are complemented by cooperations   with around 250 universities and research institutes as well as collaborations with a large number of companies.\n\n- For more information on our collaboration initiatives, see basf.com/innovate-with-us\n\n## Strategic focus\n\n- \u25aa Close cooperation between research and business units\n- \u25aa Strong customer focus\n- \u25aa Further development of our innovation strategies\n\nResearch and development expenses amounted to \u20ac2,086 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac2,158 million). The operating divisions accounted for 82% of total research and development expenses in 2020. The remaining  18%  related  to  cross-divisional  corporate  research focusing  on  long-term  topics  of  strategic  importance  to  the BASF Group.\n\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we combined research and development at an organizational level, making it better aligned with the needs of our customers. Our aim is to continue to shorten the time to market and accelerate the company's organic growth. A strong  customer  focus,  digitalization,  creativity,  efficiency  and collaboration with external partners are among the most important success factors here. In order to bring promising ideas to market as quickly as possible, we regularly assess our research projects using a multistep process and prioritize our focus areas accordingly.\n\n## Our success factors\n\nCustomer focus, digitalization, creativity, efficiency and collaboration with external partners\n\nOur cross-divisional corporate research remains closely aligned with the requirements of our operating divisions and allows space to review creative research approaches quickly and in an agile way. We strengthen existing and continually develop new, key technologies that are of central significance for our operating divisions, such as polymer  technologies,  catalyst  processes  or  biotechnological methods.",

The aim is to use these to leverage new business opportunities within the next few years. In addition, we are working on overarching projects with a high technological, social or regulatory relevance. For instance, one  global  research  and  development  program,  the  Carbon Manage ment R&D Program, is focusing on the underlying energy intensive production processes for basic chemicals. These basic chemicals account for around 70% of the CO2 emissions produced by the European chemical industry. 1 The program covers topics such as the development of new catalysts for dry reforming  methane with CO2 to produce syngas, and using methane pyrolysis to produce hydrogen from natural gas or biogas.\n\nOur global research and development presence is vital to our success. In Asia in particular, we want to continue advancing our research and development activities with a focus on growth in regional markets. A stronger presence outside Europe creates new opportunities for developing and expanding customer relationships and  scientific  collaborations  as  well  as  for  gaining  access  to talented employees. This strengthens our Research and Development  Verbund and makes BASF an even more attractive partner and employer. The Ludwigshafen site in Germany is and will remain the largest in our Research Verbund. This was once again underlined with the investment in a combined laboratory building for cleanroom and elemental analysis.

It enables the lithium contained in the battery to be recovered in high purity and with high yields. The batteries are first disassembled and shredded, which creates a substance known as 'black mass.' This contains valuable resources such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. In BASF's new process, lithium is extracted directly from the black mass as lithium hydroxide, not initially as lithium carbonate like in other processes. After purification to battery quality, with foreign ions removed to trace level, the lithium hydroxide can be used directly to produce cathode active materials. The process avoids waste and has lower CO2 emissions and energy costs than existing methods. The team successfully completed the first pilot tests in 2020 and are currently designing a pilot plant.",

Sustainability is firmly anchored  in  our  strategy  and  corporate  governance.  We carry out the company purpose 'We create chemistry for a sustainable future' using the various tools of our  sustainability management.  We  systematically  incorporate  sustainability into our business and our assessment, steering and compensation systems. We identify sustainability trends at an early stage and derive appropriate measures for our business to seize new business opportunities and minimize risks along the value chain.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## \u25aa Sustainability further integrated into governance, compensation systems and business models\n\nWe achieve long-term business success by creating value added for the environment, society and the economy. Sustainability is at the core of what we do, a driver for growth and value as well as an element of our risk management. That is why sustainability is firmly anchored into the organization as part of governance,  compensation systems and business models.\n\nBased on our corporate strategy and the global targets derived from this, we steer the sustainability targets (CO2-neutral growth until 2030 and achieve \u20ac22 billion in Accelerator sales by 2025) as most important key performance indicators. We have established the necessary steering mechanisms and control systems at Group level. Carbon management bundles our global activities to reduce greenhouse  gas  emissions  (see  page  135).  We  use  the  Sustainable Solution Steering method to manage our product portfolio (see page 45). To assess the sustainability performance of our products and identify solutions that make a substantial sustainability contribu-\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\ntion in the value chain (Accelerator products), we regularly reassess our  product portfolio.\n\nIn addition to the two climate protection and Accelerator sales targets, we have also set ourselves further sustainability targets on responsible procurement, engaged employees, women in leadership positions, occupational health and safety, process safety and water management.\n\nAs a co-founder of the U.N. Global Compact and a recognized LEAD company, we contribute to the implementation of the United Nations' Agenda 2030 on an ongoing basis. Our products, solutions and technologies help to achieve the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action). The SDG focus areas are prioritized by internal experts. In doing so, they assess the impacts and positive contributions of our products, our corporate targets and strategic action  areas. The contribution of our activities is measured using the Value to Society approach. This assesses our positive and negative impacts  on  the  environment,  society  and  the  economy  (see page 44).\n\nWe  evaluate  key  sustainability  topics  with  our  comprehensive materiality analysis. The graphic on page 43 shows how we identify and assess relevant topics. Here, we take into account topics that we have an impact on, topics that have an impact on us, and topics that our stakeholders consider important.\n\nThe relevant topics identified based on the three dimensions of materiality  include  climate  and  energy,  resource  efficiency  and waste, health and safety / product stewardship, emissions to air and soil, and responsibility along the value chain.\n\n- For more information on our materiality analysis, see basf.com/materiality For more information on our Value to Society approach, see basf.com/en/value-to-society For more information on the metastudy on sustainability trends, see basf.com/sustainability-trends\n\n## Our organizational and management structures\n\nWe are constantly working to broaden our positive impact on key sustainability topics and reduce the negative impact of our business activities. The Corporate Development unit, which is part of the Corporate Center, has steered the integration of sustainability into core business activities and decision-making processes since 2020 (see page 21). Global steering of climate-related matters is also bundled in this unit, such as coordinating measures to reach our climate protection target and steering the target on making our product portfolio more sustainable.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board are regularly briefed on the current status of individual sustainability topics. In addition, the Board of Executive Directors is informed about sustainability evaluations in business processes, for example, in the case of proposed investments and acquisitions. It makes decisions with strategic relevance for the Group and monitors the implementation  of  strategic  plans  and  target  achievement.  The Corporate Sustainability Board, which is composed of heads of business and Corporate Center units and regions, supports the Board of Executive Directors on sustainability topics and discusses operational matters. A member of the Board of Executive Directors serves as chair.\n\nWe also established an external, independent Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC) in 2013 and a Human Rights Advisory Council (HRAC) in 2020.

Accelerator products make a substantial sustainability contribution in the value chain. These include catalysts that reduce emissions to the environment, biodegradable mulch films for agricultural applications, and high-performance insulation materials for higher energy savings and reduced material use in building construction. Based on our corporate strategy, we have set ourselves a global target: We aim to make sustainability an even greater part of our innovation power and achieve \u20ac22 billion in Accelerator sales by 2025.\n\n- 1 Parts of the relevant portfolio have not yet been evaluated, including the integrated polyamide business acquired from Solvay in 2020.\n- 2 The definition of the relevant portfolio and further information can be found in the Sustainable Solution Steering manual at basf.com/en/sustainable-solution-steering\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we generated sales of \u20ac16.7 billion with Accelerator products (2019: \u20ac15.0 billion).

This is primarily attributable to the positive development of Accelerator sales in the Surface Technologies and Agricultural Solutions segments. In the Agricultural Solutions segment, the first-time assessment of the seed business acquired from Bayer contributed to the increase.\n\nIf, during reassessment of our portfolio, we identify products with substantial sustainability concerns, we classify these as  'Challenged.' Challenged products account for around 0.1% of the evaluated relevant portfolio. We develop and implement action plans for all products in this category. These include research projects and reformulations to optimize products, or even replacing the product with an alternative. To systematically align our portfolio with contributions to sustainability, as of 2018, we will phase out all Challenged  products within five years of initial classification as such at the latest. We strive to offer products that make a greater contribution to sustainability in their area of application to live up to our own commitments and meet our  customers'  demands.  This  is  why  our  Sustainable  Solution Steering method is used in areas such as our research and development pipeline, in business strategies as well as in merger and acquisition projects.\n\nFor more information on Sustainable Solution Steering, see basf.com/en/sustainable-solution-steering\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\n## \u25aa Continuous dialog with our stakeholders\n\nOur  stakeholders  include  customers,  employees,  partners  and suppliers,  investors,  representatives  from  academia,  industry, politics and society, as well as from the communities surrounding our production sites. Parts of our business activities, such as the use of certain new technologies or our environmental impacts, are often viewed by stakeholders with a critical eye. We take these questions seriously, initiate dialogs and participate in discussions. Such ongoing exchange with our stakeholders helps us to even better understand what matters to groups of society, what they\n\nIntegration of Sustainability\n\nexpect of us and which measures we need to pursue in order to establish and maintain trust, build partnerships, and increase societal acceptance for and the sustainability of our business activities. In doing so, we want to harness potential for mutual value creation and strengthen the legitimacy of our business activities - our license to operate. For important topics, we systematically identify key stakeholders at an early stage to discuss critical questions with them. Relevant considerations include their topic-specific expertise and willingness to engage in constructive dialog.\n\nBASF was awarded the 2020 CSR Prize by the German federal government, which highlighted BASF's long-standing commitment to CSR (corporate social responsibility) and its comprehensive sustainability strategy. In its justification, it emphasized BASF's pioneering role, particularly in integrated reporting and the disclosure of CO2 emissions, and the fact that BASF also encourages the\n\n## Stakeholder demands and expectations of BASF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\n- - Innovative and sustainable solutions\n- - Reliable partner\n\n## Society: politics, NGOs, media\n\n- - Responsible and trustworthy partner\n- - Production of safe products in compliance with environmental and social standards\n- - Jobs and taxes\n\n## Community\n\n- - Support for local communities\n- - Safe, disruption-free operations\n- - Attractive jobs\n\nimplementation of sustainability at other companies in the industry through transparency.\n\nWe draw on the competence of global initiatives and networks, and contribute our own expertise.

As a recognized LEAD company, we contribute to the implementation of the Agenda 2030 and the associated goals. We support UNGC Action Platforms, for example on Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3), and contribute to the UNGC Expert Network. To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations on September  21, 2020, we reaffirmed our commitment to the UNGC and pledged our support for the Women's Empowerment Principles and the CFO Principles on Integrated SDG Investments and Finance.

        "page_content": "- 2 Management's Report Integration of Sustainability\n\nIn 2020, we once again met with the Stakeholder Advisory Council to discuss important aspects of sustainability. The main topics were climate protection, circular economy and sustainable finance. The Human Rights Advisory Council discussed impacts on selected aspects of our products' value chains and interacting with  vulnerable groups.\n\nOur political advocacy is conducted in accordance with transparent guidelines and our publicly stated positions. The same applies to our activities in associations. For instance, we published an Industry Associations Review comparing the energy and climate protection positions of BASF and the most important associations of which we are a member, with explanations on our approach.\n\nBASF does not financially support political parties. In the United States, employees at BASF Corporation have exercised their right to establish a Political Action Committee (PAC). The BASF Corporation Employee PAC is an independent, federally registered employee association founded in 1998. It collects donations for political purposes and independently decides how these are used, in accordance with U.S. law.\n\nWe have a particular responsibility toward our production sites' neighbors. With the established community advisory panels, we promote open exchange between citizens and our site management and strengthen trust in our activities. Our globally binding requirements for community advisory panels are based on the grievance mechanism standards in the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We keep track of their implementation through the existing global databank of the Responsible Care Management  System.\n\nWe also use digital formats to initiate dialog on sustainability topics. The first Climathon was held in November 2020 as an initiative for employees. During the one-day hackathon, teams of (IT) experts developed digital solutions for sustainability issues, from calculating\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\npersonal carbon footprints to supporting customer-focused business ideas.\n\n- For more information on stakeholder dialog, see basf.com/en/stakeholder-dialog\n\nFor more information on the Industry Associations Review, see basf.com/corporategovernance\n\n- For more information on our guidelines for responsible lobbying, see basf.com/guidelines\\_political\\_communication For more information on the BASF Climathon, see climathon.basf.com\n\n## Social engagement\n\n- \u25aa BASF as a responsible neighbor at our sites worldwide\n- \u25aa Contribution to the United Nations' Sustainable Development  Goals\n\nThrough our social engagement, we want to take into account the needs of the communities surrounding our production sites worldwide, help achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and have a positive long-term impact on the environment and society. This is why social engagement is a cornerstone of our corporate social responsibility. Our social engagement policy was updated in 2020 and provides the guardrails for our activities. It stipulates that all social engagement measures worldwide must be conducted in line with our compliance policy, BASF's strategy and our sustainability commitments. We want to have a positive impact on society in our three focus areas: future health, future skills and future resources. We support projects that aim to have a lasting impact on specific target groups and offer learning opportunities for participating cooperation partners and BASF.\n\nAs a responsible neighbor at our Ludwigshafen site and a partner in the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, our social engagement in Germany includes strengthening participation and integration of disadvantaged groups as well as promoting research and discovery. It is particularly important to us that we work together with our partners to increase the impact of individual measures. In the project #WirGestaltenSchule , for example, we are working with our partners to improve education equality. We promote cooperation between\n\nnonprofit  organizations  with  the Gemeinsam  Neues  schaffen program.\n\nWe are a member of Wissensfabrik - Unternehmen f\u00fcr Deutschland e.V. , a network of over 130 companies and organizations with close links to business that supports children, young people, students and young entrepreneurs through its involvement with educational institutions and start-ups. The focus is on school projects that provide hands-on experience with STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the  project's  initiatives  (such  as IT2School  -  Gemeinsam  IT entdecken and KiTec - Kinder entdecken Technik ) were also offered in digital formats,  allowing these educational programs to continue even as school operations were restricted.\n\nWe foster societal integration, particularly of low-achieving young people and refugees, with our Start in den Beruf and Start Integration programs. In 2020, 106 young people in the BASF Training Verbund participated in these two programs in cooperation with partner companies in the Rhein-Neckar metropolitan region. The goal is to prepare participants for an apprenticeship within one year, and ultimately secure the long-term supply of qualified employees for BASF and in the region as a whole. Since being launched at the end of 2015, BASF's Start Integration program has supported around 420 refugees with a high probability of being granted the right to remain in Germany, helping to integrate them into the labor market. We spent around \u20ac2.6 million on the BASF Training Verbund in 2020.\n\nWe support the Esp\u00e9rance Banlieues program in France for children from elementary and high schools in 17 low socioeconomic areas with our Kids' Lab program. The hands-on program provides a playbased introduction to science and teaches topics such as a healthy diet. The program ultimately aims to prevent early school leaving and to make it easier to access further education. During the coronavirus pandemic, BASF France supported partner schools with donations of protective face masks and disinfectant.",

Our Starting Ventures program helps people with precarious livelihoods to improve their income-earning opportunities and their quality of life. At the same  time,  the  program  provides  access  to  new  markets  and partners, and strengthens our contribution to reaching the SDGs. For example, we support the Waste-2-Chemicals project in Lagos, Nigeria, in which citizens help to keep the city clean by collecting and sorting plastic waste. The plastic waste is converted into pyrolysis oil in a chemical recycling process and used as feedstock in the production of high-quality chemical products. BASF cooperates with the organizations Wecyclers and RecyclePoints to make this circular value creation process possible. We are also planning to build centers where plastic waste can be collected and converted into pyrolysis oil. In this way, we want to provide local collectors and their families with a regular income in the future.\n\nWe promote resource stewardship with different programs around the world, such as our Water Producer Program. This was established in 2011 through a partnership between BASF's Guaratinguet\u00e1 site in Brazil, the organization Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Espa\u00e7o ECO \u00ae and local government. BASF sponsors the program and wants to strengthen the local community and environment with the initiative. The  program aims  to  support  conservation  measures  usually  performed  by farmers - such as the reforestation of riverbank woodlands, soil restoration and protecting native plants and water sources - with financial assistance and training from the organization's environmental  consultants.  Since  being  founded,  the  program  has supported more than 60 farmers. It directly contributes to water conservation in the Ribeir\u00e3o Guaratinguet\u00e1 basin, which supplies 90% of communities in the area. The Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Espa\u00e7o ECO \u00ae was founded by BASF in Brazil and supports BASF business units and other customers on their journey to becoming more sustainable. The organization celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2020.\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nIn the area of international development work, we support BASF Stiftung, an independent nonprofit organization, with donations for its projects with various U.N. organizations. The 2020 year-end donation campaign in favor of BASF Stiftung supported the United Nations World Food Programme's (WFP) efforts to deliver humanitarian food aid in Yemen. A total of around \u20ac396,600 was raised for WFP from donations by the employees of participating German Group companies and BASF. A donation of \u20ac65 can feed a family in Yemen for one month.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on Starting Ventures, see basf.com/en/starting-ventures\n\nFor more information on social engagement at our sites, see ludwigshafen.basf.de/commitment For more information on our social engagement around the world, see basf.com/en/engagement",

Our Helping Hands aid campaign contributed to the fight against the novel coronavirus - as part of society, as a partner at our sites and as an international company. We used our expertise in research, production, procurement and logistics to help during the crisis.\n\nOur activities to fight the coronavirus were wide-ranging: We produced and donated disinfectant, supplied personal protective equipment, supported medical facilities and food bank initiatives, and contributed our expertise to medical research.\n\n## Production and donation of disinfectants\n\nWithin a very short period of time, we modified production  processes at plants in different countries to manufacture urgently needed disinfectants - products that are not usually part of BASF's portfolio. Employees  in  countries  such  as  Brazil,  Germany,  France,  the Netherlands,  Switzerland,  Spain,  Turkey  and  the  United  States helped to avoid local bottlenecks with their team spirit and great flexibility. In Europe alone, BASF produced more than 900,000 liters of disinfectant between March and December and donated this to hospitals, medical workers, care homes, local government, educational institutions and nonprofit initiatives such as UNO-Fl\u00fcchtlingshilfe, the German partner of the U.N. refugee agency.\n\n## Using our procurement networks\n\nGiven the strained supply situation at the beginning of the  pandemic, we used our procurement networks to purchase more than 100 million protective masks and donate these to the Federal Republic of Germany and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. We also  supported local healthcare facilities in many other countries,  including  Belgium, Brazil, China and the United States, by providing masks, protective eyewear, protective clothing and materials to protective visors free of charge.\n\n## Assistance initiatives and programs for those in need\n\nTogether, BASF SE and BASF Stiftung also established assistance initiatives and programs for those in need. An assistance fund focused on organizations that provide and distribute food to those in need. Other institutions, individuals and BASF employees could also donate to the fund. BASF Stiftung provided assistance to those who have suffered long-term loss of income due to COVID-19 illness or\n\nwhose households were in financial distress as a result of the pandemic. We also donated to hospitals and healthcare providers in the communities surrounding our sites in China, India, Italy, South Korea, Poland and Spain, for example.\n\n## BASF infrastructure supports search for active ingredients\n\nWe also made our expertise and infrastructure available for research into the virus, for example, in the search for active ingredients to treat COVID-19 patients. Our supercomputer Quriosity identified and optimized promising molecules for public research projects (see page 38 for more information). In addition, we opened our expertise and laboratory facilities to T\u00dcV Nord at the BASF Innovation  Campus in Shanghai, China, where quality checks on protective face masks were conducted on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Health.\n\n- For more information on the Helping Hands aid campaign, see basf.com/en/helping-hands",

In the first half of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic led to the worst economic slump since the Second World War. Following a recovery in the third quarter, economic activity in the fourth quarter was again disrupted by rising infection rates and government restric tions in many countries. Global gross domestic  product (GDP) fell by 3.7% year on year (2019: +2.5%). Industrial production contracted by 4.0% (2019: +1.8%). Global chemical production declined by 0.4% (2019: +1.9%). The average price for a barrel of Brent crude oil decreased to $42  per barrel (2019: $64 per barrel).\n\n- For the outlook on the economic environment in 2021, see page 152 onward\n\n## Trends in the global economy in 2020\n\nGlobal gross domestic product declined by 3.7% in 2020 due to supply-side disruptions and weaker demand as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. A sharp decline in economic activity in China in January and February was followed by similar downturns in the rest of the world from March onward. Many companies saw production impacted by government orders and disruptions in interconnected global value chains. Online purchases could not fully compensate for the drop in offline demand. Turnover also  temporarily slumped in the tourism, hospitality and cultural sectors. The resulting losses led to a decline in income and intermediate demand in this sector. Swift and strong intervention by central banks and governments in this exceptional situation prevented the global economy and financial markets from collapsing. Following a dynamic upturn in the third quarter of 2020, rising infection rates from  October onward again made restrictions on economic activity necessary, especially in Europe.\n\nEconomic Environment\n\n## Gross domestic product\n\nReal change compared with previous year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                            |   2020 | -3.7%   |\n|----------------------------|--------|---------|\n|                            |   2019 | 2.5%    |\n| European Union 2           |   2020 | -6.4%   |\n| European Union 2           |   2019 | 1.6%    |\n|                            |   2020 | -3.5%   |\n|                            |   2019 | 2.2%    |\n| Emerging markets of Asia 3 |   2020 | -0.1%   |\n| Emerging markets of Asia 3 |   2019 | 5.3%    |\n|                            |   2020 | -4.8%   |\n|                            |   2019 | 0.3%    |\n| South America              |   2020 | -6.6%   |\n| South America              |   2019 | 0.9%    |\n\n## Economic trends by region\n\n- \u25aa Strongest post-war decline in GDP\n- \u25aa Deep recessions in the E.U. and North America, slight growth in China\n- \u25aa Depreciation of exchange rates in emerging markets\n\nIn the European Union (E.U.) , GDP contracted by 6.4% (2019: +1.6%). Europe's southwest was especially hard hit: Hard lockdowns were ordered in response to high infection rates. GDP fell by 8.3% in France, 8.8% in Italy and even shrank by 11.0% in Spain. German GDP also declined significantly, but less sharply, by 5.3%. The smaller decrease reflected the fact that the export industry benefited from the recovery in China and that the downturn in  private consumption was less pronounced. GDP declined by 9.9% (2019: +1.4%) in the United Kingdom as measures to contain infection rates were taken late, but were stricter and continued for longer. Following an economic slump in the spring and a dynamic recovery in the third quarter, the eastern E.U. countries again recorded a strong rise in infection rates. As a result, governments imposed new partial lockdowns, which negatively impacted the services sector in particular. Overall, GDP in the eastern E.U. countries decreased by 4.4% in 2020 (2019: +3.8%). In Russia , GDP declined by 3.1% (2019: +1.3%). Industrial production in Russia was weighed down by rising infection rates from mid-September onward, weak demand for energy commodities and cuts to oil production. This dampened the economic recovery that began in the third quarter, largely driven by private consumption.\n\nEconomic developments in the United States were very volatile. The crisis left its mark on the unemployment rate here, which jumped from 3.5% at the beginning of the year to 14.8% in April 2020. Personal incomes rose overall as unemployment benefits were significantly bolstered by state aid. As a result, spending on consumer goods remained largely stable, while there was a clear, temporary\n\n- 1 All information relating to past years in this section can deviate from the previous year's report due to statistical revisions.

In the second half of 2020, the easing of restrictions in many states led to a significant recovery and saw the unemployment rate halve. Overall, U.S. GDP fell by 3.5% (2019: +2.2%).\n\nIn the emerging markets of Asia , the impact of the coronavirus pandemic was mixed. Economic output in China dropped considerably as early as the first quarter of 2020. However, a dynamic economic recovery was already underway in the second quarter of 2020 and continued in the second half of the year. Industrial production  and  export  demand  recovered  particularly  quickly,  while domestic consumer demand reacted only after a delay. China was the only major global economy to report growth in 2020, of 2.3% (2019: +6.0%). In India, by contrast, GDP fell by 8.0% after a lockdown lasting several months (2019: +4.2%). Here, too, a strong decline was followed by a clear upturn in the second half of the year. GDP in the remaining emerging markets of Asia declined by an average of 3%. There was considerable variation from country to country.\n\nJapan and South Korea recorded comparatively low infection rates overall. However, these also saw a significant temporary drop in domestic and foreign demand. In Japan , GDP sank by 4.8% (2019: +0.3%). In South Korea, higher government spending and investment cushioned the decline in GDP to only -1.0% (2019: +2.0%).\n\nEconomic Environment\n\nSouth America was severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Brazilian economy was bolstered by strong fiscal stimulus measures. Economic growth started to recover in the second half of the year after restrictions were eased in some regions. The increase in public debt and rising inflation rates led to a significant depreciation of  the  Brazilian  real.  Brazilian  GDP  decreased  by  4.6%  (2019: +1.4%). Argentina saw a much stronger decline in economic output in 2020, falling by 10.4% as a result of a strict lockdown in the spring (2019: -2.1%). The country's renewed debt crisis left little room for government aid. Inflation rates of over 40% negatively impacted private consumption and the Argentine peso lost around half of its value. Exchange rates in the rest of South America remained more stable. GDP losses due to lockdowns and weaker export demand varied significantly and were between -4.8% in Uruguay and -11.9% in Peru. Overall, GDP in South America fell by 6.6% (2019: +0.9%). 1\n\n## Trends in key customer industries\n\n- \u25aa Strong decline in global industrial production\n- \u25aa Weak momentum and partial recovery in the automotive industry\n- \u25aa Stable trend in agriculture\n\nGlobal industrial production contracted by 4.0% in 2020 (2019: +1.8). The advanced economies saw much stronger decreases of 6.5% overall compared with the emerging markets, which only declined by 1.8%. The emerging markets performed better primarily due to the recovery of industrial production in China (2020: +2.6%; 2019: +5.7%). In the remaining emerging markets of Asia, by contrast, industrial production fell by 7.1% overall (2019: +2.1%). Industrial production decreased by 7.8% in the E.U. (2019: -0.2%) and by 10.5% in the United Kingdom (2019: -0.4%). North America (2020: -5.7%; 2019: +1.0%) and South America (2020: -7.5%; 2019: -0.6%) reported similar declines.\n\n## Growth in key customer industries\n\nReal change compared with previous year\n\n| 2020   | -4.0%       |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 2019   | 1.8%        |\n|        | 2020 -15.0% |\n| 2019   | -3.0%       |\n|        | 2020 -16.0% |\n| 2019   | -5.7%       |\n| 2019   | 1.5%        |\n| 2020   | -3.3%       |\n| 2019   | 2.4%        |\n| 2020   | -4.4%       |\n| 2019   | 1.1%        |\n| 2020   | 3.5%        |\n| 2019   | 3.0%        |\n| 2020   | 1.0%        |\n| 2019   | 3.4%        |\n| 2020   | 2.1%        |\n| 2019   | 2.1%        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal automotive production decreased by 16% after already declining by 5.7% in 2019. After a strong slowdown in China in the first quarter of 2020, followed by massive declines in the rest of the world in the second quarter, the rest of the year saw a dynamic recovery. Growth was particularly strong in China, where automotive production already exceeded the prior-year level in the third quarter. However, average annual production in China was still 4.3% below the previous year. The remaining emerging markets of Asia posted much stronger declines in production of around one-quarter.

In the global construction industry , output decreased by 3.3% (2019: +2.4%). Overall, non-residential construction contracted at a slightly stronger rate than the residential and infrastructure segment. Developments varied from region to region: Construction volumes fell by 7.1% in western Europe and by 7.6% in eastern Europe, while North America posted a decrease of only 1.3%. The United States saw an upturn in the housing market, which partially offset developments in non-residential building. In Asia, construction activity declined only slightly by 0.6%. Construction activity grew by 3.5% in China, but shrank by 3.1% in Japan, 1.5% in South Korea and 18.7% in India. The construction industry also contracted significantly by 13.2% in South America. Consumer durables production, for example in the textile and furniture industries, fell by  almost 8% on average. Production also decreased by around 4% (2019: +1.5%) in the energy and resources sector due to weaker demand for energy and industrial commodities. Agricultural production was more stable and grew by 2.1% (2019: 2.1%). The U.S. market achieved considerable growth of 2.8%, benefiting from rising exports to China and unfavorable weather conditions in parts of South America. In western and eastern Europe, by contrast, production declined by 0.8% overall. This was attributable to both dry weather conditions and regional shortages of harvest workers. In South America, agricultural production declined slightly by 0.5%. Production increased by 1.9% in Brazil but decreased by 8.4% in Argentina due to drought. In Asia, production rose by 2.7% compared with the previous years.\n\nEconomic Environment\n\n## Trends in the chemical industry\n\n## \u25aa Global growth much weaker than in prior year and below expectations\n\nContrary to our expectations, global chemical production  contracted by 0.4% in 2020 (2019: +1.9%). As a result, the decline was much less  pronounced  than  in  global  industrial  production.  This  was because less cyclical customer sectors have a higher weighting in the chemical industry and because  demand temporarily rose for disinfectants and cleaning products, protective clothing, single-use packaging and plexiglass.\n\nHowever, there were significant regional differences. In the E.U., chemical  production  decreased  by  around  2%,  with  significant differences between the major production locations. While production only  declined by between 1% and 3% in Belgium, Germany and Spain, and was virtually unchanged in the Netherlands, it fell by around 8% in Italy and by around 9% in France. Chemical production  decreased by 4.6% in North America and by 1.1% in South America.\n\nBy contrast, China, the world's largest chemical market, increased volumes by 3.4%. In the rest of Asia, on the other hand, chemical production declined, in some countries significantly (Japan: -9.8%; Malaysia: -6.2%; India: -5.4%; South Korea: -3.2%). As a result, chemical production in Asia only increased by around 1%.\n\n## Chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| World                    |   2020 | -0.4%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|---------|\n| World                    |   2019 | 1.9%    |\n|                          |   2020 | -1.9%   |\n|                          |   2019 | -1.2%   |\n|                          |   2020 | -4.3%   |\n|                          |   2019 | -0.1%   |\n| Emerging markets of Asia |   2020 | 2.3%    |\n| Emerging markets of Asia |   2019 | 4.0%    |\n|                          |   2020 | -9.8%   |\n|                          |   2019 | -0.2%   |\n|                          |   2020 | -1.1%   |\n|                          |   2019 | -1.3%   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the Chemicals segment, this was primarily attributable to lower margins. In the Surface Technologies segment, it was mostly the result of lower volumes in the Coatings division. EBIT before special items also declined considerably in Other and in the Materials and Agricultural Solutions segments. The decrease in the Materials segment was mainly due to lower polyamide margins and volumes. EBIT before special items was lower in the Agricultural Solutions segment, largely from currency effects. In the Nutrition & Care segment, EBIT before special items declined slightly as a result of the sales performance and a one-off payment in the Care Chemicals division in the previous year. In the Industrial Solutions segment, EBIT before special items was on a level with the previous year.\n\n- For an explanation of the indicator EBIT before special items, see page 34\n\n## EBIT before special items a, b, c\n\n|   Million \u20ac |       |\n|-------------|-------|\n|        2020 | 3,560 |\n|        2019 | 4,643 |\n|        2018 | 6,281 |\n|        2017 | 7,645 |\n|        2016 | 6,309 |\n\n- a EBIT before special items for 2019 has been restated to reflect the reclassification of income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method to net income from shareholdings.

Figures for 2016 have not been restated.\n\nSpecial items in EBIT totaled -\u20ac3,751 million in 2020, compared with -\u20ac442 million in the previous year. The increase in special items is primarily attributable to the impairments of \u20ac2.9 billion on property, plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets,  which  were  mainly reported under other charges and income. Expenses of \u20ac76 million arose in connection with divestitures, mainly from the carve-out of our global pigments business. We recorded a positive earnings contribution of \u20ac286 million in the previous year, in particular from the transfer of BASF's paper and water chemicals business to the  Solenis group and the sale of businesses in the Agricultural Solutions segment in accordance with the conditions imposed by antitrust authorities in connection with the acquisition of the Bayer businesses. In addition, expenses from restructuring measures rose by \u20ac325 million compared with the previous year to \u20ac952 million. These largely related to expenses for measures to streamline the global glufosinateammonium production network and provisions in connection with the realignment of the Global Business Services unit. Integration costs amounted to \u20ac157 million in 2020, mainly for the integrated poly am ide business acquired from Solvay. In the previous year, we recorded integration costs of \u20ac303 million, primarily for the integration of the businesses acquired from Bayer in the Agricultural Solutions segment.\n\nFor the definition of special items, see page 34",

Capital employed declined, mainly due to the impairments recognized as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, and currency effects. 1\n\n- For more information on the determination of ROCE, see page 33\n\nThe calculation of EBIT as part of our statement of income is shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 222\n\n## ROCE\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                        |        |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                  | 2020   | 2019   |\n| EBIT of BASF Group                                               | -191   | 4,201  |\n| - EBIT of Other                                                  | -1,203 | -518   |\n| EBIT of the segments                                             | 1,012  | 4,719  |\n| Cost of capital basis of segments, average of  month-end figures | 60,111 | 60,900 |\n| ROCE                                                             | 1.7    | 7.7    |\n\n## Capital employed\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Intangible assets                                                           | 14,249 | 14,832 |\n| + Property, plant and equipment                                             | 20,210 | 20,472 |\n| +  Integral investments accounted for using the equity  method              | 1,395  | 1,527  |\n| + Inventories                                                               | 10,469 | 11,593 |\n| + Accounts receivable, trade                                                | 9,379  | 10,061 |\n| +  Current and noncurrent other receivables and other  assets a             | 3,149  | 1,913  |\n| + Assets of disposal groups                                                 | 1,260  | 502    |\n| Cost of capital basis of segments, average of  month-end figures            | 60,111 | 60,900 |\n| +  Deviation from cost of capital basis at closing rates  as of December 31 | -3,948 | -1,534 |\n| + Assets not included in cost of capital                                    | 24,129 | 27,584 |\n| of which disposal group for the construction        chemicals business      | -      | 2,706  |\n| Assets of the BASF Group as of December 31                                  | 80,292 | 86,950 |\n\n- a Including customer/supplier financing and other adjustments",

The decrease was primarily due to impair ments of assets at the Wintershall Dea group, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany, in the amount of \u20ac791 million, mainly as a result of lower oil and gas price forecasts and changed reserve estimates. This  reduced Wintershall Dea's earnings contribution from -\u20ac86 million in the previous year to -\u20ac890 million. The contribution from Solenis UK International Ltd., London, United Kingdom, improved by \u20ac25 million year on year to -\u20ac46 million. Higher income from other  shareholdings,  primarily  due  to  write-ups,  had  a  positive impact on net income from shareholdings.\n\nThe financial result amounted to -\u20ac462 million in 2020, compared with -\u20ac705 million in the previous year.\n\nThe interest result improved by \u20ac92 million to -\u20ac373 million, due in part to lower interest expenses for financial indebtedness. The other financial result improved by \u20ac151 million to -\u20ac89 million, primarily driven by lower expenses in connection with bonds in foreign currency and the corresponding hedging instruments, as well as by lower net interest expenses from pension and similar obligations. Higher interest income on income taxes also contributed here.\n\nIncome before income taxes decreased from \u20ac3,302 million in the previous year to -\u20ac1,562 million in 2020, mainly as a result of the impairments described above.\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nThe negative income before income taxes led to tax income of \u20ac91 million, after a tax expense of \u20ac756 million in 2019. As not all impairments were tax deductible, the BASF Group's tax rate was only 5.8% in 2020 (previous year: 22.9%).\n\nIncome  after  taxes from  continuing  operations  declined  from \u20ac2,546 million to -\u20ac1,471 million. Income after taxes from discontinued  operations decreased  from  \u20ac5,945  million  in  2019  to \u20ac396 million in 2020. The 2020 figure includes the book gain of \u20ac358 million from the sale of the construction chemicals business and the income after taxes of the former Construction Chemicals division until November 30, 2020. 2 This amounted to \u20ac38 million, \u20ac14 million above the figure for the full year 2019. In the previous year, income after taxes from discontinued operations included the book gain of \u20ac5,684 million on the deconsolidation of the Wintershall companies and their income after taxes until deconsolidation on April 30, 2019.\n\nNoncontrolling interests generated income of \u20ac15 million, after expenses of \u20ac70 million in 2019. This was due to higher losses at BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn. Bhd., Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as a result of impairments, as well as from lower earnings at BASF Total Petrochemicals in Port Arthur, Texas, owing to an unplanned outage of the steam cracker. The prior-year figure also included the shares in the gas transportation companies until deconsolidation on April 30, 2019.\n\nNet income amounted to -\u20ac1,060 million, considerably below the prior-year figure of \u20ac8,421 million. This was primarily attributable to the impairments recognized in 2020 as described above. The prior-year figure included the book gain from the deconsolidation of\n\nthe Wintershall companies. Earnings per share were -\u20ac1.15, compared with \u20ac9.17 in 2019.\n\n- For information on the items in the statement of income, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 228 onward For information on the tax rate, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 259 onward\n- For more information on the results of operations of discontinued operations, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 239\n\n## Additional indicators for results of operations\n\n- \u25aa Adjusted earnings per share decline from \u20ac4.00 to \u20ac3.21\n- \u25aa EBITDA before special items and EBITDA considerably below previous year\n\nWe also use alternative performance measures (APMs) to steer the BASF Group. Investors, analysts and rating agencies use them to assess our performance. These are not defined by IFRS. As such, the methods of calculation can differ from those used by other companies. Alternative performance measures for the results of operations are EBIT before special items, EBITDA before special items, EBITDA, the EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per share. Other APMs are net debt, 3 free cash flow 3 and capital expenditure (capex). 4\n\nIncome from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items) and income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are indicators  that  describe  operational  performance  independent  of age-related depreciation and amortization of assets and any impairment or reversal of impairment. Both figures are therefore particularly useful in cross-company comparisons. EBITDA before special items is also highly useful in making comparisons over time. The EBITDA margin is a relative indicator and is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA to sales revenue, enabling operational performance to be compared independent of the size of the underlying business.\n\n- 1 To increase reporting transparency, as of January 1, 2020, companies accounted for using the equity method that are not an integral part of the BASF Group are classified as purely financial investments and presented under net income from shareholdings. For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 228.\n- 2 The construction chemicals business was transferred in two steps, on September  30, 2020, and on November 30, 2020.\n- 3 For more information on these indicators, see the Financial Position from page 63 onward\n- 4 For more information on capex, see Value-Based Management on page 34 and Material Investments and Portfolio Measures on page 50",

Amortization, impairment and reversal of impairment on intangible assets are then eliminated. Amortization of intangible assets primarily results from the purchase price allocation following acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary nature. The effects of these adjustments on income taxes and on noncontrolling interests are also considered. This makes adjusted earnings per share a suitable measure for making comparisons over time and predicting future profitability.\n\nIn 2020, adjusted earnings per share amounted to \u20ac3.21, compared with \u20ac4.00 in the previous year.\n\n- For information on the earnings per share according to IFRS, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 248",

For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 228.\n\n## Assets\n\n- \u25aa Decline in total assets due to impairments and divestiture of the construction chemicals business\n\nTotal assets amounted to \u20ac80,292 million as of December 31, 2020, significantly below the prior-year level (\u20ac86,950 million).\n\nNoncurrent assets declined by \u20ac5,536 million to \u20ac50,424 million. All items except deferred tax assets contributed here. The main driver was the \u20ac2,145 million decrease in property, plant and equipment to \u20ac19,647 million, primarily due to the impairments recognized as a consequence  of  the  coronavirus  pandemic.  Negative  currency effects of \u20ac934 million also contributed to the decline. Additions to property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac4,075  million. This figure included additions of \u20ac559 million from the acquisition of the integrated polyamide business from Solvay. Depreciation amounted to  \u20ac3,130  million.  At  \u20ac10,874  million,  non-integral  investments accounted for using the equity method were also considerably below the prior-year level (\u20ac13,123 million), mainly as a result of impair ments and currency effects relating to the shareholding in Winters hall Dea. Integral investments accounted for using the equity method were on a level with the prior year, at \u20ac1,878 million.\n\nIntangible assets declined by \u20ac1,380 million to \u20ac13,145 million. This was likewise primarily attributable to impairments, amortization and currency effects. Additions of \u20ac691 million, mainly in connection with the acquisition of the integrated polyamide business from Solvay, had an offsetting effect.\n\n- More information on the above transactions can be found on page 51 of this Management's Report and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 235 onward",

Other receivables and miscellaneous assets decreased by \u20ac200  million compared with the previous year to \u20ac912  million. This was mainly due to the lower positive fair values of derivatives and the decline in loans and interest receivables.\n\nDeferred tax assets rose by \u20ac499 million to \u20ac3,386 million, primarily as a result of higher pension provisions and the recognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards.\n\nCurrent assets declined by \u20ac1,122 million to \u20ac29,868 million. This was largely the result of the derecognition of the disposal group for the construction chemicals business (\u20ac2,831 million). We recorded a \u20ac1,213 million decrease in inventories to \u20ac10,010 million, mainly due to the reduction in inventories in all segments and currency effects. Marketable securities declined by \u20ac237 million to \u20ac207 million.\n\nThis was partially offset by the \u20ac1,903 million increase in cash and cash equivalents compared with the previous year. At \u20ac4,330 million, this safeguards the BASF Group's liquidity in times of crisis.\n\nOther receivables and miscellaneous assets rose by \u20ac3,790 million to \u20ac4,673 million, driven mainly by an increase in precious metal trading positions due to higher prices, as well as higher tax refund claims.\n\nThe \u20ac373 million increase in trade accounts receivable to \u20ac9,466 million was largely attributable to strong business developments in the fourth quarter.\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual asset items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 228 onward\n- 3 Corporate Governance",

Retained earnings declined by \u20ac4,145 million to \u20ac37,911 million. This was the result of dividend payments for 2019 and negative net income for 2020. Other comprehensive income amounted to -\u20ac8,474 million, after -\u20ac4,850 million in the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to currency effects and actuarial losses.\n\nThe equity ratio decreased from 48.7% to 42.8%.\n\nCompared  with  the  end  of  2019,  noncurrent  liabilities  rose  by \u20ac1,618 million to \u20ac29,614 million. This was primarily attributable to the increase in provisions for pensions and similar obligations from \u20ac7,683 million to \u20ac8,566 million, mainly as a result of slightly lower discount rates in all relevant currency zones.\n\nIn addition, noncurrent financial indebtedness rose by \u20ac804 million to \u20ac15,819 million. This was mainly due to the issue of two eurobonds (including one green bond) in the amount of \u20ac1 billion each, as well as new bank loans taken out for approximately \u20ac500 million. The reclassification of a eurobond with a carrying amount of around \u20ac1 billion to current financial indebtedness and the early repayment of U.S. bonds worth around \u20ac400 million had an offsetting effect. At \u20ac1,484 million, other provisions were \u20ac144 million below the figure as of December 31, 2019.",

This was partially offset by higher provisions for restructuring measures. Tax liabilities rose by \u20ac232 million compared with the previous year to \u20ac988 million. Trade accounts payable increased by \u20ac204 million to \u20ac5,291 million.\n\nAt \u20ac3,395 million, current financial indebtedness was \u20ac33 million above the prior-year figure. This was mainly due to the abovementioned reclassification of the eurobond from noncurrent to current financial indebtedness and the issue of commercial paper. The increase was largely offset by the planned repayment of eurobonds worth around \u20ac1,300 million.\n\nNet debt declined by \u20ac829 million compared with December 31, 2019, to \u20ac14,677 million as cash and cash equivalents rose at a faster rate than financial indebtedness.\n\n- For more information on the composition and development of individual balance sheet items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 228 onward\n\nFor more information on the development of the balance sheet, see the Ten-Year Summary on pages 314 to 317\n\n## Net debt\n\n| Million \u20ac                         |                    |                    |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                   | December 31,  2020 | December 31,  2019 |\n| Noncurrent financial indebtedness | 15,819             | 15,015             |\n| + Current financial indebtedness  | 3,395              | 3,362              |\n| Financial indebtedness            | 19,214             | 18,377             |\n| - Marketable securities           | 207                | 444                |\n| - Cash and cash equivalents       | 4,330              | 2,427              |\n| Net debt                          | 14,677             | 15,506             |\n\n## Financing policy and credit ratings\n\n- \u25aa Financing principles remain unchanged\n- \u25aa Rated A by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch\n\nOur financing policy aims to ensure our solvency at all times, limiting the risks associated with financing and optimizing our cost of  capital. We preferably meet our external financing needs on the  international capital markets.\n\nWe strive to maintain a solid A rating, which ensures unrestricted access to financial and capital markets. Our financing measures are aligned with our operational business planning as well as the company's strategic direction and also ensure the financial flexibility to take advantage of strategic options.\n\n## Maturities of financial indebtedness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Million \u20ac       |       |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| 2021            | 3,395 |\n| 2022            | 2,310 |\n| 2023            | 2,121 |\n| 2024            | 1,351 |\n| 2025            | 1,787 |\n| 2026 and beyond | 8,250 |\n\nBASF enjoys good credit ratings, especially compared with competitors in the chemical industry. On December 8, 2020, Standard & Poor's confirmed its long and short-term ratings for BASF of A/A-1/outlook negative. Fitch confirmed its rating for BASF of A/F1/outlook stable on February 12, 2021. Moody's confirmed its rating for BASF of  A3/P-2/outlook stable on February 12, 2021.\n\nWe have solid financing. Corporate bonds form the basis of our medium to long-term debt financing. These are issued in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part of our \u20ac20 billion debt issuance program. The goal is to create a balanced maturity profile, diversify our investor base and optimize our debt capital financing  conditions.\n\nFor short-term financing, we use BASF  SE's global commercial paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to $12.5 billion. As of December 31, 2020, commercial paper with a carrying amount of \u20ac1,290  million was outstanding under this program. A firmly committed, syndicated credit line of \u20ac6  billion was taken out in January 2019 to cover the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. It can also be used for general company purposes. In the second quarter of 2020, we took out a one-year credit line with several banks with a total volume of \u20ac3 billion. Neither credit line was used at any point in 2020. Our external financing is therefore largely independent of short-term fluctuations in the credit markets.",

Foreign currency risks are primarily hedged centrally using derivative financial instruments in the market.\n\nOur interest risk management generally pursues the goal of reducing interest expenses for the BASF Group and limiting interest risks. Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore conducted with banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the capital market from fixed to variable interest rates or vice versa.\n\n- For more information on the financing tools and hedging instruments used, see Note 21 from page 279 onward and Note 26 from page 291 onward in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\n- \u25aa Cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow lower year on year\n\nCash flows from operating activities amounted to \u20ac5,413 million, compared with \u20ac7,474 million in the previous year. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was largely due to the cash tied up in receivables, especially in trade accounts receivable. The development of trade accounts receivable tied up cash of \u20ac994 million in 2020, compared with cash released of \u20ac1,208 million in the previous year. This could not be offset by the \u20ac370 million increase in cash released from reduction in inventories.\n\nAt -\u20ac1,060 million, net income was down \u20ac9,481 million from the prior-year figure in 2020. However, the main causes of the decline in earnings did not affect cash flows from operating activities: net divestiture and disposal gains, which were \u20ac6,060 million higher in the previous year, were reclassified using miscellaneous items to  cash  flows  from  investing  activities.  Moreover,  depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets exceeded the prior-year figure by \u20ac2,533 million due to higher impair ments. In addition, negative income from companies accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  reduced  earnings  by \u20ac821 million in 2020 compared with the previous year. This likewise did not have any effect on cash.\n\nCash flows from investing activities amounted to -\u20ac1,904 million in 2020, meaning that cash outflows were \u20ac714 million higher than in the previous year. This was mainly attributable to the \u20ac1,001 million increase in payments made for acquisitions. In 2020, \u20ac1,240 million was paid for the polyamide business acquired from Solvay. Payments received from divestitures were at the prior-year level. In addition, cash inflows from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in 2020 was \u20ac677 million lower than  in  the  previous  year.  This  was  offset  by  the  \u20ac695  million\n\ndecrease to \u20ac3,129 million in payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nCash flows from financing activities amounted to -\u20ac1,556 million, compared with -\u20ac6,405 million in the previous year. Dividend payments of \u20ac3,139 million were partially offset by the net cash inflow of \u20ac1,580 million from the change in financial and similar liabilities. The total cash outflow of \u20ac6,405 million in the previous year was due in particular to the net cash outflow from the change in financial and similar liabilities and dividend payments of \u20ac3,064 million.\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  amounted  to  \u20ac4,335  million  as  of December 31, 2020. They rose by a cash-effective amount of \u20ac1,953 million in 2020.\n\nFree cash flow , which remains after deducting payments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from cash flows from operating activities, represents the financial resources remaining after investments. It declined to \u20ac2,284 million compared with \u20ac3,650 million in the previous year due to the decrease in cash flows from operating activities.",

Sales development in the Chemicals, Industrial Solutions and Materials segments in particular was weaker than expected at the beginning of 2020. Lower demand as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic led to a slight overall decline in volumes in the BASF  Group, contrary to our assumptions. After forecasting lower prices, we were able to slightly increase price levels as a result of significantly higher precious metal prices. EBIT before special items amounted to \u20ac3,560 million, falling short of the \u20ac4.2 billion to \u20ac4.8 billion range we had forecast in February 2020. Earnings developments did not meet our expectations, especially in the Surface Tech nologies and Agricultural Solutions segments and in Other. The BASF  Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) declined considerably rather than slightly compared with 2019. ROCE was also considerably below the cost of capital percentage. In April 2020, we withdrew the outlook provided in February 2020 due to the uncertainty surrounding the length and spread of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the measures to contain it. In October 2020, we forecast sales of between \u20ac57 billion and \u20ac58 billion. We  expected EBIT before special items of between \u20ac3.0 billion and \u20ac3.3 billion and a ROCE of between 0.0% and 1.0%.\n\nSales in the Chemicals segment declined considerably in 2020, after we had expected slight growth at the beginning of the year. This was largely the result of lower prices than expected in both divisions. Also, volumes were at the prior-year level overall, contrary to our forecast of volume growth. We were able to  increase volumes in the Intermediates division as planned. By contrast, sales volumes in the Petrochemicals division remained at the prior-year level. This was primarily due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and lower product availability owing to the unplanned outage at the steam cracker in Port Arthur, Texas. EBIT before special items declined considerably as expected. ROCE declined considerably\n\nActual Development Compared With Outlook for 2020\n\n## Forecast/actual comparison a\n\nSales\n\n## EBIT before special items\n\nROCE\n\n| Chemicals              | 2020 forecast slight increase   | 2020 actual considerable decline   | 2020 forecast considerable decline        | 2020 actual considerable decline   | 2020 forecast slight increase   | 2020 actual considerable decline considerable decline   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Materials              | considerable increase           | considerable decline               | considerable decline                      | considerable decline               | considerable decline            |                                                         |\n| Industrial Solutions   | slight increase                 | considerable decline               | considerable increase                     | at prior-year level                | considerable decline            | considerable decline                                    |\n| Surface Technologies   | slight increase                 | considerable increase              | slight increase                           | considerable decline               | at prior-year level             | considerable decline                                    |\n|                        | considerable increase           | slight decline                     | slight increase                           |                                    | considerable increase           | slight increase                                         |\n| Nutrition & Care       |                                 |                                    |                                           | slight decline                     |                                 |                                                         |\n| Agricultural Solutions | considerable increase           | slight decline                     | slight increase                           | considerable decline               | slight increase                 | considerable decline                                    |\n| Other                  | at prior-year level             | considerable decline               | considerable increase b                   | considerable decline               | -                               | -                                                       |\n| BASF Group             | \u20ac60 billion-\u20ac63 billion b       |                                    | \u20ac59,149 million \u20ac4.2 billion-\u20ac4.8 billion | \u20ac3,560 million                     | 6.7%-7.7% b                     | 1.7%                                                    |\n\n- a For sales, 'slight' represents a change of 1-5%, while 'considerable' applies to changes of 6% and higher. 'At prior-year level' indicates no change (+/-0%). For earnings, 'slight' means a change of 1-10%, while 'considerable' is used for changes of 11% and higher. 'At prior-year level' indicates no change (+/-0%). At a cost of capital percentage of 9% for 2020, we define a change in ROCE of 0.1 to 1.0 percentage points as 'slight,' a change of more than 1.0 percentage points as 'considerable' and no change (+/-0 percentage points) as 'at prior-year level.'\n- b We withdrew our outlook in April 2020 and updated it in October 2020, forecasting sales of between \u20ac57 billion and \u20ac58 billion, EBIT before special items of between \u20ac3.0 billion and \u20ac3.3 billion, and a ROCE of between 0.0% and 1.0%.\n\ninstead of rising slightly as expected. This was due to lower margins in both divisions as a result of the effects of the corona virus pandemic and special charges, mainly for impairments on property, plant and equipment.\n\nSales in the Materials segment declined considerably, contrary to our forecast of considerable sales growth. Lower prices and negative currency effects exceeded the positive contribution from the acquisition of Solvay's integrated polyamide business. Volumes did not meet expectations either and were lower rather than higher. This was mainly attributable to weaker demand from our customer indus tries as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, especially from the  automotive  industry.  EBIT  before  special  items  and  ROCE declined considerably as expected.\n\nSales in the Industrial Solutions segment declined considerably, falling short of our expectations of slight growth. This was primarily due to lower price levels in both divisions. Contrary to our forecast, we recorded lower volumes in the Performance Chemicals division.\n\nIn the Dispersions  & Pigments division, too, sales volumes were merely on a level with the previous year. In a continued challenging market environment, the segment's EBIT before special items was at the prior-year level, after we had forecast a considerable increase. This was mainly driven by volumes development. ROCE was considerably below the prior-year level, as expected.\n\nWe considerably improved sales in the Surface Technologies segment, outperforming our forecast of a slight increase. The increase was primarily attributable to considerably higher sales in the Catalysts division as a result of higher precious metal prices. This more than offset the sales decrease in the Coatings division, which declined considerably rather than slightly. EBIT before special items declined considerably, contrary to our expectations of a slight  increase. This was mainly due to volumes development in the Coatings division and higher fixed costs in the Catalysts division. Improved earnings in precious metal trading were unable to compensate for this. ROCE declined considerably and was thus below our expectations. This was largely the result of special charges,",

Although both divisions increased sales volumes as forecast, this was unable to compensate for negative currency effects and the expected decrease in price levels. EBIT before special items also declined slightly instead of rising slightly, mainly as a result of sales developments. Rather than  increasing considerably as expected, ROCE rose only slightly, primarily due to impairments in connection with the optimization of production sites within the Nutrition & Health division.\n\nContrary to our forecast at the beginning of the year of a considerable increase, sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment declined slightly in a continued challenging market environment. We only increased sales volumes slightly, not considerably, which meant that significantly negative currency effects could not be offset. EBIT before special items declined considerably as a result. We had anticipated a slight increase at the beginning of 2020. ROCE also declined  con sider ably,  contrary  to  our  assumption  of  a  slight increase. This was primarily due to special charges for streamlining the global glufosinate- ammonium production network.\n\nSales in Other were considerably below the previous year in 2020, instead of being at the 2019 level as expected. This was mainly due to the sales decrease in commodity trading and the remaining activities of BASF's paper and water chemicals business, which were not part of the transfer to Solenis and are reported under Other. We were unable to considerably increase EBIT before special items as forecast. Instead, EBIT before special items declined considerably due to lower contributions from other businesses.\n\nActual Development Compared With Outlook for 2020\n\nIn 2020, we invested a total of \u20ac2.9 billion in capital expenditures (capex), excluding additions from acquisitions, IT investments, restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases. The figure forecast in February 2020 was \u20ac3.4  billion and the figure forecast in April 2020 was \u20ac2.8 billion.\n\n- For information on our expectations for 2021, see page 155 onward For information on investments, see page 50",

Its production facilities supply BASF's segments with basic chemicals and intermediates to produce higher value-added products. In this way, the segment makes a significant contribution to BASF's organic growth.  The  Chemicals  segment  is  also  a  reliable  supplier and provides chemicals of consistently high quality and markets them to customers in downstream industries.\n\nWe create value through process and product innovation and invest in  research  and  development  to  implement  new,  sustainable technologies and to make our existing technologies even more efficient.  Technological  leadership,  operational  excellence  and  a clear focus on individual value chains are among our most important competitive advantages. We concentrate on the critical success factors of the classic chemicals business: leveraging economies of scale and the advantages of our Verbund, high asset reliability, continuous optimization of access to raw materials, lean and energy efficient processes, and reliable, cost-effective logistics. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our global production structures and aligning these with regional market requirements. We continuously improve our value chains and are expanding our market position - especially in Asia - with investments and collaborations in growth markets.\n\n## How we create value - an example\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ChemCycling TM\n\nAn innovative approach to recycling plastic waste\n\n## Value for the environment\n\nRecycled raw materials used in the Verbund from 2025 onward\n\n## 250,000 metric tons\n\nChemCycling TM is a vital lever in creating a circular economy for plastics. The project covers plastic waste for which high-value processing is not yet available and makes it possible to produce virgin-grade chemical products from recycled feedstocks. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions are lower than for conventional products made from primary fossil resources as the waste is  no  longer  incinerated.  In  2020,  we  processed  around 1,000  metric tons of recycled raw materials in the Verbund, saving the same amount of fossil resources. We plan to successively  increase the use of recycled feedstocks over the coming years. The ChemCycling TM project will play a significant part in achieving BASF's target of using 250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based feedstocks annually from 2025 onward.\n\nFor more information on ChemCycling TM , see page 116 onward\n\nValue for BASF and for our customers\n\nNumber of sales products using recycled raw materials\n\n## 40 products\n\nAs part of its ChemCycling TM project, BASF uses pyrolysis oil produced by partners from post-consumer plastic waste as a feedstock in its Verbund production. We manufacture virgin-grade plastics from the pyrolysis oil according to a mass balance approach. Currently, BASF already has 40 independently certified sales products with an allocated share of recycled raw materials in its portfolio. These products have the same  properties as those produced from fossil raw materials. This means that our customers can process them in the same way as conventionally produced products and use them in demanding applications such as food packaging or automotive parts. Our customers commercially marketed the first applications based on  chemically recycled plastic waste in 2020.",

The global economic uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic led the partners to put the project on hold in November 2020. The partners remain convinced of the strong fundamentals represented by the Indian market and have agreed to re-examine market conditions in the future.\n\nIn our existing 50:50 joint venture BASF-YPC Company Limited (BYC) in Nanjing, China, BASF and Sinopec plan to further expand the site to strengthen the joint production of chemical products in China. In addition, in 2020 we increased the production capacity for neopentyl glycol at the Nanjing site to further support the growth of our customers in China. Strategically, we continue to invest in growth markets, such as the planned expansion of production capacities for tertiary  butylamines in Nanjing, China, by 2022.\n\nAt our Verbund site in Antwerp, Belgium, we are expanding our ethylene oxide plant. The project also includes several downstream plants, for example, to produce surfactants. After completing the multi-stage startup process for the new, highly efficient acetylene plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we have improved our competitiveness and strengthened the product line's sustainability.\n\nAs part of the global optimization of production structures, BASF Idemitsu Co. Ltd, a joint venture between BASF and Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd., closed a production plant for butanediol in Chiba, Japan, in 2020. Another butanediol plant operated by our joint venture BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn. Bhd. in Kuantan, Malaysia, will be closed in 2021.\n\n## Products, customers and applications\n\n| Division       | Products                                                                                                                                                                           | Customer industries and applications                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Petrochemicals | Ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene,  alcohols, solvents, plasticizers, alkylene oxides,  glycols, acrylic monomers, styrene and  polystyrene, styrenic foams, superabsorbents | Use in the BASF Verbund Chemical and plastics industry, construction,  detergent, hygiene, automotive, packaging and  textile industries; production of paints, coatings,  cosmetics, oilfield and paper chemicals |\n| Intermediates  | Basic products: butanediol and derivatives,  alkylamines and alkanolamines, neopentyl glycol,  formic and propionic acid                                                           | Use in the BASF Verbund Chemical, plastics, coatings, construction,                                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Material investments\n\n| Location                             | Project                           | Additional annual capacity  through expansion (metric tons)   | Total annual capacity  (metric tons)   |   Startup |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Antwerp, Belgium                     | Expansion: ethylene oxide plant   | n/a                                                           | n/a                                    |      2022 |\n| Nanjing, China a                     | Expansion: neopentyl glycol plant | 40,000                                                        | 80,000                                 |      2020 |\n| Expansion: tertiary butylamine plant |                                   | 30% increase                                                  | -                                      |      2022 |\n\n- a Operated by a joint venture with Sinopec",

This was primarily due to the considerable decrease in the Petrochemicals division, where sales declined by \u20ac1,244 million to \u20ac5,426 million. At \u20ac2,645  million, sales in the Intermediates division decreased by \u20ac217 million compared with the prior-year figure.\n\n## Factors influencing sales - Chemicals\n\n|            | Chemicals   | Petrochemicals   | Intermediates   |\n|------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Volumes    | 0%          | 0%               | 1%              |\n| Prices     | -13%        | -17%             | -7%             |\n| Portfolio  | 0%          | 0%               | 0%              |\n| Currencies | -2%         | -2%              | -2%             |\n| Sales      | -15%        | -19%             | -8%             |\n\nSales development was mainly driven by significantly lower prices. In the Petrochemicals division, prices declined in almost all value chains as a result of lower raw materials prices and higher product availability on the market. Higher product availability on the market also led to lower prices in the Intermediates division, particularly in the acids and polyalcohols business and in the butanediol and derivatives  business.  Sales  were  also  negatively  impacted  by currency  effects.\n\n## Segment data - Chemicals\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                                  |        |        |      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|\n|                                                                            | 2020   | 2019   | +/-  |\n| Sales to third parties                                                     | 8,071  | 9,532  | -15% |\n| of which Petrochemicals                                                    | 5,426  | 6,670  | -19% |\n| Intermediates                                                              | 2,645  | 2,862  | -8%  |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                     | 2,861  | 3,428  | -17% |\n| Sales including transfers                                                  | 10,932 | 12,960 | -16% |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | 1,305  | 1,574  | -17% |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | 1,237  | 1,545  | -20% |\n| EBITDA margin                                                              | 15.3   | 16.2   | -    |\n| Depreciation and amortization a                                            | 1,429  | 923    | 55%  |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | -192   | 622    | .    |\n| Special items                                                              | -637   | -169   | .    |\n| EBIT before special items                                                  | 445    | 791    | -44% |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE)                                          | -2.2   | 6.8    | -    |\n| Assets                                                                     | 7,896  | 8,978  | -12% |\n| Investments including acquisitions b                                       | 871    | 1,108  | -21% |\n| Research and development expenses                                          | 96     | 108    | -11% |\n\n- a Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including impairments and reversals of impairments)\n- b Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nVolumes matched the prior-year level. The Intermediates division recorded slightly higher volumes in Asia, mainly in the amines business. This was offset by lower sales volumes,  especially in the amines business in Europe and in the butanediol and derivatives business in North America. In the Petrochemicals division, volumes were at the level of the previous year. Sales  volumes declined, primarily due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the unplanned outage at the steam cracker in Port Arthur, Texas. The main offsetting factor was higher volumes of steam cracker products in Europe.\n\n## Petrochemicals - Sales by region\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our major integrated isocyanate and polyamide value chains are complemented by a number of specialties for the plastics and plastics processing industries. The Materials segment offers specially developed polymers and solutions  to  customer  industries  such  as  automotive,  construction, electrical and electronics, and consumer goods.\n\nWe cater to the growing needs of consumers in all key markets by developing new applications, high-performance materials, systems and digital solutions. Application know-how, industry knowledge and customer proximity are key differentiators. BASF's competence in this field is extended by advanced material simulation capabilities, which are a unique selling proposition in the industry.\n\nAdditional differentiators, which continue to gain importance, are our products that enable a circular economy and our sustainable production approaches. BASF plays a vital role in substantial parts of plastic  value  chains,  from  monomers  to  polymers  and  their formulated specialties. This offers us the unique opportunity to shape and close cycles with our technological capabilities. One example is a recent development of a chemical recycling process for used mattresses.\n\nDifferentiated service and product offerings enable us to continuously expand the application horizon of our portfolio. The segment's global production network allows us to operate close to our customers.\n\n- 2 Management's Report Materials\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## How we create value - an example\n\n## Adipic acid\n\nMore sustainable adipic acid production in Ludwigshafen reduces carbon footprint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValue for the environment\n\nCO2 avoided per year\n\n## 100,000 metric tons\n\nThe  synthesis  of  adipic  acid  is  a  very  complex  process  in which  nitrous  oxide  is  produced.  BASF  re-uses  the  nitrous oxide in the Verbund instead of decomposing it, as is usual in the chemicals industry. Most of the nitrous oxide is isolated and used as a feedstock in the Intermediates division. BASF avoids 100,000 metric tons of CO2 per year through investments in our production plants and the strength of our Verbund in Ludwigs hafen, Germany. The carbon footprint can be further reduced  with   additional  measures  such  as  using  the  mass balance  approach, electricity from renewable sources and the ChemCycling\u2122 method.\n\nOn January  31, 2020, BASF closed the acquisition of Solvay's integrated polyamide business, which was agreed in September 2017. The transaction broadens BASF's polyamide capabilities, allowing us to support our customers with even better engineering plastics  solutions  for  applications  such  as  autonomous  driving and e-mobility. It also enhances access to growth markets in Asia as well as in North and South America.

The decline was mostly attributable to the Performance Materials division, where sales decreased by \u20ac429 million year on year to \u20ac5,635 million. The Monomers division recorded a sales decrease of \u20ac301  million to \u20ac5,101 million.\n\n## Factors influencing sales - Materials\n\n|            | Materials   | Performance  Materials   | Monomers   |\n|------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| Volumes    | -5%         | -6%                      | -4%        |\n| Prices     | -5%         | -4%                      | -7%        |\n| Portfolio  | 6%          | 5%                       | 7%         |\n| Currencies | -2%         | -2%                      | -2%        |\n| Sales      | -6%         | -7%                      | -6%        |\n\nThe sales decrease was due in part to lower prices. In the Monomers division, prices levels declined for polyamides in particular due to lower raw materials prices and higher product availability on the market. Isocyanate prices also decreased. In the Performance Materials division, prices declined for engineering plastics and polyurethane systems in particular as a result of lower raw materials prices.\n\nSales were also reduced by lower volumes in both divisions due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

In Asia, sales volumes grew in 2020 after a weak first half of the year, driven by strong demand in China, while volumes in Europe and North America remained below the prior-year level. Sales in the consumer goods industry declined, primarily due to lower prices, while volumes were only slightly below the level of the previous year. Higher volumes in Asia, especially in the appliances segment, were able to partially offset lower sales volumes in Europe and  North  America.  Sales  also  decreased  considerably  in  the construction industry due to lower volumes and prices. Significantly higher sales volumes in Asia, especially in China, were  unable to offset lower volumes in Europe and North America.",

We develop innovative products and technologies in close collaboration with our customers from the catalysts, coatings and battery materials sectors, and offer precious and base metal as well as surface treatment services. Our aim is to drive growth by leveraging our portfolio of technologies to find the best solution for our customers in terms of functionality and cost. This helps our customers to drive forward innovation in their industries and contribute to sustainable development.\n\nKey growth drivers for us are the positive medium-term development of the automotive market, especially in Asia, the trend toward sustainable, low-emission mobility in the automotive industry, and the associated rise in demand for battery materials for  electromobility. Together  with  our  customers,  we  are  developing  customized, sustainable solutions in these growth areas for battery materials, emission control, lightweight engineering concepts and functional coatings. Our specialties and system solutions enable customers to stand out from their competition.\n\nWe aim to expand our position as a leading and innovative provider of battery materials and benefit from the strong growth in this market segment.  A  global,  customer-focused  production  network  for battery materials is crucial here. In 2020, BASF announced plans to invest in a new production plant for cathode active materials in Schwarzheide, Germany. The new plant will use precursors from the precursor plant for cathode active materials in Harjavalta, Finland, which was announced in 2018. The two plants are scheduled for startup in 2022 and will produce cathode active materials for around 400,000 fully electric mid-size vehicles per year.

We support them with highly efficient catalysts and filters and also help them to meet strict regulatory requirements. The FWC+ catalyst for gasoline engines is an  example of BASF's expertise in mobile emissions control. The FWC+ catalyst is a highly efficient filter that reduces particulates in exhaust gas emissions by up to 95%. This reduces the  environmental impact and significantly improves air quality.\n\nments in Finland and Germany, BASF aims to become the first cathode active materials supplier with local production capacities in what are  currently the three main markets: Asia, the United States and   Europe.\n\n## Value for BASF\n\nEstimated annual sales potential from 2022\n\n## >\u20ac20 million\n\nThe conventional four-way conversion catalysts used in gasoline engines  filter  out  ultra-fine  particles  and  chemically  remove substances such as carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gas. This exhaust purification  technology  was  significantly  improved  with  the development of the FWC+ catalyst - the next generation of the four-way conversion catalyst. These new, additional components in the exhaust system now filter particulates much more  efficiently than in the past. The technology was initially introduced to the Chinese passenger car market in 2019 before being launched in Europe in 2020. It has an estimated annual sales potential of more than \u20ac20 million from 2022 onward.",

This  was  due  to considerably higher sales in the Catalysts division, which rose by \u20ac4,174  million year on year to \u20ac13,570  million. In the Coatings division, sales declined by \u20ac657 million to \u20ac3,089 million.\n\n## Factors influencing sales - Surface Technologies\n\n|            | Surface  Technologies   | Catalysts   | Coatings   |\n|------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Volumes    | -1%                     | 5%          | -14%       |\n| Prices     | 32%                     | 43%         | 1%         |\n| Portfolio  | 0%                      | 0%          | 0%         |\n| Currencies | -4%                     | -4%         | -5%        |\n| Sales      | 27%                     | 44%         | -18%       |\n\nSales growth was largely driven by the strong increase in precious metal prices in the Catalysts division. In precious metal trading, sales rose to \u20ac7,612  million, mainly as a result of higher prices (2019: \u20ac4,585 million). The Coatings division also achieved slightly higher prices, primarily in the decorative paints and surface treatments businesses.\n\nNegative currency effects had an offsetting impact in both divisions.\n\n## Segment data - Surface Technologies\n\n|                                                                            | Million \u20ac   | Million \u20ac   | Million \u20ac   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                            | 2020        | 2019        | +/-         |\n| Sales to third parties                                                     | 16,659      | 13,142      | 27%         |\n| of which Catalysts                                                         | 13,570      | 9,396       | 44%         |\n| Coatings                                                                   | 3,089       | 3,746       | -18%        |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                     | 203         | 212         | -4%         |\n| Sales including transfers                                                  | 16,862      | 13,354      | 26%         |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | 966         | 1,173       | -18%        |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | 900         | 1,120       | -20%        |\n| EBITDA margin                                                              | 5.4         | 8.5         | -           |\n| Depreciation and amortization a                                            | 1,487       | 457         | 225%        |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | -587        | 663         | .           |\n| Special items                                                              | -1,071      | -59         | .           |\n| EBIT before special items                                                  | 484         | 722         | -33%        |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE)                                          | -4.8        | 5.7         | -           |\n| Assets                                                                     | 11,691      | 11,773      | -1%         |\n| Investments including acquisitions b                                       | 585         | 565         | 4%          |\n| Research and development expenses                                          | 246         | 214         | 15%         |\n\n- a Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including impairments and reversals of impairments)\n- b Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nSales  developments  was  also  weighed  down  by  slightly  lower volumes overall. This was largely the result of weaker demand from the automotive and aviation industries due to the effects of the coronavirus  pandemic,  which  significantly  depressed  volumes development in the Coatings division. Sales volumes declined significantly here, especially in the automotive OEM coatings, surface treatments and automotive refinish coatings businesses. Higher volumes in the Catalysts division for mobile emissions catalysts in Asia and in  precious metal trading were unable to compensate for this. Sales volumes declined for chemical catalysts and refining catalysts in particular.\n\n## Catalysts - Sales by region\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the Coatings division, this was mainly attributable to the development of volumes. Lower fixed costs and lower raw materials prices were unable to compensate for this. EBIT before special items declined in the Catalysts division, mainly as a result of higher fixed costs, driven in particular by growth initiatives for battery chemicals. This could not be offset by a significant improve ment in earnings in precious metal trading.\n\nEBIT decreased by \u20ac1,250 million to -\u20ac587 million. EBIT included special charges, mainly for goodwill impairments of \u20ac786 million in the surface treatments cash-generating unit, and for property, plant and equipment, primarily in the Catalysts division in Europe.

Agriculture is a key enabler in providing enough healthy, affordable food and responding to changing consumer behavior while reducing the impact on the environment. As one of the world's leading agricultural solutions companies, we want to create a positive impact and help shape a sustainable future for farming. At BASF, we believe that the way forward for agriculture is to find the right balance - for farmers, agriculture and future generations.\n\nFarmers  need  to  balance  resources,  technology,  climate  and societal uncertainty in order to produce in an economically sound way. We support them in finding the right balance by focusing more than ever on the needs of our customers, societal concerns and regulatory requirements. With a deep understanding of the way individual growers manage their farms and crop systems, we  provide a connected offer, including seeds, traits, crop protection, and digital products and solutions.\n\nOur  innovation-driven  strategy  for  agriculture  focuses  on  four selected crop combinations, known as crop systems: 1. soy, corn (maize) and cotton in the Americas; 2. wheat, canola (oilseed rape) and sunflowers in North America and Europe; 3. rice in Asia; and 4. fruit and vegetables globally. We actively steer our connected offer for farmers and the agricultural industry toward sustainable solutions\n\n- 1 Source: U.N. World Population Prospects 2019\n- 2 Management's Report Agricultural Solutions\n\nHow we create value - an example\n\n## BioSolutions by BASF\n\nNatural partners for the cultivation of field and specialty crops and conventional crop protection\n\nValue for our customers and the environment\n\nNemasys \u00ae C: biological pest control with an effectiveness of\n\n## up to 90%\n\nBeneficial nematodes provide flexible pest control as they fit into both conventional and organic farming practices and work across glasshouse and outdoor-grown field crops, fruits and vegetables as well as turf. These effective BioSolutions by BASF are in some cases the only option to limit the spread of destructive pests such as the codling moth. The larvae of this pest burrow under the bark of apple trees to overwinter, where they cannot be reached with other crop protection products. We have developed Nemasys \u00ae C beneficial nematodes that reach these overwintering larvae and provide up to 90% control in U.S. apple orchards, mitigating insect numbers for the following year.\n\nby integrating sustainability criteria into all business and portfolio decisions.\n\nThe success of our customers depends on many factors such as weather, disease, pest and weed pressure, soil conditions and prices for agricultural produce. Our customers strive for better yield - yield produced in ways that are recognized as valuable by society, are kind to the planet and enable farmers to run their farms profitably in the long term while embracing digital and other new technologies in day-to-day farm operations.\n\n## Value for BASF\n\nBioSolutions by BASF portfolio with annual sales of\n\n## > \u20ac150 million\n\nBioSolutions are part of our portfolio for sustainable agriculture. To develop BioSolutions, we focus on leveraging in-house expertise and strategic partnerships. These solutions are based on natural mechanisms like beneficial nematodes, micro-organisms, plant extracts and pheromones. They are natural partners for a wide range of field and specialty crops and can be used in organic farming  or  as  a  complement  to  conventional  crop  protection products. Demand for BioSolutions, including seed treatment, soil and foliar applications, results in annual sales of over \u20ac150 million.\n\nOur innovative digital products, marketed under the xarvio \u00ae Digital Farming Solutions brand, help farmers to make better decisions, enable precision farming and in this way, enhance sustainability.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe investment in a crop protection production hub in Singapore will, as announced in 2020, supply multiple formulation technologies in close proximity to farmers in Asia Pacific. We also invested in the expansion of our production site in Sparks, Georgia, establishing a",

At the Nunhem site in the Netherlands, we started the expansion of our breeding facilities for vegetable seeds with a state-of-the-art tomato greenhouse. Further investments were made in the modernization of site infrastructure in the Americas and Europe. To meet continuing high demand for our innovative solutions in the future, between 2021 and 2025, we will invest more than \u20ac950 million in developing and expanding our infrastructure and in our production and formulation capacities for active ingredients as well as for seed solutions.\n\n## Research and development\n\nOur  research  and  development  activities  are  aligned  with  our strategic crop systems to support our customers' success with innovations. In 2020, we spent \u20ac840 million on research and development in the Agricultural Solutions division, representing around 11% of the segment's sales. Our well-stocked innovation pipeline comprises novel seeds and traits, new chemical and biological crop protection products, new formulations and digital solutions to be launched between 2020 and 2030. With a peak sales potential 1 of more than \u20ac7.5 billion, our innovation pipeline has an even stronger focus on sustainable solutions - enabled by a research and development process that is driven by sustainability criteria. We innovate to create new business opportunities for farmers and for BASF by developing  solutions  that  meet  the  needs  of  customers  and consumers. By 2030, we will launch more than 30 major pipeline projects across all business areas. These will provide sustainable solutions to help farmers achieve better yield in their farm operations and promote healthy eating, balancing economic, environment and societal demands. Research and development activities in the Agricultural Solutions division range from seeds and traits, research and breeding capacities to solutions that protect plants against fungal diseases, insect pests and weeds, and improve soil management and plant health.\n\nOur research and development is based on a global network of research sites, seed production and breeding capacities. It positions us to seize future market opportunities and increase our competitiveness.\n\nOur biotechnology activities and our research and development capabilities  comprise  advanced  breeding  techniques,  analytics, technology  platforms  and  trait  validation.  To  offer  tailor-made, sustainable crop solutions, our research platform on gene identification focuses on plant characteristics that enable higher yields and better quality, disease resistance and tolerance of negative environmental factors, such as drought. We apply state-of-the-art scientific methods,  including  genetic  engineering  and  selective  genome editing. These activities are closely connected to our activities in the field of biotechnology, which are part of BASF's Bioscience  Research division. Corporate research and development expenses, sales, earnings and all other data for BASF's Bioscience Research division are not reported in the Agricultural Solutions segment; they continue to be reported under Other.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn 2020, we launched our Agricultural Solutions sustainability commitments. We focus on four areas to help farmers to find the right balance: climate-smart farming, sustainable solutions, digital  farming and smart stewardship.\n\nClimate-smart farming: We help farmers tackle pressing climate challenges with the right combination of technologies designed to increase yield, make farm management easier and more effective, and reduce the impact on the environment. Our technologies  include nitrogen management products to improve fertilizer efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions, no-till herbicides, seeds and traits for more stress-resilient crops, natural biological inoculants as well as digital solutions.\n\nSustainable  solutions: We  systematically  steer  our  innovation pipeline according to sustainability criteria from an early stage. This enables us to continually develop innovations that offer added value for farmers, the environment and society. We also assess each product in our existing portfolio with respect to its contribution to sustainability. In this way, we systematically steer our portfolio to every year increase the share of sales from solutions that make a substantial sustainability contribution.\n\nDigital farming: Digitalization has the power to transform agriculture and make it more efficient, inclusive and sustainable. Our digital solutions help farmers to produce more with less by growing their business profitably while reducing their environmental footprint.\n\nSmart  stewardship: Our  stewardship  tools  and  services  are tailored to farmers' daily work. Farmers get the support they need to use our products safely: access to tools and services, protective equipment, customized training, digital solutions and new and future- oriented application technologies such as drones.",

Sales performance was significantly weighed down by negative currency effects, particularly in the region South America, Africa, Middle East. This contrasted with volume growth in a challenging market environment. Overall, prices were slightly above the prior-year level.\n\n## Factors influencing sales - Agricultural Solutions\n\n| Volumes    | 5%   |\n|------------|------|\n| Prices     | 2%   |\n| Portfolio  | 0%   |\n| Currencies | -9%  |\n| Sales      | -2%  |\n\nIn Europe , sales declined by \u20ac85 million year on year to \u20ac2,035 million. This was largely attributable to lower volumes, especially of herbicides and fungicides, mainly as a consequence of dry weather conditions in large parts of Europe. Sales were also reduced by negative currency effects, primarily in Turkey and eastern Europe. Prices were on a level with the previous year.\n\nSales in North America decreased by \u20ac104 million to \u20ac3,004 million. Prices were slightly below the prior-year level in a continued challenging  market  environment,  especially  for  herbicides  and fungi  cides.  Sales  development  was  also  weighed  down  by negative currency effects. This was partially offset by higher sales volumes, particularly for fungicides, after the distributor destocking and challenges relating to weather conditions and trade conflicts that dominated the previous year.\n\nAgricultural Solutions\n\n## Segment data - Agricultural Solutions\n\n|                                                                            | Million \u20ac   | Million \u20ac   | Million \u20ac   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                            | 2020        | 2019        | +/-         |\n| Sales to third parties                                                     | 7,660       | 7,814       | -2%         |\n| Intersegment transfers                                                     | 91          | 197         | -54%        |\n| Sales including transfers                                                  | 7,751       | 8,011       | -3%         |\n| Income from operations before depreciation, amortization and special items | 1,680       | 1,809       | -7%         |\n| Income from operations before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)       | 1,582       | 1,647       | -4%         |\n| EBITDA margin                                                              | 20.7        | 21.1        | -           |\n| Depreciation and amortization a                                            | 1,000       | 719         | 39%         |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)                                              | 582         | 928         | -37%        |\n| Special items                                                              | -388        | -167        | .           |\n| EBIT before special items                                                  | 970         | 1,095       | -11%        |\n| Return on capital employed (ROCE)                                          | 3.6         | 5.3         | -           |\n| Assets                                                                     | 14,840      | 16,530      | -10%        |\n| Investments including acquisitions b                                       | 459         | 320         | 43%         |\n| Research and development expenses                                          | 840         | 879         | -4%         |\n\n- a Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including impairments and reversals of impairments)\n- b Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nSales in Asia rose by \u20ac59 million to \u20ac844 million. This was largely attributable to higher sales volumes, especially of herbicides and fungicides, primarily in India, China and Australia. Slightly higher price levels contributed to the positive sales development, while negative currency effects had a dampening impact.\n\nSales in the region South America, Africa, Middle East amounted to \u20ac1,777 million, \u20ac24 million below the previous year. This was primarily due to significantly negative currency effects, mainly from the depreciation of the Brazilian real. Considerably higher volumes in all indications and sectors, especially in Brazil, and higher price levels were unable to fully offset the negative currency developments.\n\n## Agricultural Solutions - Sales by region\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was mainly due to the sales decrease in commodity trading and the remaining activities of BASF's paper and water chemicals business, which were not part of the transfer to Solenis and are reported under Other.\n\nAt -\u20ac769 million, income from operations before special items in Other was \u20ac188 million below the prior-year figure. This is largely attributable to lower contributions from other businesses and to positive effects in 2019, primarily from changes to pension benefits in the United States.\n\nEBIT declined by \u20ac685  million to -\u20ac1,203  million.

Gas prices on the European spot markets declined significantly compared with the previous year. The strong price declines in the first half of 2020 were attributable to the drop in global macroeconomic demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Oil and gas prices partially recovered in the second half of the year.\n\n## Equity-accounted income of the oil and gas business\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, BASF no longer presents equity-accounted income from Wintershall Dea in the BASF Group's EBIT and EBIT before special items, but under net income from shareholdings. Wintershall Dea contributed -\u20ac890 million to net income from shareholdings in 2020. This included impairments of \u20ac791 million, mainly as a result of lower oil and gas price forecasts and changed reserve estimates.  In  the  previous  year,  Wintershall's  earnings  were presented in income after taxes from discontinued operations until the merger of Wintershall and DEA on April  30, 2019. Equityaccounted income from Wintershall Dea in the period from May 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, amounted to -\u20ac86 million.\n\nWintershall Dea conducts production, development 1 and exploration activities in the following countries:\n\n- - Egypt (production, development, exploration)\n- - Algeria (production)\n- - Argentina (production, development, exploration)\n- - Brazil (exploration)\n- - Denmark (production, exploration)\n- - Germany (production, development, exploration)\n- - Libya (production)\n- - Mexico (production, development, exploration)\n- - Netherlands (production, development, exploration)\n- - Norway (production, development, exploration)\n\nNon-Integral Oil and Gas Business\n\n- - Russia (production, development)\n- - United Arab Emirates (development, exploration)\n- - United Kingdom (production, development, exploration)\n\n## Wintershall Dea's activities in 2020\n\nWintershall Dea produced 227 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2020, of which around 162 million BOE of gas. This corresponded to a daily production of 623 thousand BOE. Despite the macroeconomic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Wintershall Dea was able to increase daily production slightly compared with the period from May 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019.\n\nInvestment  projects  continued  largely  as  planned.  The  \u00c6rfugl project in Norway started production of phase 1 on schedule and budget  - a milestone for subsea development in the Norwegian Sea. How ever, a number of projects, such as the Njord and Nova projects in Norway, were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. In  Russia,  the  Achim  Develop ment  joint  venture  operated  with Gazprom, in which Winters hall Dea holds a 25.01% interest, continued field development in blocks 4A and 5A of the Achimov Formation. Production is expected to start in the first quarter of 2021. Another investment focus is Egypt, especially the Nile Delta. The Raven subproject there commenced production at the beginning of 2021.\n\nThe Achimgaz joint venture with Gazprom successfully drilled further production wells. Production is running at the expected high level. Severneftegazprom, a joint venture between Gazprom, Wintershall Dea and OMV, reached a major milestone in 2020: The YuzhnoRusskoye field in Russia's Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District has produced 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas since production began in 2007.\n\nIn October 2020, Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft, in which Wintershall Dea holds a 51% interest, transferred operatorship of Contract Areas 91 (formerly concession 96) and 107 (formerly concession 97)\n\n- 1 Development activities include projects before and after the FID (final investment decision)\n- 2 Scope 1 and 2 emissions from upstream activities operated by Wintershall Dea and upstream activities not operated by Wintershall Dea on a pro rata basis\n\nonshore Libya's Sirte basin to Sarir Oil Operations B.V. (SOO), a newly established joint operating company with the National Oil Corporation (NOC).\n\nWintershall  Dea  drilled  11  exploration  wells  in  2020.  Of  these, around 64% were successful.\n\nWintershall Dea is also active in gas transportation. This includes interests in GASCADE Gastransport GmbH and OPAL Gastransport GmbH & Co. KG held by WIGA Transport Beteiligungs-GmbH & Co. KG, and the interest in Nord Stream AG held directly by Wintershall Dea. Wintershall Dea is involved in the financing of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, but does not hold an interest in the company.\n\nAs part of its climate strategy, which was communicated in November 2020, Wintershall Dea aims to achieve net zero emissions 2 from upstream activities by 2030 and reduce the methane intensity of its own natural gas production to 0.1% by 2025. During the next 10 years, Wintershall Dea intends to invest around \u20ac400  million in  reducing and offsetting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn 2020, Winters hall Dea continued to drive forward the integration that  began with the merger and was able to realize the intended syn er gies.  Wintershall  Dea  has  undertaken  preparations  for  a stock  exchange listing, which is expected to take place over the course of 2021 subject to market conditions.",

This was mainly due to considerably lower sales in the Chemicals and Materials segments. Sales also declined considerably in Other and in the Industrial Solutions and Agricultural Solutions segments, and slightly in the Nutrition & Care segment. Considerable sales growth in the Surface Technologies segment was unable to compensate for this.\n\nSales performance was primarily driven by lower volumes in  almost all segments and in Other, but especially in the Materials segment as a result of weaker demand from the automotive industry. Price levels declined in the Chemicals segment in particular, espe cially for steam cracker products due to higher product availability on the market and lower raw materials prices, as well as in the Materials segment as a result of lower isocyanates prices. By contrast, prices in the Surface Technologies segment were well above the prior-year level.\n\nNegative currency effects also contributed to the sales decrease. Portfolio effects in the Materials segment from the acquisition of Solvay's integrated polyamide business had an offsetting impact.\n\nAt -\u20ac1,005 million, EBIT was down \u20ac3,130 million from the previous year. All segments and Other recorded lower contributions, but espe cially the Materials segment. This was largely attributable to impairments.\n\nWe are strengthening our position in the European market with invest ments such as the construction of a precursor plant for cathode active materials in Harjavalta, Finland, and the construction of a cathode active materials plant in Schwarzheide, Germany. With these investments, BASF aims to expand its position as a leading and innovative provider of battery materials. The two plants are scheduled for startup in 2022 and will be able to equip around 400,000 fully electric mid-size vehicles per year.\n\n## North America\n\n- \u25aa Sales of \u20ac16,440 million at prior-year level\n- \u25aa EBIT declines \u20ac893 million to -\u20ac201 million\n\nSales at companies located in North America were on a level with the previous year, at \u20ac16,440 million. In local currency terms, they rose by 2%. Considerable sales growth in the Surface Technologies segment and slightly higher sales in the Nutrition & Care segment were offset by considerable sales decreases in the Chemicals, Materials and Industrial Solutions segments, as well as slightly lower sales in the Agricultural Solutions segment.\n\nSales performance was positively impacted by an increase in prices on the back of significantly higher price levels in the Surface Technologies segment. This more than compensated for lower prices in all other segments. Sales were weighed down by lower volumes, especially in the Surface Technologies, Materials, Chemicals and Industrial Solutions segments. This was mainly the result of lower demand from the automotive industry due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the unplanned outage at the steam cracker in Port Arthur, Texas. Sales were also reduced by negative currency effects.\n\nAt -\u20ac201 million, EBIT was down \u20ac893 million from the prior-year figure due to significantly lower contributions from almost all  segments, but especially from the Surface Technologies segment. EBIT includes special charges, mainly from impairments in the Surface  Technologies, Agricultural Solutions and Chemicals segments. In addition, the contribution from the Industrial Solutions segment was lower, after the transfer of the paper and water chemicals business to the Solenis group had positively impacted the segment's earnings in the previous year. By contrast, EBIT rose considerably in Other and in the Nutrition & Care segment.",

In local currency terms, sales were 14% above the prior-year level. This was largely due to considerably higher sales in the Surface Technologies segment. Sales also rose considerably in the Agricultural Solutions segment, while the Materials segment recorded a slight improvement. By contrast, sales  declined considerably in the Industrial Solutions segment and slightly in the Chemicals segment. Sales were at prior-year level in the Nutrition & Care segment.\n\nThe sales performance was primarily the result of higher volumes in all segments, but especially in the Surface Technologies and Agricultural Solutions segments. Higher prices overall, mainly attributable to the Surface Technologies segment, also contributed to the increase in sales. By contrast, prices in the Materials, Industrial Solutions, Chemicals and Nutrition & Care segments were below the prior-year level. Sales were buoyed by portfolio effects, especially in the Materials segment following the acquisition of the integrated polyamide business from Solvay. Negative currency effects had an offsetting impact.\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nEBIT in the region declined by \u20ac314 million compared with 2019 to \u20ac768 million, primarily as a result of impairments. This was largely due to the considerable decrease in EBIT in the Chemicals and Surface Technologies segments. The Industrial Solutions segment's contribution was also significantly lower. By contrast, the Materials, Nutrition & Care and Agricultural Solutions segments posted much higher earnings.\n\nEven in the coronavirus pandemic, the Asia Pacific region remains the strongest growth driver in the chemical industry. Our investments in local production plants and in research and development meet the needs of our local customers and lay the foundation for future growth in the Asian market. Following the official groundbreaking in November 2019, we started construction of the first plants at the planned integrated Verbund site in Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The first plants will produce engineering plastics and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to serve the growing demand in various growth industries in Asia, including in the southern Chinese market. We also expanded our dispersions portfolio at our site in Huizhou, China, to better serve the fast-growing packaging industry in southern China. At the Nanjing site, in 2020, we increased the production capacity for neopentyl glycol to meet our Chinese customers' demands for envi ron mentally friendly automotive refinish coatings.\n\n## South America, Africa, Middle East\n\n- \u25aa Sales down 6% at \u20ac3,591 million\n- \u25aa EBIT declines 18% to \u20ac247 million\n\nSales at companies located in the region South America, Africa, Middle East declined by 6% year on year to \u20ac3,591 million. In local currency terms, by contrast, they rose by 22%. The decline in sales in euros was mainly due to considerably lower sales in the Surface Technologies segment. Sales were also considerably below the prioryear level in the Industrial Solutions segment and decreased slightly in the Agricultural Solutions segment. By contrast, the Materials  segment\n\nrecorded  considerable  sales  growth,  while  the  Chemicals  and Nutrition & Care segments posted slight increases.\n\nSales performance in South America was primarily attributable to negative currency effects. Higher price levels in all segments except Chemicals had an offsetting effect. We also increased sales volumes overall. Higher volumes, particularly in the Agricultural Solutions segment, more than compensated for lower sales volumes in the Surface Technologies segment due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Portfolio effects, especially in the Materials segment from the acquisition of Solvay's integrated polyamide business, had a positive impact on sales.\n\nCompanies located in Africa and in the Middle East recorded a considerable sales decrease overall. Higher prices were unable to offset lower volumes and negative currency effects.\n\nAt \u20ac247 million, EBIT in the region South America, Africa, Middle East was down \u20ac55 million from the prior-year figure. This was due to lower contributions from Other and from the Agricultural Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Surface Technologies and Nutrition & Care segments. EBIT improved considerably in the Materials and Chemicals segments.",

That  is  why sustainability is firmly anchored in our corporate purpose, our strategy, our targets and our operating business (see page 42). It is at the core of what we do, a driver for growth and an element of our risk management. We pursue a holistic approach  that  covers  the  entire  value  chain  -  from  our suppliers and our own activities to our customers.\n\nWe contribute to a sustainable development and to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in many different ways (see page 32). For instance, our innovations, products and technologies help to better use natural resources, produce enough food, enable climate-smart mobility, reduce emissions, or increase the  capabilities  of  renewable  energy.  Alongside  these  positive contributions, our business activities also have negative impacts. For example, we create CO2 emissions and procure raw materials, the sourcing of which by our suppliers involves a potential risk of human rights violations. This is why we are constantly working to broaden  our  positive  impact  on  key  sustainability  topics  (see page 42) along our value chains and reduce the negative impact.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u25aa Comprehensive management and monitoring systems to uphold our responsibility to the environment and society\n\nWe are committed to doing business in a responsible, safe, efficient and respectful way. Our actions are guided by our corporate values and our global Code of Conduct. We comply with and in some\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncases exceed the applicable laws and regulations with voluntary commitments. We stipulate binding rules for our employees with standards that apply throughout the Group. In doing so, we  consider, respect and promote internationally recognized principles such as the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or the Core Labor Standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO).\n\nWe want to ensure that we act in line with the applicable laws and uphold our responsibility to the environment and society with our comprehensive management and monitoring systems. Our global Responsible  Care  Management  System  covers  environmental protection, health and safety (see page 121). We meet our responsibilities with respect to international labor and social standards chiefly through three elements: the Compliance Program (including internal and external compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or  international\n\norganizations) and the guideline on compliance with international labor norms, which applies Group-wide. This guideline specifies what the issues in our global Code of Conduct mean for our employees.\n\nOur business partners are also expected to comply with prevailing laws and regulations and to align their actions with internationally recognized principles. We have established appropriate management  and  control  systems,  for  example,  for  working  with  our suppliers (see page 113).\n\nWe are involved in numerous initiatives to drive forward sustainability in general and, specifically, as this relates to our value chains. These include the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and OECD's Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG)  initiative, as well as networks with thematic focus like the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) or the",

For many years now, we have engaged in constructive dialog on human rights with other companies, nongovernmental organizations, international organizations and multistakeholder initiatives to better understand different perspectives and address conflicting goals. BASF is a founding member of the U.N. Global Compact and a member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBI), a group of globally operating companies from various sectors. The initiative aims to ensure implementation of the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are confronted by the fact that there are states that do not honor their obligation to protect human rights. People are particularly at risk in such countries and companies' ability to act is often limited. Nevertheless, we are committed to our values - including and especially there - and contribute to the respect of human rights.\n\nResponsible Conduct\n\nWe have embedded this into our Code of Conduct and our human rights position (for more information, see page 177). All employees and members of management bodies are responsible for ensuring that we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct and our human rights  position.  We  uphold  our  standards  worldwide,  including where they exceed local legal requirements. We avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through our own operations.\n\nOur Corporate Compliance unit is responsible for steering human rights topics and developing binding policies. A group of internal experts from various specialist units - environment, health and safety,  sustainability,  legal,  procurement,  human  resources  and supply chain - and the operating divisions works closely together to coordinate  measures  across  units.  This  expert  working  group provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of information and training offerings, among other things. Together with our Human Rights Advisory Council, it ensures that we can meet our due diligence obligations.\n\nWe established the Human Rights Advisory Council to  systematically integrate external expertise. Its members include independent international human rights experts. The trust-based dialog on human rights topics helps us to better understand critical perspectives and to deal more openly with dilemmas. At the same time, the renowned external experts show us where we have potential for improvement and help us to build on our strengths in how we handle human rights. The council is chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer. Meetings are also attended by employees from Corporate Sustainability and Corporate Compliance. Other representatives, for example, from the operating divisions or procurement, are invited depending on the focus topics. Its composition allows the Human Rights Advisory Council to provide an external perspective on our processes and contribute this in discussions with senior management.  Similarly, the Stakeholder Advisory Council brings outside views to discussions with the Board of Executive Directors. We see assuming our\n\nhuman rights responsibilities as a continuous process. This is why we continuously review our policies and processes and update them if necessary.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a comprehensive review of our human rights management system and the related processes. The review showed that we have achieved important milestones in the area of human rights and in terms of our due diligence processes. These include the introduction of explicit questions on due diligence aspects in the risk  analyses  conducted  by  business  units,  standard  supplier assessments or evaluations of investment projects. The analysis, which was discussed with the Board of Executive Directors, did however also reveal potential for improvement that we have ambitions to pursue, such as awareness of human rights topics within our organization. Continued efforts are needed to help all employees better understand how these topics are relevant to our daily work. In addition, we want to expand our due diligence process to more effectively identify challenges at different stages of our value chain. A human rights risk assessment is to be more systematically incorporated into strategy development for our procurement units. We also want to further strengthen our grievance mechanisms and introduce a standardized global hotline and reporting system in 2021. In consul tation with the Human Rights Advisory Council, Corporate Compliance  is  developing  specific  measures  for  improvement together with the expert group and the relevant units. Awareness-raising  measures  are  currently  being  developed,  including training concepts and content to make employees more conscious of human rights.\n\nWe want to ensure that our actions do not have a negative impact on human rights. We have long used monitoring and management systems to identify potential and actual negative impacts. Our measures and criteria for monitoring and observing human rights are integrated into supplier assessment processes and our global monitor ing systems for environmental protection, safety and security, health protection and product stewardship. They are also integrated into the evaluation of investment, acquisition and divestiture",

Aspects  of  human  rights related to site security, such as the right to liberty and security of person, are a component of the global qualification requirements of our security personnel. Respect for human rights is a mandatory element of any contract with service providers of the BASF Group who are active in this area.\n\nAs an international company, we are a part of society in the  countries in which we operate and have business relationships with different partners around the world. We have trustful working relationships with our partners (joint venture partners, contractors, suppliers, and customers), expect them to comply with internationally recognized human rights standards and to demand the same of their partners further along the value chain. For instance, we contractually agreed with our two joint venture partners in the Chinese region of Xinjiang that the basis for joint activities is the BASF Code of Conduct and the requirements embedded in it to respect human rights and relevant labor and social standards (such as the exclusion of forced labor and discrimination in hiring, promotion and dismissal  practices). We review this on a regular basis with audits. The most recent audits on compliance with labor and social standards at our joint ventures were performed in the first half of 2020, despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The audits were conducted with the support of a well-known external auditor. They reviewed the implementation of measures agreed in previous internal audits and again verified compliance with BASF's requirements regarding international labor and social standards.\n\nWe support our partners in their efforts to meet their respective responsibilities. This is because we can only meet our goal of eradicating human rights abuses along our value chains if we work together. We have defined our expectations in a binding Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nEmployees and third parties around the world can report potential violations of laws or company guidelines to our compliance hotlines. Since 2020, employees have also been able to contact specialists directly via a new internal online platform or the corresponding app. In 2020, 261 human rights-related complaints were received by phone as well as by post and e-mail. All complaints received were reviewed and forwarded to the relevant departments for in-depth investigation. If justified, appropriate measures were taken.\n\nWe report on our global targets, monitoring systems and measures to integrate human rights topics into our business activities in publications such as this report and online.\n\n- For more information on standards in our supply chain, see page 113 onward For more information on our production standards, see page 121 onward For more information on systems for monitoring labor and social standards, see page 144 onward For more information on corporate governance and compliance, see page 167 onward\n- See basf.com/humanrights for more information on the human rights position and a comprehensive report on the implementation of due diligence in human rights in accordance with the requirements of the National Action Plan developed by the German government, and in accordance with the U.N.

Our suppliers are an important part of our value chain. Our objective is to secure competitive advantages for BASF through our professional procurement structures. At the same time, together with our suppliers, we want to improve sustainability in the supply chain and minimize risks.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur partnerships with suppliers are based on mutual value creation, as well as a reliable supply of raw materials, technical goods and services at competitive prices. 1 We work together in an open and transparent way to generate long-term benefits for both sides.\n\nOur sustainability-oriented supply chain management helps to manage risks. We have defined our standards and processes in global guidelines and are constantly refining and optimizing these. Our risk-based approach aims to identify and evaluate sustainability risks in our value chains as best possible to improve sustainability together with our suppliers. We regularly review and document progress based on the risk level. Employees with procurement responsibility receive ongoing training in sustainability-oriented supplier management and responsible procurement. In 2020, 462 BASF employees received such training.\n\nOur  expectations  of  our  suppliers  are  laid  down  in  the  global Supplier Code of Conduct. This clarifies for our suppliers the standards to be met and supports them in carrying out our requirements. We count on reliable supply relationships and want to make our suppliers' contribution to sustainable development visible to us.\n\nSupplier Management\n\n## 2025 target\n\nShare of relevant spend covered by sustainability evaluations\n\n## 90%\n\n## 2025 target\n\nPercentage of suppliers with improved sustainability performance upon re-evaluation\n\n## 80%\n\nWe actively promote sustainability in the supply chain and have set ourselves ambitious targets for this: By 2025, we aim to have conducted sustainability evaluations for 90% of the BASF Group's relevant spend 2 and will develop action plans where improvement is necessary. In addition, we are working toward having 80% of suppliers improve their sustainability performance upon re-evaluation by 2025. In 2020, 80% of the relevant spend had been evaluated. Of the suppliers re-evaluated in 2020, 68% had improved. The global targets are embedded in the target agreements of persons responsible for procurement.\n\n- For more information on suppliers, see basf.com/suppliers\n\n## Worldwide procurement\n\nOur more than 70,000 Tier 1 suppliers play an important role in value creation at our company. We work in long-term partnership with companies from different industries around the world. They supply us with raw materials, precursors, investment goods and consumables, perform a range of services and are innovation partners. Procurement management systems such as guidelines and targets are set centrally and are binding for all employees with procurement responsibility worldwide.\n\nWe  acquired  raw  materials,  goods  and  services  for  our  own production  worth  approximately  \u20ac31.5  billion  in  2020.  Of  this, around  90%  was  procured  locally. 3 There  were  no  substantial changes to our supplier structure.\n\n## What we expect from our suppliers\n\nTogether with our suppliers, we want to improve sustainability in the supply chain. Consequently, we expect our suppliers to comply with the applicable laws in full and to adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate governance standards. We also expect our suppliers to make an effort to implement these standards at their suppliers. In addition, we ask our suppliers to acknowledge, support and abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct - or to dem onstrate and ensure their commitment to the principles specified in the Code of Conduct, for example in their own code of conduct. Our Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations' Global Compact, the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions and the topic areas of the Responsible Care initiative. Topics covered by the Code of Conduct include compliance with human rights, the exclusion of child and forced labor, safeguarding labor and social standards,  and  antidiscrimination  and  anticorruption  policies  in\n\n- 1 BASF considers all direct suppliers of the BASF Group in the business year concerned as Tier 1 suppliers.

The Code of Conduct is available in the most relevant languages for our suppliers and is integrated into electronic ordering systems and purchasing conditions across the Group. In 2020, 4,918 new suppliers committed to our Code of Conduct.\n\nBASF reserves the right to conduct audits or evaluations to ensure that suppliers comply with the applicable laws, rules and standards. In addition, BASF reserves the right to discontinue business relationships for non-adherence to international principles, failure to correct violations, or for displaying patterns of non-compliance with these standards. Potential violations of laws, rules or standards can be reported - including anonymously - to one of our more than 50 externally operated hotlines worldwide. Each case is documented and investigated, and appropriate measures are taken as necessary.\n\n- For more information on responsible conduct along the value chain, see page 110 onward\n- For more information on the Supplier Code of Conduct, see basf.com/suppliers\n\n## Selection and evaluation of our suppliers\n\nNew suppliers are selected and existing suppliers are evaluated not only on the basis of economic criteria, but also environmental, social and corporate governance standards. As such, the selection, evalua tion and auditing of suppliers is an important part of our sus tain able supply chain management. Approaches and responsibilities are set out in a global guideline. Due to the size and scale of our supplier portfolio, our suppliers are evaluated based on risk, including materiality and country and industry-specific risks. We also use observations from our employees in procurement and information from internal and external databases, such as Together for Sustainability (TfS) assessments.\n\nWe have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or on-site audits. The list of suppliers to be assessed is updated every year. Sustainability evaluations and on-site audits are mainly conducted\n\nSupplier Management\n\naccording to the TfS framework. A total of 50 raw material supplier sites were audited on sustainability standards on our behalf in 2020. We received sustainability evaluations for 628  suppliers. We also take into account other certification systems and external audits, such as from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, when evaluating our suppliers' sustainability performance. Depending on business requirements, we additionally conduct our own Responsible Care audits at selected suppliers (see page 121).\n\n- For more information on raw materials, see page 116 onward\n- For more information on Together for Sustainability, see basf.com/en/together-for-sustainability\n\n## Audit results\n\nWe carefully analyze the results of sustainability evaluations and on-site audits and document these in a central database. The supplier audits conducted over the past few years have identified some need for adjustment with respect to environmental, social and corporate governance standards, for example in waste management or deviations in occupational health and safety measures and standards  under  labor  law.  Follow-up  audits  in  2020  identified improvements,  for  example  the  correct  storage  of  hazardous substances, proper disposal of waste, the implementation of occupational and process safety measures, the correct implementation of emergency plans, and compliance with labor law requirements. In 2020, none of our audits identified any instances of child labor or dangerous work and overtime performed by persons under 18.\n\nIn January 2020, a full mining-specific re-audit was performed at our platinum supplier Sibanye-Stillwater in Marikana, South Africa, 1 in accordance with TfS standards to re-evaluate the situation following the previous audits in 2015 and 2017. This identified fundamentally solid management systems at Sibanye-Stillwater in line with good industry practice and international standards, especially in the area of health and safety. The audit also recognized the significant efforts by Sibanye-Stillwater since the acquisition of Lonmin in 2019 in the area of social engagement, as well as the establishment of an\n\n- 1 In 2012, an extended strike at a mine formerly operated by Lonmin Plc, London, UK, in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police. Employees of the platinum supplier Lonmin were among the fatalities. Ownership of the Marikana mine was transferred to Sibanye-Stillwater with its acquisition of Lonmin in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Together for Sustainability (TfS)\n\nBASF is a founding member of Together for Sustainability (TfS). The initiative was established in 2011 to improve sustainability in the supply chain. The focus is on standardizing and simplifying supplier evaluations and audits globally. This  increases transparency and creates synergies. Suppliers only have to complete an assessment process once. The results are then made available to all TfS members in a database and are mutu ally recognized - saving time and money for both parties. Suppliers are evaluated by independent experts either in  on-site audits  or  online  assessments.  The  latter  are  conducted by EcoVadis, a ratings agency specialized in sustainability analyses.\n\nAt the end of 2020, TfS had 29 members with a combined procurement spend of around \u20ac227 billion. A total of 258 audits and 4,675 online assessments were performed. As a TfS member, BASF itself is assessed and was one of the best-rated companies in 2020. With 80 points in sustainable procurement, BASF is among the top 1% in this category worldwide.\n\n- For more information on Together for Sustainability, see tfs-initiative.com",

These include maintaining the cooperation between Sibanye-Stillwater and the authorities to improve local living conditions. In addition, the audit team recommended that the implementation and management of the social engagement strategy continue to be systematically monitored.\n\nNeed for action was identified in areas such as health and safety and the environment, for example in storing corrosive substances, firefighting capabilities and compliance with soil and water emission limits. All of the deviations identified by the audit were included in an action  plan.  BASF  and  Sibanye-Stillwater  discuss  the  progress made on its implementation four times a year. The improvements were documented by the end of 2020 as planned. Sibanye- Stillwater is a member and supporter of the International Platinum Group Metals Association (IPA) sustainability initiative that was co-founded by BASF. The initiative's measures include conducting comprehensive sustainability audits in the South African platinum group metals sector and exchanging factors for success. BASF continued its regular dialog with local stakeholder groups in 2020.\n\nWe are also in regular contact with our supplier Nornickel on sustainability matters and other aspects relevant to our cooperation. These include current events and the findings from the miningspecific TfS audits conducted in 2017 at Nornickel's sites in Polar and Kola (both in Russia) and in Harjavalta, Finland. The audits identified some need for adjustment in the areas of waste, wastewater, emissions and land rehabilitation to mitigate environmental and production risks. A number of points have since been implemented,  while  others  are  still  outstanding  and  are  included  in site-specific action plans. In addition, Nornickel has committed to becoming certified according to the standards of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA). This involves comprehensive audits, which are planned for 2021.\n\n- For more information on the supplier relationship with the Sibanye-Stillwater mine, see basf.com/en/marikana\n\nSupplier Management\n\n## Supplier development\n\nUsing TfS evaluations, we pursue a risk-oriented approach with clearly defined, BASF-specific follow-up processes. If we identify deviations from our standards, we ask our suppliers to develop and implement corrective measures within a reasonable time frame. We support them in their efforts, for example by providing training on environmental, social and corporate governance topics. We trained employees from 43 Chinese suppliers in 2020 as part of a partnership with the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai, China.\n\nAs part of TfS, training was developed for suppliers that already have a sustainability rating but have potential for improvement in environmental, social and corporate governance. In 2020, more than 1,000 participants attended TfS training on this topic in China and Brazil. The TfS Supplier Academy is also developing training opportunities for our suppliers around the world. These will be imple mented in 2021.\n\nWe review our suppliers' progress according to a defined timeframe based on the sustainability risk identified, or after five years at the latest. In the case of ongoing, serious violations of the standards defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct or international principles, we reserve the right to impose commercial sanctions. These can go as far as termination of the business relationship. In 2020, this was decided in four cases.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nManagement's Report\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nSUPPLIERS\n\nBASF\n\nCUSTOMERS\n\nIn 2020, BASF purchased a total of around 30,000 different raw  materials  from  more  than  6,500  suppliers.  Using resources as efficiently and responsibly as possible and the concept of a circular economy are firmly embedded in our strategy and our actions, supported by our Verbund structure and the use of renewable and recycled feedstocks. We  expect our  suppliers  to  source  and  produce  raw  materials responsibly. In the search for alternative raw materials, we employ solutions that also contribute to sustainability.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur strategy covers the entire value chain - from responsible procurement and using and recycling raw materials efficiently in our own processes to developing green products and technologies for our  customers.  We  want  to  decouple  growth  from  resource consumption with process and product innovations to drive forward the shift toward closed-loop value creation systems (see page 30). Alongside  economic,  environmental  and  social  criteria,  we  also consider aspects such as product safety and supply security when selecting raw materials for our production processes.\n\nOur expectations of our suppliers are laid down in the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 113). We take a closer look at suppliers in critical supply chains, for example for mineral raw materials, renewable resources such as palm kernel oil, for a number of pigments or highly toxic substances. Upstream stages of the value chain are assessed for serious sustainability risks and, if necessary, suitable remedial measures are identified. In addition, we develop and test approaches to make raw materials supply more sustainable in joint initiatives with suppliers and other partners. Examples include our cooperative ventures to recycle battery materials (see page 119) or our joint activities on certified sustainable supply chains for renewable raw materials such as palm and castor oil.\n\nRaw Materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The mass balance approach\n\nMany BASF value chains start in syngas plants or steam  crackers, where fossil resources, mostly natural gas and naphtha, are converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide or important basic chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. These are used to create thousands of products in the BASF Verbund. Alongside fossil resources, bio-based and recycled raw materials such as biomethane, bio-naphtha or pyrolysis oil can be used as feedstocks. It is not possible to physically or chemically match the feedstock to the output as our plants simultaneously process fossil, bio-based and recycled raw materials. The share of biobased or recycled raw materials can be allocated to certain products using the mass balance approach, which is audited by a third party, and certification (such as the REDcert2 standard for the chemical industry). It is similar in principle to green power, which has been established for many years: Energy from renewable sources is fed into the grid and then charged to individual\n\ncustomers. Mass balance products are identical in quality to conventional  products  but  make  a  substantial  sustainability contribution to the use of bio-based or recycled raw materials. This  method  has  already  been  applied  to  over  200  BASF products (2019: around 80 products), for example, for engineering plastics, superabsorbents, dispersions and intermediates. We  share  our  expertise  in  various  stakeholder  platforms  to harmonize  and  standardize  different  allocation  methods  and certification systems for mass balance products. For instance, BASF  contributed  to  position  paper  on  the  mass  balance approach published by the industry association PlasticsEurope in 2020.\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/massbalance",

        "page_content": "2\n\nManagement's Report\n\nBASF's Verbund concept is key to making the use of raw materials in our own processes as efficient as possible: Intelligently linking and steering our plants and processes creates efficient value chains. By-products from one facility are used as feedstocks elsewhere. This saves raw materials and energy (see page 130). At the same time, the Verbund offers many opportunities to use renewable and recycled raw materials. We want to better leverage this potential going forward (see page 30). For example, we are driving forward chemical recycling of mixed plastic waste and used tires in our ChemCycling TM project (see page 118).\n\nResource efficiency and stewardship are also becoming  increasingly important topics for our customers. That is why we are constantly working to reduce the resources consumed in the production of our products, for example through more efficient processes or the use of renewable and recycled raw materials. This enables us to offer our customers solutions that make a greater contribution to sustainability, like a smaller carbon footprint. Our products also improve our customers' resource efficiency and sustainability in many areas. For example, metal pretreatment using our innovative Oxsilan \u00ae thin-film technology requires significantly less material than conventional processes. At the same time, it can achieve water savings of up to 50% and reduce energy costs by up to 40%.\n\n## Fossil and petrochemical resources\n\nBASF's most important raw materials (based on volume) include liquid gas and natural gas, as well as crude oil-based petrochemical products such as naphtha and benzene. We mainly use liquid gas and natural gas to generate energy and steam, and to produce key basic chemicals such as ammonia or acetylene. Naphtha is mostly fed into our steam cracker, where it is split into products such as ethylene and propylene - both important feedstocks for numerous value chains. We use aromatics such as benzene or toluene to manufacture  high-performance  plastics,  among  other  products. Thanks to a high degree of forward and backward integration, we can produce many feedstocks for our value chains efficiently while\n\nRaw Materials\n\nconserving  resources  within  the  BASF  Verbund.  This  increases supply  security  and  reduces  dependence  on  external  supply sources to just a few key raw materials. We source these from different suppliers to minimize supply risks.\n\nAs part of our efforts to improve sustainability, we are continuously investigating whether fossil and petrochemical resources can be replaced  with  non-fossil  alternatives.  We  carefully  consider economic,  environmental  and  social  aspects,  as  well  as  other important criteria like supply security and product safety. Our aim is to increase the share of renewable and recycled feedstocks in our value chains. This brings with it challenges and compromises in the supply of both energy and resources for carbon-based organic chemistry, for example, in striking the balance between competitiveness and the additional costs of using renewable energy, or between renewable resources and land use. We raise awareness of these trade-offs through close dialog with our stakeholders and our involvement in sustainability initiatives, and help to find solutions.\n\n## Renewable resources\n\n## \u25aa Numerous projects and cooperative ventures to improve sustainability along the value chain\n\nIn addition to fossil resources, we employ renewable raw materials, mainly based on vegetable oils, fats, grains, sugar and wood. In 2020, we purchased around 1.2 million metric tons of renewable raw materials. For instance, we use renewable resources to produce ingredients for the detergent and cleaner industry, or to source natural active ingredients for the cosmetics industry. We also use renewable feedstocks such as biomethane or bio-naphtha in our Verbund as an alternative to fossil resources. The mass balance approach allows us to  allocate the amount of renewable resources used to a wide variety of end products (see box on page 116). Examples include the biomass balance polyisobutene OPPANOL \u00ae BMBCert TM (see page 84) or the biomass balance versions of our Styropor \u00ae , Neopor \u00ae and Styrodur \u00ae insulation materials.\n\nAs  for  fossil  raw  materials,  we  also  consider  how  renewable resources impact sustainability topics along the value chain. Alongside positive effects like saving greenhouse gas emissions, these can also have negative effects on areas such as biodiversity, land use or working conditions, depending on the raw material. This is why we carefully weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of using  renewable  resources,  for  example  using  Eco-Efficiency Analyses. We also take recognized certification standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil into account in our decisions. We want to minimize raw material-specific risks and increase sustainability with measures, projects and targeted involvement in initiatives. Our activities here concentrate on value chains that are relevant quantitatively, such as palm-based raw materials, or that do not yet have certification standards, such as castor oil. We are also working on product innovations and on enhancing production processes to improve the profitability and competitiveness of renewable   resources.\n\nPalm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are some of our most important renewable resources. We mainly use these raw materials to produce ingredients for the cosmetics, detergent, cleaner and food industries. We aim to ensure that palm-based raw materials come from certified sustainable sources and have actively  supported the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2004. Based on the Group-wide Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 113), we have laid down our expectations of suppliers in the oil palm value chain in an additional Palm Sourcing Policy. This addresses aspects such as forest and peat conservation, respect of human and labor rights,  smallholder  inclusion,  and  certification  and  traceability standards. The annual BASF Palm Progress Report reports on our measures and progress toward more sustainability and  transparency in the value chain.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nManagement's Report\n\nWe purchased 227,213 metric tons of certified palm oil and palm kernel oil in 2020. We therefore reached our goal of only sourcing RSPO-certified palm oil and palm kernel oil by 2020. By 2025, we want to do the same for the most important intermediate products based on palm oil and palm kernel oil, including fractions and primary oleochemical derivatives as well as vegetable oil esters. We were able to trace 96% of our global palm footprint to oil mill level as of the end of 2020. In addition, we continued to drive  forward  the RSPO supply chain certification of our sites for  cosmetic ingredients. At the end of 2020, 25 production sites worldwide were certified by the RSPO.\n\nWe continue to see growing demand for certified palm-based products from our customers. Sales volumes rose by more than 30% compared with the previous year. We are expanding our range of certified sustainable products in accordance with the RSPO's mass balance supply chain model. This helps our customers to meet their obligations to customers, consumers and stakeholders.\n\nWe source most of our palm-based raw materials from Malaysia and Indonesia. Smallholders account for around one-third of the total volumes produced there. We have worked together with The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, the RSPO and Solidaridad in Indonesia since 2019 to strengthen smallholder structures and sustainable production methods at local level. The project in the province of Lampung supports around 1,000 independent smallholders in improving their livelihoods and the sustainable production of palm oil and palm kernel oil. The focus is on efficient and sustainable farming practices and health and safety standards. The goal is for at least one-third of program participants to become certified according to the RSPO Smallholder Standard in three years.\n\nAlso important for BASF, albeit at a much smaller scale, is castor oil. We use castor oil to manufacture products such as plastics and ingredients for paints and coatings, as well as products for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. We established the Sustainable Castor Initiative - Pragati in 2016 together with Arkema,\n\nRaw Materials\n\nJayant Agro and Solidaridad as there were previously no globally defined  and  recognized  certification  standards.  The  aim  is  to improve the economic situation of castor oil farmers in India and, at the same time, raise awareness of sustainable farming methods. Around 80% of the world's castor beans are produced in India, mainly by smallholders. As part of the project, smallholder farmers receive training on topics such as cultivation methods, efficient water use, health and the safe use of crop protection products based on a specially developed sustainability code. Since the project  was  initiated,  more  than  4,500  smallholders  and  over 8,700 hectares of land have been certified for sustainable castor cultivation. Yields from this land have risen by at least 50%  compared with baseline  2016. We will source the first certified sustainable castor oil from the program in 2021. In the long term, we want to increase the share of this oil to cover our total demand.\n\nOur raw materials for cosmetic active ingredients mainly come from plants. Two examples of holistic programs that consider the various aspects of sustainability are our products based on rambutan and argan. The rambutan tree belongs to the soapberry family. Its fruit is mainly sold for food. Our research and development discovered a method to extract the bioactives contained in the peel, leaves and seeds. The commercialization of the rambutan tree's by-products, which were previously disposed of as waste, creates new income streams for farmers and expands our portfolio of natural active ingredients. As part of our rambutan program, we have worked closely together with two small plantations in the Vietnamese province of Dong Nai since 2014, which supply us with sustainably produced, certified organic raw materials. The partnership focuses in particular on responsible farming practices and social inclusion, including gender equality, safe working conditions and fair incomes.\n\nWe have cooperated with Targanine in the region of Agadir in Morocco since 2005. The network of six argan oil cooperatives supplies 16 products - including argan oil, essential oils and bee products - to BASF under fair trade conditions. Some 2,000 women from rural areas now work in the cooperatives. Commercialization\n\nhelps to preserve the argan forest and strengthens local communities, for example, by providing additional income and through literacy programs and health initiatives. In 2020, the certification organization  Ecocert  awarded  our  cosmetic  active  ingredient Lipofructyl TM Argan the 'Fair for Life' label for the fourth time in a row, confirming the sustainability of the supply chain.\n\n- For more information on renewable resources, see basf.com/renewables\n\nFor more information on our voluntary commitment to palm oil products and the Palm Progress Report, see basf.com/en/palm-dialog\n\n## Recycled feedstocks\n\nRecycling  is  becoming  increasingly  important  due  to  limited resources, growing sustainability requirements in the markets and regulatory developments. We want to increase the use of recycled feedstocks with our Circular Economy Program. From 2025 onward, we aim to process around 250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials every year worldwide, replacing fossil raw materials (see page 30).\n\nOne focus here is chemically recycling plastic waste. This  technology complements mechanical recycling and can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is disposed of in landfill or thermally recovered. Chemical recycling breaks down plastics into their building blocks or converts them into basic chemicals. Different methods are used to achieve this. In our ChemCycling TM project, our partners use the thermochemical process of pyrolysis to extract pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or used tires, which were not previously recycled. We can feed this pyrolysis oil into our Verbund structure as an alternative to fossil raw materials and use it to make new products. These have the same properties as products manufactured from fossil feedstocks. We use a certified mas balance approach to allocate the percentage of recycled materials to the end product (see box on page 116). Since 2020, we have been able to offer our customers the first commercial Ccycled TM products. After investing in Quantafuel  AS in 2019, we expanded our supply base with",

The first test foams show promising results.\n\nBASF continues to recycle the precious metals used in automotive, process and chemical catalysts. These contain precious metals like platinum, palladium and rhodium. Treating and recovering resources from spent automotive catalysts is a complex process. All of the precious metals we recover in this way are reused as feedstocks in catalyst production.\n\nThe growing demand for electromobility is also increasing the need for lithium-ion battery recycling. As a leading producer of battery materials with local production capacities in the three main markets - Asia, Europe and the United States - in the future, BASF has in-depth expertise in battery chemistry and process technology. Together with our partners, we are leveraging this expertise to develop a closed-loop system for the raw materials used to produce cathode active materials, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and lithium. The objective is to further increase sustainability in the value chain for batteries. In 2020, we launched the project 'Recycling lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles' (ReLieVe) together with Eramet and SUEZ. The project received \u20ac4.7 million in funding from the European Union. The aim is to develop an innovative, large-scale process to recycle batteries along the entire value chain - from collecting end-of-life batteries and recovering mineral raw materials to using these in the production of new battery materials.\n\n- For more information on BASF's Circular Economy Program, see page 30\n- For more information on recycled raw materials, see basf.com/circular-economy\n\n## Mineral raw materials\n\nWe procure a number of mineral raw materials, which we use to produce  mobile  and  process  emissions  catalysts  or  battery materials, among other products. We are continually improving our products and processes to minimize the use of primary mineral raw materials. At the same time, we are driving forward the recycling of mineral raw materials, for example, by recovering platinum metals from mobile and process emissions catalysts and using these as secondary resources (see 'Recycled feedstocks').\n\nSourcing mineral raw materials responsibly is important to BASF. We have selected suppliers confirm to us that they do not source minerals as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act from the Democratic Republic of Congo or its neighboring countries. If there is cause for concern, we reserve the right to audit suppliers and, if necessary, terminate the business relationship. We implemented the E.U. Conflict Minerals Regulation by the deadline in early 2021. This defines supply chain due diligence for importers and processors of certain mineral raw materials originating from conflict regions and high-risk areas.\n\nIn addition to responsible procurement of 'conflict minerals,' BASF is committed to responsible and sustainable global supply chains for other mineral raw materials. These include cobalt, a key component in the production of battery materials for electric vehicles, among other applications. Our cobalt supply chain for battery materials is organized according to special sustainability criteria for cobalt procurement. For example, we do not purchase cobalt from artisanal mines and also aim to exclude this in supply chains through our supply chain management as long as responsible artisanal production cannot be verified. In addition, we have signed a long-term supply agreement with Nornickel for nickel and cobalt from a metal refinery in Finland. The agreement ensures locally sourced and secure supply of raw materials for battery production in Europe.\n\nTogether  with  BMW,  Samsung  SDI,  Samsung  Electronics, Volkswagen and the German governmental agency for international cooperation (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ), we have been involved in Cobalt for Development since 2018. The cross-industry initiative aims to identify how to improve working conditions in artisanal mines, as well as living conditions in the surrounding communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To achieve  this,  the  initiative  offers  programs  such  as  training  on important environmental, social and governance aspects of responsible mining practices. Training for 12 mining cooperatives in Kolwezi started in October 2020. The initiative aims to train more than 1,500 artisanal cobalt miners on topics such as occupational safety and environmental management by mid-2021. Cobalt for Development also works closely together with local nongovernmental organizations and Bon Pasteur/the Good Shepherd International Foundation to create additional income opportunities for families and improve access to education. For example, a new building for Kisote's public elementary and secondary school was constructed and training was held on topics such as farming.\n\nWe are also involved in various international initiatives to strengthen sustainability and innovation in the value chain for batteries. These include the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), which we co-founded in 2017. It brings together business, government and civil society and develops standards and tools to create a socially responsible, ecological and economically sustainable, and innovative value chain for batteries. For instance, BASF is working with the GBA on a battery pass. In the future, this 'digital twin' will contain information on the sustainability of a battery to increase transparency in the value chain. The first test version will be developed in 2021 and the battery pass should be ready to be used by the end of 2022. BASF is also an active member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).",

Third-party suppliers are requested to source mica in accordance with internationally recognized standards which, among other things, exclude child labor. As a member of the cross-industry Responsible Mica Initiative, BASF actively contributes to the eradication of child labor and unacceptable working  conditions in the Indian mica supply chain.\n\n- For more information on the Cobalt for Development project, see basf.com/cobalt-initiative\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements\n- 5 Overviews",

Our core business - the development, production, processing and transportation of chemicals - demands a responsible approach. We address environmental, health and safety risks with  a  comprehensive  Responsible  Care  Management System. We expect our employees and contractors to know the risks of working with our products, substances and plants and to handle these responsibly.\n\n## Responsible Care Management System\n\n## \u25aa Global EHS directives and standards\n\nBASF is actively involved in the International Council of Chemical Associations' (ICCA) Responsible Care \u00ae initiative and has endorsed the  Responsible  Care \u00ae Global  Charter.  Our  Responsible  Care Management System comprises the global directives, standards and procedures for environmental protection, health and safety (EHS) for the various steps along our value chain. Our regulations cover the transportation of raw materials, activities at our sites and warehouses, and distribution of our products as well as our customers' application of the products. Specifications for implementing these measures are laid out in binding directives that are introduced in  consultation  with  employee  representatives.  These  describe responsibilities, requirements and assessment methods. The Environmental Protection, Health & Safety unit in the Corporate Center defines Group-wide management and control systems and monitors compliance with internal guidelines and legal regulations, while the sites and legal entities implement these requirements locally. Our policies and requirements are continuously updated. This is why we\n\nResponsible Care Management System\n\nalso maintain dialog with government institutions, associations and international organizations.\n\nWe  set  ourselves  ambitious  goals  for  environmental  protection, health and safety (see page 32) and regularly review our performance and progress with audits. We assess the potential risks and weaknesses of all our activities - from research and production to logistics - and the effects of these on the safety and security of our employees, the environment or our surroundings. We use databases to document accidents, near misses and safety-related incidents at our sites as well as along our transportation routes to learn from these; appropriate measures are derived according to specific cause analyses.\n\n- For more information on Responsible Care \u00ae , see basf.com/en/responsible-care\n\n## Audits\n\n## \u25aa 131 audits to monitor performance and progress\n\nRegular audits help ensure that our safety, security, health and environmental protection standards are met. We conduct regular audits every three to six years at all BASF sites and at companies in which BASF is a majority shareholder. We take a risk-based approach and use an audit database to ensure that all sites and plants worldwide are regularly audited. Sites and companies acquired as part of acquisitions are audited in a timely manner to bring these into line with our standards and directives as necessary. After the integration phase is complete, they are generally audited within one to two years, depending on complexity and size. We have defined our regulations  for  Responsible  Care  audits  in  a  global  Corporate Requirement. During our audits, we create a safety and environmental profile that shows if we are properly addressing the existing hazard potential. If this is not the case, we agree on measures and monitor their implementation, for example, with follow-up audits. Our Responsible Care audit system complies with the ISO 19011 standard and is certified according to ISO 9001. Worldwide, 150\n\n- 1 The decrease compared with the previous year is attributable to the sale of the construction chemicals business and the related sites.\n\nBASF production sites are certified in accordance with ISO 14001 and EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) (2019: 183). 1 In addition,  54  sites  worldwide  are  certified  in  accordance  with OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001 (2019: 53).\n\nIn the BASF Group in 2020, 112 environmental and safety audits were conducted at 60 sites (2019: 137 audits at 90 sites). The focus was on auditing sites based on the level of risk. For production plants with a medium and high hazard potential, we additionally conducted 19 short-notice audits at seven sites (2019: 42 audits at 33 sites). The sites of the businesses acquired from Bayer in 2018 were evaluated in 2020 as planned. We aim to audit the sites acquired from Solvay in 2020 from the end of 2021.\n\nDue  to  the  coronavirus  pandemic,  medical  personnel  including auditors had to concentrate on monitoring and responding to the pandemic and on global pandemic preparedness. For this reason and due to the travel restrictions, only one site was audited on occupational medicine and health protection in 2020 (2019: 15). All other audits and health performance control visits were postponed to 2021.\n\n- For more information on occupational safety and health protection, see page 122 onward\n\n## Costs and provisions for environmental protection in the BASF Group\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                                          |       |       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                                                                                    | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Operating costs for environmental  protection                                      | 1,125 | 1,035 |\n| Investments in new and improved  environmental protection plants and  facilities a | 231   | 328   |\n| Provisions for environmental protection  measures and remediation b                | 693   | 654   |\n\n- a Investments comprise end-of-pipe measures as well as integrated environmental protection measures.\n- b Values shown refer to December 31 of the respective year.\n- For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 252 and 289",

Our global safety and security concepts serve to protect our employees, contractors and neighbors, to prevent property and environmental damage, and to protect information and company assets.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u25aa Global safety standards\n- \u25aa Strengthening risk awareness\n- \u25aa Comprehensive incident analyses and global experience and information exchange\n\nThe safety of our employees, contractors and neighbors, and protecting the environment is our top priority. This is why we have set ourselves ambitious goals for occupational and process safety as well as health protection. We stipulate mandatory global standards for safety, security, and environmental and health protection. A worldwide network of experts ensures these are implemented. As part of our continuous improvement process, we regularly monitor progress toward our goals.\n\nWe promote risk awareness for every individual with measures such as systematic hazard assessments, specific and ongoing qualification measures and global safety initiatives. We analyze accidents and incidents as well as their causes and consequences in detail at a global level to learn from these. Hazard assessments and the risk minimization measures derived from them are an important prevention tool. We also promote regular dialog across different sites to strengthen risk awareness among our employees and contractors,\n\n- 1 Hours worked by BASF employees, temporary employees and contractors\n- 2 Management's Report Safety and security\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nto learn from examples of good practice and in this way, continually develop our safety culture.\n\nBy the end of 2020, we had introduced digital solutions and applications at around 250 plants worldwide to further increase safety, security, planning capability and availability. We plan to implement these at around another 170 plants by 2022. Such solutions include augmented reality: At many sites, our employees already use mobile end devices and special apps for day-to-day tasks such as safety inspections, which continuously improves the efficiency and quality of our processes. Other applications include efficiently simulating maintenance and production processes in digital plant models and predictive maintenance. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for example, over 40 plants already use predictive maintenance models to monitor plant components such as compressors, pumps or heat exchangers.\n\nLeaders are important role models for employees, which is why environmental protection, health, safety and security are discussed with newly appointed senior executives. Senior executives with a particular responsibility for such topics, for example, in production, also  receive  specific  further  training  to  be  able  to  meet  their responsibilities. Due to the restrictions caused by the coronavirus pan demic, the seminars for senior executives could only take place to a limited extent in 2020. We will therefore expand our offering with digital formats in 2021.\n\n## Global safety initiative\n\n## \u25aa First decentralized Global Safety Days\n\nOur global safety initiative was established in 2008 and plays a key role in the ongoing development of our safety culture. For the first time, decentralized virtual safety days were held around the world in 2020. As a result of the new organizational structure and due to the different regional measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic, each\n\nsite could decide on the focus and implementation of the safety initiative. In the Asia Pacific region, many sites organized activities under the banner of 'Safety, my responsibility!' while numerous events reflecting the motto of 'Halt! Safety champions pause for safety' were held at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. Many events were held online using interactive formats In the interest of our employees' health, giving them the opportunity to find out about safety-related topics and to learn from each other. This involvement and lively discussion, even in times of a pandemic, make a major contribution to our safety culture.\n\n- For more information on the global safety initiative, see basf.com/global-safety-initiative\n\n## Occupational safety\n\n- \u25aa Employees and contractors worldwide instructed on safe behavior\n\nOur aim is to reduce the worldwide lost-time injury rate to no more than 0.1 per 200,000 working hours 1 by 2025. To prevent workrelated  accidents,  we  encourage  and  promote  risk-conscious behavior and safe working practices for every individual, learning from incidents and regular discussion. We are constantly refining and enhancing our requirements and training.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the legally required briefings, BASF requires new employ ees and contractors to complete compulsory safety training, as well as regular training on the safe handling of chemicals and the correct use of personal protective equipment for employees at our production sites.",

In the future, a new  mobile  hazard  assessment  app  can  be  used  at  the Ludwigshafen site in Germany to report occupational hazards directly on site using explosion-proof smartphones or tablets. This information can later be edited on a computer. There are many advantages to this approach. Digital processes do not just save time and avoid transcription errors - images and notes also allow more detailed information to be passed on without having to enter this twice. This makes is easier to review the effectiveness of the measures, making the app a valuable, integrated tool that complements the existing backend application. The hazard assessment app was tested at the first plants in 2020 and made more user-friendly based on the findings. We want to expand availability to further plants at the Ludwigshafen site from 2021 and share experiences from the pilot phase in a global network.\n\nSafety and security\n\nIn 2020, 0.3 work-related accidents per 200,000 working hours 1 occurred  at  BASF  sites  worldwide  (2019:  0.3).  The  share  of chemical-related  accidents  declined  slightly  to  6%  (2019:  7%). Unfortunately, there was one fatal work-related accident in 2020 (2019: 1). At the Gunsan site in South Korea, an employee of a contractor  succumbed  to  injuries  sustained  from  falling  after receiving an  electric shock during painting work on a high-voltage transmission tower. BASF supported the relevant authorities in their investigation into the circumstances and cause of the accident. We use the findings to take appropriate measures to prevent this from happening again. Such measures include regular information and awareness campaigns.\n\nFor more information on occupational safety, see basf.com/occupational\\_safety\n\n## Process safety\n\n- \u25aa Regular review of plant safety concepts and performance of implementation checks and safety-related measures\n- \u25aa Global initiatives to reduce process safety incidents\n- \u25aa Production networks and global training methods foster dialog\n\nProcess safety is a core part of safe, effective and thus sustainable production. We meet high safety standards in the planning, construction and operation of our plants around the world. These meet and, in some cases, go beyond local legal requirements.\n\nOur global standards provide the framework for the safe construction and operation of our plants as well as the protection of people and the environment. Our experts have developed a plant safety concept and implementation check for every plant that considers the key aspects of safety, health and environmental protection - from conception to startup - and stipulates specific protection measures.\n\nIn order to maintain the highest level of safety at our plants across their entire life cycles, we verify that our protection concepts, safety reviews and resulting safety measures have been carried out in all our plants at timely intervals based on risk potential. We regularly update our plants' safety and security concepts in line with changing technologies and as necessary.\n\n## 2025 target\n\nReduction of worldwide process safety incidents per 200,000 working hours\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe use the number of process safety incidents (PSI) per 200,000 working hours 1 as a reporting indicator. We have set ourselves the goal of reducing process safety incidents to a rate of no more than 0.1 per 200,000 working hours by 2025. In 2020, we recorded 0.3 process safety incidents per 200,000 working hours worldwide (2019: 0.3). We investigate every incident in detail, even under the constraints of the coronavirus pandemic, analyze causes and use the findings to derive suitable measures. We share the findings in our global network in the interest of continuous improvement.\n\nAround the world, we promote the reduction of process safety incidents and improve risk awareness with a culture of dealing openly with mistakes and initiatives to foster dialog around potential safety risks. In reducing plant safety incidents, the main focus is on the implementation of technical measures. Bolstered by a greater risk awareness, avoiding and detecting all leaks was again a key priority in 2020 with the 'Zero Loss of Containment Mindset' initiative in North America and the 'Zero leakage' initiative in South America.\n\nIn addition, we are continually refining and expanding our training methods  and  offerings  to  increase  risk  awareness.  Due  to  the restrictions associated with the coronavirus pandemic, in-person seminars were also held as virtual meetings or taught using webbased applications in 2020.",

Our worldwide standards for occupational health are specified in a requirement. A global network of experts provide implementation support. We monitor compliance with these standards at BASF sites with regular audits. 1 We measure our performance in health protection using the Health Performance Index (HPI). This has five components: recognized occupational diseases, medical emergency drills, first aid, preventive medicine and health promotion. Each component contributes a maximum of 0.2 to the total score, meaning that the highest possible score is 1.0. We aim to reach a value of more than 0.9 every year.\n\n## Development of the Health Performance Index (HPI)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith an HPI of 0.92, we once again reached this target in 2020 (2019: 0.97). The figure is slightly lower than in previous years due to the coronavirus pandemic, as a result of which a number of criteria crucial to the HPI could not be fully met. For instance, activities that required physical participation such as emergency drills, examinations or first aider training could not be held on the usual scale.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic also made many health protection measures necessary in 2020. Activating our pandemic plans, which have been mandatory for all sites since 2010, sharing information in our global BASF medical network, and working closely together with the authorities, employee representatives and our partners at BASF sites enabled us to make and successfully implement sound and timely decisions according to the situation. Our actions focused on the health of all of our employees, contractors and third parties. Measures  included  developing  hygiene  concepts,  tracing  and breaking infection chains, and providing information to and raising awareness among employees via the intranet and at the site gates.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic, the annual global health campaign on the theme 'Protect yourself and others - stay healthy in 2020' was developed at short notice and offered around the world. The focus was on preventive hygiene measures, vaccinations and preventing infection. There were also special offerings on remote working, such as videos and consultations on nutrition, exercise/ ergonomics and psychological stress. Over 450 sites worldwide took part in the health campaign with activities such as workshops, courses, talks and exercises. Another focus in 2020 was on  influenza prevention.  BASF  employees  could  be  vaccinated  against  the seasonal flu at many sites around the world, an offer that was very well received. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for example, around three times more employees participated in the vaccination campaign than in past years.\n\nWe raise employee awareness of health topics with offerings tailored to  specific  target  groups.  The  BASF  health  checks  form  the foundation of our global health promotion program and are offered to employees at regular intervals.\n\n- For more information on occupational medicine, health campaigns and the HPI, see basf.com/health",

In the event of a crisis, our global, regional or local emergency response plans and crisis management structures are engaged, depending on the impact scope. We involve situation-related partners and suppliers as well as cities, communities and neighboring companies. An IT system to support emergency response helps us to speed up communication between the relevant players in the event of a crisis and maintain the best possible overview of the situation. This enables the crisis management team to record and process events around the world better and in more detail.\n\nWe regularly check our emergency systems, crisis management structures and drill procedures with employees, contractors, local authorities and emergency rescue workers. For example, in 2020 we conducted 176 drills and simulations in Ludwigshafen, Germany, to instruct participants on our emergency response measures.\n\nWe analyze the potential safety and security risks associated with investment projects and strategic plans, and define appropriate safety and security concepts. Our guiding principle is to identify risks for the company at an early stage, assess them properly and derive appropriate safeguards.\n\nWe inform business travelers and transferees about appropriate protection measures prior to and during travel in countries with elevated security risks. After any major incident, we can use a standardized global travel system to locate and contact employees in the affected regions.\n\nWe protect our employees, sites, plants and company know-how against third-party interference. This includes, for example, analyzing potential security risks in the communities surrounding our production sites and addressing in depth the issue of cybersecurity. BASF applies the 'security by design' principle. As early as the concept  phase,  all  internet  of  things  applications  are  critically reviewed from a cybersecurity perspective. We are continually developing our ability to prevent, detect and react to security incidents with various measures and training programs. Our global Cyber  Security  Defense  Center  monitors  and  protects  our  IT systems against hacker attacks. We cooperate closely with a global network of experts and partners to ensure that we can protect ourselves against cyberattacks as far as possible. Our IT security system is certified according to ISO 27001:2013. This also includes ISO 27019:2018 for critical infrastructure.\n\nAround the world, we work to sensitize our employees about protecting  information  and  know-how.  For  example,  we  further strengthened our employees' awareness of risks in 2020 with mandatory online training for all employees and other offerings such as seminars, case studies and interactive training. We have defined mandatory information protection requirements to ensure compliance with our processes for protecting sensitive information and perform audits to monitor this.\n\nOur worldwide network of information protection officers comprises around 650 employees. They support the implementation of our uniform requirements and hold events and seminars on secure behaviors. Around 100,000 employees had been trained on the basics of cybersecurity and information protection in 2020. Our standardized Group-wide recommendations for the protection of information and knowledge were expanded to include additional guidance  for  employees  and  updated  in  line  with  current developments.\n\n- For more information on emergency response, see basf.com/emergency\\_response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global Be Secure month\n\nCyberattacks have become commonplace. Social engineering calls in particular have risen sharply in recent times. Alongside technical security, every individual's conduct plays an important role  in  protecting  companies  against  information  theft  and cyber crime.\n\nWe want to raise employee awareness around cybersecurity and give them the tools to effectively defend themselves. As well as online training, which is compulsory for all employees, we hold a Be Secure month every year in October. In 2020, over 16,000 employees participated in around 90 events in nine languages. These ranged from talks on topics such as counter-espionage at BASF to live hacking demonstrations by an external digital forensics expert. In addition, information protection officers around the world organized regional and local  events,  mainly  held  online  due  to  the  coronavirus pan demic.",

We continuously work to ensure that our products pose no risk to people or the environment when they are used responsibly and in the manner intended.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## \u25aa Global directives with uniformly high standards\n\nProduct stewardship is of central importance for us. We want to ensure that our products meet our customers' quality expectations and pose no risk to people, animals or the environment when used in the manner intended. We are committed to continuously minimizing the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety along the value chain - from development to disposal and to the ongoing optimization of our products. This commitment to  product  stewardship  is  enshrined  in  our  Responsible  Care \u00ae charter and the initiatives of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). Our aim is to comply with all relevant national and international laws and regulations. Our global requirements define rules, processes and responsibilities, for example, to ensure uniformly high product stewardship standards worldwide. In some cases, voluntary initiatives exceed local statutory regulations. We regularly conduct internal audits to monitor compliance with global standards.\n\nWe maintain and evaluate environmental, health and safety data for all of our substances and products in a global database. This information is continuously updated. The database forms the basis for our safety data sheets, which we make available to our customers in around 40 languages. These include information on the physical/ chemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of products,\n\nProduct stewardship\n\npotential hazards, first aid measures, measures to be taken in the case of accidental release, and disposal. Our global emergency hotline network enables us to provide information around the clock. In order to help users to quickly find out about our products and the risks associated with them, we use the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) to classify and label our products around the world, provided this is legally permissible in the country concerned. We take into account  any  national  or  regional  modifications  within  the  GHS framework, such as the CLP Regulation in the European Union or HazCom in the United States. We train our employees, customers and logistics partners worldwide on the proper handling and optimal use of selected products with particular hazard potential. In associations and together with other manufacturers, BASF is pushing for the establishment of voluntary global commitments to prevent the misuse of chemicals.\n\nBASF supports the implementation of initiatives such as the Global Product Strategy (GPS) of the ICCA. GPS is establishing worldwide standards and best practices to improve the safety management of chemical substances and to support governments in the introduction of local chemical regulations. We are also involved in initiatives such as workshops and training seminars in emerging markets. In 2020, these included the virtual ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) workshop on regulatory cooperation.\n\n- For more information on GPS, see basf.com/en/gps\n\n## Global chemicals regulations\n\nMost of the products we manufacture are subject to statutory chemicals regulations. We want to ensure compliance with these. We are bound by the relevant regional and national chemicals regulations, which continue to grow in number worldwide. Examples include REACH in the European Union, TSCA in the United States, KKDIK in Turkey or K-REACH in South Korea. BASF Group companies work closely together with a global network of experts to ensure that BASF complies with the applicable regulations. For example,\n\nwe submitted the relevant substances to the Turkish authorities in 2020 - an important milestone in the pre-SIEF notification process. 1\n\nAfter successfully registering all substances in Europe, our REACH activities  concentrate  on  aspects  such  as  dossier  evaluation, substance evaluation, authorization and restriction. We are also required to continually update our registration dossiers. To satisfy the complex requirements of REACH, we are in regular contact with suppliers,  customers,  industry  associations  and  government authorities.  For  example,  BASF  is  working  together  with  the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on a project to improve the quality of REACH dossiers. BASF was one of the first companies to join this industry-wide initiative.\n\n## Product stewardship for crop protection products and seeds\n\nCrop protection products and seeds are highly regulated at national and international level, which brings with it strict requirements for registering and re-registering active ingredients and crop systems. Regulatory approval is only granted when extensive documentation can be provided showing that our products are safe for people, animals and the environment. Potential risks are assessed and minimized throughout the research, development and registration process, and on an ongoing basis following successful market registration. We regularly perform a large number of scientific studies and tests to ensure that, as far as possible, our registration dossiers address all questions on potential environmental and health effects.\n\nWe adapt our portfolio to the specific regional markets as crops, soils, climate conditions, plant diseases and farming practices vary around  the  world.  Consequently,  product  approvals  differ  from country to country.\n\nBASF adheres to the International Code of Conduct issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture\n\n- 1 Pre-SIEF notification for KKDIK, Turkish REACH, is similar but not identical to pre-registration under E.U. REACH. It serves to bring together future registrants for the purposes of joint registration and to enable the creation of a SIEF (substance information exchange forum).",

We communicate changes to instructions for use through channels such as our Farmer Field School initiatives in Asia and in training programs such as the On-Target Application Academy in the United States or our FarmNetwork Sustainability in Europe.\n\nOne of the ways we meet our commitment to product stewardship is by offering a wide range of courses and training on the safe storage and safe use of our products. In India, for example, BASF launched  the  Suraksha  Hamesha  program.  Suraksha  Hamesha means 'safety all the time.' The program creates a platform for educating farmers and agricultural workers about the nine steps of responsible use of crop protection products and personal protection. Through Suraksha Hamesha, BASF has engaged with around 150,000 agricultural workers and around 29,000 users across India since 2016. BASF also involves government agencies and the central government's farm extension teams in these meetings to\n\nProduct stewardship\n\nsupport and promote farm safety. We are additionally involved in numerous  scientific  and  public  organizations  and  initiatives. Together, we are working on solutions for sustainable agriculture that meet long-term economic, ecological and social needs.\n\nWe also work closely together with associations such as Crop Life International and the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) to promote the safe and proper use of crop protection products. For example, we support the two associations' safe use initiatives and various programs on the proper disposal and recycling of product containers.  Technological  innovations  developed  together  with industry partners such as the easyconnect closed transfer system in Europe or the Wisdom system in South America also help to make using crop protection products easier and safer.\n\n- For more information on our Agricultural Solutions segment, see page 100 onward\n\nFor more information on biodiversity, see page 142 onward\n\n## Environmental and toxicological testing\n\n## \u25aa Use of alternative methods for animal studies\n\nBefore launching products on the market, we subject them to a variety of environmental and toxicological testing using state-of-theart knowledge and technology. Animal studies are only conducted when they are required by law, for example as part of REACH, and none of the alternative methods approved by the authorities are available.\n\nWe adhere to the specifications laid down by the German Animal Welfare Act as well as the requirements of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care - the highest standard for laboratory animals in the world. We develop and are continuously optimizing alternative methods to experimentally assess the safety and tolerance of our products without animal studies. Our aim is to replace, reduce and refine animal studies to minimize the impact on them. We already use alternative methods in more than a third of our toxicological tests. Currently, 35 alternative\n\nmethods are being used in our labs and another 14 are in the development stage. BASF spent \u20ac3.5  million toward this purpose in 2020. The development of alternative methods for testing the potential of substances to induce developmental toxicity has been a focus area of our research since 2017.\n\nSince 2016, BASF SE's Experimental Toxicology and Ecotoxicology department has been working together with a total of 39 partners on one of the largest European collaborative projects for alternative methods. The project, planned to run for six years, aims to develop alternative methods to the point that chemical risk assessments can be efficiently conducted largely without animal testing. We are also involved in initiatives such as the European Partnership for Alternative  Approaches  to  Animal  Testing  (EPAA)  to  strengthen  the cross-sector development of alternative methods.\n\n## Management of new technologies\n\n## \u25aa Continual safety research on nano- and biotechnology\n\nNanotechnology and biotechnology offer solutions for key societal challenges - such as environmental and climate protection or health and nutrition. For example, nanomaterials can improve battery performance and biocatalytic methods can improve process resource efficiency. We want to harness the potential of both technologies. Using them safely and responsibly is our top priority.\n\nSafe handling of nanomaterials is stipulated in our Nanotechnology Code of Conduct. In recent years, we have conducted over 250 scientific studies and participated in numerous Verbund projects related to the safety of nanomaterials in Germany and around the world. The results were published in more than 150 scientific  articles.\n\nTogether with partners from academia and government authorities, we are working on E.U.-funded projects to develop and validate methods for evaluating and grouping nanomaterials without the use of animal studies. In particular, grouping nanoforms can reduce",

This is why we are developing new methods to group nanomaterials in groups with the same hazard potential in the E.U.'s PATROLS project. In the E.U.'s GRACIOUS project, we are developing  concepts  for  defining  and  then  evaluating  the  toxicological effects of these groups. In addition, together with the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC), we developed an internet application (NanoApp) and put this online in late November 2020. This makes the concepts developed to date available for the entire industry together with the regulatory requirements. The aim is to simplify the registration of nanomaterial groups under REACH.\n\nAppropriate OECD testing and implementation guidelines must be developed  for  the  new  requirements  for  nanomaterials  under REACH,  the  European  chemicals  regulation.  We  support  this process by contributing our expertise in various working groups of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the OECD's Business and Industry Advisory Group (BIAC). Many of the methods developed for nanoparticles could, in our view, also be used to evaluate solid particles in the future, an approach we bring up in regulatory discussions.\n\nBASF makes successful use of biotechnology. We produce a range of products with the help of biotechnological methods. This provides us with extensive experience in their safe use in research and development as well as in production. Biotechnological methods are used to develop and produce products such as natural flavors and fragrances, enzymes and vitamins. Another application is the development of seeds for agriculture. We use both conventional and molecular  biological  methods  to  develop  plants  with  improved characteristics, such as greater resistance to drought, pests or the pathogens that cause plant diseases. Tolerance of certain herbicides also secures yields and enables sustainable, no-till crop systems to increase CO2 retention in the soil. Innovative breeding technologies can play a key role in the sustainable development of agriculture, for\n\nProduct stewardship\n\nexample, with varieties that are better adapted to changing environmental conditions or that have higher disease tolerance. In using biotechnology, we want to adhere to all relevant standards and legal regulations governing production and marketing. We are also  guided by the code of conduct set out by EuropaBio, the European biotechnology association.",

This is why we depend on reliable logistics partners, global standards and an effective organization. Our goal is to minimize risks along the entire transportation chain - from loading and transportation to unloading. Some of our guidelines for the transportation of dangerous goods go above and beyond national and international dangerous goods requirements. We have defined global guidelines and requirements for the storage of our products and regularly monitor compliance with these through audits and assessments.\n\n## Accident prevention and emergency response\n\n## \u25aa Risk assessments for transportation and storage\n\nWe regularly assess the safety and environmental risks of transporting and storing raw materials and sales products with high hazard potential  using  our  global  requirement.  This  is  based  on  the Guidance on Safety Risk Assessment for Chemical Transport Operations  published  by  the  European  Chemical  Industry  Council (CEFIC). We also have binding global standards for load safety.\n\nWe stipulate worldwide requirements for our logistics service providers and assess them in terms of safety and quality. Our experts use our own evaluation and monitoring tools as well as internationally\n\n- 1 Hazardous goods are classified in accordance with national and international hazardous goods regulations.\n\nTransportation and storage\n\napproved schemes such as the ship inspection reports issued by the Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF).\n\n## Transportation incidents\n\nWe are systematically implementing our measures to improve transportation safety. We report in particular on goods spillages that could lead to significant environmental impacts such as dangerous goods leaks of BASF products in excess of 200 kilograms on public traffic routes, provided BASF arranged the transport.\n\nWe recorded two incidents in 2020 with spillage of more than 200 kilograms of dangerous goods 1 (2019: 3). None of these transportation incidents had a significant impact on the environment (2019: 0).\n\n## Securing raw materials supply via the Rhine River\n\nAt the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, around 50% of incoming volumes are transported to the site by ship under normal conditions. In recent years, hot and dry summers often led to extended low water levels on the Rhine River, temporarily impacting logistics. We are implementing various measures to make the site more resilient to extended low water events in particular. These include a digital early warning system for low water, which was introduced in 2020. This makes it possible to forecast water level trends up to six weeks in advance, which significantly simplifies planning for raw materials supply and alternative transportation routes. We are also working with the German Federal Institute for Hydrology to improve water level forecasts. In addition, we chartered more ships that can navigate low water levels and invested in making loading stations more flexible. Together with partners, we are also developing our own type of ship designed for extreme low-water situations, which should start operation in late 2022. We support the hydraulic engineering measures proposed by the German Federal Ministry of Transport's 'Low water on the Rhine' action plan, in particular\n\noptimizing fairways on the Middle Rhine to improve long-term shipping conditions on the Rhine. We recorded no extended low water events that significantly restricted our logistics in 2020.\n\n## Activities in external networks\n\nWe are actively involved in external networks, which quickly provide information and assistance in emergencies. These include the International Chemical Environmental (ICE) initiative and the German Transport Accident Information and Emergency Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a coordinating role. In 2020, we provided assistance to public emergency response agencies and other companies in 112 cases (2019: 165). This included information on chemicals and their proper disposal, on-site operational support for transportation accidents involving hazardous goods, or information on human biomonitoring. We apply the experience we have gathered to improve our own processes and set up similar systems in other countries.\n\n- For more information on transportation safety, see basf.com/distribution\\_safety For more information on emergency response, see basf.com/emergency\\_response",

We want to further reduce emissions along the value chain. To achieve this, we rely on efficient technologies for generating steam and electricity, for example, and the increased use of renewable energies. We make our production processes as energy efficient as possible with the help of comprehensive energy management. We are researching and developing completely new processes and technologies to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. In addition, our climate protection products make an important contribution toward emission reduction and resource efficiency.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u25aa Climate protection target: CO2-neutral growth until 2030\n- \u25aa Carbon management to reduce emissions\n\nClimate protection is very important to us and is an important part of our corporate strategy. As a leading chemical company, we want to achieve CO2-neutral 1 growth until 2030. We aim to keep total greenhouse gas emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases  stable  at  the  2018  level  while  growing  production volumes. Based on our growth plans until 2030, this would mean reducing our specific greenhouse gas emissions by up to one-third compared with 2018. To achieve this, we have adopted comprehensive carbon management (see page 135) with three strategic levers: optimizing our plants, increasingly sourcing low-carbon energy, and developing completely new, low-emission technologies and processes. With these innovations, we want to lay the foundation for significant emissions reductions from 2030 onward. In connection with our climate protection target, we made Group-wide CO2 emissions one of our most important key performance indicators at the\n\n## Schematic overview: development of the BASF Group's greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Purchasing electricity from renewable sources\n\nbeginning of the 2020 business year (see page 33). This makes emissions even more important to the operational and strategic steering of the BASF Group.\n\nOur climate protection activities are based on a comprehensive analysis of our emissions. We report on greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as well as the sector-specific standard for the chemical industry. Sharp increases in our greenhouse gas emissions, due for example to the startup of large-scale plants, are progressively offset. We assess investments and acquisitions with respect to the impact on our climate protection target. If, for technical or economic reasons, our carbon management activities cannot stabilize emissions at the 2018 level, we will also consider taking short-term external offsetting measures such as purchasing certificates.\n\nMost of our greenhouse gas emissions are from the consumption of energy. At sites with internal supply capabilities, we primarily rely on\n\n- 1 The goal includes other greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents.\n- 2 Costs not relevant to the calculation of this share include research expenses in early innovation stages of the phase-gate process, patent costs and expenses for supporting services.\n\nhighly efficient combined heat and power plants with gas and steam turbines, and on the use of heat released by production processes. Furthermore, we are committed to energy management that helps us analyze and further improve the energy efficiency of our plants on an ongoing basis. We continuously analyze potential risks to our business operations arising in connection with the topics of energy and climate protection and derive appropriate measures.\n\nWe offer our customers solutions that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy and resource efficiency. More than 40%  of  our  annual  research  and  development  spending 2 goes toward developing these products and optimizing our processes, as well as toward research projects to make our processes more energy and resource-efficient and to prevent greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe participate in the program established by the international nonprofit organization CDP for reporting on data relevant to climate",

BASF achieved a score of A- in CDP's 2020 climate change questionnaire, again attaining Leadership status. Companies on the Leadership level are  distinguished  by  factors  such  as  the  completeness  and trans parency of their reporting. They also pursue comprehensive approaches in managing the opportunities and risks associated with climate change as well as strategies to achieve company-wide emission reduction goals.\n\nClimate protection is a shared global task. This is why we support various international initiatives and are involved in partnerships. For instance, we are committed to an ambitious climate policy as part of the Business 20 (B20) - the central dialog platform between business and politics in the G20 group of countries. In 2020, we helped draft climate protection recommendations for the G20 Summit in Saudi Arabia as a member of the B20's taskforce on Energy, Sustainability & Climate. BASF also supports the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2020, we contributed to the TCFD report on climate-related  scenario analyses as a member of a TCFD advisory group. Since the 2019 reporting year, BASF's annual report has included an overview showing the sections and subsections in which TCFD-relevant information can be found (see page 19).\n\n- For more information on climate protection, see basf.com/climate\\_protection\n\n## Global target and measures\n\nWe want to achieve CO2-neutral growth until 2030. In other words, we  aim  to  maintain  total  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  our production sites (excluding emissions from sale of energy to third parties) and our energy purchases at the 2018 level (21.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents) while increasing production. In 2020, the emissions reported under this target amounted to 20.8 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents, an increase of 3.5% compared with the previous year (2019: 20.1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents).

This was mainly due to changes in BASF's portfolio from the acquisition of the carbon-intensive polyamide business from Solvay and the sale of the less carbon-intensive construction chemicals business. In addition, some plants could not be run at optimal capacity due to weaker demand as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to higher specific emissions.

These are residues from chemical production plants that can no longer be reused. We cover more than 70% of the BASF Group's electricity demand with gas and steam turbine plants in highly efficient combined heat and power plants. Compared with separate methods of generating steam and electricity, we saved 12.0  million MWh of fossil fuels and avoided 2.4 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2020. In 2020, internally generated power in the BASF Group had a carbon footprint of around 0.24 metric tons of CO2 per MWh of electricity and was below the national grid factor at most BASF Group locations. The figure for purchased electricity in 2020 was around 0.41 metric tons of CO2 per MWh (market-based approach). As part of our carbon management (see page 135), we therefore initially aim to reduce the carbon footprint of purchased electricity.\n\nThe Verbund system is an important component of our energy efficiency strategy: Waste heat from one plant's production process is used as energy in other plants. In this way, the Verbund saved us around 18.7 million MWh in 2020, which translates to 3.8 million metric tons less CO2 released into the environment. With combined\n\npower  and  steam  generation  as  well  as  our  optimized  Energy Verbund, we were thus able to avoid a total of 6.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2020.\n\nWe further improved energy and resource consumption in production with numerous projects around the world in 2020. In China, for example, we reduced our steam demand by optimizing steam traps at the Caojing site and installing a steam cooler at the Nanjing site. In the United States, we saved electricity by replacing a cooling tower at the Geismar site and modernizing a chilling unit in Freeport, among other measures. Process improvements at many other sites led to additional savings in steam, electricity and fuel.\n\nWe also rely on locally available sources to supply our sites with power. We generally consider the use of renewable energies in our decision-making processes, especially when purchasing electricity. Our research also helps to increase the efficiency of technologies for using renewable energy sources.\n\n## Carbon footprint and climate protection products\n\n- \u25aa Reporting on greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain\n- \u25aa Customers' use of BASF climate protection products avoids greenhouse gas emissions\n- \u25aa Calculation of product carbon footprints to increase transparency for our customers\n\nBASF has published a comprehensive corporate carbon footprint every year since 2008. This reports on all emissions along the value chain - from raw materials extraction to production and disposal. It also shows, on the basis of selected climate protection products, the emissions avoided through the use of these products.\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions arising before and after BASF's activities in the value chain (Scope 3 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) amounted to around 92 million metric tons of",

In 2020, BASF implemented a new digital application to calculate transport-related emissions, which evaluated around 68  billion metric ton kilometers for transport within BASF and to BASF customers by distance and transportation mode.\n\nOur climate protection products offer our customers solutions to avoid greenhouse gas emissions over their entire life cycle compared with reference products. The systematic analysis we conduct on our portfolio - Sustainable Solution Steering (see page 45) - rates the use of these Accelerator solutions as particularly good with respect to climate protection and energy.\n\nOne example of Accelerator products are our lubricant additives, which give hydraulic fluids long-term lubrication stability combined with wear and corrosion protection. These can be used to design high-quality products with a longer service life. Together with our customer  Fuchs  Petrolub,  we  examined  the  environmental  and climate friendliness of different hydraulic fluids. A joint eco-efficiency analysis analyzed three mineral oil-based fluids from Fuchs over their entire life cycle, including over 8,000 hours of use in a crawler excavator.\n\nIn the future, we will calculate cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions for almost all of our products to increase carbon transparency for our customers. We use an in-house digital solution to calculate the  product  carbon  footprint  (PCF).  The  methodology  follows general standards for life cycle analysis such as ISO  14044 and ISO 14067, as well as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product Standard. We used the new method to calculate PCFs for the first products in 2020. We want to make the data for around 45,000 sales products available by the end of 2021. The transparency this creates enables us to target our CO2 reduction measures to those areas where our customers can later achieve the greatest value added from lower carbon emissions in the value chain.\n\n- For more information on the sustainability analysis of our product portfolio, see page 45 onward\n- For more information on our emissions reporting, see basf.com/corporate\\_carbon\\_footprint\n\nThis showed that a standard hydraulic fluid has the lowest carbon footprint during the production stage. BASF uses more energy to produce  the  lubricant  additives  needed  for  high-performance hydrau lic fluids, which means that these have higher carbon emissions. However, these products offer a significant advantage during the use phase: Compared with a standard hydraulic fluid, these reduce friction and increase pump efficiency, which significantly reduces the excavator's fuel consumption. They save 9,600 liters of diesel over 8,000 hours of crawler excavator operation. Viewed over the entire life cycle, the high-performance hydraulic fluids therefore have a much better carbon footprint than standard hydraulic fluids. Overall, the reduction in greenhouse gases corresponds to around 30 metric tons of CO2 equivalents. In addition, high-per for mance hydraulic fluids have a much longer service life, which also saves fossil resources.\n\nThe findings of the study show that the advantages of high-performance oils first become clear in a holistic cradle-to-grave assessment  that  also  considers  the  use  phase.  The  product-related greenhouse gases emitted from resource extraction to the production of precursors and the BASF product (cradle to gate) are an impor tant part of this approach.",

        "page_content": "## Climate protection with carbon management\n\nClimate protection is firmly embedded in our corporate purpose, 'We create chemistry for a sustainable future,' and is a cornerstone of our strategy. We are committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and the goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Our innovative climate protection products such as insulation materials for buildings or battery materials for electromobility play a role here. We are also continually working to reduce our own carbon emissions. We have already almost halved our carbon emissions since 1990 through improvements to processes and methods - while simultaneously doubling sales product volumes.\n\nUntil 2030, we want to grow our production without adding further CO2 emissions. 1 Our carbon management bundles our global activities to meet this climate protection target and further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. We have adopted a three-pronged approach: We aim to increase production and process efficiency, purchase electricity from renewable sources, and develop completely new low-emission technologies and processes. We want to use these to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions from 2030 onward.\n\n## Further improving process and energy efficiency\n\nWe aim to make our plants and processes even more efficient and resource-saving. When investing in our sites, we draw on our expertise and innovative technologies to optimize the use of raw materials and in this way, reduce CO2 emissions. For example, our gas and steam turbine power plant at the Schwarzheide site in Germany is currently undergoing a \u20ac73 million modernization. Once it is started up in 2022, it will produce 10% more electricity and the CO2 emissions factor of the power generated will be around 10% lower thanks to higher fuel efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBASF's  Verbund  concept  also  plays  a  key  role  in  increasing efficiency. It helps us to realize synergies across all segments and to efficiently steer value chains. Intelligently linking production and energy demand enables us to use fewer resources and reduce our emissions.  Together, combined power and steam generation and our continuously enhanced Energy Verbund avoided a total of 6.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2020  (see page 133).\n\nThat is why we will continue to invest in the creation and optimization of Verbund  structures and drive forward the consolidation of production at  highly efficient sites.\n\n## Increasing use of renewable energy\n\nOur carbon management aims to increase the share of renewables in our energy supply. Nineteen sites in Europe and North America already  source  partially  or  fully  emission-free  elec tricity  from suppliers.\n\nNumber of sites partially or fully powered by emission-free electricity in 2020\n\n19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWherever  possible,  we  incorporate  renewable  energies  when constructing plants and modernizing or establishing new sites. For example, we only used hydropower for the construction of our new battery materials plant in Harjavalta, Finland, in 2020 (planned startup: 2022). We plan to mainly use locally generated renewable electricity in the operational phase as well. This will enable us to offer cathode active materials with a lower carbon footprint. In 2020, we also started up photovoltaic plants with a nameplate capacity of around 1,300 kWp (kilowatt peak), for example at the Caojing and Pudong sites in China.\n\n## Developing climate-smart technologies\n\nMost of our production processes and methods are already highly optimized,  making  further  improvements  to  existing  plants  an increas ingly difficult task. As a result, completely new technologies are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the long term and on a large scale. BASF researchers are working at full speed on this in our Carbon Management R&D Program, which focuses on the production of basic chemicals. These are the basis for many",

        "page_content": "value chains and account for around 70% of the chemical industry's greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.\n\nPotential CO2 avoided by electrical heating concepts for steam crackers\n\n## up to 90%\n\nAs part of this R&D program, we are developing an innovative, climate-friendly production process for hydrogen (methane pyrolysis) together with partners from academia and industry in a project sponsored  by  the  German  Federal  Ministry  of  Education  and Research, to name one example. Hydrogen is used as a reactant in many chemical processes, such as ammonia synthesis. However, the processes currently used to produce hydrogen from methane, such as steam reforming, are extremely CO2 emission-intensive. In methane pyrolysis, by contrast, methane is split directly into hydrogen and carbon. The resulting solid carbon could be used in the future to produce aluminum, for example. Methane pyrolysis requires around 80% less electricity than the alternative method of producing hydrogen using water electrolysis. If this energy comes from renewable sources, the process could be made carbon-free. Following extensive groundwork, including research into the reaction kinetics of the pyrolysis process and technical feasibility studies, we started up a test facility for methane pyrolysis at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany in 2020. It will provide insights into the heating concept, as well as the use of new types of high-temperature materials.\n\nAnother focus area of the R&D program is alternative heating concepts for our steam crackers. These large-scale industrial plants are used in the chemical industry to split petroleum into olefins and aromatics. To do this, it needs to reach temperatures of 850\u00b0C and higher. The cracker's furnaces are usually operated with natural gas. An interdisciplinary team is working on developing a fundamentally new furnace concept based on an electrical resistance heater (e-furnace). If powered by renewable energy, this could avoid up to 90% of CO2 emissions.\n\nAnother example from our Carbon Management R&D Program, which  has  been  marketed  since  mid-2019  in  cooperation  with Linde, is a process known as dry reforming to produce syngas from methane and CO2. Thanks to BASF's newly developed SYNSPIRE\u2122 catalyst in combination with an innovative process technology from Linde, less water vapor is required in syngas production and CO2 is used in the process as a raw material. In this way, the DRYREF\u2122 technology improves plants' energy and carbon footprint.\n\n## The framework for the transformation\n\nThe transition toward a climate-friendly society remains a fundamental challenge of the 21st century. There are many ways in which the chemical industry can be part of the solution. The political and regulatory environment is also crucial to the development and industrial application of completely new production processes. Demand for green electricity will increase sharply with innovative, more climate-friendly technologies. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany alone, we would need to roughly triple or quadruple our current electricity use (2020: 6.0 TWh) to fully implement new, low-carbon electricity-based production processes. As well as its availability, the price of green power is also a critical success factor. High prices are already hindering the more widespread adoption of green power today and impact the economic feasibility of future, new production processes. Sectors like the chemical industry, which compete in an international market, cannot pass on the additional costs caused by low-carbon  technologies  to  their  customers  until  a  comparable carbon pricing mechanism exists globally - or at least at G20 level. Until then, governments must implement measures to ensure the competitiveness of climate-friendly processes.\n\n- For more information on carbon management, see basf.com/en/carbon-management\n\n## Methane pyrolysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Our  plants  are operated  responsibly  and  we  use  natural  resources  with respect. We have set ourselves standards in global requirements and are continually improving the resource efficiency of our processes with our Operational Excellence program.\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u25aa Minimizing environmental impacts\n- \u25aa Maximizing recovery options\n\nRegular monitoring of our emissions to air is a part of our environmental management. In addition to greenhouse gases (see page 130 onward), we also measure and analyze emissions of air pollutants to avoid potentially harmful substances as best possible.\n\nOur waste management is based on the systematic tracking of material flows and follows a clear hierarchy. We aim to avoid waste as far as possible. If this is not possible, we review the options for recycling or energy recovery in terms of a circular economy. Nonrecyclable waste is disposed of properly and in an environmentally responsible manner.  BASF's Verbund structure helps us to avoid or reduce waste. We regularly audit external waste disposal companies to ensure that waste is disposed of properly. In this way, we also contribute to preventive soil protection and keep today's waste from becoming tomorrow's contamination. If soil and groundwater contamination occurs at active or former sites, appropriate remediation measures are reviewed and implemented.\n\n- 1 The comparative figure for 2019 has been adjusted to reflect updated data.\n- 2 Heavy metals are included in the figure for dust (see the table 'Emissions to air').\n\nAir, waste and soil\n\n## Emissions to air\n\n## \u25aa Emissions to air slightly lower\n\nTotal emissions of air pollutants from our production plants  amounted to 23,791 metric tons in 2020 (2019: 25,040 metric tons 1 ).   Emissions of ozone-depleting substances as defined by the Montreal Protocol totaled 14 metric tons in 2020 (2019: 26 metric tons 1 ). The  successive changeover to alternative coolants has significantly reduced these emissions, down from 229 metric tons in 2002. Emissions of heavy metals 2 in 2020 amounted to 4 metric tons (2019: 5 metric tons 1 ).\n\n## Emissions to air\n\n| Metric tons Air pollutants from BASF operations   | 2020   | 2019     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| CO (carbon monoxide)                              | 3,507  | 3,530    |\n| NOX (total nitrogen oxides)                       | 10,010 | 10,534   |\n| NMVOC (nonmethane volatile organic compounds)     | 4,702  | 4,496    |\n| SOX (total sulfur oxides)                         | 1,861  | 1,982    |\n| Dust                                              | 2,000  | 2,320 a  |\n| NH3 (ammonia) and other inorganic substances      | 1,711  | 2,178    |\n| Total                                             | 23,791 | 25,040 a |\n\n- a The comparative figure for 2019 has been adjusted to reflect updated data.\n\nWe want to further reduce our emissions with various measures. For instance, we use catalysts to reduce nitrogen oxides or feed waste gases back into the production process. One example of this is the production of adipic acid at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. The nitrous oxide generated in the process is not broken down, but isolated and used in the BASF Verbund as a feedstock for intermediates. This reduces our emissions and simultaneously increases process and resource efficiency.\n\nIn addition, our portfolio contains a variety of products to help reduce the emission of air pollutants - from process catalysts for industry applications and plastics additives to catalysts for the automotive industry.\n\n## Management of waste and contaminated sites\n\n- \u25aa Total waste volume slightly lower\n- \u25aa Systematic management of contaminated sites\n\nWe use the BASF Verbund to efficiently manage our material flows. The by-products of one plant often serve as feedstocks for another plant, avoiding waste. At the Antwerp site in Belgium, for example, we re-use a carboxylate solution from the cyclohexanone plant in the production of soda ash. Other material flows can be used to generate steam, which saves fossil fuels.\n\nWe are working intensively on solutions for a circular economy (see page  30). We want to further reduce our demand for primary resources and at the same time, help to reduce waste generation through better recycling, for example, of platinum group metals, or the use of recycled feedstocks such as pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or used tires (see see page 119). We are also involved in various initiatives to avoid waste and strengthen the circular economy. For example, as a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), we cooperate with around 50 other companies along the value chain to put plastic waste to good use and reduce the amount that enters the environment. The AEPW intends to invest up to $1.5  billion in various projects and cooperative ventures to this end, mainly in Asia and Africa (see box on page 138).",

It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, to make our products and transport our goods. We are committed to its responsible use along the entire value chain and  especially in our production sites' water catchment areas. We have set ourselves a global target for sustainable water management.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## \u25aa Using water responsibly with sustainable water management\n\nBASF is committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. These cover topics such as the responsible use and sustainable management of water (SDG 6). We have defined global standards and processes in our Responsible Care Management System.\n\nSustainable water management has been a central element of our strategy to use water responsibly for many years. We aim to introduce sustainable water management at all relevant production sites. These include our Verbund sites and sites in water stress areas. 1 Our sustainable water management aims to protect water as a resource, continuously improve water use efficiency, and consistently reduce emissions. We consider the quantitative, qualitative and social aspects of water use.\n\nWe advocate the responsible use of water as a resource along the entire value chain. We audit supplier compliance with environmental standards in our regular supplier assessments (see page 113). In addition, we support a wide range of initiatives to promote sustainability in the supply chain (see page 117). Our Responsible Care Management System (see page 121) and global process and trans-\n\n- 2 Management's Report Water\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nportation safety standards (see pages 123 and 129 ) aim to maintain good water quality and minimize the risk of product spillages into water bodies.\n\nWe offer our customers solutions that help purify water and use it more  efficiently  while  minimizing  pollution.  These  include  highperformance plastics to produce ultrafiltration membranes, seeds with higher drought and heat tolerance, or water-saving thin-film processes for metal pretreatment. Together with other companies from along the value chain, we are also involved in global initiatives such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (see page 138), the World Plastics Council and Operation Clean Sweep to prevent plastics from entering the environment, especially water bodies.\n\nWe report transparently and comprehensively on water. For instance, we again provided detailed answers to the 2020 water survey from the nonprofit organization CDP. In the final assessment, BASF again achieved the top grade of A and thus Leadership status. CDP evaluates  how  transparently  companies  report  on  their  water management activities and how they reduce risks such as water scarcity. The assessment also considers the extent to which  product developments - including at the customers of the companies being evaluated - can contribute to sustainable water management.\n\n- For more information on the CDP water survey, see basf.com/en/cdp\n\n## Global target and measures\n\nOur goal is to introduce sustainable water management at our production sites in water stress areas and at our Verbund sites by 2030, covering 93% of BASF's total water abstraction. We achieved 46.2% of our target in 2020 (2019: 35.8%). 2 Sustainable water management was introduced at six sites in 2020 (2019: 8).\n\n- 1 We define water stress areas as regions in which more than 40% of available water is used by industry, households and agriculture. Our definition is based on the Water Risk Atlas (Aqueduct 3.0) published by the World Resources Institute. For more information, see wri.org/aqueduct.\n- 2 Our water target also continues to take into account the sites that we identified as water stress sites in accordance with Pfister et al. (2009) prior to 2019.\n\n## 2030 target\n\nIntroduction of sustainable water management at our production sites in water stress areas and at our Verbund sites\n\nWe pursue our goal by applying the European Water Stewardship standard, which rests on four principles: sustainable water abstraction, maintaining good water quality, preserving conservation areas, and ensuring continuous improvement processes. In addition, we are a member of the global Alliance for Water Stewardship.\n\nWe identify and implement potential for improvement as part of sustainable water management. For instance, we use wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants to reduce our freshwater demand at our sites in Tarragona, Spain (since 2013) and Freeport, Texas (since 2019). At the Pontecchio site in Italy, our need for river and groundwater is reduced by the use of rainwater and optimized sludge dewatering, which started up in late 2020. At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, we have continually optimized cooling water needs over the past few years with technical improvements, most recently in the production of higher carboxylic acids, for example. In addition, the startup of a new recooling plant in 2020 makes the site less dependent on changes in water temperature and water levels on the Rhine. We have also taken numerous measures to secure the supply of raw materials to the site and the transportation of our products by ship on the Rhine River, even in the case of extended periods of low water (see page 129).",

This demand was covered for the most part by freshwater such as rivers and lakes (87% of water abstraction). At some sites, we use alternative sources such as treated municipal wastewater, brackish water or seawater. A small part of the water we use reaches our sites as part of raw materials and steam, or is released in our production processes. We abstract most of the water we need for cooling and production ourselves. In 2020, 5% of our total water demand was covered by third parties.\n\nWe predominantly use water for cooling purposes (87% of water abstraction), after which we discharge it back to our supply sources. We reduce our demand for cooling water by recirculating as much of it as possible. To do this, we use recooling plants that allow water to be reused several times. Around 13% of our total water abstraction is used in production plants, for example, for extraction or dissolution processes or for cleaning. Most of this water is discharged back to our supply sources after being treated in BASF or third party plants.\n\nThe BASF Group's water consumption describes the amount of water that is not discharged to a supply source, meaning that it is no longer available to other users. Consumption is mainly attributable to the evaporation of water during closed-circuit cooling. A smaller amount  is  from  the  water  contained  in  our  products.  Water consumption in 2020 amounted to around 63 million cubic meters (2019: 61).\n\nWater\n\n## Water in the BASF Group 2020\n\nMillion cubic meters per year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The difference between the volume of water abstracted and the volume discharged is primarily attributable to evaporation losses during recirculation of cooling water and limited accuracy in measuring cooling water discharge. b Total from production processes, graywater, rinsing and cleaning in production\n\n(73%). Water consumption in water stress areas accounted for around 11% of our total water consumption (2019: 14%) and was primarily attributable to evaporation in cooling processes.\n\nThe supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is associated with a considerable energy demand. We are constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our business and the environment. One example of this is the nitric acid Verbund at the Ludwigshafen site in Germany. Various recooling optimization measures not only significantly reduce the use of cooling water there, but also save 12 gigawatt hours of energy and avoid 3,500 metric tons of CO2 every year.\n\nIn 2020, around 25% of our production sites were located in water stress areas. These sites accounted for 1% of BASF's total water abstraction (2019: 1%). 1 This demand was covered for the most part by freshwater (97%). We mainly source water from third parties\n\n- 1 Aqueduct 3.0 was used to identify sites in water stress areas to determine pro rata water abstraction and water consumption.\n\n## Emissions to water\n\n## \u25aa Emissions slightly lower\n\nA total of 1,429 million cubic meters of water were discharged from BASF production sites in 2020 (2019: 1,509), including 166 million cubic meters of wastewater from production. Total wastewater in water stress areas was less than 1%. As cooling water is  recirculated as much as possible there, the share of wastewater from production processes is comparatively higher than at other BASF sites.\n\nBASF carefully assesses the impact of wastewater discharge in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. The  responsible local authorities regularly review our analyses and precautions in accordance with the relevant local requirements to prevent contaminants from entering water bodies.",

Animals and plants fulfill a variety of functions and guarantee the ability of their ecosystem to withstand alterations such as climate change. As a chemical company, we depend on ecosystem services like the availability of renewable resources and air, water and soil quality, while also influencing them. Protecting biodiversity is therefore a key element of our commitment to sustainability.\n\nThanks to responsible procurement practices, the efficient use of raw materials, our product solutions and involvement in numerous initiatives,  our  business  conduct  is  consistent  with  the  United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and we reduce our negative impact on biodiversity. It is currently extremely difficult to measure impacts on biodiversity and thus BASF's impacts in full. At the same time, we help to measure  signifi cant impacts on land use in individual steps of the value chain, for example with our Value to Society method. We also initiated a pilot project in 2020 to improve methodological measurement of the  impacts of individual product applications on biodiversity.\n\n## Our responsibility to our supply chains\n\nThe business activities of our raw materials suppliers often involve land use and the associated impact on biodiversity, whether it is in natural gas and crude oil production, mineral extraction or cultivation of crops such as oil palms and castor-oil plants. Our expectations with regard to environmental, labor and social standards in the supply chain are laid down in the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 113).\n\nWe published our Position on Forest Protection in June 2020. In it, we commit to the preservation of areas of High Conservation Value, High Carbon Stock forest areas and peatlands when procuring\n\nrenewable raw materials. Our aim is to prevent these areas from being developed for intensive economic use. Furthermore, we want any land use development activity to respect the rights of indigenous and local communities. We are working with partners to increase supply chain sustainability, for instance with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in our supply chain for palm-based raw materials (see page 117).\n\nBASF procures a variety of renewable raw materials. Particularly palm and palm kernel oil, soy oil and its derivatives as well as lignosulphonates, which are extracted from wood, have been determined to have a high deforestation risk. Based on purchasing volume, palm oil products are the most relevant renewable raw materials for BASF. To achieve greater sustainability in this supply chain, a detailed Palm Commitment went into effect in 2011 and was extended in 2015. It was put into practice through our Palm Sourcing Policy. Furthermore, we are involved in a range of projects in other supply chains promoting responsible use of natural resources and biodiversity (see page 118). BASF was rated for the first time in 2020 in the nonprofit organization CDP's forest assessment (grade: A-). It evaluates companies' management of environmental risks and opportunities. It is based on detailed insights into our palm value chain and the impact of our activities on ecosystems and habitats.\n\nIn cooperation with partners, we are also developing innovative solutions to reduce pressure for economic use of forests. For example,  the  Nutrition  &  Health  division  and  Isobionics \u00ae launched Isobionics \u00ae Santalol in 2020, which is a biotechnologically produced fragrance and a convincing alternative to natural sandalwood oil. This oil is extracted from the wood and roots of the sandalwood tree, which is on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because it is highly endangered by overexploitation. Our newly developed fragrance addresses customer demand for reliability in the supply of raw materials while conserving natural resources.\n\n## Our responsibility to our sites and our production\n\nPreservation of biodiversity is also taken into consideration in the management of our sites. We respect natural resources at all our production sites and have committed to the following measures: We operate our facilities in a responsible manner and minimize negative effects on the environment, including forests, by keeping air, water and soil emissions as low as possible and reducing and avoiding waste (see page 137). Moreover, we conduct systematic assessments  of  sustainability  aspects  when  making  decisions  about investments in the construction of new sites or expansion of existing ones, including the potential impact on forests and biodiversity. Our water management (see page 139) and our involvement in organizations  such  as  the  Alliance  to  End  Plastic  Waste  (AEPW)  (see page 138) contribute to the preservation of biodiversity in bodies of water.\n\n## Our management of our product impact\n\nWe want to ensure that our products meet our customers' standards in quality and, through appropriate use, pose no risk to humans, animals or the environment. Our commitment to the objectives set forth by the Responsible Care \u00ae charter of the  International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) obligates us to continuously minimize the negative effects of our products on the environment, health and safety and to optimize our products on an ongoing basis. For example, we evaluate our products and solutions in crop protection and seeds throughout the entire research, development and registration process. After they have been  approved for the market, we continue assessing them regularly for potential risks and impact to the ecosystems in which they are used. We have initiated various projects and offer training to prevent  inappropriate application of our products (see page 126).",

Activities such as tillage, drainage, fertilization and the use of crop protection products can affect flora and fauna by influencing their food sources.\n\nWe  strengthened  our  commitment  to  sustainable  agriculture  in 2020. We focus on four areas to help farmers to find the right balance: climate-smart farming, sustainable solutions, digital farming and smart stewardship (see page 102). In this context, we work with farmers to create balanced agricultural systems which enable productive and efficient farming of high-quality food products and at the same time promote biodiversity in the field. For example, we advise them on soil cultivation and look for suitable ways to improve biodiversity in farmlands. Our many years of experience in sustainability measurement and evaluation in agriculture are particularly useful here. Our AgBalance \u00ae method and the biodiversity calculator, which has been available since 2020, enable a scientifically sound assessment of the impact of agricultural practices on biodiversity. Based on these assessments, we issue recommendations for measures such as planting flower strips or establishing nesting places to bene fit pollinators, like wild bees, and farmland birds. Our modern seed solutions also enable better yield on existing farmlands and thus help protect natural habitats.\n\n## Our biodiversity initiatives\n\nEngaging in an ongoing dialog with a variety of stakeholders is of utmost importance to BASF. For this reason, we will continue to pursue an exchange with partners in the value chain, in government and in civil society to preserve the natural habitats of plants and wild animals and thus play our part in protecting biodiversity. We work with  a  number  of  organizations  including  the  Roundtable  on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the Sustainable Palm Oil Forum, the Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests and Agriculture and the High Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group. We seek to collaborate with additional relevant stakeholders and organizations to raise and increase awareness and drive the necessary market transformation\n\nBiodiversity\n\nto make an impact on the ground. To promote biodiversity, we are pursuing various initiatives such as the BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability, the Mata Viva \u00ae Initiative and the 'Lark's Bread' project (see box on the right).\n\nThe BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability was established in 2013 with the goal of developing feasible measures to increase biodiversity across intensively farmed land. The network is composed of farms in Europe, including in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Poland. Independent external experts on nature conservation and environmental protection assess the development of bio di versity at some of these farms.\n\nThe Mata Viva \u00ae Initiative in Brazil is a collaboration between BASF and the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Espa\u00e7o ECO \u00ae organization as well as partners from many facets of society. It was established in 1984 to preserve water quality and soil and create a natural habitat for indigenous animal and plant species. To date, a total of 730 hectares of land have been reforested and 1.2 million seedlings have been planted. A program started in 2020 restores forests in the Mata do Barreiro Rico green reserve. The reserve is one of the last sanctuaries of the southern muriqui monkey (Brachyteles arachnoides), which is classified by the IUCN as critically endangered.\n\n- For more information on our responsible management of resources, see page 116\n- For more information on product stewardship, see page 126\n- For more information on our commitment to biodiversity, see basf.com/biodiversity For more information on our position on forest protection, see basf.com/forestprotection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The 'Lark's Bread' project to foster biodiversity\n\nWith this project, BASF is showing in Germany that striking a balance  between  productive  agriculture  and  biodiversity  is possible. In a pilot project with a local bakery chain and a mill, four farmers from the BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability have created 'lark windows' on a total of 40 hectares of winter wheat fields. These 'lark windows' are open spaces in fields with an area of about 20 m\u00b2, which skylarks use as 'runways\" when they brood in the fields and search for food. The harvested wheat is processed into 'lark's bread' and sold at a markup that compensates farmers for their efforts and yield loss as well as supports further biodiversity measures.",

This positions us to meet the challenges of an increasingly rapidly\n\nEmployees\n\nchanging environment, demographic change and the digital workplace. In everything we do, we are committed to complying with internationally recognized labor and social standards. We want our working conditions to be a motor for innovation, and one way of achieving this is through inclusion of diversity.

Employee engagement is shown by, for example, a passion for the job, a dedication to top performance and a commitment to BASF. Global employee surveys and pulse checks are an established feedback tool in the BASF Group, and are used to actively involve employees in shaping their working environment. The results are communicated to employees, the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board  and  stakeholders.  We  have  performed  regular  global employee  surveys  since  2008.  We  aim  to  keep  the  employee engagement  determined  by  these  surveys  at  a  high  level  and increase it even further as far as possible. As part of the BASF strategy, we therefore set ourselves the following goal in 2018: More than 80% of our employees feel that at BASF, they can thrive and perform at their best. We regularly calculate the employee engagement level as an index score based on five questions on set topics in our employee surveys. Overall, more than 72,000 employees worldwide participated in this year's survey, representing 66% of survey recipients. 1\n\nThe 2020 survey revealed an engagement index of 82% (2019: 79%). This result reinforces our existing approach taken by our corporate strategy, even in a difficult environment. It also shows that we can rely on our engaged employees, even in a challenging year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOur aim is to keep this score above 80%. We support our leaders with a range of follow-up measures to decentrally address individual action areas and in this way, help to further strengthen employee engagement together with their employees.\n\nEmployees\n\n## What we expect from our leaders\n\n- \u25aa Leaders as role models\n- \u25aa CORE Leadership Values as the basis for our leadership culture\n\nOur leaders and their teams should make a sustainable contribution to BASF's success. This is why we promote high-quality leadership and measure its impact. We understand impactful leadership as leaders that serve as role models by having a positive influence on the engagement and development of their employees, and developing and implementing business strategies in line with our corporate values. These expectations are part of the standard global nomination criteria for leadership positions. Our leadership culture is based on BASF's corporate values: creative, open, responsible and entrepreneurial - CORE. Our specific expectations of leaders' conduct are derived from these: the CORE Leadership Values (see box on the right).\n\nWe offer our leaders a wide variety of learning and development opportunities for each phase of their career, as well as various formats that enable them to learn from one another and external experts.  Global,  regional  and  local  offerings  are  optimally coordinated. We aim to develop leaders who lead their teams with optimism, empathy and trust, and in this way, create a competitive advantage for BASF. Regular feedback plays an important role in the development of leaders. This is why we implemented the comprehensive FEEDback&forward program for all leaders Group-wide in 2020,  in  which  employees  provide  regular  feedback  on  their managers' leadership skills. The questionnaire focuses on behaviors like empathy or the ability to make difficult decisions and approach change positively. Employees can also report back to their leaders which leadership behaviors they want in the future. In this way, FEEDback&forward promotes regular and open dialog between employees and leaders, and encourages them to reflect on them-\n\n- 1 Scope of employees surveyed goes beyond the scope of consolidation presented on page 6.

We want to reflect this diversity among our  employees, too, because it enables them to better meet our customers' needs. For us, diversity means, among other things, having people from different backgrounds working at our company who can draw on their individual perspectives and skills to grow our business. By valuing and promoting employee diversity, we boost our teams' performance and power of innovation, and increase creativity, motivation and employees' identification with the company.\n\nPromoting and valuing diversity across all hierarchical levels is an integral part of our strategy and is also embedded in our corporate values. BASF strives to foster a working environment based on mutual respect, trust and appreciation. This is enshrined in our global Competency Model, which provides a framework for our employees and leaders. The inclusion of diversity is anchored in this model as one of the behaviors expected of employees and leaders.\n\nOur leaders play an important role in its implementation. We support them with various, flexible offerings. For instance, we have provided a toolbox with a wide range of content to enable a change of perspective and on promoting diversity and inclusion. A new podcast series from leaders shows the importance of appreciative, fair and inclusive leadership.\n\nIntegrating different perspectives is very important to BASF. There are a large number of Employee Resource Groups around the world dedicated to different aspects of diversity.\n\nIn North America, conversational formats on the inclusion of  diversity were developed for employees and leaders. These led to the creation  of  further  action  areas,  such  as  promoting  talent  and training on intercultural communication and leadership, with the aim of further increasing the inclusion of diversity. BASF also took a stand against racism with various internal and external activities in 2020.\n\nBASF is one of approximately 150 companies that support the United Nations Global LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex) Standards of Conduct for business and has done so since 2018. The U.N. recommendations show the many opportunities companies have to contribute to positive social change. As part of pride month, employees promoted openness, acceptance and tolerance with campaigns at various sites around the world.\n\nDiversity also relates to the company's demographic profile, which varies widely by region within the BASF Group. Our aim is to create a suitable framework to help maintain the employability of our personnel at all stages of life and ensure the availability of qualified employees over the long term.\n\n## BASF Group employee age structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also promote diversity in leadership development. Since 2015, BASF has set itself global quantitative goals for increasing the percentage of women in leadership positions.\n\nAfter achieving our original target for women in leadership positions ahead of schedule, BASF set a new, more ambitious target in 2020 to further strengthen diversity. By 2030, we aim to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions to 30%. We have made important progress toward this goal. In the BASF Group, the global proportion  of  female  leaders  with  disciplinary  responsibility  was 24.3% at the end of 2020 (2019: 23.0%). We intend to employ various measures to reach our ambitious target.\n\n## 2030 target\n\nProportion of women in leadership positions with disciplinary  responsibility\n\n30%\n\nWe have developed a global dashboard to permanently monitor our progress toward this target.",

Job sharing is a future-ready working model that offers benefits for both sides and makes it  easier for employees to balance their personal and professional lives.\n\nBASF also renewed its commitment to promoting gender equality by endorsing the United Nations' Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) in 2020. The WEPs are seven principles providing guidance to business on how to promote gender equality and women's empowerment in the workplace, the labor market and the community.\n\nIn the global Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) initiative, which we joined in 2019, we campaign together with other companies alongside the G7 and the OECD for inclusive growth, greater gender equality, and the promotion of diversity and inclusion in business. We are also involved in other external initiatives to promote inclusion of diversity at work, such as the Chefsache initiative and the European Round Table.\n\n## Leaders and professionals in the BASF Group\n\n|                       | December 31, 2020   |   Of which women (%) |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| (Senior) executives a | 8,881               |                 24.3 |\n| Professionals b       | 38,484              |                 31.8 |\n\n- a Employees with disciplinary leadership responsibilities\n- b Specialists without disciplinary leadership responsibilities\n- For more information on health protection, see page 124\n\nFor more information on diversity in the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see page 169 onward\n\n- For more information, see basf.com/diversity\n\n## Competition for talent\n\n- \u25aa Positioning as an attractive employer\n- \u25aa Addressing specific target groups, including during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nAttracting  and  retaining  the  best  employees  is  crucial  to  our success. Having an attractive and compelling total offer package for employees is becoming increasingly important given the strong global competition for the best qualified employees and leaders. This is why we are constantly working on measures to increase BASF's appeal in the global labor markets. Target group-specific campaigns focus on sustainability, digital ways of working and innovation for the future - reflecting our strategic action areas and key labor market trends.\n\nWe are increasingly using digital platforms such as our countryspecific career websites as well as global and regional social networks to reach potential candidates. This enables us to appropriately address different target groups.\n\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic, we used digital solutions for our talent search activities in 2020. For instance, in order to still be present at career fairs, we participated virtually. As a result, we were able to continue to attract and recruit talented employees. We also offered virtual tours of the Ludwigshafen site for universities in Germany. In addition, we consistently take part in specific career events to directly reach and attract talented female recruits in the natural sciences.\n\nThe talent program for external students and former interns was redesigned and expanded to include targeted retention measures. For example, special online events on different career opportunities and an exclusive journal help to maintain contact with talented students who impressed us with their outstanding personal qualities\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nand skills. Mentors at BASF also keep in contact until they have completed their degree and can be recruited.\n\nTo  combat  the  shortage  of  skilled  workers  in  production  and technical areas, due among other factors to demographic-related declines in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we have strengthened our social media presence, for example, to alert qualified specialists to new career prospects at BASF.\n\nWe once again achieved high scores in a number of employer rankings in 2020. For example, in a study conducted by Universum, engineering and IT students ranked BASF as the 51st most attractive employer in the world (2019: 47th). In North America,  DiversityInc named BASF as one of the top 50 companies for diversity in recruiting for the eighth consecutive year. In Asia, Top Employer recognized BASF China as one of the best employers for the eleventh time in succession.  In  South  America,  BASF  was  recognized  by  Valor Econ\u00f4mico newspaper as one of the employers with the best personnel management in Brazil.\n\nThe BASF Group hired 6,340 new employees in 2020. The percentage of employees who resigned during their first three years of employment - the early turnover rate - was 1.0% worldwide in 2020.  This  turnover  rate  was  0.7%  in  Europe,  1.5%  in  North America, 1.8% in Asia Pacific and 1.8% in South America, Africa, Middle East. Our early turnover rate is therefore at a desirable low level.",

We spent a total of around \u20ac113 million on vocational training in 2020.\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/apprenticeship\n\n## Learning and development\n\n- \u25aa Lifelong learning concept\n- \u25aa Focus on virtual learning and digitalization\n\nLearning and development are essential success factors for a strong company culture. The skills and competencies of our employees are critical for profitable growth and lasting success. For this reason, we want to further modernize our learning culture and step up our efforts to promote lifelong, self-directed learning. Employee development at BASF is guided by the belief that talent is in everyone. This means that development opportunities and support are open to all employees. In our understanding, there is more to development than a promotion or a job change - it encompasses the development of personal experience and abilities.\n\nIn regular development meetings, which are held as part of our annual employee dialogs, employees outline ideas for their  individual development together with their leaders and determine specific measures for further training and development, which focus on personal and professional competencies. Our learning activities\n\nfollow the '70-20-10' philosophy: We apply the elements 'learning from experience' (70%), 'learning from others' (20%) and 'learning through courses and media' (10%). Our learning and development offerings cover a range of learning goals: starting a career, expanding knowledge, personal growth and leadership development.\n\nDigital learning formats play an important role in our development offerings. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, training for leaders and employees was updated to meet the challenges of the digital transformation and modern working life with appropriate learning formats and content. For example, the Digitalization & Me platform was established as a central resource where employees and leaders can find a wide range of online training, learning paths on LinkedIn Learning, or virtual continuous professional development events. Both target groups can also hold joint workshops in an avatar-based 3D working and learning environment.\n\nWe  enable  our  employees  to  take  responsibility  for  their  own professional development within the company with digital and novel offerings. To support multidisciplinary teams in the development of products, services or business models, workshops on design thinking empower participants to find creative and innovative solutions to complex problems. This fosters an agile learning and working culture, which will ultimately also help us to master the digital transformation.\n\nTo harness the opportunities of the digital transformation for BASF, the #liveitleadit initiative for leaders focused on agility in 2020. Over 3,000 participants discussed methods, best practices and insights into agile working and digital leadership in monthly digital events.\n\nIn addition, more and more academies in the divisions and service units, which teach specific professional content, offer virtual training. We have offered virtual presence training since 2018, which gives all employees  the  opportunity  to  attend  professional  development courses via digital communication channels such as virtual  meetings.\n\n## Compensation and benefits\n\n- \u25aa Compensation based on employee's position and individual performance as well as company's success\n- \u25aa ROCE determines variable compensation\n\nWe want to attract engaged and qualified employees, retain them and motivate them to achieve top performance with an attractive package including market-oriented compensation, individual development opportunities and a good working environment so that they contribute to the company's long-term success. Our employees' compensation is based on global compensation principles according to position, market and performance. As a rule, compensation comprises fixed and variable components as well as benefits that often exceed legal requirements. In many countries, these benefits include company pension benefits, supplementary health insurance and share programs. We regularly review our compensation  systems at local and regional level.\n\nWe want our employees to contribute to the company's long-term success. This is why the compensation granted to the vast majority of  our  employees  includes  variable  compensation  components, with which they participate in the success of the BASF Group as a whole and are recognized for their individual performance. The same  principles basically apply for all employees worldwide. The amount of the variable component is determined by economic success as well as the employee's individual performance. We use the BASF Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) to measure economic success for the purposes of variable compensation. This links variable compensation to our ROCE target. 1 Individual performance is assessed as part of a globally consistent performance manage -ment process. In numerous Group companies, our 'plus' share program ensures employees' long-term participation in the com pany's success through incentive shares. In 2020, for example, around 27,600 employ ees worldwide (2019: around 25,400) participated in the 'plus' share program.\n\n- 1 In calculating ROCE, adjustments are made for negative and positive special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures (for example, integration costs in connection with acquisitions and gains or losses from the divestiture of businesses) when these exceed a corridor of +/-1% of the average cost of capital basis. An adjustment of the ROCE (in the first 12 months after closing) therefore only occurs in cases of exceptionally high special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures.",

The BASF Group's share price-based compensation program (BASF Option Program, BOP), which has existed since 1999, was offered for the last time in 2020. Around 87% of the people eligible to participate in the program around the world did so, investing up to 30% of their actual variable compensation (for the 2019 business year) in BASF shares. From 2020 onward, the previous LTI program for senior executives will be replaced by a new LTI (Strive!) in the form of a performance share plan. The new, fouryear  program  takes  into  account  the  development  of  the  total shareholder return and incentivizes the achievement of strategic growth, profitability and sustainability targets. To take part in this new LTI, participants must hold BASF shares, the amount of which is based on their individual fixed compensation. In 2020, around 94% of the people eligible to participate in the new LTI around the world did so, investing between 30% and 70% of their fixed annual compensation in BASF shares.\n\n- For more information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 307 onward\n\n## Personnel expenses\n\nThe BASF Group's expenses for wages and salaries, social security contributions  and  pensions  and  assistance  in  2020  totaled \u20ac10,576  million (2019: \u20ac10,924  million). This amount included proportional personnel expenses for 2020 from the disposal group for the construction chemicals business in the amount of \u20ac291 million. In 2019, personnel expenses from the disposal groups for the construction chemicals business and proportionally for the oil and gas  business  totaled  \u20ac557  million.  The  decrease  in  personnel expenses was primarily due to lower bonus provisions and the lower average number of employees which resulted, in particular, from the divestiture of the construction chemicals business. A higher wage and salary level as well as higher pension expenses because of increased service costs had an offsetting effect.\n\n## BASF Group personnel expenses\n\n| Million \u20ac                                              |        |        |       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|\n|                                                        | 2020   | 2019   | +/-   |\n| Wages and salaries                                     | 8,416  | 8,825  | -4.6% |\n| Social security contributions and assistance  expenses | 1,424  | 1,545  | -7.8% |\n| Pension expenses                                       | 736    | 554    | 32.9% |\n| Total personnel expenses                               | 10,576 | 10,924 | -3.2% |\n\n- 1 The term 'senior executives' refers to leadership levels 1 to 4, whereby level 1 denotes the Board of Executive Directors. In addition, individual employees can attain senior executive status by virtue of special expertise.\n\n## Balancing personal and professional life\n\n- \u25aa Wide range of offerings for different phases of life\n- \u25aa Flexible working models support employees during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nOur identity as an employer includes our belief in supporting our employees in balancing their personal and professional lives. We want to strengthen their identification with the company and our position in the global competition for qualified personnel. To achieve this, we have a wide range of offerings aimed at employees in different phases of life that accommodate the growing demand for flexibility in when and where they work. BASF helps employees to adapt working hours and location to their personal circumstances with a wide range of established options, including flexible working hours, part-time  employment  and  remote  working.  We  are  constantly working to expand these options and increasingly support the effective use of digital solutions here.\n\nOur flexible tools proved extremely helpful during the coronavirus pandemic. They help our employees to master the increased challenges around work and personal life during the pandemic. One of the tools that increases flexibility is moving larger employee events that were previously held in-person to virtual formats and recording these. We have developed a global policy and framework for the future of work to integrate the positive experiences from the surge in remote working into our working culture. The aim is to further promote and facilitate flexible working models for interested employees.",

We also provide employee assistance programs at other sites in Germany and around the world to help employees overcome difficult life situations and maintain and restore their employability.\n\nEmployees\n\n## Dialog with employee representatives\n\nTrust-based  cooperation  with  employee  representatives  is  an important component of our corporate culture. Our open and ongoing dialog lays the foundation for balancing the interests of the company and its employees, even in challenging situations. In the case of organizational changes or if restructuring leads to staff downsizing, for example, we involve employee representatives to develop socially responsible implementation measures at an early stage. In 2020, this happened in connection with the transformation of the newly created Global Business Services unit, for example. Our actions are aligned with the respective legal regulations and the agreements reached, as well as operational considerations. During the coronavirus pandemic, we developed solutions together with employee representatives to continue our trust-based cooperation, despite the necessary pandemic-related restrictions. This enabled us to sign a new site agreement with the Works Council of BASF SE for the Ludwigshafen site in Germany in May 2020, which contains a clause that excludes forced redundancies until 2025.\n\nBy focusing our discussions on the local and regional situations, we aim to find tailored solutions to the different challenges and legal considerations  for  each  site.  The  BASF  Europa  Betriebsrat ( European  Works  Council)  addresses  cross-border  matters  in Europe. In South America, we foster dialog with the Di\u00e1logo Social.\n\nFor more information, see basf.com/employeerepresentation\n\nInternational labor and social standards\n\n## \u25aa Alignment with U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\nWe act responsibly toward our employees. Part of this is our voluntary commitment to respecting international labor and social standards, which we have embedded in our global Code of Conduct. This encompasses internationally recognized labor norms as stipulated in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). BASF is committed to complying with these standards worldwide. We  mainly approach our adherence to international labor and social standards using three elements: the Compliance Program (including external compliance hotlines), close dialog with our stakeholders (such as with employee representatives or international organizations) and the BASF guideline on compliance with international labor norms, which applies Group-wide. This guideline makes concrete what the human rights issues and international labor standards in our global Code of Conduct mean as these relate to our employees.\n\nIt forms the basis for our global management process: We regularly monitor changes to the national law of all the countries in which BASF operates and evaluate our adherence to international labor and social standards. If the national law contains no or lower requirements, action plans are drawn up to successively close these gaps in a reasonable time frame. If conflicts with national law or practices arise, we strive to act in accordance with our values and internationally recognized principles without violating the law of the country concerned. As part of the management process, we regularly follow up on and document the results of the comparison between national law and our guideline, as well as measures to implement the guideline. This is our central due diligence system.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nManagement's Report\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Forecast\n\n## Economic Environment in 2021 1\n\nWe expect the global economy to gradually recover in 2021 after  the  sharp  downturn  resulting  from  the  coronavirus pandemic.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  will  return  to roughly the pre-crisis level. We assume that global GDP will grow by 4.3% (2020: -3.7%). Consumers and companies in many countries remain restricted in their freedom of actions for the time being due to measures to combat the pan demic. Positive seasonal impulses should start to make themselves felt as the year progresses. We expect that growing immunization  of  the   population  -  especially  risk  groups  -  will increasingly support the economic recovery in the second half of 2021. Regional differences will presumably remain significant: While we assume emerging markets in Asia will experience robust growth, momentum in Europe, the United States and Japan is likely to initially  remain  sluggish. Uncertainty about future developments is exceptionally high. It is very difficult to predict how the corona virus pandemic will progress. Furthermore, the aftereffects of the sharp  economic decline in the business sector and the labor market from the past year will materialize further.\n\nTrends in the global economy in 2021\n\n- \u25aa Moderate growth expected in Europe and the United States\n- \u25aa Strong growth likely in Asia\n\nWe anticipate an overall moderate GDP growth rate of 3.0% (2020: -6.4%) in the European Union (E.U.). We expect base effects to support growth momentum in countries that were hit especially hard by the pandemic. These include southern European countries with\n\nEconomic Environment in 2021\n\na high percentage of tourism, but also economies in northwestern and eastern Europe where industry is specialized in investment goods and automotive production. It is likely, though, that measures, to contain the corona virus pandemic, which vary in degree among the different E.U. member countries, will continue to have a significant impact on economic growth. Furthermore, we expect Brexit to have a negative effect on economic growth in the E.U. In the United Kingdom, we are forecasting weak GDP growth of 2.4% due to Brexit and  extremely high infection rates at the beginning of the year, after the considerable decline in the previous year (2020: -9.9%).\n\nWe expect a GDP growth rate of 4.0% in the United States . A further government spending plan is likely to significantly bolster the economy. However, since the 2020 economic decline in the United States was only about half of what the E.U. saw, base effects should have a smaller impact. Private consumption in 2020 was  significantly supported by government payments. Consequently, no strong catch-up effects can be expected in the consumption of goods in 2021. Moreover, we expect the labor market to recover more slowly than in the previous year. While the weaker U.S. dollar should have a positive effect on exports, import prices will  foreseeably rise year on year. We do not expect tariffs imposed on imported intermediate or consumer goods from China to drop for the time being, and thus no favorable effect on import prices is foreseeable.\n\nThe emerging markets of Asia will presumably see considerably higher growth rates. In China , private consumption will increasingly bolster growth. Global economic recovery should also have a stimulating effect on exports. Overall, growth is likely to slow during the course of the year. Year on year, growth will still be relatively high, at over 7%, and thus above average for recent years. We expect India to see a continuation of the dynamic recovery that began in the second half of 2020. In the other Asian emerging markets, we anticipate a growth rate comparable to the long-year average before the crisis, slightly above 4%.\n\n- 1 Our assumptions account for current estimates by external institutions, including economic research institutes, banks, multinational organizations and consulting firms.\n\nIn Japan , we expect moderate GDP growth of just slightly above 2%. Although this country has been able to control the pandemic better than other advanced economies so far, domestic demand for consumer and investment goods will presumably only recover slowly after the sharp decline in the previous year. Exports are likely to see a considerably better upswing, especially due to increasing demand from China.\n\nGrowth prospects in South America will probably remain subdued. We are forecasting total GDP growth in this region of slightly above 4%. Fiscal impetus in Brazil is likely to weaken over the course of the year and dampen further economic recovery (2021: +3.5%; 2020: -4.6%). Macroeconomic imbalances, primarily rising inflation rates coupled with continued low interest rates and growing national debt, will presumably continue to burden the Brazilian currency. In Argentina, too, the debt and currency crisis are expected to  dampen the country's economic recovery following the sharp  decline in the previous year (2021: +5.0%; 2020: -10.4%). In the other countries of South America, we anticipate moderate growth in domestic demand and a favorable impact on demand for industrial and agricultural raw materials from the recovering global economy.",

Growth in advanced economies (2021: +3.1%; 2020: -6.5%) is likely to be weaker than growth in emerging markets (2021: +5.5%; 2020: -1.8%).\n\nWe are forecasting a considerable recovery in the transportation industry 1 as a whole after the sharp decline in the previous year. We expect global automotive production to grow significantly. In China,\n\nEconomic Environment in 2021\n\nwe anticipate moderate growth momentum in 2021 following the rapid recovery in 2020.  By contrast, we expect stronger recovery effects in western and eastern Europe as well as in North America, India and Japan. The percentage of hybrid and electric vehicles should continue to rise due to buying incentives, vehicle tax rebates and the expansion of the charging infrastructure.\n\nIn the energy and raw materials sector, we expect moderate overall growth in energy demand and demand for industrial raw materials. Production growth should only be small in advanced economies. In the emerging markets by contrast, we are forecasting considerable growth. Approximately half of total global growth is expected to be in Asia.\n\nProduction  in  the construction  industry will  presumably  grow moderately in 2021. We anticipate low growth rates in commercial construction but higher growth in housing construction and in the infrastructure segment. While the construction business in Europe is likely to grow moderately, we only foresee a slight increase in the United  States.  This  is  because  of  small  base  effects  after  the upswing in the housing market in the previous year and government spending on construction, which is only likely to benefit from the economic stimulus packages after a delay. By contrast, we expect considerably higher growth rates in Asia.\n\nDue to recovery effects, overall production of consumer goods, primarily textiles and consumer durables, will foreseeably grow at a somewhat higher rate than global GDP. Production of care products, by contrast, will grow approximately in line with the gross domestic product.\n\nThe electronics industry should benefit from the ongoing digitalization trend, more frequent use of electronic parts in the automotive industry and the advancement of connectivity and automation. We therefore continue to expect above-average growth.\n\n- 1 The transportation industry includes the production of motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and the construction of other vehicles (especially ships and boats, trains, air and spacecraft, and two-wheelers).\n\nIn line with overall economic recovery, the health and nutrition sector should grow markedly in the year to come. We expect above-average growth in the pharmaceutical industry, which will be favorably affected by global vaccine activities. Expansion in the nutri tion sector should almost equal that of the global economy.\n\nUnder  normal  weather  conditions, agricultural  production will presumably see similar growth in 2021 to the past few years. In Europe, we expect a slight increase in agricultural production given the low basis for comparison. In the United States, the trade agreement with China is likely to boost agricultural exports again in 2021, and similarly high growth rates are expected to those of 2020. In Brazil, economic recovery and the considerable currency devaluation should be favorable to the sales volumes of agricultural products. For this reason, higher growth in sales volumes can be expected. In Asia, which is by far the largest agricultural market because of the size of its population, we expect solid growth in agricultural  production.",

This growth should be seen  predominantly  in  emerging  markets  (2021:  +5.4%;  2020: +1.8%). In advanced economies, we anticipate a growth rate of 2.5% (2020: -4.2%), which is above average for pre-crisis years. The level of production from 2019 will thus already be surpassed in 2021 in emerging markets. Overall, production in advanced economies will presumably still be considerably lower.\n\nIn China , the world's largest chemical market, we are forecasting a growth  rate  in  chemical  production  of  6.3%  (2020:  3.4%). Momentum  is  likely  to  slow  down  after  the  rapid  recovery  in production in 2020. Nevertheless, we anticipate demand across all customer industries to grow for intermediate inputs from the chemical  industry, in particular consumer goods and in the automotive industry.\n\nIn the European Union , we are forecasting an increase in chemical production of 3.2% (2020: -1.9%), roughly in line with GDP growth. The expected marked recovery in the automotive industry along with moderate growth in the construction industry and in consumables in the health and nutrition sector, as well as somewhat stronger growth in consumer durables should bolster domestic chemical demand. We anticipate weaker growth momentum in the United Kingdom. Higher transaction costs are likely to dampen chemical production due to the end of the Brexit transition period and the negative  econo mic  impact  of  the  coronavirus  pandemic  (2021: +2.0%; 2020: +1.0%).\n\nWe expect chemical production in the United States to grow by 2.6% (2020: -4.3%). Further recovery in automotive production and considerable growth in health and nutrition and in electronics should have positive effects on chemical demand, whereas the  construction and oil and gas industries are only expected to provide weak growth stimulus.\n\nIn Japan , we anticipate moderate growth in chemical production, analogous to the modest overall economic recovery.\n\nIn South America , chemical production will presumably lag slightly behind the economy as a whole (2021: +3.0%; 2020: -1.1%). Chemical growth will be buoyed by the recovery in automotive production, as well as in the agriculture, nutrition and industrial raw materials sectors.\n\n## Outlook for chemical production 2021 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Real change compared with previous year   |      |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|\n| World                                     | 4.4% |\n| European Union                            | 3.2% |\n| United States                             | 2.6% |\n| Emerging markets of Asia                  | 5.9% |\n| Japan                                     | 1.0% |\n| South America                             | 3.0% |\n\n## Trends in chemical production 2021-2023 (excluding pharmaceuticals)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Real change compared with previous year   |      |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|\n| European Union                            | 2.3% |\n| United States                             | 2.6% |\n| Emerging markets of Asia                  | 5.3% |\n| Japan                                     | 1.0% |\n| South America                             | 2.5% |",

However,  uncertainty  about  future  developments  remains excep tionally  high.  Our  forecast  therefore  includes  wide ranges to account for the possibility of significant disruptions to global supply chains and negative effects on the entire economy. At the same time, we are confident that without such negative impacts, we will be able to achieve earnings at the upper end of the forecast range. Our forecast assumes growth in our customer industries. For the automotive industry in particular, we are forecasting significant production growth compared with 2020. The global economy should see significant  growth  of  4.3%  compared  with  2020  (-3.7%).  Global chemical production is expected to expand by 4.4%, well above the prior-year level (2020: -0.4%). We anticipate an average oil price of $50 for a barrel of Brent crude and an exchange rate of $1.18 per euro.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we aim to increase our sales to between \u20ac61 billion and \u20ac64 billion (2020: \u20ac59,149 million). The BASF Group's income from operations (EBIT) before special items is expected to be  between \u20ac4.1 billion and \u20ac5.0 billion (2020: \u20ac3,560 million). The return on capital employed (ROCE) should be between 8.0% and 9.2% (2020: 1.7%).\n\nFor 2021, we anticipate Accelerator sales of between \u20ac18 billion and \u20ac19 billion (2020: \u20ac16.7 billion). Our CO2 emissions are expected to stabilize at between 20.5 million metric tons and 21.5 million metric tons in 2021 (2020: 20.8 million metric tons).\n\n- For more information on our expectations for the economic environment in 2021, see page 152 onward\n\nFor more information on our opportunities and risks, see page 158 onward\n\n## Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the BASF Group 1\n\n- \u25aa Sales growth to between \u20ac61 billion and \u20ac64 billion\n- \u25aa EBIT before special items of between \u20ac4.1 billion and \u20ac5.0 billion\n- \u25aa ROCE of between 8.0% and 9.2%\n\nIn 2021, we expect the BASF Group as a whole to increase sales to between \u20ac61 billion and \u20ac64 billion (2020: \u20ac59,149 million). The main drivers should be volume growth and higher prices. By contrast, currency  and  portfolio  effects  will  have  a  negative  impact.  The Materials segment and Other are expected to see considerable sales growth.  We  are  forecasting  slightly  higher  sales  in  the  Surface Technologies, Chemicals, Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments, and a slight year-on-year decline in the Industrial Solutions segment.\n\nThe BASF Group's EBIT before special items is expected to increase to between \u20ac4.1 billion and \u20ac5.0 billion (2020: \u20ac3,560 million). We anticipate considerably higher contributions from the Materials and Chemicals segments, Other and the Surface Technologies segment. The Agricultural Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments should record slightly higher EBIT before special items. By contrast, we are forecasting slightly lower EBIT before special items in the Industrial Solutions segment.\n\nBased on the expected recovery in the global economy, a positive business trajectory and a lower cost of capital basis in 2021, we expect the BASF Group's ROCE to be between 8.0% and 9.2% (2020: 1.7%). We expect a considerable increase in ROCE in all segments compared with the previous year.\n\nOur forecast for 2021 takes into account the agreement between BASF and DIC on the sale of the global pigments business. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to the approval of the U.S. competition authorities, which is still outstanding. Until closing, the assets and liabilities to be divested will be presented in a disposal group in the Dispersions & Pigments division.\n\n## Accelerator sales and CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group\n\nWe expect Accelerator sales to increase to between \u20ac18 billion and \u20ac19 billion in 2021 (2020: \u20ac16.7 billion), in line with the global  economic recovery and growing demand for chemical products. The  divestiture of BASF's global pigments business will also reduce sales of Accelerator products in BASF's portfolio. Compensating factors will include the expected increase in Accelerator products from the initial portfolio segmentation of the businesses acquired from Solvay.\n\nDespite  the  global  economic  recovery  and  growing  demand  for chemical  products,  CO2  emissions  are  expected  to  stabilize  at between 20.5 million metric tons and 21.5 million metric tons in 2021. We  will  keep  emissions  roughly  at  the  prior-year  level  (2020: 20.8 million metric tons) with targeted measures. These include the implementation of further projects to increase energy efficiency and optimize processes, for example, to significantly reduce nitrous oxide emissions in Ludwigshafen, Germany. In addition, we are switching energy supply agreements to renewable energy sources, for example in Freeport, Texas, where we have signed long-term supply agreements for wind power. Emissions will also be reduced by the  divestiture of BASF's global pigments business in 2021.\n\nThe significant opportunities and risks that could affect our forecast are described under Opportunities and Risks on pages 158 to 166.\n\n- 1 For sales, 'slight' represents a change of 1%-5%, while 'considerable' applies to changes of 6% and higher.

In  the  Petrochemicals  division,  we expect an improved availability of steam cracker  products following the unplanned outage at the steam cracker in Port Arthur, Texas, in 2020. In the Intermediates division, we  anticipate higher sales volumes in all business areas. Price levels will likely rise, primarily due to higher raw materials prices in both  divisions and from a favorable product mix in the Petrochemicals division. Currency effects are expected to dampen sales performance. We expect considerable growth in EBIT before special items, mainly through higher sales volumes, due in part to improved availability of steam cracker products, and a recovery in margins.\n\nFor the Materials segment, we expect sales to be considerably above the previous year in 2021 due to higher volumes. In the Performance Materials division, we expect higher demand from all\n\ncustomer  industries.  For  the  Monomers  division,  we  anticipate higher  volumes,  specifically  for  isocyanates  and  polyamides. Currency effects should reduce sales performance. We want to considerably  increase  EBIT  before  special  items  through  the increase in volumes and a recovery in margins, especially in the Monomers division.\n\nSales in the Industrial Solutions segment will likely decline slightly in 2021, mainly as a result of the agreement to divest BASF's global pigments business to DIC. This should be partially offset by higher volumes in both divisions. We anticipate slightly lower EBIT before special items, due in particular to the sale of BASF's global pigments business and higher fixed costs. This will not be completely offset by the expected growth in volumes.\n\nIn the Surface Technologies segment, we are forecasting slight sales growth in 2021, primarily from higher precious metal prices in the Catalysts division and higher volumes in both divisions. We aim to considerably improve the segment's EBIT before special items\n\ncompared with 2020, mainly through volume growth. We anticipate considerably  higher  EBIT  before  special  items  in  the  Coatings division but a slight year-on-year decrease in EBIT before special items  in  the  Catalysts  division  due  to  lower  contributions  from precious metal trading.\n\nFor the Nutrition & Care segment, we expect slightly higher sales than in 2020. Higher volumes in both divisions will likely be partially offset by negative price and currency effects. Our planning assumes improved product availability, especially in the Nutrition & Health division. We expect the segment's EBIT before special items to be slightly above the previous year, due to a higher contribution from the Nutrition & Health division, driven by volume growth. For the Care Chemicals division, we are forecasting a slight year-on-year decrease in EBIT before special items as a result of slightly higher fixed costs due to costs for the startup of new plants.\n\nWe expect sales to be slightly above the prior-year level in the Agricultural Solutions segment. We aim to increase our sales volumes  and  prices,  which  should  more  than  offset  negative currency effects. Overall, we expect a slight increase in EBIT before special items. Alongside higher sales, this will be driven by stringent fixed  cost  management.  In  addition,  we  will  benefit  from  the measures to increase efficiency initiated in 2020. We will continue to invest in research and development and digitalization at a high level in  2021.  Currency  effects  will  presumably  have  a  significantly negative impact on EBIT before special items in 2021.\n\nSales in Other are expected to be considerably above the 2020 level in 2021. This will be driven by sales growth in commodity trading. We anticipate a considerable improvement in EBIT before special items compared with the previous year. This should mainly reflect lower research expenses and higher contributions from other businesses.",

The aim is to avoid risks that pose a threat to BASF's continued existence and to make improved managerial  decisions to create value. We define opportunities as  potential successes that exceed our defined goals. We understand risk to be any event that can negatively impact the achievement of our short-term operational or long-term strategic goals.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nPotential successes that exceed our defined goals\n\n## Risks\n\nEvents that can negatively impact the achievement of our goals\n\nIn order to effectively measure and manage identified opportunities and risks, we quantify these where appropriate in terms of  probability and economic impact in the event they occur. Where possible, we use statistical methods to aggregate opportunities and risks into risk factors. This way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks at a portfolio level, allowing us to take effective measures for risk management.\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\n## Overall assessment\n\n- \u25aa Significant opportunities and risks arise from overall economic developments, margin and exchange rate volatility\n- \u25aa No threat to continued existence of BASF\n\nFor 2021, we anticipate a considerable global economic recovery after the downturn in the previous year due to the coronavirus pandemic. General economic uncertainty will nevertheless remain high until wide spread immunization of the population has been achieved. Specifically, production stoppages due to official orders or high  infection rates can lead to disruptions in the supply chains of our  customer  industries,  with  our  suppliers  and  in  our  own production plants. Moreover, restricted economic activity resulting from further lockdowns can have a significant negative impact on aggregate demand. An escalation of geopolitical conflicts as well as the ongoing trade conflicts between the United States and China and the  associated slowdown of the economy also pose significant risks. These developments could have a negative impact on  demand for intermediate and investment goods worldwide. Opportu nities arise from continued strong demand, supported by earlier and better availability and broader acceptance of the coronavirus vaccine than is assumed in our forecasts. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding market growth and the development of key customer indus tries, material opportunities and risks for our earnings arise from margin  volatility. From today's perspective, Brexit does not give rise to any  material  opportunities or risks for the BASF Group due to the trade agreement reached between the European Union and the United   Kingdom.\n\nAccording to our assessment, there continue to be no significant individual risks that pose a threat to the continued existence of the BASF Group. The same applies to the sum of individual risks, even in the case of a global economic crisis, such as the intensification of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nUltimately, however, residual risks (net risks) remain in all entrepreneurial activities that cannot be ruled out, even by comprehensive risk   manage ment.\n\n## Potential short-term effects on EBIT of key opportunity and risk factors subsequent to measures taken a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Possible variations related to:                                                                                 | Outlook -   2021   +   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Business environment and sector                                                                                 |                        |\n| Market growth                                                                                                   |                        |\n| Margins                                                                                                         |                        |\n| Competition                                                                                                     |                        |\n| Regulation/policy                                                                                               |                        |\n| Company-specific opportunities and risks                                                                        |                        |\n| Procurement                                                                                                     |                        |\n| Supply chain                                                                                                    |                        |\n| Investments/production                                                                                          |                        |\n| Personnel                                                                                                       |                        |\n| Acquisitions/divestitures/cooperations                                                                          |                        |\n| Information technology                                                                                          |                        |\n| Law                                                                                                             |                        |\n| Financial                                                                                                       |                        |\n| Exchange rate volatility                                                                                        |                        |\n| Other financial opportunities and risks                                                                         |                        |\n| \u20ac100 million     \u20ac100 million   \u20ac500 million     \u20ac500 million   \u20ac1,000 million  \u20ac1,000 million   \u20ac1,500 million |                        |\n\n- a Using a 95% confidence interval per risk factor based on planned values; summation is not permissible",

The opportunities and risks resulting from the shareholding in Wintershall Dea are therefore not  included  in  the  outlook  for  the  EBIT  of  the  BASF  Group. Opportunities and risks that have an impact on net income from shareholdings and cash flow from the shares in Wintershall Dea are monitored and tracked through BASF's involvement in the relevant governing bodies.\n\n## Risk management process\n\n- \u25aa Integrated process for identification, assessment and reporting\n- \u25aa Decentralized management of specific opportunities and risks\n- \u25aa Aggregation at a Group level\n\nThe BASF Group's risk management process is based on the inter national risk management standard, COSO II Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework, and has the following key features:\n\n## Organization and responsibilities\n\n- - Risk management is the responsibility of the Board of Executive Directors, which also determines the processes for approving invest ments, acquisitions and divestitures.\n- - The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the Corporate Center. Corporate Finance and Corporate Development, which are units within the Corporate Center, and the Chief Compliance Officer coordinate the risk management process at a Group level, examine  financial  and  sustainability-related  opportunities  and risks, and provide the structure and appropriate methodology. Opportunity and risk management is thus integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes.\n- - BASF's risk committee reviews the BASF Group's risk portfolio at least twice a year to evaluate any adjustments to risk- management measures and informs the Board of Executive Directors of these.\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\n## Organization of BASF Group's risk management since January 1, 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The Corporate Audit unit is part of the Corporate Center.\n\nMembers of the risk committee are the head of Corporate Finance (president), the head of Corporate Development, the head of Corporate Legal, Compliance, Tax & Insurance and representatives of the Corporate Audit and Corporate Environmental Protection, Health & Safety units.\n\n- - The management of specific opportunities and risks is largely delegated to the divisions, the service and research units and the regions, and is steered at a regional or local level. This also applies to sustainability-related topics relevant to BASF including the impact of climate change on BASF. Financial risks are an exception. The management of liquidity, currency and interest rate risks is conducted in the Corporate Finance unit. The management of commodity price risks takes place in the Global Procurement unit or in authorized Group companies.\n- -  A network of risk managers in the divisions, service and research units as well as in the regions advances the implementation of appropriate risk management practices in daily operations.\n\n- - The  BASF  Group's  management  is  informed  of  short-term operational opportunities and risks that fall within an observation period of up to one year in the monthly management report produced by the Corporate Finance department. In addition, Corporate  Finance  provides  information  twice  a  year  on  the aggregated  opportunity/risk  exposure  of  the  BASF  Group. Furthermore, if a new individual risk is identified which has a more than \u20ac10 million impact on earnings or bears reputational risks, it must be immediately reported.\n- - As part of strategy development, the Corporate Development unit conducts  strategic  opportunity/risk  analyses  for  long-term opportunities and risks with a 10-year assessment period. These analyses are annually reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are adapted if necessary.\n- - BASF's  Chief  Compliance  Officer  (CCO)  manages  the  implementation of our Compliance Management System, supported by additional compliance officers worldwide. He regularly reports to the Board of Executive Directors on the status of implementation",

He also provides a status report to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee at least once a year,  including any major developments. The Board of Executive Directors immediately informs the Audit Committee about significant incidents.\n\n- - The internal audit unit (Corporate Audit) is responsible for  regularly auditing the risk management system established by the Board of Executive  Directors  in  accordance  with  section  91(2)  of  the German Stock Corporation Act. Furthermore, as part of its monitoring of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board considers the effectiveness of the risk management system. The suitability of the early detection system we set up for risks is evaluated by our  external auditor.\n\n## Tools\n\n- - The Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC) Policy, applicable throughout the Group, forms the framework for risk management and is implemented by the operating divisions, the service and research units and the regions according to their specific business conditions.\n- - A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps to identify all relevant financial and sustainability-related opportunities and risks as comprehensively as possible. We also systematically assess opportunities and risks with effects that cannot yet be measured in monetary terms, such as reputational and climate risks. To reflect these, risks for companies in connection with the transition to a low- carbon economy (transition risks) as well as physical risks as  defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) were added to the catalog in 2020.\n- - We  use  standardized  evaluation  and  reporting  tools  for  the identi fication  and  assessment  of  risks.  The  aggregation  of opportunities, risks and sensitivities at division and Group level using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to identify effects and trends across the Group.\n- For more information on our sustainability management processes, see page 42 onward\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\n- - Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure adherence to legal regulations and the company's internal guidelines. Our global employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these  mandatory standards into everyday business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow these principles.\n- For more information on our Group-wide Compliance Program, see page 177 onward\n\nSignificant features of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the Group financial reporting  process\n\n- \u25aa Conducted in accordance with standardized Group guidelines\n- \u25aa Segregation of duties, principle of dual control and clearly regulated access rights\n- \u25aa Annual evaluation of the control environment and relevant processes at significant companies\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared by a unit in the Corporate Finance department. BASF Group's accounting process is based on a uniform accounting guideline that sets out accounting policies and the significant processes and deadlines on a  Group-wide basis. There are binding directives for the internal reconciliations and other accounting operations within the Group. Standard software is used to carry out the accounting processes for the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are clear rules for the  access rights of each  participant in these processes.\n\nEmployees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet the qualitative requirements and participate in training on a regular basis. There is a clear assignment of responsibilities between the specialist units, companies and regional service units involved. We strictly  adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control, or the 'four-eyes principle.' Complex actuarial reports and\n\nevaluations  are  produced  by  specialized  service  providers  or specially qualified employees.\n\nAn  internal  control  system  for  financial  reporting  continuously monitors these principles. To this end, methods are provided to ensure that evaluation of the internal control system in financial reporting is  structured and uniform across the BASF Group.\n\nThe significant risks for the BASF Group regarding a reliable control environment for proper financial reporting are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Risks are compiled into a central risk catalog.\n\nMoreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that are exposed to particular risks, that are material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the BASF Group, or that provide service processes. The selection process is conducted annually. Persons responsible  for  implementing  the  requirements  for  an  effective control system in financial reporting are appointed at the relevant companies.\n\nIn these companies, the process comprises the following steps:\n\n## -Evaluation of the control environment\n\nAdherence to internal and external guidelines that are relevant for the maintenance of a reliable control environment is checked by means of a standardized questionnaire.\n\n- -Identification and documentation of control activities In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting processes listed in our central risk catalog, critical processes and control activities are documented.\n\n## -Assessment of control activities\n\nAfter documentation, a review is performed to verify whether the described controls are capable of adequately covering the risks. In the subsequent test phase, samples are taken to test whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described and effective.\n\n- -Monitoring of control weaknesses\n\nThe managers responsible receive reports on any control weaknesses identified and their resolution, and an interdisciplinary committee",

The Board of Executive Directors and the Audit Committee are informed if control  weaknesses  with  a  considerable  impact  on  financial reporting are identified. Only after material control weaknesses have  been  resolved  does  the   company's  managing  director confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system.\n\n## -Internal confirmation of the internal control system\n\nAll  managing  directors  and  chief  financial  officers  of  each consolidated  Group  company  must  confirm  to  the  Board  of Executive  Directors of BASF SE every half-year and at the end of the annual cycle, in writing, that the internal control system is effective with regard to accounting and reporting.\n\n## Short-term opportunities and risks\n\n## Market growth\n\nThe development of our sales markets is one of the strongest sources of opportunities and risks. More details on our assumptions regarding short-term growth rates for the global economy, regions and key customer industries, such as the chemicals, automotive and  construction sectors, can be found under Economic Environment in 2021 on pages 152 to 154.\n\nWe also consider risks from deviations in assumptions. Stronger demand caused by an accelerated lifting of lockdowns, for example as a result of high efficacy and acceptance of coronavirus vaccines, give  rise  to  macroeconomic  opportunities.  A  significant  macroeconomic risk arises from the possibility that measures to contain the corona virus are kept in place for a longer period of time or expanded, and that global economic growth slows as a result. Addi tional macroeconomic risks result from the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China. Both can have a considerable impact on global demand  for  intermediate  goods  for  industrial  production  and demand for invest ment goods.\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\nWeather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects on our business, particularly in the Agricultural Solutions segment.\n\n## Margin volatility\n\nOpportunities and risks for the BASF  Group primarily result from higher or lower margins in the Chemicals and Materials segments. Opportunities arise here if the positive margin trend driven by the supply side continues for longer than expected. However, new capaci ties  or  raw  materials  shortages  could  increase  margin pressure on a number of products and value chains. This would have a negative effect on our EBIT.\n\nMoreover, if oil and gas prices rise, Wintershall Dea does not have a compensating  effect  on  the  BASF  Group's  EBIT  because  this shareholding is no longer reported in EBIT, but in net income from shareholdings.\n\nThe year's average oil price for Brent crude was $42 per barrel in 2020, compared with $64 per barrel in the previous year. For 2021, we anticipate an average oil price of $50 per barrel. We therefore expect price levels for the raw materials and petrochemical basic products that are important to our business to rise slightly.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe continuously enhance our products and solutions in order to maintain  competitive  ability.  We  monitor  the  market  and  the com     pe tition, and try to take targeted advantage of opportunities and counter emerging risks with suitable measures. Aside from innovation, key components of our competitiveness are our ongoing cost management and continuous process optimization.\n\n## Regulation and political risks\n\nRisks for us can arise from intensified geopolitical tensions, new trade  sanctions,  stricter  emissions  limits  for  plants,  changes  in chemical regulations and energy and climate laws.\n\nIn addition, risks to the BASF Group can be posed by further regulations in key customer industries or on the use or registration of agricultural and other chemicals.\n\nPolitical measures could also give rise to opportunities. For example, we view measures around the world to increase energy efficiency and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  as  an  opportunity  for increased demand for our products, such as our insulation foams for buildings, catalysts, battery materials for electromobility, or our solutions for wind turbines. Our broad product portfolio enables us to offer alternatives if new chemicals have to be developed as a result of restrictions in connection with the REACH chemicals regulation or new standards in our customers' industries.\n\n## Purchasing and supply chain\n\nWe minimize procurement risks through our broad portfolio, global purchasing activities and the purchase of raw materials on spot markets. If possible, we avoid procuring raw materials from a single supplier. When this cannot be avoided, we try to foster competition or  we  knowingly  enter  into  this  relationship  and  assess  the consequences of potential nondelivery. We continuously monitor the credit risk of important business partners.\n\nAround the world, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions (such as high/low water levels on rivers or hurricanes) are subject to change as a result of climate change. We address the risk of supply interruptions on the procurement and sales side caused by extreme weather conditions by switching to alternative logistics carriers and the possibility of falling back on unaffected sites within our global Verbund.\n\nIn 2019/2020, we implemented a package of climate resilience measures at our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany: We developed an early warning system for low water, created multimodal transportation concepts, chartered more ships that can navigate low water levels and, in cooperation with partners, are currently developing our own type of ship designed for extreme low-water",

These measures are already making long periods of low water on the Rhine River, like in 2018, more manageable.\n\n## Investments and production\n\nWe try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering to high technical standards and by continuously improving our plants. We reduce the effects of an unscheduled shutdown on the supply of intermediate and end products through diversification within our global production Verbund.\n\nIn the event of a production outage - caused by an accident, for example - our global, regional or local emergency response plans and crisis management structures are engaged, depending on the impact scope. Every region has crisis management teams on a local and   regional  level.  They  not  only  coordinate  the  necessary emergency  response measures, they also initiate the immediate measures for damage control and resumption of normal operations as quickly as possible.\n\nCrisis management also includes dealing with extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes (for example, at the sites on the Gulf of Mexico in Freeport, Texas, and Geismar, Louisiana) or  significantly elevated water temperatures in rivers due to extended heat waves, which  limit  the  available  cooling  capacity  (for  example,  at  the Ludwigshafen site in Germany). Appropriate precautions are taken at the sites in the case of a potential change in risk in connection with climate change. For example, over the past few years, the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, has implemented a package of  measures to increase cooling capacity, including expanding and  optimizing the central recooling plants and optimizing cooling water flows. These are capable of avoiding production outages due to  extreme heatwaves like the one in 2018.\n\nShort-term risks from investments can result from, for example, technical  malfunctions  or  schedule  and  budget  overruns.  We counter these risks with highly experienced project management and   controlling.\n\n## Acquisitions, divestitures and cooperations\n\nWe  constantly  monitor  the  market  in  order  to  identify  possible acquisition targets and develop our portfolio appropriately. In addition, we work together in collaborations with customers and partners to jointly develop new, competitive products and applications.\n\nOpportunities and risks arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures from the conclusion of a transaction, or it being completed earlier or later than expected. They relate to the regular earnings contributions gained or lost as well as the realization of gains or losses from divestitures if these deviate from our planning assumptions.\n\n- For more information on opportunities and risks from acquisitions and divestitures in 2020, see page 51\n\n## Personnel\n\nDue to BASF's worldwide compensation principles, the development of personnel expenses is partly dependent on the amount of variable compensation, which is linked to the company's success, among other factors. The correlation between variable compensation and the success of the company has the effect of minimizing risk. Another factor is the development of interest rates for discounting pension obligations. Furthermore, changes to the legal environment of a  particular country can have an impact on the development of  personnel expenses for the BASF Group. For countries in which BASF  is  active,  relevant  developments  are  therefore  constantly monitored in order to recognize risks at an early stage and enable BASF to carry out suitable measures.\n\n- For more information on our compensation system, see page 149\n\nFor more information on risks from pension obligations, see page 164\n\n## Information technology risks\n\nBASF relies on a large number of IT systems. Their nonavailability, violation of confidentiality or the manipulation of data in critical IT systems and applications can all have a direct impact on production and logistics processes. The threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers have become better organized, use more\n\nsophisticated technology, and have far more resources available. If data are lost or manipulated, this can, for example, negatively affect plant availability, delivery quality or the accuracy of our financial reporting. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personnel records  or  customer  data,  competition-related  information  or research results, can result in legal consequences or jeopardize our competitive position. This would also be accompanied by the associated loss of reputation.\n\nTo minimize such risks, BASF uses globally uniform processes and systems to ensure IT availability and IT security, such as stable and redundantly designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access protection, encryption systems as well as integrated, Groupwide standardized IT infrastructure and applications. The systems used for information security are constantly tested, continuously updated, and expanded if necessary. In addition, our employees receive regular training on information and data protection. IT-related risk management is conducted using Group-wide regulations for organization and application, as well as an internal control system based on these regulations.\n\nBASF also established the Cyber Defense Center in 2015, is a member of Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics e.V. (CSSA), and a founding  member  of  the  German  Cybersecurity  Organization (DCSO) together with Allianz SE, Bayer AG and Volkswagen AG. BASF has also established an information security management system and is certified according to ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\n## Legal disputes and proceedings\n\nWe constantly monitor current and potential legal disputes and proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board. In order to assess the risks from current legal disputes and proceedings and any potential need to recognize provisions, we prepare our own analyses and assessments of the circumstances and claims considered. In addition, in individual cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings and, if needed, independent legal opinions. Risk assessment is",

These estimates are the result of close cooperation between the relevant operating and service units together with  Corporate Finance and Corporate Legal. If sufficient probability of occurrence is identified, a provision is recognized accordingly for each proceeding. Should a provision be unnecessary, general risk  management continues to assess whether these litigations never theless represent a risk for the EBIT of the BASF Group.\n\nWe use our internal control system to limit risks from potential infringements of rights or laws. For example, we try to avoid patent and  licensing disputes whenever possible through extensive clearance research. As part of our Group-wide Compliance Program, our employees receive regular training.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\nDetailed guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with financial risks. Among other things, they provide for the segregation of trading and back office functions.\n\nAs a part of risk management, activities in countries with transfer restrictions are continuously monitored. This includes, for example, regular  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  and  legal  environment, shareholders' equity and the business models of the operating units. The chief aim is the management of counterparty, transfer and currency risks for the BASF Group.\n\n## Exchange rate volatility\n\nOur competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluctuations in exchange rates. For BASF's sales, opportunities and risks arise in particular when the U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates. A full-year appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by $0.01, which could result from a macroeconomic slowdown, would increase the BASF Group's EBIT by around \u20ac30 million, assuming other condi-\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\ntions  remain the same. On the production side, we counter  exchange rate risks by producing in the respective currency zones.\n\nFinancial currency risks result from the translation of receivables, liabilities and other monetary items in accordance with IAS 21 at the closing rate into the functional currency of the respective Group company. In addition, we incorporate planned purchase and sales transactions in foreign currencies in our financial foreign currency risk management. These risks are hedged using derivative instruments, if necessary.\n\n## Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks result from potential changes in prevailing market interest rates. These can cause a change in the fair value of fixedrate instruments and fluctuations in the interest payments for variable-rate financial instruments, which would positively or negatively affect   earnings.  To  hedge  these  risks,  interest  rate  swaps  and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases.\n\nIn addition to market interest rates, BASF's financing costs are determined by the credit risk premiums to be paid. These are  mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market conditions at the time of issue. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected from the possible effects on its interest result thanks to the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness.\n\n## Risks from metal and raw materials trading\n\nIn the catalysts business, BASF employs commodity derivatives for precious metals and trades precious metals on behalf of third parties and on its own account. Appropriate commodity derivatives are also traded to optimize BASF's supply of refinery products, gas and other petrochemical raw materials. To address specific risks associated with these non-operating trades, we set and continuously monitor limits with regard to the type and volume of the deals concluded.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nRisks from fluctuating cash flows are recognized in a timely manner as part of our liquidity planning. We have access to extensive liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our unrestricted access to the commercial paper market and committed bank credit lines. In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected against potential  refinancing risks by the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness as well as through diversification in various financial markets.\n\n## Risk of asset losses\n\nWe limit country-specific risks with measures based on internally determined  country  ratings,  which  are  continuously  updated  to reflect changing environment conditions. We selectively use investment guarantees to limit specific country-related risks. We lower credit risks for our financial investments by engaging in transactions only with banks with good credit ratings and by adhering to fixed limits. Creditworthiness is continuously monitored and the limits are adjusted  accordingly. We reduce the risk of default on receivables by   continuously  monitoring  the  creditworthiness  and  payment behavior of our customers and by setting appropriate credit limits. Risks are also limited through the use of credit insurance and bank guarantees. Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the BASF Group, there are no major concentrations of credit default risk.\n\n## Impairment risks\n\nAsset impairment risk arises if the assumed interest rate in an impairment test increases, the predicted cash flows decline, or investment  projects  are  suspended.  Following  the  impairments recognized in the third quarter of 2020, we currently consider the risk of further impairment for assets such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill, technologies and trademarks to be immaterial. The same applies to investments accounted for using the equity method, with the exception of Wintershall Dea, which was revalued in 2019. As the value of the shareholding is dependent on expected",

The need for provisions for this program varies according to the development of the BASF share price and the MSCI World Chemicals Index; this leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.\n\nFrom 2020 onward, the previous long-term incentive (LTI) program for senior executives will be replaced by a new LTI program in the form of a performance share plan. The new LTI plan incentivizes the achievement of strategic growth, profitability and sustainability targets and takes into account the development of the BASF share price and the dividend. The need for provisions for this program varies according to assumptions on the degree of strategic target achievement, the  development of the BASF share price and the dividend. This leads to a corresponding increase or decrease in personnel costs.\n\n## Risks from pension obligations\n\nMost employees are granted company pension benefits from either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. We predominantly finance company pension obligations externally through separate plan assets. This particularly includes BASF Pensionskasse VVaG and BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V. in Germany, in addition to the large pension plans of our Group companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. To address the risk of underfunding  due  to  market-related  fluctuations  in  plan  assets,  we  have investment  strategies that align return and risk optimization to the structure of the pension obligations. Stress scenarios are also simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses. An adjustment to the interest rates used in discounting pension obligations leads immediately to changes in equity. To limit the risks of changing financial market  conditions  as  well  as  demographic  developments, employees have, for a number of years now, been almost  exclusively\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\noffered defined contribution plans for future years of service. Some of these contribution plans include minimum interest guarantees. If the pension fund cannot generate this, it must be provided by the employer. A permanent continuation of the low interest rate environment could make it necessary to  recognize pension obligations and plan assets for these plans as well.\n\n## Long-term opportunities and risks\n\n## Long-term demand development\n\nWe assume that growth in chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) will be slightly stronger than global gross domestic product over the next five years and will be considerably stronger than the previous five-year average. Through our market-oriented and broad portfolio, which we will continue to strengthen in the years ahead through investments in new production capacities, research and  development activities and acquisitions, we aim to achieve volume growth that slightly exceeds this market growth. Should global economic  growth  see  unexpected,  considerable  deceleration because of prolonged restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, an ongoing weak period in the emerging markets, protectionist tendencies or geopolitical crises, the expected growth rates could prove too  ambitious.\n\n- For more information on the corporate strategy, see page 26 onward\n\n## Development of competitive and customer landscape\n\nWe expect competitors from Asia and the Middle East in particular to gain increasing significance in the years ahead. Furthermore, we predict that many producers in countries rich in raw materials will expand their value chains. We counter this risk through active portfolio management.\n\nWe  continuously  improve  our  processes  in  order  to  remain competitive through our operational excellence.  We are streamlining our administration, sharpening the roles of services and regions, and simplifying procedures and processes as part of our ongoing Excellence   Program.\n\nIn order to achieve lasting profitable growth, tap into new market segments and make our customers more successful, our research and business focus is on highly innovative business areas, some of which we enter into through strategic cooperative partnerships.\n\n- For more information on the Excellence Program, see page 21\n\n## Innovation\n\nThe  central  research  areas  Process  Research  &  Chemical Engineering,  Advanced  Materials  &  Systems  Research  and Bioscience Research serve as global platforms headquartered in our  regions: Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Together with the development units in our operating divisions, they form the core of the global Know-How  Verbund. Our strong regional presence opens up opportunities to participate in local innovation processes and gain access to local  talent. We optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of our research activities through our global Know-How Verbund.\n\nResearch activities funded by the BASF Group promote the targeted development and enhancement of key technologies as well as the establishment of new business areas. Focus areas in research are determined based on their strategic relevance for BASF, above and beyond existing business areas.\n\nWe also address the risk of the technical or economic failure of research and development projects by maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project portfolio, as well as through professional, milestone-based project management.\n\nPotential applications of digital technologies and solutions along the entire value chain are evaluated and implemented in the divisions and service units as well as by cross-divisional teams. They are supported here by the Global Digital Services unit. We analyze the opportunities and risks of digitalization in Production, Logistics, Research &  Development and for business models as well as in corporate  functions such as Finance, Human Resources, Procure-",

That is why we enter into dialog with our stakeholders at an early stage of development. The trend toward  increased  sustainability  requirements  in  our  customer industries  continues. Our aim is to leverage the resulting  opportunities in  a  growing  market  even  more  effectively  in  the  future  with innovations.  This  is  why  we  applied  the  Sustainable  Solution Steering method, which is used to evaluate the sustainability of our product  portfolio,  to  assessments  of  innovation  projects,  and integrated it into an early stage of our research and development processes as well as the  development of our business strategies. In this way, we want to benefit from the higher profitability of our Accelerator  products   compared  with  the  rest  of  our  evaluated portfolio. At the same time, we reduce reputational and financial risks by phasing out products for which we have identified  substantial sustainability concerns (' Challenged' products) within five years of initial classification as such at the latest. We develop action plans for these products at an early stage to minimize any potential financial risks. These can include  research projects, reformulations or even replacing one product with another.\n\nFor more information on innovation, see page 35 onward\n\n## Portfolio development through investments\n\nOur decisions on the type, scope and locations of our investment projects  are  based  on  assumptions  related  to  the  long-term development of markets, margins and costs, as well as raw material availability and country, currency and technology risks.  Opportunities and risks arise from potential deviations in actual developments from our  assumptions. We expect the increase in chemical production in emerging markets in the coming years to remain above the global\n\nOpportunities and Risks\n\naverage. This will create opportunities that we want to exploit by expanding our local presence.\n\n- For more information on our investment projects, see page 157 onward\n\n## Acquisitions, divestitures and cooperations\n\nIn the future, we will continue to expand and refine our portfolio through acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth, are innovation-driven or offer a technological differentiation and help achieve a relevant market position, and make new, sustainable business models possible.\n\nThe evaluation of opportunities and risks plays a significant role during the assessment of acquisition targets. A detailed analysis and quantification is conducted as part of due diligence. Examples of  risks   include  increased  staff  turnover,  delayed  realization  of synergies, or the assumption of obligations that were not precisely quantifiable in advance. If our expectations in this regard are not met, risks could arise, such as the need to impair intangible assets; however,  there  could  also  be  opportunities,  for  example,  from additional  synergies.\n\nDivestitures also play a key role in the development of our portfolio. Risks could arise from divestitures as a result of potential warranty claims or other contractual obligations, such as long-term supply agreements.\n\nFor more information on our acquisitions and divestitures, see page 51 onward\n\n## Recruitment and long-term retention of qualified employees\n\nBASF  anticipates  growing  challenges  in  attracting  qualified employees  in  the  medium  and  long  term  due  to  demographic change, especially in North America and Europe. As a result, there is an increased risk that job vacancies may not be filled with suitable applicants,  or  only  after  a  delay.  We  address  these  risks  with measures  to integrate diversity, employee  and  leadership development,  and  intensified   employer  branding.  At  local  level, demographic management includes succession planning, knowledge  management  and  offerings  to   improve  the  balance\n\nbetween personal and professional life and  promote healthy living. This  increases  BASF's  appeal  as  an  employer  and  retains  our employees in the long term.\n\nFor more information on the individual initiatives and our goals, see page 144 onward\n\n## Sustainability\n\nOpportunities and risks that could arise from material sustainability topics can only rarely be measured in specific financial terms and have an impact on business activities, especially in the medium to long term.\n\nWe reduce potential risks in the areas of environmental protection, safety  and  security,  health  protection,  product  stewardship, compliance, supplier relationships and labor and social standards by setting ourselves globally uniform requirements. These often go beyond local legal requirements.\n\nWe  verify  compliance  with  these  standards  through  internal moni toring systems such as global surveys or audits. In 2020, for example, suppliers were audited for sustainability at a number of sites. Our global Code of Conduct was revised in 2020 to which all employees, managers and Board members are required to adhere. It defines a binding framework for our activities. The monitoring systems are complemented by grievance mechanisms such as our compliance hotlines.\n\nFurthermore, ongoing climate change poses both opportunities and risks for BASF. As an energy-intensive company, climate-related risks arise particularly from regulatory changes, such as in carbon prices  through  emissions  trading  systems,  taxes  or  energy legislation. In addition, BASF's emissions footprint and intensity could lead to a negative perception and reduced appeal among external stake holders such as customers or investors. We counter these  risks  with  our  carbon  management  measures  and  by transparently  disclosing  our  positions  on  and  contributions  to climate  protection  (such  as   political  demands,  progress  in  the implementation of our climate strategy and how our products help",

For example, we can no longer rule out extreme low-water situations or heat waves caused by climate change at our Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany. In 2019/2020, we therefore implemented a package of climate resilience measures.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks, there are also opportunities. Our broad product portfolio includes, among other things, solutions for the circular economy and climate protection (such as insulation foams for buildings, materials for electromobility and bio-based products).  Increased  social  awareness  offers  additional  market opportunities for these products. We are working with numerous scientific and public organizations and initiatives on solutions for sustainable agriculture that meet economic, ecological, and social demands over the long term.\n\nOur decentralized specialists use a central decision tree to  document reportable sustainability risks within the meaning of section 289b et seq. of the German Commercial Code.

This  includes  its organization, values, corporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms.  Effective  and  transparent  corporate  governance ensures that BASF is managed and supervised responsibly with a focus on value creation. It fosters the confidence of our  investors,  the  financial  markets,  our  customers  and other business  partners, employees, and the public in BASF.\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\nmanages company and represents BASF SE in business with third parties\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nappoints, monitors and advises Board of Executive Directors\n\n## Shareholders\n\nexercise rights of co-administration and supervision at Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n\nThe fundamental elements of BASF SE's corporate governance system are: its two-tier system, with a transparent and effective separation  of  company  management  and  supervision  between BASF's Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board; the equal  representation  of  shareholders  and  employees  on  the Supervisory Board; and the shareholders' rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nCorporate Governance Report\n\nDirection and management by the Board of Executive Directors\n\n- \u25aa Board of Executive Directors strictly separate from the Supervisory Board\n- \u25aa Responsible for company management\n- \u25aa Sets goals and strategic direction\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the management of the company, and represents BASF SE in business undertakings with third parties. BASF's Board of Executive Directors is strictly separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of Executive Directors' activities and decides on its composition. A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously be a member of the Supervisory Board. As the central duty of company management, the Board of Executive Directors agrees on the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as well as its individual business areas; determines the company's internal organization; and decides on the composition of management on the levels below the Board. It also manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual measures, and supervising operational management.\n\nThe Board's actions and decisions are geared toward the  company's best interests. It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing the company's value. Among the Board's responsibilities is the preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements of BASF SE and reporting on the company's financial and nonfinancial  performance.  Furthermore,  it  must  ensure  that  the company's  activities  comply  with  the  applicable  legislation  and regulatory requirements, as well as internal corporate directives. This includes the establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance  and  risk  management  as  well  as  establishing  a company-   wide compliance culture with undisputed standards.\n\nDecisions that are reserved for the Board as a whole by law, through the Board of Executive Directors' Rules of Procedure or through resolutions adopted by the Board, are made at regularly held Board meetings called by the chair of the Board of Executive Directors. Board decisions are based on detailed information and analyzes provided by the business areas and specialist units, and, if deemed necessary, by external consultants. Board decisions can generally be made via a simple majority. In the case of a tied vote, the casting vote is given by the chair of the Board. However, the chair of the Board does not have the right to veto the decisions of the Board of Executive Directors. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in their assigned areas of responsibility.\n\nThe Board can set up Board committees to consult and decide on individual  issues  such  as  proposed  material  acquisitions  or divestitures; these must include at least three members of the Board of Executive Directors. For the preparation of important decisions, such  as  those  on  acquisitions,  divestitures,  investments  and personnel, the Board has various commissions at the level below the Board.  Independently of the affected business area, these commissions carefully assess the planned measures and evaluate the associated opportunities and risks.  Based on this information, they report and make recommendations to the Board.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important to the company with regard to planning, business development, risk situation,  risk  management  and  compliance.  Furthermore,  the Board of Executive Directors coordinates the company's strategic orientation with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Statutes of BASF SE and the Supervisory Board have defined certain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to obtain the Supervisory Board's approval prior to their conclusion. Such cases include the acquisition and disposal of enterprises and parts of enterprises, as well as the issue of bonds or comparable",

BASF aims to fill most Board positions with leaders from within the company. It is the task of the Board of Executive Directors to propose a sufficient number of suitable individuals to the Supervisory Board.\n\nBASF's long-term succession planning is guided by the corporate strategy.  It  is  based  on  systematic  management  development characterized by the following:\n\n- -  Early identification of suitable leaders of different professional backgrounds, nationalities and genders\n- - Systematic  development  of  leaders  through  the  successful assumption of tasks with increasing responsibility, where possible in different business areas, regions and functions\n- - Desire to shape strategic and operational decisions, and proven success in doing so, as well as leadership skills, especially under challenging business conditions\n- - Role model function in putting corporate values into practice\n\nThe aim is to enable the Supervisory Board to ensure a reasonable level  of  diversity  with  respect  to  education  and  professional experience,  cultural  background,  international  representation, gender and age when appointing members of the Board of  Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Two-tier management system of BASF SE\n\n## Board of Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nappointed by the Supervisory Board\n\n6 members Chair\n\nappointed by the Supervisory Board\n\nDirectors. Irrespective of these individual criteria, a holistic approach will ultimately determine a person's suitability for appointment to the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE. Both systematic succession planning and the selection process aim to ensure that the Board of Executive Directors as a whole has the following profile, which serves as a diversity concept:\n\n- - Many years of management experience in scientific, technical and commercial fields\n- - International experience based on background and/or  professional experience\n- - At least one female Board member\n- - A balanced age distribution to ensure the continuity of the Board's work and enable seamless succession planning\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12 members\n\n6 shareholder representatives elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and 6 employee representatives\n\nChair\n\nelected by the Supervisory Board\n\nThe  first  appointment  of  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive Directors is for a term of no more than three years. The standard age limit for members of the Board of Executive Directors is 63.\n\nThe number of members on the Board of Executive Directors is determined by the Supervisory Board. It is guided by insights gained by BASF as a company with an integrated leadership culture and is determined by the needs arising from cooperation within the Board of Executive Directors.

As members of the Supervisory  Board  cannot  simultaneously  be  on  the  Board  of Executive Directors, a high level of autonomy is already structurally ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nIn addition to the SE Council Regulation, the relevant legal basis for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is provided by the Statutes of BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement of Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement), which also includes the regulations applicable to BASF for implementing the statutory gender quota for the Supervisory Board. The German Codetermination Act does not apply to BASF as a European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE).\n\nThe Supervisory Board of BASF SE comprises 12 members. Six members are elected by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The remaining six members are elected by the BASF  Europa  Betriebsrat  (BASF  Works  Council  Europe),  the European employee representation body of the BASF Group. In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 18, 2020, the period of appointment for newly elected members of the Supervisory Board was reduced from five to four\n\nyears; and the Statutes were amended accordingly. This ensures that the maximum membership duration of 12 years up to which a Supervisory  Board  member  can  be  classified  as  independent corresponds to a total of three election terms. In accordance with the  German  Corporate  Governance  Code  (Code  2020),  the Supervisory Board reduced the membership duration used as a basis for its independence rating from 15 to 12 years in December 2019.\n\nThe meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees are called by their respective chairs and, independently, at the request of one of their members or the Board of Executive Directors. The shareholder and employee representatives of the Supervisory Board prepare for Supervisory Board meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case. Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are passed by a simple majority vote of the participating members. In the event of a tie, the vote of the chair of the Supervisory Board, who must always be a shareholder representative, shall be the casting vote. This resolution process is also applicable for the  appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board. Resolutions can, as needed, also be made in writing or through communication outside of the meetings, as long as no member objects to this form of passing a resolution.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors regularly informs the Supervisory Board about matters such as the course of business and expected developments,  the  financial  position  and  results  of  operations, corporate planning, the implementation of the corporate strategy, business  opportunities  and  risks,  as  well  as  risk  compliance management.  The  Supervisory  Board  has  embedded  the  main reporting requirements in an information policy. The chair of the Supervisory Board is in regular contact with the Board of Executive Directors, especially with its chair, outside of meetings as well.\n\nBASF  SE's  Supervisory  Board  has  established  a  total  of  four Supervisory  Board  Committees:  the  Personnel  Committee,  the\n\n- * Classified by the Supervisory Board as an 'independent' member of the Supervisory Board (see page 172 for the criteria used to determine independence)\n\nAudit  Committee,  the  Nomination  Committee  and  the  Strategy Committee.\n\n- A list of the members of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE indicating which members are shareholder or employee representatives and their appointments to the supervisory bodies of other companies can be found from page 180 onward\n- The compensation of the Supervisory Board is presented in the Compensation Report from page 183 onward\n- The Statutes of BASF SE and the Employee Participation Agreement can be found at basf.com/statutes and basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Personnel Committee\n\n## Members\n\nDr. Kurt Bock (chair, since June 18, 2020),* Dr. J\u00fcrgen Hambrecht (chair, until June 18, 2020),* Franz Fehrenbach, Sinischa Horvat,* Michael Vassiliadis\n\n## Duties\n\n- - Prepares the appointment of members to the Board of Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board as well as the employment contracts  to  be  entered  into  with  members  of  the  Board  of Executive  Directors\n- -  When making recommendations for appointments to the Board of Executive Directors, considers professional qualifications, international experience and leadership skills as well as long-term succession planning, diversity, and especially the appropriate consideration of women\n- - Prepares the resolutions made by the Supervisory Board with regard  to  the  system  and  amount  of  compensation  paid  to members of the Board of Executive Directors\n\n## Audit Committee\n\n## Members\n\nDame  Alison  Carnwath  DBE  (chair),*  Tatjana  Diether,*  Franz Fehrebach  (until  February  29,  2020),  Anke  Sch\u00e4ferkordt  (since March 1, 2020),* Michael Vassiliadis",

On December 21, 2017, the Supervisory Board therefore agreed on objectives for the composition, the competence profile and the diversity concept of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated February 7, 2017, and section 289f(2) no. 6 of the German  Commercial  Code  (HGB).  These  were  expanded  on December 19, 2019, in particular with respect to the criteria for assessing independence, based on the new recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, which was revised and amended  in  2019  (2020  Code).  The  guiding  principle  for  the composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  is  to  ensure  qualified supervision and guidance for the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE. Individuals shall be nominated to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board who can, based  on  their  professional  expertise  and  experience,  integrity, commitment, independence and character, successfully perform the work of a supervisory board member at an international  chemical company.\n\n## Competence profile\n\nThe following requirements and objectives are considered essential to the composition of the Supervisory Board as a collective body:\n\n- - Leadership experience in managing companies, associations and networks\n- - Members' collective knowledge of the chemical sector and the related value chains\n- - Appropriate knowledge within the body as a whole of finance, accounting, financial reporting, law and compliance as well as\n\nCorporate Governance Report\n\none independent member with accounting and auditing expertise ('financial expert') within the meaning of section 100(5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\n- - At least one member with in-depth experience in innovation, research & development and technology\n- -  At least one member with in-depth experience in digitalization, information technology, business models and start-ups\n- -  At  least  one  member  with  in-depth  experience  in  human resources, society, communications and the media\n- -  Specialist knowledge and experience in sectors outside of the chemical industry\n- For more information on the Supervisory Board's competence profile, see basf.com/supervisoryboard\n\n## Diversity concept\n\nThe Supervisory Board strives to achieve a reasonable level of diversity  with  respect  to  character,  gender,  international  representation,  professional  background,  specialist  knowledge  and experience as well as age distribution, and takes the following composition criteria into account:\n\n- - At least 30% women and 30% men\n- -  At least 30% of members have international experience based on their background or professional experience\n- - At least 50% of members have different educational backgrounds and professional experience\n- -  At least 30% under the age of 60\n\n## Further composition objectives\n\n- -Character and integrity: All members of the Supervisory Board must  be  personally  reliable  and  have  the  knowledge  and experience required to diligently and independently perform the work of a supervisory board member.\n- -Availability: Each member of the Supervisory Board ensures that they invest the time needed to properly perform their role as a member of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE. The statutory limits  on  appointments  to  governing  bodies  and  the  recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code must be complied with when accepting further appointments.\n\n- -Age  limit  and  period  of  membership: Persons  who  have reached the age of 72 on the day of election by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting should generally not be nominated for election. Membership on the Supervisory Board should generally not exceed three regular statutory periods in office, which will correspond to 12  years in the future.\n\n-\n\n- Independence: To  ensure  the  independent  monitoring  and consultation of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory Board  should  have  an  appropriate  number  of  independent members on the board as a whole, and an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives. The Supervisory Board deems this to be the case if more than half of the shareholder representatives and at least eight members of the Supervisory Board  as  a  whole  can  be  considered  independent.  The Supervisory Board's assessment of independence is based on the  criteria  in  the  new  version  of  the  German  Corporate Governance Code, which was revised in 2019 (2020 Code). Among other things, this means that members of the Supervisory Board are no longer considered independent if they have been a member of the board for 12 years or longer. The Supervisory Board has additionally defined the following principles to clarify the meaning of independence: The independence of employee representatives is not compromised by their role as an employee representative or employ ment by BASF SE or a Group company. Prior membership of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE does  not  preclude  independence  following  the  expiry  of  the statutory cooling- off period of two years. Material transactions between  a  Supervisory  Board  member  or  a  related  party  or undertaking of the Super visory Board member on the one hand, and BASF SE or a BASF Group company on the other, exclude a member  of  the  Supervisory  Board  from  being  qualified  as independent. A  material transaction is defined as one or more transactions in a single calendar year with a total volume of 1% or more of the sales of the companies involved in each case. In the same way, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party of a Supervisory Board member has a personal service or consulting agreement with BASF SE or one of its Group companies with an",

Furthermore, if a Supervisory Board member or a related party of a Supervisory Board member holds more than 20% of the shares in a company in which BASF SE is indirectly or directly the majority shareholder, the necessary independence is also not met.\n\n## Status of implementation\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's own assessment, its current composition  meets  all  of  the  requirements  of  the  competence profile. With the court appointment of the new Supervisory Board member Liming Chen on October 8,  2020, the competence area of digitalization - which is key to the future viability of BASF - will continue to be fully covered, despite the departure of Alexander C. Karp on July 22, 2020.\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's assessment, nine (five shareholder representatives and four employee representatives) of the 12 current members are considered independent based on the above criteria.  As  of  January  2020,  shareholder  representative  Franz Fehrenbach is no longer classified as independent, because he has been a member of the Supervisory Board since January 2008 and no longer meets the criterion of a membership duration of less than 12 years. The same applies to employee representative Denise Schellemans, who has also been a member of the Supervisory Board since January 2008 , and to employee representative Michael Vassiliadis, who has been a member of the Supervisory Board since August 2004.\n\n- For more information on the statutory minimum quotas for the number of women and men on the\n- Supervisory Board, see the following section\n\nThe independent Supervisory Board members are named under Management and Supervisory Boards from page 180 onward\n\nCorporate Governance Report\n\nCommitments to promote the participation of women in leadership positions at BASF SE\n\n- \u25aa Minimum quota on Supervisory Board, target figures for Board of Executive Directors and top management\n\nThe supervisory board of a publicly listed European stock  corporation (SE) that is composed of the same number of shareholder and employee representatives must, according to section 17(2) of the SE Implementation Act, consist of at least 30% women and 30% men. Since  the  2018  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting,  the  Supervisory Board  of  BASF  SE  comprises  four  women,  of  whom  two  are shareholder representatives and two are employee representatives, and eight men. The Supervisory Board's composition meets the statutory requirements.\n\nAs  a  target  figure  for  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  the Supervisory Board determined that, in accordance with section 111(5) AktG for the second target-attainment period after the law's entry into force, which began on January 1, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors should continue to have at least one female member. This represented 12.5% on the date the target was set (based on eight members of the Board of Executive Directors), and represents 16.7% as of January 1, 2020 (based on six Board members). With the appointment of Dr. Melanie Maas-Brunner to the Board of Executive Directors, effective as of February 1, 2021, there will be two female Board members.  The proportion of women will be 33.3% upon Wayne T. Smith's departure on May 31, 2021.\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors also decided on target figures for the proportion of women in the two management levels below the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE: Women are to make up 12.1% of the leadership level directly below the Board, and the level below that is to comprise 7.3% women. This corresponds to the status at the time these target figures were determined. The deadline for achieving the goals for the second target-attainment period was set for December 31, 2021. The goals for the second\n\ntarget-attainment period were reached ahead of schedule at the end of 2019.\n\nBASF views the further development and promotion of women as a global  duty  independent  of  individual  Group  companies.  It  has committed to ambitious targets that were further raised in 2020. The new target is to increase the proportion of women in leadership worldwide to 30% by 2030. BASF will continue to work systematically on expanding the percentage of women in its leadership team. To achieve this, global measures will be implemented and enhanced continuously.\n\n- For more information on women in leadership positions in the BASF Group worldwide, see page 32 For more information on the inclusion of diversity, including promotion of women, see the chapter on Employees in the Management's Report on page 146\n- The November 2015 Employee Participation Agreement relevant to the composition of the Supervisory Board is available at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Shareholders' rights\n\n- \u25aa Shareholders' rights of co-administration and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n- \u25aa One share, one vote\n\nShareholders  exercise  their  rights  of  co-administration  and supervision at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which usually takes place within the first five months of the business year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects half of the members of the Supervisory  Board  and,  in  particular,  resolves  on  the  formal discharge of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, the distribution of profits, capital measures, the authorization of share buybacks, changes to the Statutes and the selection of the auditor.\n\nEach BASF SE share represents one vote. All of BASF SE's shares are registered shares. Shareholders are obliged to have themselves entered with their shares into the company share register and to provide  the  information  necessary  for  registration  in  the  share register according to the German Stock Corporation Act.

Only the persons listed in the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders. Listed shareholders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting either personally, through a representative of their choice or through a company-appointed proxy authorized by the shareholders  to  vote  according  to  their  instructions.  Individual instructions are only forwarded to the company on the morning of the day of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Voting rights can be exercised  according  to  shareholders'  instructions  by  companyappointed proxies until the beginning of the voting process during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. There are neither voting caps to limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting rights. BASF has fully implemented the principle of 'one share, one vote.' All shareholders entered in the share register are entitled to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meetings, to have their say concerning any item on the agenda and to request information about company issues insofar as this is necessary to make an informed judgment about the item on the agenda under discussion. Registered shareholders are also entitled to file motions pertaining to proposals for resolutions made by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and to contest resolutions of the Meeting and have them evaluated for their lawfulness in court. Shareholders who hold at least \u20ac500,000 of the company's share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be added to the agenda of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDue to assembly restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting took place virtually without the physical presence of shareholders in accordance with special regulations prescribed by the COVID-19 Act passed by the lower house of the German parliament (Bundestag) in March 2020. To  ensure  legally  compliant  execution  of  this  special  Annual Shareholders' Meeting format, whereby shareholders participated solely via electronic communication, some of the aforementioned\n\nshareholder rights and options for action were limited or handled in an exceptional manner at this virtual meeting. With a few amendments, these special policies are valid for Annual Shareholders' Meetings in 2021 as well.\n\n## Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code\n\n## \u25aa BASF SE follows all recommendations of German Corporate Governance Code\n\nBASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on sustainably increasing the value of the company. BASF SE follows all of  the  recommendations  of  the  German  Corporate  Governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019 (Code 2020), the version in force on submission of the Declaration of Conformity. In the same manner, BASF follows all of the nonobligatory suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n- The joint Declaration of Conformity 2020 by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board of BASF SE is rendered on page 210\n- For more information on the Declaration of Conformity 2020, the implementation of the Code's suggestions and the German Corporate Governance Code, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\nDisclosures according to section 315a(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 1 and explanatory report of the Board of Executive Directors according to section 176(1) sentence 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the subscribed capital of BASF SE was \u20ac1,175,652,728.32,  divided  into  918,478,694  registered  shares with no par value. Each share entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Restrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist. The same rights and duties apply to all shares. According to the Statutes, shareholders are not entitled to receive  share  certificates.  There  are  neither  different  classes  of shares nor shares with preferential voting rights (golden shares).\n\nThe  appointment  and  dismissal  of  members  of  the  Board  of Executive  Directors  is  legally  governed  by  the  regulations  in Article  39 of the SE Council Regulation, section 16 of the SE Implemen tation Act and sections 84 and 85 AktG as well as Article 7 of the Statutes of BASF SE. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board deter mines the number of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least two), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors, and can nominate a chair, as well as one or more vice chairs.  The  members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  are appointed for a maximum of five years. The maximum initial term of appointment is three years. Reappointments are permissible. The Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if there is serious cause to do so. Serious cause includes, in particular, a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive Directors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and dismissals according to its own best judgment.\n\nAccording to Article 59(1) of the SE Council Regulation, amendments to the Statutes of BASF SE require a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting adopted with at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, provided that the legal provisions applicable to German stock corporations under the German Stock Corporation Act do not stipulate or allow for larger majority requirements. In the case of amendments to the Statutes, section 179(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the subscribed capital represented. Pursuant to Article 12(6) of the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve on amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their wording. This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share capital and the number of shares after the redemption of  repurchased BASF shares and after a new issue of shares from authorized  capital.\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May 2,",

A right to subscribe to the new shares shall be granted to shareholders.  This  can  also  be  achieved  by  a  credit  institution acquiring  the  new  shares  with  the  obligation  to  offer  these  to shareholders (indirect subscription right). The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 10% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in Article 5(8) of the  BASF  SE  Statutes.  This  applies  in  particular  if,  for  capital i ncreases in return for cash contributions, the issue price of the new shares is not substantially lower than the stock market price of BASF shares and the total number of shares issued under this authorization does not exceed 10% of the shares currently in issue or, in eligible individual cases, to acquire companies or shares in companies in exchange for surrendering BASF shares.\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 12, 2017, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 by issuing up to 91,847,800 new shares. The contingent capital increase serves to grant shares to the holders of convertible bonds or warrants attached to bonds with warrants of BASF SE or a subsidiary, which the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to issue up to May 11, 2022, by way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 12, 2017. A right to subscribe to the bonds shall be granted to shareholders. The Board of  Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the shareholders'  subscription right in certain exceptional cases - as defined in Article 5(9) of the BASF SE Statutes.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on May 12, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to purchase up to 10% of the shares in issue at the time of the resolution (10% of the company's share capital) until May 11, 2022. At the discretion of the Board of Executive Directors, the purchase can take place on the stock\n\nCorporate Governance Report\n\nexchange or by way of a public purchase offer directed to all shareholders. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to sell the repurchased company shares (a) through a stock exchange, (b) through a public offer directed to all shareholders and - with the approval of the Supervisory Board - to third parties, (c) for a cash payment that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price at the time of sale and (d) for contributions in kind, particularly in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or shares in companies or in connection with mergers. In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders' subscription right is excluded. The Board of Executive Directors is furthermore authorized to retire the shares bought back and to reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital accounted for by the retired shares.\n\nBonds issued by BASF SE and its subsidiaries grant the bearer the right to request early repayment of the bonds at nominal value if, after the date of issue of the bond, one person - or several persons acting together - hold or acquire a volume of BASF SE shares that corresponds to more than 50% of the voting rights (change of control), and one of the rating agencies named in the bond's terms and conditions withdraws its rating of BASF SE or the bond, or reduces it to a noninvestment grade rating within 120 days of the change of control event.\n\nAn exceptional change of control compensation awarded to outgoing members of the Board of Executive Directors has not existed since January  1, 2020, as of the introduction of the amended compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors, which was approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 18, 2020.  The  general  rule  for  severance  payments  granted  for premature terminations of appointments to the Board of Executive Directors  applies,  which  states  that  the  maximum  severance payment may not exceed the amount of two years' compensation; however, this may not exceed the compensation for the remaining period of the contract.\n\nBy contrast, employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are classed as senior executives will still receive a severance payment if  their  contract  of  employment  is  terminated  by  BASF  within 18 months of a change of control event, provided the employee has not given cause for the termination. The employee whose service contract has been terminated in such a case will receive a maximum severance payment of 1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) depending on the number of months that have passed since the change of control event. A change of control is assumed when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding of at least 25% or the increase of such a holding. The remaining specifications stipulated in section 315a(1) HGB refer to situations that are not applicable to BASF SE.\n\nFor more information on bonds issued by BASF SE, see basf.com/bonds\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance\n\nBASF SE has taken out liability insurance that covers the activities of members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board (directors' and officers' liability insurance).

Dr. Stephanie Dietz has been the auditor responsible for the Consolidated Financial Statements since auditing the 2020 Financial Statements. Since the 2020 Financial Statements,  the  auditor  responsible  for  the  Separate  Financial Statements has been Stephan Kaiser. The total fee paid to KPMG and auditing firms of the KPMG group by BASF SE and other BASF Group companies for non-audit services, in addition to the auditing fee, was \u20ac1.2 million in 2020. This represents around 6.1% of the fees for auditing the financial statements.\n\n- For more information, see Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 312\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements",

        "page_content": "## Compliance\n\nOur  Group-wide  Compliance  Program  aims  to  ensure adher ence to legal regulations, the company's internal guidelines and ethical business practices. Our employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory standards into day- to-day business. Members of the Board of Executive Directors  are  also  expressly  obligated  to  follow  these principles.\n\n## Compliance Program and Code of Conduct\n\n- \u25aa Integrated into corporate values\n- \u25aa Regular compliance training for employees\n- \u25aa New Code of Conduct 'We are BASF'\n\nBASF's Compliance Program is based on our corporate values and voluntary  commitments,  as  well  as  international  standards.  It describes our commitment to responsible conduct and  expectations around how all BASF employees interact with business partners, officials,  coworkers  and  the  community.  At  the  core  of  our Compliance Program is the global, standardized Code of Conduct. All employees and managers are obligated to adhere to its  guidelines,  which cover topics ranging from corruption and antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy.\n\nBASF's global Code of Conduct from 2013 was thoroughly revised and republished in June 2020. The content of the new Code of Conduct is fundamentally the same as that of the previous global Code  of  Conduct  but  has  been  supplemented  with  specific additional topics. New sections include 'Digital Responsibility' and 'How We Make Decisions.' A greater emphasis is placed on the importance of raising concerns openly and speaking up when our gut feeling tells us to. A further focus of the new version is its modern design, which offers employees more user-friendly features such as\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance Compliance\n\n## The structure of BASF's Code of Conduct\n\n## We Care\n\n- -Our Code of Conduct\n- -How We Make Decisions\n- -We Always Speak Up\n\n## We Earn Trust\n\n- -Anti-Corruption\n- -Trade Control\n- -Anti-Money Laundering\n\n## We Play Fair\n\n- -Antitrust Laws\n- -Gifts and Entertainment\n- -Conflicts of Interest\n- -We Lead Integrity\n\ncase studies, FAQs and additional references. A new internal online platform and the corresponding app are available to employees worldwide, providing them continuously with up-to-date content, interactive educational options as well as direct contact to subject specialists.\n\nAbiding by compliance standards is the foundation of responsible leadership. This has also been embedded in our values. We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a key role in  securing  our  company's  long-term  success.  Our  efforts  are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset.\n\nWe perform a systematic risk assessment to identify the risk of compliance  violations,  including  corruption  risks.  These  are conducted at divisional, regional and country levels. The regular compliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are another source of information for the systematic identification of risks. These risks are documented in the relevant risk or audit report. The same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the time frame for their implementation.\n\nOne  key  element  in  the  prevention  of  compliance  violations  is compulsory training and workshops held as classroom or online courses. All employees are required within a prescribed time frame\n\n## We Respect\n\n- -Human Rights, Labor and Social Standards\n- -Environmental Protection,  Health and Safety\n\n## We protect\n\n- -Sensitive Company Information\n- -Personal Data\n- -Digital Responsibility\n- -Company Property\n- -Accurate Books and Records\n\nto take part in basic compliance training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations. In addition, the new Code of Conduct contains  a  section  dedicated  to  leading  with  integrity.  Newly appointed senior executives therefore receive special training on compliance. Course materials and formats are constantly updated, taking into account the specific risks of individual target groups and business areas. In total, more than 42,000 participants worldwide received around 54,000 hours of compliance training in 2020.\n\n- For more information on the BASF Code of Conduct, see basf.com/code\\_of\\_conduct\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nis the core of our Compliance Program\n\n## More than 42,000\n\nParticipants in compliance training\n\n## 61 internal audits\n\nconducted on compliance",

        "page_content": "3\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n## Compliance culture at BASF\n\nWe firmly believe that for corporate responsibility to be a success, there must be an active culture of living these guidelines within the company.  Thanks  to  the  early  introduction  of  our  compliance standards, which were consolidated in our global Code of Conduct in 2013 and republished in June 2020 in our currently applicable global Code of Conduct, these are firmly established and  recognized. We  expect  all  employees  to  act  in  line  with  these  compliance principles. Managers play a key role here - they serve as an example of and communicate our values and culture both internally and externally.\n\n## Monitoring adherence to our compliance principles\n\nBASF's  Chief  Compliance  Officer  (CCO)  reports  directly  to  the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the further development of our global compliance organization and our Compliance Management System. The CCO is supported in this task by the Corporate Compliance unit and more than 100 compliance officers worldwide in the regions and countries as well as in the divisions. Material compliance topics are regularly  discussed in the compliance committees established at global and regional level. The CCO reports to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee in at least one of its meetings each year on the status of the  Compliance Program as well as any major developments. In the event of significant incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nWe particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly seek  guidance  if  in  doubt.  They  can  consult  their  managers, specialist departments, such as the Legal department, and  company compliance officers. The new internal platform and corresponding app  also  help  employees  to  access  advice  by  enabling  direct contact. In addition, we have set up more than 50 external hotlines worldwide that our employees can use - including anonymously - to report potential violations of laws or company guidelines. All hotlines\n\nCompliance\n\nare also open to the public. Each concern is documented according to specific criteria, properly investigated in line with standard internal procedures and answered as quickly as possible. The outcome of the investigation as well as any measures taken are documented accordingly and included in internal reports.\n\nIn 2020, 387 calls and emails were received by our external hotlines (2019: 408). The information received related to all categories of our Code of Conduct, including environmental and human rights issues, corruption  and  handling  of  company  property.  We  carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that came to our attention  and,  when  necessary,  took  countermeasures  on  a case-by-case basis. These included, for example, improved control mechanisms,  additional  informational  and  training  measures, clarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as well as disciplinary measures as appropriate. Most of the justified cases  related  to  personal  misconduct  in  connection  with  the protection of company property, inappropriate handling of conflicts of interests or gifts and invitations. In such isolated cases, we took disciplinary measures in accordance with uniform internal standards and also pursued claims for damages where there were sufficient prospects of success. In 2020, violations of our Code of Conduct led to termination of employment in a total of 31 cases (2019: 52). This relates to all employee groups, including senior executives.\n\nBASF's  Corporate  Audit  department  monitors  adherence  to compliance  principles,  covering  all  areas  in  which  compliance violations could occur. They check that employees uphold regulations and make sure that the established processes, procedures and monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize potential risks or preclude violations in the first place. In 2020, 61 Group-wide audits of this kind were performed (2019: 86). Our compliance management system itself is also regularly audited by the internal Corporate Audit department, most recently in November 2018.  Overall,  the  audits  confirmed  the  effectiveness  of  the compliance management system.\n\nWe monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance risks  based  on  the  global  Guideline  on  Business  Partner  Due Diligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based analysis. The results are then documented. If business partners are not prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a business relationship with them. A dedicated global Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with environmental, social and corporate governance standards, among other requirements. As part of our trade control processes, we also check whether persons, companies or organizations appear on sanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities, and whether there are business processes with business partners from or in countries under embargo.\n\nWe support the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are constantly working to enhance our internal guidelines  and  processes  in  keeping  with  these  principles.  For example, there is an internal guideline to respect international labor and  social  standards  that  is  applicable  throughout  the  Group. Outside of our company, too, we support respect for human rights and the fight against corruption. We are a founding member of the United Nations Global Compact. As a member of Transparency International Deutschland and the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, we assist in the implementation of these organizations' objectives.\n\nAs prescribed by BASF's Code of Conduct and corporate values, we  adhere  to  uniformly  high  standards  and  integrity  regarding tax-related issues. To aid in the achievement of the U.N. SDGs and to meet our own standards for the creation of economic and social value, we contribute to public finances in accordance with legal requirements and our corporate values. BASF's Value to Society approach considers taxes paid by BASF to be a social advantage.",

Furthermore, it provides information on end-ofservice undertakings with respect to members of the Board of Executive Directors, as well as information on the compensation of Supervisory Board members.\n\n- -New compensation system for Board of Executive Directors applied for the first time in 2020\n- -The one-year variable compensation is 70% below the prior-year level (sum of performance bonus part 1 and part 2)\n- -Members of the Board of Executive Directors voluntary relinquished 20% of their fixed compensation in the second quarter of 2020\n\nThis report meets the disclosure requirements of the German Commercial Code, supplemented by the additional requirements based on the German Act on the Disclosure of Management Board Remuneration (VorstOG) as well as the German Act on the Appropriateness of Management Board Remuneration (VorstAG), and is aligned with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the version dated December 16, 2019. The existing system of compensation for the Board of Executive Directors was amended as of January 1, 2020, by resolution of the Supervisory Board in order to meet the changed requirements from the 2020 fiscal year onward arising from the German Act Implementing the Second E.U. Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG  II), which also entered into force on January 1, 2020, and from the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the version dated December 16, 2019. The amended compensation system for members of the Board of Executive Directors was approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 18, 2020. Significant changes apply to the variable compensation and the pension benefits. The amended and\n\n- 3 Corporate Governance Compensation Report\n\nsimplified system of compensation for members of the Board of Executive Directors has been applicable since January 1, 2020, for all service contracts for members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\n## Principles\n\nThe compensation of the Board of Executive Directors is determined by the company's size, complexity and financial position, as well as the performance of the Board of Executive Directors as a whole ( Gesamtvorstand ). It is designed to contribute to sustainable corporate development and the achievement of strategic corporate goals. The long-term strategic goals communicated as part of BASF's strategy form the key performance indicators for the short-term and long-term variable compensation and thus foster the sustainable development of the company.\n\n- - The strategic target ' yield ' refers to an annual return on capital employed (ROCE) above the cost of capital percentage. The ROCE serves as the key performance indicator for determining the performance bonus ( short-term incentive, STI ).\n- - The strategic targets ' growth ,' ' profitability ' and ' CO2-neutral growth until 2030 ' are represented in the new long-term incentive  (LTI) program. The final number of performance share units (PSUs) is determined based on the level of target achievement for the three strategic targets over the entire four-year period of the LTI program.\n\nBy taking into account the total shareholder return (development of the share price and dividend), the new LTI enables both members of the Board of Executive Directors and shareholders to participate in the sustainable development of the company.\n\nThe compensation of the Board of Executive Directors is marked by a pronounced variability in relation to the performance of the Board of Executive Directors as a whole and the BASF Group's success. The external and internal appropriateness of the Board's compensa-\n\n- 1 The European peer group for the 2019 appropriateness review comprised the following companies: ABB, Air Liquide, Akzo Nobel, BAE Systems, Bayer, BHP, BMW, BP, Continental, Daimler, DSM, E.ON, EDF, Henkel, Linde, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, Siemens, Solvay, Thyssenkrupp, Total, Volkswagen.\n\ntion is reviewed by an independent external auditor on a regular basis. DAX companies in Germany and globally operating companies in the rest of Europe 1 serve as an external reference.\n\nFor internal comparison, the compensation of senior executives and employees of BASF SE is considered in total as well as over time.\n\nBased on a proposal by the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the structure and amount of compensation of members of the Board of Executive Directors. In the event of significant amendments, but at least every four years, the compensation system resolved by the Supervisory Board is presented to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\nIn very exceptional cases (such as a severe economic crisis), the Supervisory Board can temporarily deviate from the components of the compensation system (procedures and rules on the compensation structure and amount as well as relating to the individual compensation components) for the Board of Executive Directors, if this is in the interest of the long-term well-being of the company.\n\n- For more information on the Supervisory Board and its committees, see page 181 and from page 205 onward",

Company pension benefits\n\nThe previous pension benefits granted to members of the Board of Executive Directors (Board Performance Pension, deferred compensation program and basic coverage under BASF Pensionskasse) were discontinued as of January 1, 2020, and replaced by a new defined contribution pension.\n\n## Company pension benefits\n\n- -Defined contribution pension commitment in the form of an external capital investment model\n- -Pension entitlement: retirement, disability and surviving dependents'  pensions\n- -Possibility to opt out in favor of an annual pension allowance\n\nSince January 1, 2020, the company offers members of the Board of Executive Directors a defined contribution pension commitment in the form of a capital investment model. The company grants the members of the Board of Executive Directors a fixed annual pension plan contribution:\n\n- - For the purpose of building retirement assets (retirement capital), the  company  pays  pension  contributions  into  an  investment model to be chosen by the company. The pension account is managed by an external provider. The performance of the paid-in contributions is determined by the returns generated by the investment  model.  However,  each  member  of  the  Board  of Execu tive Directors is guaranteed a benefit of least 80% of the amount of the pension contributions paid by the company.\n- - The pension benefits include disability and survivor benefits. The disability capital corresponds to the value of the pension account at the time the disability occurs, but at least to 80% of the sum of the pension contributions paid by the company. The surviving dependents capital corresponds to the value of the pension account at the time of death of the member of the Board of Execu tive Directors, but at least to 80% of the sum of the pension contributions paid by the company.\n\nCompensation Report\n\n- - Members of the Board of Executive Directors can choose a pension allowance for private retirement savings instead of the  defined contribution pension commitment. In this case, the defined  annual pension contribution amount is paid in equal monthly installments as a gross amount to the member of the Board of Executive Directors. In this case, there is no further claim to benefits  following the conclusion of the Board mandate, since the annual pension contribution is paid as a gross amount to the Board member in equal monthly installments during the term of the mandate.\n\nFor future entitlements from the new defined contribution pension commitment in the form of a capital investment model, the following applies:\n\n- - The pension benefit is paid as a capital payment, possibly in as many as 10 installments. Moreover, there is the possibility of choosing an annuity (lifetime pension payment).\n- - For conversion into an annuity, the actuarial parameters relevant at this point in time are used.\n- - If the member of the Board of Executive Directors dies while receiving the annuity, the surviving spouse receives a survivor benefits pension corresponding to 60% of the annuity. The same applies for civil partners.\n- - Current pensions are increased annually by 1% as of January 1.",

Short-term incentive (STI)\n\n## Short-term incentive (STI)\n\n- -One-year performance period\n- -The amount of the STI is based on the achievement of set operational and strategic targets as well as the BASF Group's ROCE.\n- -The payout is limited to 200% of the target amount (cap).\n- -The payment occurs after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting following the fiscal year.\n\nFor each fiscal year, an STI with a one-year performance period is granted. The STI is based on the achievement of operational and strategic goals as well as the return on capital employed (ROCE), which is relevant for the compensation of all employees. The actual STI amount is paid out after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in the following year.\n\nWith the ROCE as the key performance indicator for the variable compensation,  the  short-term  variable  compensation  is  directly linked to the company's operating success and aligned with the BASF Group's financial goal of earning a premium on the cost of capital. The ROCE of the particular fiscal year serves as the key performance indicator for the success of the company when determining the STI. ROCE is the ratio of income from operations (EBIT) of the segments in relation to the average operating assets of the segments, plus the customer and supplier financing not included there.\n\n## For more information on operating assets, see Value-Based Management on page 33\n\nThe target ROCE for the variable compensation is one percentage point above the cost of capital percentage for the fiscal year, which is determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach in accordance with the capital asset pricing model. A ROCE factor is assigned to each relevant ROCE value. If the ROCE is two percentage points or more below the target ROCE, the ROCE factor will decline at a faster rate. The ROCE factor will increase at a slower rate if the ROCE is two percentage points or more above the target ROCE.\n\n## ROCE factor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe ROCE factor is 1.0 if the ROCE achieved in the fiscal year is one percentage point above the weighted cost of capital percentage (based on the WACC in accordance with the capital asset pricing model) for that year, meaning an appropriate premium on the cost of capital was earned.\n\nIn calculating ROCE, adjustments are made for negative and positive special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures (for example, integration costs in connection with acquisitions and gains or losses from the divestiture of businesses) when these exceed a corridor of plus or minus 1% of the average cost of capital basis. An adjustment of the ROCE (in the first 12 months after closing) therefore only occurs in cases of exceptionally high special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets a maximum amount for the STI (cap). The current cap is \u20ac2,000,000 for a member of the Board of Executive Directors. The maximum amount for the chair of the Board of Executive Directors is two times this value, and 1.33 times this value for the vice chair.\n\nCompensation Report\n\nFor the fiscal year 2020, the target ROCE was 10% with a cost of capital percentage of 9%. This figure is reviewed and communicated annually. In order to assess the sustainable performance of the Board of Executive Directors, each year the Supervisory Board sets a target agreement with the Board of Executive Directors as a whole. The target agreement contains:\n\n- - One-year operational targets, primarily earnings, financial and operational excellence targets. This includes, for example, EBIT before special items.\n- - One-year strategic targets relating to the further development of BASF, primarily targets for growth, portfolio optimization, investment and R&D strategy, digitalization, sustainability and BASF corporate values.\n\nThese targets are in line with the outlook published in the forecast. A performance factor with a value between 0 and 1.5 is determined on the basis of the target achievement ascertained by the Supervisory Board. A target achievement rate of 100% equates to a value of 1.0 for the performance factor.\n\n## Target achievement and performance factor\n\n| Target achievement                            | 50%   | 75%   | 100%   | 125%   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Performance factor                            | 0     | 0.5   | 1.0    | 1.5    |\n| Values between these figures are interpolated |       |       |        |        |\n\nThe payout of the STI is determined as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe payout is limited to 200% of the target amount (cap).\n\n- For more information on the determination of the cost of capital percentage, see Value-Based Management on page 33",

Long-term incentive (LTI)\n\nThe LTI plan incentivizes the achievement of strategic goals and takes into consideration the development of the BASF share and dividend (Total Shareholder Return) over a period of four years. The LTI is also offered with slight variations to senior executives of the BASF Group.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI)\n\n- -Four-year performance period\n- -The payout amount is determined by the achievement of three agreed strategic targets (growth, profitability, sustainability) and the performance of the BASF share plus the dividends paid (total shareholder return).\n- -The payout is limited to 200% of the target amount (cap).\n- -The payout occurs in May following the Annual Shareholders' Meeting after the end of the four-year performance period.\n\nGrant: For each fiscal year, an LTI plan with a four-year performance period will be granted. The target amount will be converted into a preliminary number of virtual performance share units (PSUs). To undertake this conversion, the target amount is divided by the average price of the BASF share in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the beginning of the respective plan.\n\nTargets and target achievement: At the beginning of the four-year performance period, the Supervisory Board defines three strategic targets. Depending on the achievement of these strategic targets over the four-year performance period, the number of PSUs can increase or decline. To determine this, the number of provisional PSUs at the end of the four years is multiplied by the weighted target achievement rate for the three strategic targets.\n\n## Grant (year 1)\n\n## Payout (after year 4)\n\nLTI target amount\n\nShare price at grant date\n\nPreliminary number of (virtual) performance share units (PSUs)\n\nCompensation Report\n\n## Achievement of strategic targets over a four-year performance period\n\n## Strategic target 1: Growth\n\nGrow sales volumes faster than global chemical production every year\n\nStrategic target 2: Profitability\n\nIncrease EBITDA before special items by 3% to 5% per year\n\n## Strategic target 3: Sustainability\n\nGrow CO 2 neutrally (\u226421.9 million metric tons CO 2 equivalents per year)\n\nPayout: The final number of PSUs determined in this way is multiplied by the average share price of the BASF share in the fourth quarter of the last year of the four-year performance period plus the cumulative dividend payments in the four fiscal years of the performance period. The payout amount of the LTI therefore reflects not only the achievement of the strategic targets but also the development of BASF's total shareholder return. The actual LTI amount is paid out after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in the year following the end of the four-year performance period. The payout is limited to 200% of the target amount (cap).\n\nFinal number of (virtual) PSUs\n\nShare price at end date + \u2211 dividends\n\nLTI payout (gross); Cap at 200% of target amount\n\nDetermination of target achievement: For each of the three strategic targets, at the beginning of the four-year performance period the Supervisory Board defines a target value, which corresponds to a target achievement of 100%, as well as a minimal value, a maximum value and a target achievement curve.\n\nFor each strategic target, the target achievement rate is determined on an annual basis. At the end of the four-year performance period, the arithmetic mean of the four annual target achievement rates is calculated. The resulting average target achievement rates for the individual strategic targets are combined according to the defined weighting to reach a weighted target achievement. The preliminary number of PSUs is multiplied by the weighted target achievement in order to determine the final number of PSUs.\n\nFor the LTI plan 2020 (performance period 2020-2023) the following targets as communicated by the BASF corporate strategy (see BASF Report 2019, page 27) apply:",

The conversion into a number of shares to be held is carried out using the average price of the BASF share in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the start of the first-time share ownership guideline.\n\nThe number of shares to be held rises accordingly with any increase in the amount of fixed salary. The share ownership obligation ends two years after the end of the mandate of the member of the Board of Executive Directors (post-mandate share ownership obligation). When members are first appointed to the Board of Executive Directors, they have until the end of the fourth calendar year following the initial appointment to fulfill this share ownership obligation (built-up phase).

The BOP is based on the STI paid out for the previous year and can therefore be considered delayed compensation for the preceding fiscal year. It was therefore offered for the last time in 2020, based on the performance bonus for 2019.\n\nTo take part in the program, each participant must prove an  individual investment in BASF shares and hold the shares for this purpose for a defined period of time (holding period). The individual investment can amount to a maximum of 30% of the participant's performance bonus (gross) for the previous year.",

        "page_content": "3\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nThe members of the Board of Executive Directors are obligated to invest at least 10% of their individual performance bonus (gross) for the previous year in the LTI program each year (share ownership obligation). This mandatory investment is subject to a holding period of four years. For any further additional voluntary investment of up to 20% of the performance bonus (gross) for the previous year, the general holding period of two years applies.\n\nFour options are granted for each BASF share brought into the LTI program as an individual investment. After a four-year vesting  period, there is a four-year exercise period during which the members of the Board of Executive Directors can exercise these options if performance thresholds are met. During the exercise period, the exercising of options is prohibited during certain periods (closed periods). Each member of the Board of Executive Directors can individually decide on the timing and extent of the exercising of options. Once the options are exercised, the computed value of the options is paid out in cash (cash settlement).\n\nEach option consists of right A (absolute performance threshold) and right B (relative performance threshold), whose value is determined by different performance targets.\n\nAt least one of the two conditions must be met in order for the option to be exercised:\n\n- - Performance threshold, right  A: BASF share price increases at least 30% compared with the base price on the option grant date for the LTI program concerned. The value of right A is calculated as the difference between the market price of BASF shares on the exercise date and the base price on the option grant date. It is limited to 100% of the base price (cap). The base price for an LTI program is the volume-weighted average share price in Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG's electronic trading system (Xetra) on the first trading day after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of BASF SE in the year in which the LTI program is granted. The base price for the LTI program granted in 2020 was \u20ac51.26 (2019: \u20ac68.21).\n\nCompensation Report\n\n- - Performance threshold, right B: The cumulative percentage performance of the BASF share exceeds that of the MSCI World Chemicals Index (outperformance) and the price of the BASF share on the exercise date equals at least the base price. The value of right B is calculated as the base price of the option multiplied by twice the outperformance of BASF shares on the exercise date. It is limited to the closing price on the date of exercise minus the computed nominal value of BASF shares.\n\nIn total, the maximum exercise gain (cap) is limited to five times the individual investment.\n\n## For more information on the LTI program, see page 149 and page 310\n\n## Provisions relating to the previous multi-year variable compensation components and to the previous pension plan\n\nThe still-running deferral components from the performance bonus 2018 (2018-2021) and 2019 (2019-2022) will be continued as planned and paid out in accordance with the terms of the previous program. To assess the strategic performance, the Supervisory Board will therefore determine a separate strategic performance factor (SPF) for each of the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. This SPF will serve exclusively to determine the average SPFs necessary for the deferral components of the performance bonus in accordance with the terms of the program.\n\nThe option rights granted under the previous BASF option program (BOP) and not yet exercised can continue to be exercised in accordance with the specified terms of the BOP for the Board of Executive Directors. Members of the Board of Executive Directors had the opportunity to participate for the last time in the BASF option program as of July 1, 2020, based on their performance bonus (gross) for the year 2019. The existing applicable minimum investment of 10% and the additional voluntary investment of up to 20% of the performance bonus (gross) for the previous year remain in effect unchanged. The option rights hereby granted are a component of the compensation for the Board of Executive Directors for the fiscal year 2019 and were granted in accordance with the previous program's terms as of July 1, 2020. Owing to the maximum program duration of eight years, exercise gains from the option program may be allocated to members of the Board of Executive Directors up until June 30, 2028, at the latest.\n\nThe pension entitlements acquired until December 31, 2019, under the previous pension benefits are maintained as vested rights and upon retirement, disability or death can be accessed by the member of the Board of Executive Directors or by the surviving dependents as a company pension or retirement capital in accordance with the previous rules.",

These targets are in line with the outlook for 2020 published in the forecast. The amount of the STI is calculated by multiplying the target amount by the performance factor derived from the target achievement and by the ROCE factor. If the ROCE is below the threshold of 4%, the compensation system stipulates that the Supervisory Board determines the ROCE factor by special resolution, either as zero or a value larger than zero. If the ROCE factor is zero, the STI would also be zero, regardless of the achievement of the agreed operational and strategic targets.\n\nIn the year 2020, BASF Group's ROCE was 1.7% and thus below the target of earning a premium on the cost of capital as well as below the threshold for the ROCE. The main reasons for this were the slowdown in business - particularly in the second quarter - and the negative impact on earnings resulting from impairments to fixed assets.\n\nAs required by the compensation system, the Supervisory Board determined an ROCE factor of 0.3 by special resolution. This corresponds to the value that would be achieved with an ROCE of 4% and equates to half the level of 2019. The following factors were relevant in this decision:\n\nThe economic conditions in 2020 developed in an unforeseeable and exceptional way due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Board of Executive Directors reacted quickly, energetically and effectively, ensured the protection of employees and steered BASF well through this difficult phase with a focus on costs and liquidity.\n\nCompensation Report\n\nAt the same time, the Board of Executive Directors demonstratively took on social responsibility by, for example, producing and donating disinfectant for clinics and doctors' offices and by procuring masks. The Supervisory Board wants to expressly recognize these achievements. Moreover, efforts to advance BASF's strategic further development were unabated. Finally, the operational and strategic targets were largely achieved. Despite the decline in earnings, based on the target agreement, the performance factor amounts to 0.95:\n\n- - The EBIT target was clearly missed.\n- - The free cash flow target was not reached.\n- - The targets from the Excellence Program were exceeded.\n- - A further improvement in customer and employee satisfaction was achieved.\n- - Sales of products that make a substantial contribution to sustainability (Accelerators) increased.\n- - The target for investments in growth focus areas was met.\n\n| Target amount  performance bonus,  STI 2020:   |   ROCE factor  2020: |   Performance factor  2020: | STI payout  (gross):   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n| \u20ac1,000,000                                     |                  0.3 |                        0.95 | \u20ac285,000               |\n\n- - Synergies from acquisitions and joint ventures were above the target level.\n\nBased on the defined parameters, the performance bonus for a fullyear member of the Board of Executive Directors is calculated as shown below. In light of the exceptional circumstances and the achievements of the Board of Executive Directors in 2020, the Supervisory Board considers this bonus to be appropriate and fair. The Supervisory Board did not make use of the possibility, in very exceptional cases (such as a severe economic crisis), to temporarily deviate from the components of the compensation system for the Board of Executive Directors.",

The following table shows the number of PSUs granted as of January 1.\n\n## Number of performance share units (PSUs) granted\n\n|                         | 2020    | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller | 41,268  | -      |\n| Saori Dubourg           | 20,634  | -      |\n| Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel   | 27,443  | -      |\n| Michael Heinz           | 20,634  | -      |\n| Dr. Markus Kamieth      | 20,634  | -      |\n| Wayne T.

This expense refers to the total of all option rights from the LTI programs 2012 to 2020 and is calculated as the difference in the fair value of the option rights on December 31, 2020, compared with the fair value on December 31, 2019, considering the option rights exercised and granted in 2020. The fair value of the option rights is based  primarily  on  the  development  of  the  BASF  share  price and its relative performance compared with the benchmark index, the MSCI World Chemicals Index.\n\nThe expenses reported below are purely accounting figures that do not equate with the actual gains should options be exercised. Each member of the Board of Executive Directors may decide individually on the timing and scope of the exercise of options of the LTI programs, while taking into account the terms and conditions of the program.\n\nThe outstanding option rights held by the members of the Board of Executive Directors resulted in the following expenses in 2020: Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller: expense of \u20ac266 thousand (2019: expense of \u20ac464 thousand); Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel: expense of \u20ac152 thousand (2019: expense of \u20ac339  thousand); Saori Dubourg: expense of \u20ac136 thousand (2019: expense of \u20ac66 thousand); Michael Heinz: expense of \u20ac172  thousand (2019: expense of \u20ac334  thousand); Dr. Markus Kamieth: expense of \u20ac203 thousand (2019: expense of \u20ac124 thousand); and Wayne T. Smith: expense of \u20ac914 thousand (2019: expense of \u20ac298 thousand).\n\nIn 2020, the performance share units granted as part of the new LTI resulted in an expense. This expense refers to the total of all performance share units from the LTI program 2020 and is calculated as the difference in the fair value of the performance share units on December 31, 2020, compared with the fair value on December 31, 2019. The fair value of the performance share units is based  primarily on the expected development of the BASF share price and the dividend as well as assumptions relating to the expected weighted level of target achievement for the three strategic targets in the fouryear performance period.\n\nThe expenses reported below are purely accounting figures that do not equate with the actual inflows from the LTI at the end of the four-year performance.\n\nThe performance share units granted to the members of the Board of Executive Directors resulted in the following expenses in 2020 (2019:  not  applicable):  Dr.  Martin  Bruderm\u00fcller:  expense  of \u20ac642 thousand; Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel: expense of \u20ac427 thousand; Saori Dubourg: expense of \u20ac321 thousand; Michael Heinz: expense of \u20ac321 thousand; Dr. Markus Kamieth: expense of \u20ac321 thousand; Wayne T.

Effective January 1, 2020, the company offers members of the Board of Executive Directors a defined contribution pension commitment in the form of a capital investment model. The company grants the members of the Board of Executive Directors a fixed  annual pension plan contribution. The pension entitlements acquired until December 31, 2019, under the previous company pension system are maintained as vested rights and upon retirement, disability or death can be accessed by the member of the Board of Executive Directors or by the surviving dependents as a company pension or retirement capital in accordance with the previous rules.\n\nThe present value of pension benefits (defined benefit obligation) is an accounting figure for the entitlements that the Board members have accumulated in their years of service at BASF. The table below shows the defined benefit obligations for the pension entitlements accrued until the end of 2020 (as of December 31 in each case).\n\n## Present value of the defined benefit obligation\n\n| Thousand \u20ac              |        |          |\n|-------------------------|--------|----------|\n|                         | 2020   | 2019     |\n| Dr. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller | 19,490 | 18,171   |\n| Saori Dubourg           | 6,611  | 6,983    |\n| Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel   | 16,219 | 14,081   |\n| Michael Heinz           | 16,253 | 15,201   |\n| Dr. Markus Kamieth      | 7,100  | 5,797    |\n| Wayne T.

The company is entitled to offset compensation received for any other employment against pension benefits until the legal retirement age is reached.\n\nThis rule no longer applies for any member who was appointed to the Board of Executive Directors after January 1, 2017.\n\nThere is a general limit on severance pay (severance payment cap) for all Board members. Accordingly, payments made to a Board member upon premature termination of their contract, without serious cause, may not exceed the value of two years' compensation, including fringe benefits, nor compensate more than the remaining term of the contract. The severance payment cap is to be calculated on the basis of the total compensation for the past fiscal year and, if\n\nappropriate, also the expected total compensation for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe following applies to end of service due to a change-of-control event: A change-of-control event, in terms of this provision, occurs when a shareholder informs BASF of a shareholding of at least 25%, or the increase of such a holding.\n\nIf a Board member's appointment is revoked within one year following a change-of-control event, the Board member will receive the contractually agreed payments for the remaining contractual term of mandate as a one-off payment; however, this amount also may not exceed the value of two years' compensation. The outstanding pension contributions until the end of the regular contractual term of office shall be paid as a one-time gross payment.\n\n## Former members of the Board of Executive Directors\n\nTotal compensation for previous Board members and their surviving dependents amounted to \u20ac12.5 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac11.5 million). This figure also contains payments that previous Board members have themselves financed through the deferred compensation program, as well as the income for 2020 relating to option rights that previous members of the Board still hold from the time of their active service period. Moreover, this figure contains non-compete compensation paid to a former member of the Board of Executive Directors. The increase in total compensation resulted from two opposing effects: On the one hand, the fair value measurement of option rights resulted in income of \u20ac0.7 million overall in 2020, mainly due to the higher accounting valuation of the option rights due to the increased share price (2019: expense of \u20ac0.6 million). On the other hand, the inclusion of the non-compete compensation led to an expense of \u20ac2.0 million in 2020.\n\nOption rights that have not yet been exercised on retirement are to be continued under the conditions of the program including the",

The obligation to purchase and hold shares is a variable compensation component with a long-term orientation  which  emphasizes  the  Supervisory  Board's  strategic support role.\n\n## Amount of Supervisory Board compensation\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board shall receive annually a fixed compensation of \u20ac200,000. In recognition of the increased demands on the chair, the compensation of the Supervisory Board of BASF follows the GCGC recommendation of function-related differentiation of the compensation of the chair, vice chair and members. The amount for the chair of the Supervisory Board is 2.5 times this value, and 1.5 times this value for the vice chair compared with the compensation of a member of the Supervisory Board. The members of the Supervisory Board each voluntarily relinquished 20% of their fixed compensation for the period from April 1, 2020, until December 31, 2020.\n\n## Amount of compensation for serving on a committee\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board who are members of a committee, except for the Nomination Committee, receive an additional annual fixed compensation of \u20ac12,500. This also follows the GCGC recommendation that the increased workload of Supervisory Board members serving on committees should be appropriately taken into\n\naccount. For members of the Audit Committee, the further compensation shall be \u20ac50,000. The chair of a committee shall receive twice and a vice chair 1.5 times the further fixed  compensation.",

This does not apply to the amount of compensation that the member of the Supervisory Board transfers to a third party on a pro rata basis as a result of an obligation entered into before their appointment to the Supervisory Board. In this case, the utilization and holding obligation applies to 25% of the remaining compensation after deducting the amount transferred.\n\nThe company reimburses members of the Supervisory Board for out-of-pocket expenses and value-added tax to be paid with regard to their activities as members of the Supervisory Board or of a committee. The directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&O insurance) concluded by the company covers the duties performed by the members of the Supervisory Board. This policy provides for the level of deductibles for the Supervisory Board as recommended in section 3.8(3) of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). Total compensation of the Supervisory Board in 2020 was around \u20ac2.9 million (2019: around \u20ac3.3 million). The compensation of the individual Supervisory Board members is listed in the table on the left.\n\nCompensation for membership on the Supervisory Board and its committees, provided it is not withheld for the purpose of acquiring shares, is due after the conclusion of the fiscal year for which the compensation is paid. Beyond the compensation in accordance with the Statutes presented in the table 'Compensation of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE,' no Supervisory Board members received any compensation in 2020 for services rendered  personally, in particular, the rendering of advisory and agency services.\n\n- For more information on share ownership by members of the Supervisory Board, see page 175",

The pandemic had a significant impact on BASF's business and its activities. In particular, the dramatic downturn in the second quarter left a clear mark on the BASF Group's earnings. The operating result declined significantly. The bottom line - income after taxes - was negative for the first time in many years due to special items. In this situation, the Supervisory Board intensified its communication with the Board of Executive  Directors. It was informed in detail and at an early stage about changed business forecasts and the measures to be taken. The Board of Executive Directors ensured that employees were protected and kept costs and liquidity under control with  effective crisis management. At the same time, cooperation with customers was further strengthened. Key  initiatives to promote the long-term development of BASF  continued unabated. In this way, the\n\nReport of the  Supervisory Board\n\nBoard of Executive Directors led BASF through this difficult phase with strength, prudence and foresightedness.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expressly supports this approach and would like to thank the Board of Executive Directors and all employees worldwide for their extraordinary dedication and hard work in the 2020 business year.\n\nThis year, we as the Supervisory Board will again not have any opportunity to meet directly with you - our shareholders. We deeply regret this, because a physical  Annual Shareholders' Meeting is the ideal place to discuss the development of your BASF with you. This report should give you the opportunity to appraise the Supervisory Board's work. We hope to be able to again meet and talk with you directly as soon as possible.\n\n## Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing dialog with the Board of Executive  Directors\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its duties as required by law and the Statutes with the utmost care. It regularly monitored the management of the Board of Executive Directors and provided advice on the company's strategic development and important individual measures, about which the Supervisory Board was regularly and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This occurred both during and outside of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the form of written and oral reports on, for example, all of the major financial key performance indicators (KPIs) of the BASF Group and its segments, the economic situation in the main sales and procurement markets, and on deviations in business developments  from  original  plans.  Furthermore,  the  Supervisory  Board  tackled fundamental questions of corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel planning, as well as measures for designing the future of research and development. It regularly discussed occupational and process  safety, with a particular focus on the measures resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. The Supervisory  Board  discussed  in  detail  the  reports  from  the  Board  of  Executive Directors, and also deliberated on prospects for the company and its individual business areas with the Board of Executive Directors. It was convinced of the law fulness, expediency and propriety of the Board of Executive Director's company leadership.",

        "page_content": "3\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors were also in regular contact outside of Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  was  always  promptly  and  comprehensively informed of current developments and significant individual issues. The Supervisory Board was involved at an early stage in decisions of major importance. The Supervisory Board passed resolutions on all of those individual measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors which by law or the Statutes required the approval of the Supervisory  Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held seven meetings in the 2020 business year. With the exception of the meeting immediately following the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 18, 2020, in which Dr. Kurt Bock was elected as Chairman of the Supervisory Board following his appointment to the Supervisory Board, which one member of the Supervisory Board was unable to attend, all members attended all Supervisory Board meetings in 2020. Despite the restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, four of the meetings were able to be held in person with most Supervisory Board members physically present. The three meetings in April and June were held solely by means of electronic communication as video conferences. The members of the Supervisory Board elected by shareholders and those elected by the employees prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions in each case, which were also attended by members of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nWith the exception of the meeting following the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, all members  of  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors  attended  the  Supervisory  Board meetings unless it was deemed appropriate that the Supervisory Board discuss individual topics - such as personnel matters relating to the Board of Executive Directors - without them being present. In addition, each Supervisory Board meeting includes an agenda item that provides an opportunity for discussion without the Board of Executive Directors (executive session).\n\n- An individual overview of attendance at meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees will be made available on the company website at basf.com/supervisoryboard/meetings\n\nA significant component of all Supervisory Board meetings was the Board of Executive Directors' reports on the current business situation with detailed information on sales and earnings development, as well as on opportunities and risks for business\n\ndevelopment,  the  status  of  important  current  and  planned  investment  projects, operational  excellence  and  sustainability,  developments  on  the  capital  markets, significant managerial measures taken by the Board of Executive Directors and innovation projects.\n\nIn all meetings in 2020, the Supervisory Board addressed the development of the coronavirus  pandemic  and  its  impact  on  the  macroeconomic  environment  and business developments and prospects of the BASF  Group. It fully supported the Board of Executive Directors' measures and initiatives to respond to the crisis, avoid operational disruptions and ensure the health and safety of employees, including extensive remote and mobile working offerings.\n\nIn all meetings, it also discussed the progress of major investments and ongoing portfolio projects. Discussions focused on:\n\n- - The execution of the sale of the global construction chemicals business\n- - The development of the joint venture Wintershall Dea created by the merger of the oil and gas businesses of BASF and LetterOne\n- - The execution of the sale of the global pigments business\n- - The progress of the investment project to establish a new Verbund site in southern China\n\nAt its meeting on February 26, 2020, the Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the Consolidated Financial Statements, Management's Report and the proposal for the appropriation of profit for the 2019 business year as presented by the Board of Executive  Directors.  It  also  discussed  the  agenda  for  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting, which was originally planned for April 30, 2020, and adopted its proposals for resolutions. Other topics discussed at the meeting were business conditions and BASF's development and prospects in China, the world's largest chemical market, as well as the project to construct a new Verbund site in southern China, the report on the strategy and focus areas of research and development, and the integration and use of renewable energies in the BASF Group.\n\nThe main focus of the meeting on April 29, 2020, was the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which had been spreading since the middle of the first quarter, on BASF's business and prospects, as well as crisis management and measures in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The Supervisory Board also addressed the execution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which had been postponed to June 18, 2020,",

In a further meeting following the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Supervisory Board elected Dr. Kurt Bock as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board. He succeeds Dr. J\u00fcrgen Hambrecht, who retired from the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe main agenda items at the meeting on July 22, 2020, were BASF's leadership development and personnel concept, as well as the current status of and the  strategies and main plans for the further development of the Nutrition & Health and Agricultural Solutions divisions.\n\nAt the strategy meeting on October 22/23, 2020, the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board discussed at length the status of implementation of the corporate strategy with a particular focus on growth, strengthening profitability and portfolio development, as well as key aspects of BASF's strategic development. These included:\n\n- - The further development of BASF's portfolio after the coronavirus pandemic\n- - Growth projects (the Verbund site in China and battery materials)\n- - The development of the regulatory environment, including the European Green Deal\n- - The transformation to a circular economy\n- - The energy transformation to reduce CO2 emissions\n\nAt its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Supervisory Board discussed and  approved the Board of Executive Directors' operational and financial planning, including the investment budget for 2021, and, as in previous years, authorized the Board of Executive Directors to procure the necessary financing in 2021 within a set limit.\n\n## Compensation and composition\n\nIn several meetings over the 2020 business year, the Supervisory Board discussed and passed resolutions on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and its composition.\n\nAt its meeting on February 26, 2020, the Supervisory Board discussed and agreed on the 2020 targets for the Board of Executive Directors based on the preparations of the Personnel Committee. At the meeting on April  29, 2020, in light of the dramatic deterioration in business performance since the outbreak of the coronavirus  pandemic, it discussed the voluntary relinquishment by the members of the Supervisory Board of part of their fixed Supervisory Board compensation, and the corresponding offer made by the members to the Board of Executive Directors to voluntarily relinquish part of their fixed compensation on a temporary basis. Corresponding waiver declarations were subsequently submitted by all members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nAt its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Supervisory Board evaluated, based on the discussions and the corresponding recommendation of the Personnel Committee, the Board of Executive Directors' performance in 2020 and resolved to grant short-term variable compensation to the members of the Board of Executive Directors. The resolution was necessary as the minimum return on capital employed (ROCE) required for the short-term bonus of 4% was not achieved. The decision to grant a bonus was justified by the Board of Executive Directors' sound crisis management during the coronavirus pandemic and the achievement of key operational and strategic targets in 2020. In addition, the Supervisory Board defined the strategic performance factors for the  deferral  compensation  components  for  2018-2021  and  2019-2022.  The Chairman of the Supervisory Board abstained from the resolution on the factor for the performance bonus for 2018-2021 as this affected him personally.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board, see the Compensation Report on pages 183 to 202\n\nAt its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Supervisory Board also addressed the composition of the Board of Executive Directors and longer-term succession planning. Based on the recommendation of the Personnel Committee, it appointed Dr. Melanie Maas-Brunner as an additional member of the Board of Executive Directors as of February 1, 2021. As a further element of this long-term succession planning, Wayne T. Smith will leave the Board of Executive Directors at midnight on May 31, 2021, one year before the end of his current appointment to the Board of Executive Directors, which ends on conclusion of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2022.",

Following each Committee meeting, the chairs of the Committees reported in detail about the meetings and the activities of the Committees at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board.\n\n- For information on the composition of the committees and the tasks assigned to them by the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report on pages 170 to 171\n\nThe Personnel Committee met four times during the reporting period. All committee members attended all meetings. At its meeting on February 26, 2020, the Personnel Committee discussed the targets for the Board of Executive Directors for the 2020 business year and the 2019 Compensation Report. A key topic of discussion at the meeting on April 29, 2020, was the temporary, voluntary relinquishment by the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board of part of their compensation. At its meeting on July 22, 2020, the Personnel Committee addressed the status of leadership development at the top levels of management below the Board of Executive Directors and long-term succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors. At its meeting on December 16, 2020, the Personnel Committee discussed the future composition of the Board of Executive Directors with the suggestion to appoint Dr.  Melanie Maas-Brunner to the Board of Executive Directors and consequently terminate Wayne T. Smith's mandate one year ahead of the end of his regular term of office. Other topics were the appropriateness of the compensation of the Board of Executive Directors, the assessment of its performance in 2020 and a proposal for the performance-related variable compensation of the Board of Executive Directors.\n\nThe Audit Committee met six times during the reporting period. With the exception of one meeting, which one member did not attend, all committee members attended all meetings. The Audit Committee is responsible for all the tasks listed in section 107(3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. In 2020, the Supervisory Board  additionally tasked the Audit Committee with monitoring the internal process of identifying related party transactions and adopting resolutions to approve related party transactions.\n\nAt the meeting on February 23, 2021, the auditor reported in detail on its audits of BASF SE's Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2020 business year, including the corresponding management's reports, and discussed the results of its audit with the Audit Committee. The committee's audit also included the  nonfinancial statements of BASF SE and the BASF Group. In preparation for this audit, the Audit Committee had, following a corresponding resolution by the Supervisory Board, additionally engaged KPMG to perform a substantive audit with limited assurance of the Nonfinancial Statements and to issue an assurance report on it. KPMG also reported in detail on the focus, the procedure and the key findings of this audit.\n\nAt  the  meeting  on  July  21,  2020,  the  Audit  Committee  engaged  KPMG  AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft - the auditor elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 18, 2020 - with the audit for the 2020 reporting year and auditing fees were agreed upon. The focus areas and scope of the annual audit were  discussed and defined together with the auditor. The Audit Committee excluded in principle the engagement of the auditor to perform any services outside of the audit of the annual financial statements, including beyond prevailing legal limitations. For certain nonaudit services, the Audit Committee authorized the Board of Executive Directors to engage KPMG for such services to a very limited extent, or granted approval in individual cases. At the meeting on December 16, 2020, the auditors responsible reported on the status of the annual audit, as well as the focus areas of the audit and the most important individual items.\n\nOther important agenda items included providing guidance to the Board of Executive Directors on accounting issues, the control system established by the Board of Executive  Directors,  and  follow-up  assessments  of  acquisition  and  investment projects. At its meeting on April  29, 2020, the Audit Committee addressed risk management in the BASF  Group and the organization of internal environmental, health and safety audits. It focused on the internal auditing system and, in particular, payment fraud prevention at the meeting on July 21, 2020, and compliance in the BASF Group on December 16, 2020. In these meetings, the head of the Corporate Audit  department and the Chief Compliance Officer reported to the Audit Committee and answered its questions. In all meetings, the Audit Committee also received information on the  development of risks from litigation.\n\nIn 2020, the Audit Committee's work focused on the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on BASF's results of operations and business prospects, as well as the",

To this end, the Audit Committee received regular reports from the Chief Financial Officer and discussed the ramifications. At an extraordinary committee meeting on October  8, 2020, it discussed at length the possible impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets identified by  the  Board  of  Executive  Directors,  in  particular  the  assumptions  underlying measurement.\n\nThe Nomination Committee is responsible for preparing candidate proposals for the Supervisory Board members to be elected by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Nomination Committee is guided by the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board adopted by the Supervisory Board as well as the competence profile and diversity concept for the Supervisory Board resolved at the meeting on December 21, 2017. The Nomination Committee met twice in 2020. One member was absent at each of the two meetings; otherwise, the meetings were attended by all committee members. Items discussed at the meetings were the existing competence profile and diversity  concept  for  the  Supervisory  Board,  the  selection  of  candidates  for appointment to the Supervisory Board by the court following Dr. Alexander C. Karp's departure from the Supervisory Board, and the proposal to nominate Liming Chen as his successor.\n\nThe Strategy Committee, which was established to discuss strategic options for the further development of the BASF Group, did not meet in 2020.\n\n## Corporate governance and Declaration of Conformity\n\nThe Supervisory Board places great value on ensuring good corporate governance: In 2020, it was therefore once again intensely occupied with the corporate governance standards practiced in the company and the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code in the current version dated December 16, 2019. Other important consultation topics were the translation of the second E.U. Shareholder Rights Directive into German law and, in particular, the new regulations governing related party transactions.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and the Guiding principles for the dialog between investors and German supervisory boards, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board again sought dialog with investors where appropriate in 2020.\n\nSpecial onboarding events are held for new members of the Supervisory Board to familiarize them with the basics of corporate governance at BASF, the organization and internal structures of the BASF Group, and the composition of its businesses. Above and beyond this, the company also supports the members of the Supervisory Board with training for their activities on the Supervisory Board, whether through external offerings such as topic-specific seminars or internal information offerings such as site and plant visits.\n\nAt its meeting of December 17, 2020, the Supervisory Board approved the joint Declaration of Conformity by the Supervisory Board and the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). BASF complies with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated December 16, 2019, without exception. The Corporate Governance Report provides extensive information on the BASF Group's corporate governance.\n\n- The full Declaration of Conformity is rendered on page 210 and is available to shareholders on the company website at basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Independence and efficiency review\n\nAn  important  aspect  of  good  corporate  governance  is  the  independence  of Supervisory  Board  members  and  their  freedom  from  conflicts  of  interest.  The Supervisory Board based the assessment of the independence of its members on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code and the additional criteria for assessing the independence of Supervisory Board members contained in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which were revised in the Supervisory Board meeting on December 19, 2019. The criteria used to assess independence are presented in the Corporate Governance Report on page 172. According to the Supervisory Board's assessment, on the basis of these criteria, five of the six shareholder representatives and four of the six employee representatives - 9 of the 12 members of the Supervisory Board in total - are considered to be independent. All three non-independent Supervisory Board members were classified as such due to the length of their membership on the Supervisory Board, which exceeds 12 years in each case. Beyond this limitation, however, the Supervisory Board does not see any indications that the Supervisory Board role is not performed completely independently. In cases where Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management positions at companies with which BASF has business relations, we see no  impairment",

The scope of these businesses is relatively marginal and furthermore takes place under conditions similar to those of a third party.\n\nAs a consequence of the change in assessed independence of Franz Fehrenbach, the Supervisory Board resolved to appoint Anke Sch\u00e4ferkordt to the Audit Committee in his place as of March 1, 2020, to ensure that the shareholder representatives on the Audit Committee continue to solely be independent Supervisory Board members in the future.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the efficiency of its activities every year in the form of a self-assessment. To this end, the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board Dr. Kurt Bock met with all Supervisory Board members individually in June and July in preparation, and again in December 2020. Topics centered in particular on Supervisory  Board  meeting  preparation  and  agendas,  cooperation  with  the  Board  of Executive Directors, the quality of the information supplied to the Supervisory Board, cooperation  between  shareholder  and  employee  representatives,  the  tasks, composition and work of the committees, and the need for information and training for Supervisory Board members. The results of these dialogs, including suggestions to further improve the Supervisory Board's work, were presented by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 17, 2020, and thoroughly discussed by the members of the Supervisory Board. Overall, its members rated the Supervisory Board's activity as efficient.\n\nIndependent of the efficiency review of the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee also  conducted  a  self-assessment  of  its  activities  in  2020  based  on  individual discussions between the chair of the Audit Committee and all members of the Audit Committee. Material subjects were the topics addressed by the committee, the number, organization and content of meetings, the depth and quality of discussions, and the supply of information as the basis of the committee's work. The Audit Committee discussed the results of the questionnaire and detailed suggestions at its meeting on December  16, 2020. On this basis, the members judged the Audit Committee's work to be efficient and appropriate.\n\n## Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKPMG  AG  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft,  the  auditor  elected  by  the  Annual Shareholders'  Meeting  for  the  2020  reporting  year,  has  audited  the  Financial\n\nStatements of BASF SE and the BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and the additional requirements that must be applied in accordance with section 315e(1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), including the Management's Report and the accounting records from which they were prepared, and have approved them free of qualification. Furthermore, the auditor certified that the Board of Executive Directors had taken the measures incumbent on it under section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in an appropriate manner. In particular, it had instituted an appropriate information and monitoring system that fulfilled the requirements of the company and is applicable for the early identification of developments that could pose a risk to the continued existence of the BASF Group. The results of the audit as well as the procedure and material findings of the audit of the financial statements are presented in the Auditor's Report.\n\n- The Auditor's Report is rendered from page 214 onward\n\nFor more information on the auditor, see the Corporate Governance Report on page 176\n\nBeyond the statutory audit of the Financial Statements, KPMG also conducted, on behalf of the Supervisory Board, a substantive audit with limited assurance of the Nonfinancial Statements (NFSs) for BASF SE and the BASF Group, which are integral parts of the respective management's reports. On the basis of its audit, KPMG did not raise any objections to the nonfinancial reporting and the satisfaction of the relevant statutory requirements.\n\n## The assurance report issued by KPMG on the substantive audit of the NFS can be found at basf.com/nfs-audit-2020\n\nThe auditor's reports were sent in a timely manner to every member of the  Supervisory Board. The auditor attended the accounts review meeting of the Audit Committee on February 23, 2021, as well as the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 24, 2021, and reported on the procedure and material findings of its audit, including the key audit matters described in the Auditor's Report. The auditor also provided detailed explanations of the reports on the day before the accounts meeting of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the Financial Statements and Management's Report at its meeting on February 23, 2021, including the reports prepared by the auditor and the key audit matters specified in the Auditor's Report, and discussed them in detail with the auditor.

On this basis, the Supervisory Board has examined the Financial Statements and Management's Report of BASF SE for 2020, the proposal by the Board of Executive Directors for the appropriation of profit, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Report for 2020.

He had already announced his intention to resign from this position on his reelection by  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting  2019.  The  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting elected Dr. Kurt Bock to the Supervisory Board as his successor. The Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Kurt Bock as Chairman of the Supervisory Board immediately following  the  Annual  Shareholders'  Meeting.  The  Supervisory  Board  member Dr.  Alexander C. Karp left the Supervisory Board at the end of July 2020 after announcing his resignation for professional reasons. At the request of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, supported by the members of the Nomination Committee, the Ludwigshafen am Rhein local court ( Amtsgericht ) appointed Mr. Liming Chen to the Supervisory Board as a shareholder representative effective October 8, 2020. Liming Chen has many years of management experience at chemical and petrochemical companies. As Chairman of IBM Greater China Group, he also brings with him expertise in digitalization and is very familiar with the growth market of China. Liming Chen is considered independent based on the criteria used by the company to assess the independence of Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board satisfied itself that he can devote the necessary time to the BASF mandate.\n\nAccording to the Supervisory Board's assessment, the current members meet in full the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board with respect to the competence profile and the diversity concept.\n\nFor more information on changes within the Supervisory Board, see the Corporate Governance Report on page 173\n\nWe would like to thank the now retired members of the Supervisory Board, Dr. J\u00fcrgen Hambrecht  and  Dr.  Alexander  C.

In addition, we have audited the Group Management Report of BASF SE for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.\n\nIn accordance with German legal requirements we have not audited the  content  of  those  components  of  the  Group  Management Report specified in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nThe Group Management Report contains cross-references which are not intended to use by law and are identified as unaudited. In accordance  with  the  German  legal  requirements  we  have  not audited the content of those cross-references and the related referenced information.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- - the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and full IFRS and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and\n- -  the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the Group Management Report does not cover the content of those parts of the Group Management Report specified in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report. The Group Management Report contains cross-references which are not legally required and are identified  as  unaudited.  Our  opinion  does  not  cover  those cross-references and the referenced information.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Independent Auditor's  Report\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No. 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer, IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German  professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Recoverability of goodwill\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied, please refer to Note 1.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 232. The underlying assumptions used in the calculation and the disclosures on the impairment tests performed are included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 264 onward.\n\n## Financial statement risk\n\nIntangible  assets  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of BASF SE include goodwill in the amount of \u20ac6,959 million. Goodwill  accounts for 8.7% of total assets and thus has a material impact on the company's net assets. Goodwill must be tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. Due to the demand declines and the expected slow recovery in the automotive and aviation industries, the goodwill impairment testing resulted in impairments of \u20ac786 million in the reporting year in the cash-generating unit Surface Treatment in the Surface Technologies segment.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing is based on a range of discretionary assumptions. These include the forecasts for future cash inflows in the detailed planning period, the assumed growth rate for subsequent periods and the cost of capital. These assumptions have a material impact on the recoverability of goodwill. The growth forecasts of the Board of Executive Directors are associated with risks and can be revised in light of volatile raw materials prices and an instable macroeconomic environment.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that an impairment as of the balance sheet date is not identified or that an impairment as of the balance sheet date is not recognized with an appropriate amount. In addition, there is also a risk that the disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are not appropriate and complete.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe consulted our valuation specialists in order to assess, among other things, the appropriateness of the key assumptions as well as the Group's methods of calculation.\n\nWe examined the forecast for the expected business and earnings development in the detailed planning period, in particular with respect to whether the expected development of the relevant sales markets were given appropriate consideration and are consistent with the current budgets adopted by the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board. We compared internal growth forecasts with industry expectations and those of significant competitors and we assessed whether assumptions contained in the planning  regarding  the  future  development  of  margins  and  the amount of investments are appropriate. Our review of the appropriateness of the budgets adopted by the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board also included a comparison of planning in past business years with the results actually achieved. For selected units, we examined whether reasons for not reaching planned values in the past were given appropriate consideration in current planning, to the extent that this was relevant.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the assumed growth rate for the period following the detailed planning period on the basis of industry-specific and macroeconomic studies. We evaluated the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted cost of capital rates. To this end, we calculated our own expected values for the assumptions and data underlying the weighted cost of capital rates and compared these with the assumptions and data used.\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are appropriate and complete.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Independent Auditor's Report\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe assumptions and data underlying the calculations of the Board of Executive Directors are acceptable overall. The disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are appropriate and complete.\n\n## The acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied, please refer to Note 1.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 232. Information on the acquisition can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from page 235 onward.\n\n## Financial statement risk\n\nOn January 31, 2020, BASF acquired Solvay's global polyamide business. The total acquisition costs amounted to \u20ac1,319 million. Taking into account the acquired net assets of \u20ac1,299 million, goodwill amounted to \u20ac20 million.\n\nAs a rule, the acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities are recognized at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. To identify and assess the acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities, BASF consulted an external expert.\n\nIdentifying and assessing the acquired intangible assets are complex and based on the discretionary assumptions of the Board of Executive Directors. The key assumptions are the projected development of sales and margins in the acquired business, the license rates used in assessments based on the license price analogy method, the underlying useful lives of the identified assets and the cost of capital.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that the acquired intangible assets are inaccurately identified and/or valued incorrectly. In addition, there is also a risk that the disclosures in the Notes are not complete and appropriate.",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nFirst, we gained an understanding of the acquisition transaction by surveying employees in the accounting and controlling units as well as by evaluating the relevant contracts.\n\nWe assessed the competence, skills and objectivity of the independent expert contracted by BASF. Moreover, against the backdrop of our knowledge of BASF's business model, we evaluated the identification process for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for compliance with the requirements under IFRS 3. We examined the valuation methods used for compliance with the relevant accounting principles.\n\nWe consulted our valuation specialists in order to assess, among other things, the appropriateness of the identification and valuation methods as well as the assumptions used therein.\n\nWe discussed the expected development of sales and margins with the persons responsible for planning. Moreover, we evaluated the consistency of the assumptions with external market estimates. We compared the license rates used in the valuation of intangible assets with  reference  values  from  relevant  external  databases.  We evaluated the applied useful lives based on conversations with the client's experts and on the underlying product life cycles.\n\nMoreover, we satisfied ourselves of the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted cost of capital rates. We compared the assumptions and data underlying the cost of capital, in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and  publicly available data.\n\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the measurement, we reproduced selected calculations taking into account risk-based considerations. Finally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the Notes on the acquisition of the polyamide business are complete and  appropriate.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe underlying approach for the identification and valuation of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is appropriate and consistent with the applicable accounting principles.\n\nThe key assumptions and data are appropriate and the presentation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements is complete and appropriate.\n\n## Recoverability of the shareholding in Wintershall Dea\n\nFor information on the accounting principles applied and the underlying assumptions used in the calculation, please refer to Note 10.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 255.\n\n## Financial statement risk\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE, shares in Wintershall Dea in the amount of \u20ac10,199 million are reported under non-integral shareholdings accounted for using the equity method. The shareholding in Wintershall Dea accounts for 12.7% of total assets and thus has a material influence on the company's net assets.\n\nThe carrying amount of Wintershall Dea is calculated using the equity method. Impairments of \u20ac843 million on assets belonging to Wintershall Dea were taken into account. If, in addition to this, there are indicators for an impairment of an equity-accounted shareholding as a whole, the company determines the recoverable amount as of the reporting date and compares this with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the shareholding. The recoverable amount is determined using the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount, this results in an impairment.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Independent Auditor's Report\n\nThe calculation of the recoverable amount of the shareholding in the Wintershall Dea is complex and based on discretionary assumptions. These include, in particular, BASF's forecasts on production volumes of Wintershall Dea's oil and gas fields based on expected license terms and production profiles, the development of oil and gas prices, and the cost of capital.\n\nAfter carrying out impairment testing, the company did not identify a need for an impairment of its shareholding in Wintershall Dea as a whole.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that a decline in the value of the shareholding as a whole as of the balance sheet date was not identified. In addition, there is also the risk that the associated disclosures in the Notes are not appropriate and complete.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nFrom explanations provided by employees in accounting, we gained an understanding of the company's process to identify indicators for impairment as well as of the determination of the recoverable amount. In doing so, we assessed, among other things, whether the calculation  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  shareholding  in Winters hall Dea is consistent with the relevant accounting principles and whether the key assumptions made in this calculation are appropriate.\n\nWe discussed the projected development of production volumes and oil and gas prices with the persons responsible for planning. We evaluated the production profiles used in the measurement of the exploration and production business's assets, taking into account assessments by experts contracted by Wintershall Dea. In order to assess its suitability as a basis for calculation, we had the oil and gas price scenario used by the company explained to us. To assess its appropriateness, we compared the oil and gas price scenario used by BASF with the published forecasts of industry associations, analysts, international institutions and other market participants.",

The development of property, plant and equipment, including a list of the impairments, can be found in Note 15 from page 268 onward in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial statement risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, property, plant and equipment in the amount of \u20ac19,647 million were recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE. Depreciation and amortization of\n\nproperty plant and equipment in the 2020 business year included impairments of \u20ac2,059 million. These impairments had a material impact on the group's net assets and results of operations in the business year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIf there are indications for an impairment of assets, the company determines the recoverable amount as of the balance sheet date and compares this with the respective carrying amount. If the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount, an impairment must be recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the shareholding. The recoverable amount is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In general, the determination of the recoverable amount takes place at the level of cash-generating units.\n\nImpairment testing of assets using the discounted cash flow method is complex and based on a range of discretionary assumptions. These include, in particular, the projected cash flows as well as the cost of capital rates used.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that an impairment as of the  balance  sheet  date  is  not  recognized  with  an  appropriate amount. In addition, there is also a risk that the disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are not appropriate and complete.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nIn a first step, we evaluated the design and establishment of controls put in place by BASF for the valuation of property, plant and equipment. In discussions with representatives of the group from corporate management, accounting and controlling, we gained an understanding of the specific valuation risks identified by the company and we learned about the approaches used by the company to determine impairments.\n\nWith regard to the valuation model, we assessed whether the valuation methodology is consistent with the relevant valuation principles and we confirmed the mathematical accuracy via modeling. In con-\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Independent Auditor's Report\n\nsultation with our valuation specialists, we satisfied ourselves of the methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the appropriateness of the weighted cost of capital rates used. To this end, we calculated our own expected values for the assumptions and data underlying the weighted cost of capital rates and compared these with the assumptions and data used.\n\nIn addition, we evaluated whether the assumptions and forecasts of future cash flows underlying the valuations were based on appropriate and acceptable assumptions. To this end, we sought explanations of these assumptions from the persons responsible for planning and we evaluated the effects of the assumptions on the planning of future cash flows. Through comparisons to other forecasts internally available within the company, we ascertained their consistency. If the identified impairments resulted from changes in the market environment, we assessed the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions about expected cash flows and compared these with external market estimates. We then discussed the calculated valuation results with BASF and carried out the resulting accounting treatment of the valuation results.\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are appropriate and complete.",

The assumptions and data used by the group are appropriate. The disclosures in the Notes on the key assumptions are appropriate and complete.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other infor-mation. The other information comprises the following components of the Group Management Report, whose content was not audited:\n\n- - the information of the integrated non-financial statement which is identified as unaudited\n- - the corporate governance statement in the section Corporate Governance of the Group Management Report, and\n- - the disclosures which are not normally part of the Group Management Report and which are identified as unaudited.\n\nAdditionally, the other Information comprises the remaining parts of the BASF Report 2020.\n\nThe other Information does not comprise the Consolidated Financial Statements, the audited parts of the Group Management Report and our auditor's report.\n\nOur opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- - is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the Group Management Report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we conclude, based on the work we have conducted, that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are obligated to report on this fact. We do not have anything to report in this\n\nregard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the prepa ra tion of the Consolidated Financial Statements that comply, in all material  respects,  with  IFRSs  as  adopted  by  the  EU  and  the additional require ments of German commercial law pursuant to Section  315e  (1) HGB and full IFRS and that the Consolidated Financial Statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of Consolidated Financial  Statements  that  are  free  from  material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that, as a whole,\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Independent Auditor's Report\n\nprovides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Board of Executive Directors is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Group Management  Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the Group Management Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally  Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic",

We also:\n\n- - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the Group Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Board of Executive Directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors and related disclosures.\n- - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Executive Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  in  the  Group  Management Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  present  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the  additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and full IFRS.\n- - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n- - Evaluate the consistency of the Group Management Report with the Consolidated Financial Statements, its conformity with law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- - Perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information presented by the Board of Executive Directors in the Group Management Report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Board of Executive Directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the  assumptions  used  as  a  basis.  There  is  a  substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Independent Auditor's Report\n\nWe also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.",

Its official  address  is  Carl-Bosch-Str.  38,  67056  Ludwigshafen  am Rhein, Germany.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of BASF SE as of December  31, 2020, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and section  315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). IFRSs are generally only applied after they have been endorsed by the European Union. For the 2020 fiscal year, all of the binding IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) were applied. The Consolidated Financial Statements are for the period  from  January  1,  2020  to  December  31,  2020  and  are presented in euros. They are written in German and translated into English. All amounts, including the figures for previous years, are given in million euros unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe individual financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business continuity is assumed regardless of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The accounting policies applied are largely the same as those used in 2019.\n\nOne change arose with respect to the presentation of some of the investments accounted for using the equity method that are not an integral  part  of  the  BASF  Group.  Income  from  non- integral companies accounted for using the equity method is no longer presented in the BASF Group's EBIT, but under net income from shareholdings.  Due  to  its  increased  significance,  this  will  be presented as a separate subtotal within income before income taxes and is no longer part of the financial result. Integral and non-integral investments accounted for using the equity method will also be shown separately in the balance sheet. The statement of income for 2019 has been restated accordingly.\n\n- For more information, see Note 1.3 from page 230 onward and Note 10 from page 253 onward\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the Board of Executive Directors prepared the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  submitted  them  to  the Supervisory Board for review and approval, and released them for publication.\n\n## 1.2 Changes in accounting principles\n\n## Accounting policies applied for the first time in 2020\n\n## Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards\n\nThe  amendments  update  references  to  and  quotes  from  the Conceptual Framework and were endorsed by the E.U. on November  29,  2019.  The  revised  Conceptual  Framework  issued  on March 29, 2018 replaces the previous Conceptual Framework from 2010. The main changes primarily relate to the definition, recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, as well as the differentiation  between  income  and  expense  and  other  comprehensive income.  They  had  no  material  effect  on  BASF's  Consolidated Financial  Statements.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nThe amendments issued by the IASB on October 31, 2018 provide a uniform and more precise definition of the materiality of information provided in the financial statements, together with accompanying examples.  In  this  connection,  the  definitions  in  the  Conceptual Framework, IAS 1, IAS 8 and the IFRS Practice Statement 2 (Making Materiality Judgements) were harmonized. The amendments were endorsed by the E.U. on November 29, 2019. They had no material effect on the reporting of BASF.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 on September  26, 2019, completing Phase  1 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform project. The amendments relate to existing uncertainties  surrounding  the  interest  rate  benchmark  reform. According  to  the  original  hedge  accounting  policies,  pending adjustments to interest rate benchmarks would, in many cases, have resulted in an end to hedging relationships. The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 ensure the continuity of hedging relationships despite existing uncertainties regarding interest rate benchmarks, for example by defining that the highly probable requirement is always considered to be met. In connection with the amendments to IFRS  9 and IAS  39, disclosure requirements were added to IFRS  7. The amendments were endorsed by the E.U. on January 15, 2020. This change did not have a material impact on BASF as no hedging relationships affected by interest rate benchmarks were subject to hedge accounting.",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nThe  amendments  issued  on  October  22,  2018  specify  that  a business is a set of activities and assets with at least one input and one substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Outputs are defined as the provision of goods and services to customers. The existing reference to cost reduction  as  a  characteristic  of  business  combinations  was removed. In addition, the new provisions also contain an optional concentration test designed to simplify identification of a business. The modified definition was endorsed by the E.U. on April 21, 2020. These amendments had no material effect on the reporting of BASF.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 16 - Leases Relating to CoronavirusRelated Rent Concessions\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 aimed at simplifying  lessees'  accounting  of  concessions,  such  as deferments of rent payment or deductions in rent prices, which are granted as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic. If certain requirements are met, lessees may forego the determination of whether  a  coronavirus-related rent concession  presents  a modification  of  the  lease  agreement.  These  amendments  were endorsed by the E.U. on October 9, 2020. They had no material effect on BASF.\n\n## IFRSs and IFRICs not yet to be considered but already endorsed by the E.U.\n\nThe effects on the BASF Group financial statements of the IFRSs and IFRICs not yet in force in 2020 but already endorsed by the European Union were reviewed and are explained below. BASF currently assumes that they will have no material effect on the Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  It  does  not  plan  on  early adoption of these amendments.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts - Extension of Temporary Exemption from Application of IFRS 9\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 4 issued on June  25,  2020 are aligned with the two-year postponement of the date on which IFRS 17 will come into force to reporting periods beginning on or after January  1,  2023. They include an analog extension of the temporary exemption period for certain insurance companies from application of IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, requiring these insurance companies to apply IFRS 9 for the first time in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The amendments were endorsed by the E.U. on December 15, 2020 and are to be applied for the first time on or after January 1, 2021.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and IFRS 16 - Leases - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nThe amendments from phase 2 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, which were issued on August  27, 2020, are intended to simplify accounting during the IBOR reform. They supplement the requirements  from  the  first  phase  and  generally  deal  with  the replacement of one benchmark interest rate with another. With respect to the presentation of financial instruments, it was clarified that in the case of changes to contractual cash flows, the carrying amount of financial instruments is not to be adjusted or derecognized. Under certain conditions, the effective interest rate can be changed  to  reflect  the  change  in  the  alternative  interest  rate benchmark. Similarly, with respect to the accounting treatment of hedging transactions, under certain conditions, it is not necessary to end a hedge accounting relationship designated for hedge accounting purposes due to changes arising from the IBOR reform. In addition, minor changes to IFRS 16 and IFRS 4 as well as additional IFRS  7 disclosure requirements were adopted. The amendments were endorsed by the E.U. on January 13, 2021 and will come into force for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## IFRSs and IFRICs not yet to be considered and not yet endorsed by the E.U.\n\nThe IASB issued further amendments to standards and interpretations which are still subject to E.U. endorsement and whose application is not yet mandatory. These amendments are unlikely to have a material impact on the reporting of BASF. BASF does not plan on early adoption of these amendments.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification of Liabilities\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 on January  23,  2020. The amendments pertain to a limited modification of the relevant criteria used to classify liabilities as current or noncurrent. They specify that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the company's rights as of the balance sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability by a minimum of 12 months after the end of the reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is classified as noncurrent. Otherwise, it is classified as current. Classification is irrespective of management's expectations and of possible events after the  balance sheet date. It also specifies that settlement of a liability is defined as the repayment of a liability using cash, other economic resources or a company's own equity instruments. The IASB issued a further amendment on July 15, 2020 whereby the date of initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will be postponed by one year to January 1, 2023 - subject to endorsement by the E.U.",

Furthermore, an additional provision will be added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards. The content of the accounting rules for business combinations will not change.\n\nThe amendments to IAS  16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced while the asset is being  brought  to  its  location  and  into  working  order  must  be recognized with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 37 pertain to the definition of the costs a company includes when determining if a contract will cause losses. Accordingly,  settlement  costs  are  all  costs  that  would  not  be incurred without the contract (incremental cost) as well as other costs directly attributable to the contract.\n\nThe annual improvements to IFRS 2018-2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be included in the '10% test' for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor amendments  to  IFRS  1  -  First-Time  Adoption  of  International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS  41 - Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 - Leases.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17\n\nOn March 18, 2020, the IASB decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. It has not yet been endorsed by the E.U. IFRS 17 was issued on May 18, 2017 and provides requirements on recognition, measurement and presentation of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Making Materiality Judgements\n\nThe  amendments  were  issued  on  February  12,  2021.  The amendments to IAS 1 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies - requires that only material accounting policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future. Accounting policy information is material if it relates to material transactions or events and there is a reason to consider materiality  (for  example  a  change  in  accounting  policy).  The guidelines in IFRS Practice Statement 2 were accordingly adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023 - subject to endorsement by the E.U. The effect on the reporting of BASF will be examined.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\n\nThe amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement  uncertainty'. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023 - subject to endorsement by the E.U. The effect on the reporting of BASF will be examined.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## 1.3 Group accounting principles\n\nScope of consolidation: The scope of consolidation is based on the application of the standards IFRS 10 and 11.\n\nAccording to IFRS 10, a group consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries  controlled  by  the  parent.  'Control'  of  an  investee assumes the simultaneous fulfillment of the following three criteria:\n\n- - The  parent  company  holds  decision-making  power  over  the relevant activities of the investee\n- - The  parent  company  has  rights  to  variable  returns  from  the investee\n- - The parent company can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns\n\nBased on corporate governance and any additional agreements, companies are analyzed for their relevant activities and variable returns, and the link between the variable returns and the extent to which their relevant activities could be influenced.\n\nAccording  to  IFRS  11,  which  regulates  the  accounting  of  joint arrangements, a distinction must be made between joint ventures and joint operations. In the case of a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of a legally independent company have rights to the net assets of that arrangement. In joint operations, the parties that have joint control have direct rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This requirement is particularly fulfilled if the production output of the joint arrangement is almost entirely transferred to the partners, through which the partners guarantee the joint arrangements' ongoing financing.\n\nCompanies whose corporate governance structures classify them as joint arrangements are analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for joint ventures or joint operations in accordance with IFRS 11. Should the arrangement be structured through a separate vehicle, its legal form, contractual arrangements and all other facts and circumstances are reviewed.",

        "page_content": "In addition to BASF  SE, the Consolidated Financial Statements include  all  material  subsidiaries  on  a  fully  consolidated  and  all material joint operations on a proportionally consolidated basis. Companies whose business is dormant or of low volume, and are of minor importance for the presentation of a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations, are not consolidated, but rather are reported under other shareholdings. These companies are carried at amortized cost and are written down in the case of an impairment. The aggregate assets and  equity of these companies amount to less than 1% of the corresponding value at Group level.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the equity  method in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Associated companies are entities that are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or joint operations, and over whose operating and financial policies  significant  influence  can  be  exercised.  In  general,  this applies to companies in which BASF has an investment of between 20% and 50%. Associated companies and joint ventures that are fully or predominantly allocated to operating divisions are classified as integral because they are integrated into the value chain of the respective division; are controlled by the divisions; and they  generate their income in close cooperation with the other assets of the BASF Group and/or of these divisions. Equity-accounted income from integral joint ventures or associated companies is reported as part of income from operations (EBIT).\n\nEquity-accounted  income  from  non-integral  joint  ventures  or associated companies is reported in net income from shareholdings.\n\n- For more information, see Note 10 from page 253 onward\n\nConsolidation  methods: Assets  and  liabilities  of  consolidated companies are uniformly recognized and measured in accordance with the principles described herein. For companies accounted for using  the  equity  method,  material  deviations  in  measurement resulting from the application of other accounting principles are adjusted  for.\n\nTransactions between  consolidated  companies  as  well  as intercompany  profits  resulting  from  trade  between  consolidated companies are eliminated in full. Sales and material other balances and transactions between joint operations and fully consolidated Group  companies  are  eliminated.  Material  intercompany  profits related to companies accounted for using the equity method are eliminated.\n\nCapital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date according to the purchase method. Initially, all assets, liabilities and additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are measured at fair value. Subsequently, the cost of acquiring the company is  compared with  the  proportional  share  of  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets acquired.  The  resulting  positive  differences  are  capitalized  as goodwill.  Negative  differences  are  reviewed  once  more,  then recognized directly in the income statement.\n\nThe incidental acquisition costs of a business combination are recognized in the income statement under other operating expenses.\n\nForeign  currency  translation: The  cost  of  assets  acquired  in foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are determined by the exchange rate on the date the transaction is recognized. Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Changes in assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency translation are recognized in the income statement and reported under other operating income or expenses, other financial result, and in the case of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in other comprehensive income.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nTranslation  of  foreign  currency  financial  statements: The translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the consolidated companies. For companies whose  functional  currency  is  not  the  euro,  translation  into  the reporting currency is based on the closing rate method: Balance sheet items are translated into euros using closing rates on the balance sheet date; expenses and income are translated into euros at  monthly  average  rates  and  accumulated  for  the  year.  The difference between a company's translated equity at historical rates at the time of acquisition or retention and its equity at closing rates on the  balance sheet date is reported under other comprehensive income (translation adjustments) and is recognized in the income statement only upon the company's disposal.\n\nFor certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S. dollar zone, the euro or U.S. dollar is the functional currency. In such cases, financial statements prepared in the local currency are translated into the functional currency using the temporal method: All nonmonetary assets and related depreciation and amortization as well as equity are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  applying  to  the  respective transactions. All other balance sheet items are translated using closing rates on the balance sheet date; other expenses and income are translated at monthly average rates. The resulting translation differences are recognized in the income statement under other operating income or expenses. If necessary, financial statements in the functional currency are translated into the presentation currency according to the closing rate method.",

The fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition, as well as the useful lives of the acquired assets, are determined on the basis of assumptions.  Measurement  is  largely  based  on  projected  cash flows.  Actual  cash  flows  can  deviate  significantly  from  those. Independent external appraisals are typically used for the purchase price allocation of material business combinations. Valuations in the course of business combinations are based on existing information as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Groups of assets and liabilities held for sale (disposal groups):\n\nThese  comprise  those  assets  and  directly  associated  liabilities shown separately on the balance sheet whose sale in the context of a single transaction is highly probable. A transaction is assumed to be highly probable if there are no significant risks of completion of the transaction, which usually requires the conclusion of binding contracts. The assets and liabilities of disposal groups are recognized at the lower of the sum of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell; this does not apply to assets that do not fall under the valuation principles of IFRS 5. Depreciation of noncurrent assets and the use of the equity method are suspended.\n\nDiscontinued operations: These are classified as held for sale and are presented as discontinued operations in BASF's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS 5. Until closing, the income after taxes of discontinued operations is shown in income after taxes of the BASF Group as a separate item (income after taxes from discontinued operations). In addition, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are reclassified to a disposal group (assets or liabilities of disposal groups). The statement of cash flows is not restated. The activities of discontinued operations are not allocated to any reportable segment in financial reporting.\n\n- For more information, see Note 3 from page 235 onward and Note 5 from page 241 onward\n\n## Use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe carrying amount of assets, liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and other financial obligations reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on the use of estimates, assumptions and discretionary scope. Specific estimates or assumptions used in individual accounting or valuation methods are disclosed in their respective  sections  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. They are based on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date and thus affect the amounts of income and expenses  shown  for  the  reporting  periods  presented.  These assumptions primarily relate to the determination of discounted\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\ncash flows in the context of impairment tests and purchase price allocations;  the  useful  lives  of  depreciable  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets; the carrying amount of shareholdings; and the measurement of provisions for items such as employee benefits, warranties, trade discounts, environmental protection and taxes.  Although  uncertainty  is  appropriately  incorporated  in  the valuation factors, actual results can differ from these estimates.\n\nImpairment  tests on  assets  are  carried  out  whenever  certain triggering events indicate potential impairment. External triggering events  include,  for  example,  changes  in  customer  industries, technologies  used  and  economic  downturns.  Internal  triggering events for an impairment test include lower product profitability, planned  restructuring  measures  or  physical  damage  to  assets. Impairment tests entail a comparison of the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. As a rule, value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The estimation of cash flows and the assumptions used consider all information available  on  the  respective  balance  sheet  date  on  the  future development of the operating business. Actual future developments may vary. Impairment testing relies upon the cash-generating unit's long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on macroeconomic trends. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the capital asset pricing model plays an important role in impairment testing. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, the market risk  premium and  an  industry-specific  spread  for  the  credit  risk.  Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for the detailed planning period and the terminal growth rates used. Fair value less costs to sell must be determined for the impairment test of disposal groups; specific assumptions relating to the respective transaction must be made for this determination.\n\nFor more information, see Note 3 from page 235 onward and Note 14 from page 264 onward",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\nAn impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The impaired asset (excluding goodwill) is written down by the amount of the difference between these amounts.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating units. At BASF, these largely correspond to the business units, or in  individual cases the divisions. If there is a need for impairment, the existing goodwill is, if necessary, completely written off as a first step. If there is further need for impairment, this is allocated to the remaining assets  of  the  cash-generating  unit.  Goodwill  impairments  are reported under other operating expenses.\n\nFor planning purposes, BASF assumes an oil price of $50/bbl (Brent) and for gas of approximately \u20ac14/MWh (roughly $5/mmBtu) in 2021.\n\n## 2 Scope of consolidation\n\n## 2.1 Changes in scope of consolidation\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, a total of 282 companies were included, either proportionally or fully, in the scope of consolidation of the Consolidated Financial Statements (December 31, 2019: 302). Of these, 43 companies were first-time consolidations (2019: seven). Since the beginning of 2020, a total of 63 companies (2019: 36) were  deconsolidated  due  to  divestiture,  merger,  liquidation  or immateriality.\n\nFirst-time consolidations in 2020 comprised:\n\n- - Four acquired companies with headquarters in Europe (one of those in Germany), one in North America, one in South America, Africa, Middle East, and three in Asia Pacific\n- - One newly established company with headquarters in Europe, two newly established companies in Asia Pacific, and one newly established company with headquarters in South America, Africa, Middle East\n- - Eleven companies that had not been consolidated at the time of initial  inclusion  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nEurope, six in North America, 11 in Asia Pacific and two in South America, Africa, Middle East\n\nFirst-time consolidations in 2019 comprised:\n\n- - One acquired company with headquarters in Europe\n- - One newly established company with headquarters in Asia Pacific\n- - Five companies that had not been consolidated at the time of initial inclusion in the Consolidated Financial Statements with headquarters in Europe (three, two of those in Germany) and in Asia Pacific (two)\n\nTwelve companies were added to the scope of consolidation in 2020 as part of the acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business.\n\nFifty-four  companies  were  deconsolidated  as  a  result  of  the divestiture of construction chemicals activities in 2020.\n\nA  list  of  the  companies  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements  and  of  all  companies  in  which  BASF  SE  has  a shareholding  as  required  by  section  313(2)  of  the  German Commercial Code (HGB) is provided in the list of shares held.\n\n- For more information, see Note 4 on page 241\n- For more information, see basf.com/en/corporategovernance\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\n|                                      | Europe   | Of which  Germany   | North  America   | Asia Pacific   | South America,   Africa,   Middle East   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| As of January 1                      | 152      | 50                  | 46               | 74             | 30                                       | 302    | 331    |\n| of which proportionally consolidated | 5        | -                   | -                | 2              | -                                        | 7      | 8      |\n| First-time consolidations            | 16       | 1                   | 7                | 16             | 4                                        | 43     | 7      |\n| of which proportionally consolidated | 2        | -                   | -                | -              | -                                        | 2      | -      |\n| Deconsolidations                     | 25       | 6                   | 14               | 14             | 10                                       | 63     | 36     |\n| of which proportionally consolidated | -        | -                   | -                | -              | -                                        | -      | 1      |\n| As of December 31                    | 143      | 45                  | 39               | 76             | 24                                       | 282    | 302    |\n| of which proportionally consolidated | 7        | -                   | -                | 2              | -                                        | 9      | 7      |",

The  companies sell their products directly to the partners. The partners ensure ongoing financing of the companies by purchasing the  production. The companies were therefore classified as joint operations in accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAO Achimgaz, Novy Urengoy, Russia, which was jointly operated with Gazprom for the production of natural gas and condensate, was derecognized in connection with the deconsolidation of the oil and gas business as of April 30, 2019.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## 2.3 Joint ventures and associated companies\n\nCompanies over which BASF exercises a significant influence or which are jointly controlled with a partner and not classified as a joint operation are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 (associated companies) and IFRS 11 (joint ventures).\n\nSince 2020, a distinction between shareholdings accounted for using  the  equity  method  in  integral  and  those  in  non-integral companies has been made.\n\nThe material equity-accounted shareholding that has been classified as integral is BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China, in which BASF and Sinopec each hold 50%, and which operates the  Verbund site in Nanjing.\n\nThe material non-integral shareholding is Wintershall Dea GmbH, Kassel/Hamburg,  Germany.  The  company,  which  has  been  in existence since May 1, 2019 and in which BASF holds 72.7%, is considered a joint venture because BASF and its partner LetterOne defined the decision-making processes in the governing bodies as such that neither party alone can control the relevant activities.\n\nStahl Lux 2 S.A., Luxembourg (BASF interest: 16.32%) is classified as  an  associated  company  as  BASF  can  exercise  significant influence over the company in a number of relevant board decisions.\n\n- For more information, see BASF Group list of shares held under basf.com/en/corporategovernance",

        "page_content": "## 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## 3 Acquisitions and divestitures\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn 2020, BASF acquired the following activity:\n\n- - BASF  closed  the  acquisition  of  Solvay's  polyamide  business (PA 6.6) on January 31, 2020. Domo Chemicals, Leuna,  Germany, was approved by the E.U. Commission as the buyer of the European polyamide business, which could not be acquired by BASF  under  the  conditions  imposed  by  the  authorities.  The transaction broadens BASF's polyamide capabilities with innovative products. It also enhances the company's access to growth markets in Asia as well as in North and South America. Through the backward integration into the key raw material adiponitrile (ADN), BASF is now integrated along the entire polyamide 6.6 value chain and can improve supply reliability. The purchase price of the business acquired by BASF was \u20ac1.319 million on a cash and debt-free basis. Of that amount, \u20ac1,308 million was already cash effective. The business was integrated into the Performance Materials  and  Monomers  divisions.  The  transaction  between Solvay and BASF included eight production sites in Germany, France, China, India, South Korea, Brazil and Mexico, as well as research and development and technical consultation centers in Asia and the Americas. It also included two  shareholdings in France, which are accounted for as joint  operations: The 50% interest in Butachimie SNC, Chalamp\u00e9, France, to produce ADN and hexamethylenediamine, and the 51% interest in the newly established Alsachimie S.A.S.,  Chalamp\u00e9, France, to produce adipic acid. With the acquisition, around 700 Solvay employees were transferred to BASF.  Furthermore, some 1,000 employees of the Alsachimie S.A.S. and Butachimie SNC joint operations are to be included on a pro rata basis by BASF. The purchase price allocation considers all the facts and circumstances prevailing as of the date of acquisition that were known prior to the preparation of these financial statements. Goodwill of \u20ac20 million resulted in particular from sales synergies. The businesses acquired from Solvay accounted for \u20ac678 million of sales revenue and  -\u20ac114 mil-\n\nm operations in the 2020 fiscal year. Including Solvay's businesses and assets in BASF's Consolidated Financial Statements as of January 1, 2020 would have resulted in a sales revenue  contribution of \u20ac792 million and in income from operations of -\u20ac104 million. These pro forma data are for comparison purposes.  They  are  not  necessarily  values  that  would  have resulted had the transaction taken place as of January 1, 2020 and are not  suitable for forecasting future developments or events. The  majority of  total goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\n- In 2019, BASF acquired the following activity:\n- - BASF  acquired  100%  of  shares  in  Isobionics  B.V.,  Geleen, Netherlands, on September  26, 2019. The company develops and produces a wide range of natural flavors and fragrances with a focus on citrus oil components. This transaction strengthened the Nutrition  & Health division. The preliminary purchase price allocation  was  immaterially  revised  in  2020,  which  led  to  an increase in goodwill of \u20ac1 million.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Purchase price allocation for the acquisition of assets and liabilities from Solvay\n\nMillion \u20ac\n\n|                                                                | Fair value as of  date of acquisition   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Goodwill                                                       | 20                                      |\n| Other intangible assets                                        | 670                                     |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                  | 559                                     |\n| Integral investments accounted for using the equity method     | -                                       |\n| Non-integral investments accounted for using the equity method | -                                       |\n| Other financial assets                                         | -                                       |\n| Deferred taxes                                                 | 105                                     |\n| Other receivables and miscellaneous assets                     | 3                                       |\n| Noncurrent assets                                              | 1,357                                   |\n| Inventories                                                    | 156                                     |\n| Accounts receivable, trade                                     | 165                                     |\n| Other receivables and miscellaneous assets                     | 160                                     |\n| Marketable securities                                          | -                                       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                      | 68                                      |\n| Current assets                                                 | 549                                     |\n| Total assets                                                   | 1,906                                   |\n| Provisions for pensions and similar obligations                | 25                                      |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                       | 172                                     |\n| Tax provisions                                                 | -                                       |\n| Other provisions                                               | 11                                      |\n| Financial indebtedness                                         | -                                       |\n| Other liabilities                                              | 45                                      |\n| Noncurrent liabilities                                         | 253                                     |\n| Accounts payable, trade                                        | 273                                     |\n| Provisions                                                     | 2                                       |\n| Tax liabilities                                                | 28                                      |\n| Financial indebtedness                                         | 8                                       |\n| Other liabilities                                              | 23                                      |\n| Current liabilities                                            | 334                                     |\n| Total liabilities                                              | 587                                     |\n| Total purchase price                                           | 1,319                                   |",

The purchase price on a cash and debt-free basis was \u20ac3.17 billion. The sale covered approximately 7,500 employees as well as production sites and sales offices in more than 60 countries of the former Construction Chemicals division. From the signing of the agreement on  December 21, 2019 until the closing of the transaction, BASF's construction chemicals business was reported as a discontinued operation.\n- The effects of the disposal are disclosed in the Notes under 'Discontinued operations' on page 239\n\nIn 2019, BASF sold the following activities:\n\n- - On  January  31,  2019,  following  the  approval  of  all  relevant authorities, BASF and Solenis had concluded the transfer of BASF's paper and water chemicals business to Solenis. Since February 1, 2019, the combined company has operated under the name Solenis UK International Ltd., London, United Kingdom, and offers bundled sales, service and production capabilities across the globe. BASF holds a 49% share in the combined entity; 51% of the shares are held by funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier  & Rice, and by Solenis management. The transaction included production sites and plants of BASF's paper and water chemicals business in Bradford and Grimsby, England; Suffolk, Virginia;  Altamira,  Mexico;  Ankleshwar,  India;  and  Kwinana, Australia. The divestiture affected the Performance Chemicals division.\n- - BASF and LetterOne completed the merger of Wintershall and DEA on April  30, 2019. On September  27, 2018, BASF and LetterOne had signed a transaction agreement to merge their respective oil and gas businesses in a joint venture, creating a leading  independent  European  exploration  and  production company with international operations in core regions. LetterOne contributed all shares in DEA Deutsche Erd\u00f6l AG to Wintershall\n\nHolding  GmbH  and  received  new  shares  in  the  latter.  The company was renamed Wintershall Dea GmbH, Kassel/Hamburg. Including preference shares, BASF has a shareholding of 72.7% in Wintershall Dea GmbH. No later than 36 months after closing but in all cases before an IPO, these preference shares will be converted into ordinary shares in Wintershall Dea GmbH. From the signing of the agreement in September 2018 until the closing of the merger, BASF's oil and gas business was reported as a discontinued  operation.  Since  the  merger,  BASF's  interest  in Wintershall Dea GmbH has been accounted for as a non-integral shareholding using the equity method. The gain from the  transition from full consolidation to the equity method was reported in income after taxes from discontinued operations.\n\n- - On December 6, 2019, BASF India Limited sold its stilbene-based optical brightening agents (OBA) business for paper and powder detergent applications to Archroma India Private Limited,  Mumbai, India.

The business is allocated to the Dispersions & Pigments division. Impairment tests were conducted for the disposal group for the pigments business  as  of  December  31,  2019  and  June  30,  2020.  In accordance  with IFRS 5, the fair value less costs to sell must be used as the recoverable amount and compared  with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount was determined as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020 by discounting the respective expected cash flows the planned transaction closing, including income from the sale, at a discount rate after taxes of 7.98%. This resulted in the need for impairment in the amount of \u20ac73 million as of December 31, 2019 and, additionally, of \u20ac66  million as of June 30, 2020, which was allocated to the goodwill of the  disposal group for the pigments business. The impairment test as of December 31, 2020 revealed no need for a valuation adjustment.\n\nThe values for the disposal group are presented in the following table.\n\nOther  comprehensive  income  included  -\u20ac116  million  (2019: -\u20ac79 million) as of December 31, 2020 attributable to the business to be sold.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Pigments business disposal group\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                      | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Balance Sheet                                                  |                     |                     |\n| Goodwill                                                       | -243                | -336                |\n| Other intangible assets                                        | -21                 | -22                 |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                  | -290                | -266                |\n| Integral investments accounted for using the equity method     | -                   | -                   |\n| Non-integral investments accounted for using the equity method | -64                 | -65                 |\n| Other financial assets                                         | -8                  | -8                  |\n| Deferred tax assets                                            | -51                 | -58                 |\n| Other receivables and miscellaneous assets                     | -4                  | -2                  |\n| Noncurrent assets                                              | -681                | -757                |\n| Inventories                                                    | -351                | -383                |\n| Accounts receivable, trade                                     | -112                | -109                |\n| Other receivables and miscellaneous assets                     | -33                 | -22                 |\n| Marketable securities                                          | -                   | -                   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                      | -5                  | -7                  |\n| Current assets                                                 | -501                | -521                |\n| Assets of the disposal group                                   | 1,182               | 1,278               |\n| Provisions for pensions and similar obligations                | -202                | -213                |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                       | -9                  | -17                 |\n| Tax provisions                                                 | -                   | -                   |\n| Other provisions                                               | -9                  | -9                  |\n| Financial indebtedness                                         | -                   | -                   |\n| Other liabilities                                              | -8                  | -15                 |\n| Noncurrent liabilities                                         | -228                | -254                |\n| Accounts payable, trade                                        | -53                 | -51                 |\n| Provisions                                                     | -15                 | -20                 |\n| Tax liabilities                                                | -5                  | -6                  |\n| Financial indebtedness                                         | -                   | -                   |\n| Other liabilities                                              | -40                 | -27                 |\n| Current liabilities                                            | -113                | -104                |\n| Liabilities of the disposal group                              | 341                 | 358                 |\n| Net assets                                                     | 841                 | 920                 |",

Furthermore, it focuses on the development of specific key technologies, which are of central importance for the divisions.\n- - Results from currency translation that are not allocated to the segments; earnings from the hedging of raw materials prices and foreign currency exchange risks; and gains and losses from the long-term incentive programs (LTI programs).\n- - Remanent fixed costs resulting from organizational changes or restructuring; function and region-related restructuring costs not allocated to a division; idle capacity costs from internal human resource  platforms;  and  consolidation  effects  that  cannot  be allocated to the divisions.\n\n## Income from operations (EBIT) of Other\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                        |        |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                  | 2020   | 2019 a |\n| Costs for cross-divisional corporate research                    | -364   | -397   |\n| Costs of corporate headquarters                                  | -214   | -231   |\n| Other businesses                                                 | 169    | 164    |\n| Foreign currency results, hedging and other measurement  effects | -59    | -89    |\n| Miscellaneous income and expenses                                | -735   | 35     |\n| Income from operations of Other                                  | -1,203 | -518   |\n\n- a The 2019 figures have been restated to reflect the reclassification of income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method to net income from shareholdings.\n\nIncome from operations of Other declined by \u20ac685 million year on year, from -\u20ac518 million to -\u20ac1,203 million. The costs for crossdivisional  corporate  research decreased  by  \u20ac33  million  to -\u20ac364  million, and the costs of corporate headquarters were \u20ac17 million lower at -\u20ac214 million. Income from other businesses rose by \u20ac5 million to \u20ac169 million. The line item foreign currency results, hedging and other measurement effects improved by \u20ac30  million to -\u20ac59  million. In addition to currency effects, the improvement was due mainly to earnings from hedging transactions. The line item miscellaneous income and expenses decreased by -\u20ac770 million from \u20ac35  million to -\u20ac735  million. This was due especially to expenses related to the realignment of the Global Business Services unit and to positive effects in 2019 primarily from adjustments to pension benefits in the United States and gains from the sale of BASF's share of the Klybeck site in Basel, Switzerland.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nThe same accounting rules are used for segment reporting as those used for the Group, which are presented in these Notes. Transfers between  the  segments  are  generally  executed  at  adjusted market-based prices, taking into account the higher cost efficiency and lower risk of intragroup transactions. Assets, as well as their depreciation and amortization, are allocated to the segments based on economic control. Assets used by more than one segment are allocated based on the percentage of usage.\n\nIncome from operations (EBIT) before special items is used for the internal  steering  of  the  segments  and  complements  the  key management indicator, ROCE. It is determined based on EBIT, which is calculated from gross profit on sales, selling expenses, general  administrative  expenses,  research  and  development expenses, other operating income and expenses, and income from integral  companies  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method.  To calculate EBIT before special items, this figure is then adjusted for special items. Special items arise from the integration of acquired businesses,  restructuring  costs,  certain  impairments,  gains  or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of integral investments accounted for using the equity method, and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities. EBIT and EBIT before special items are alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are to be considered as being complementary to the indicators defined by IFRS.",

        "page_content": "## 7 Sales revenue\n\nSales revenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the amount of the consideration BASF expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them.\n\nBASF primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Because the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, the corresponding sales revenue is recognized based on a given point  in  time.  Determination  of  the  point  in  time  at  which  the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the context of an overall  assessment  of  the  circumstances  which  considers  the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards  takes  into  account  the  underlying  terms  of  delivery (especially  Incoterms)  and  is  of  particular  practical  significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. If products are delivered to a consignment  warehouse,  BASF  normally  retains  control  of  the goods.  Accordingly,  sales  revenue  is  not  recognized  until  the customer collects the goods from the consignment warehouse. Long-term  supply  agreements  usually  contain  variable  prices, dependent on the development of raw materials prices and variable volumes.\n\nServices rendered to customers by BASF are invoiced according to work completed and recognized as revenue accordingly.\n\nBASF  generates  a  portion  of  its  sales  revenue  from  license agreements. Sales revenue from license agreements is recognized based on a point in time or a period of time depending on whether the licensee is being granted a right to use (revenue recognized at a\n\npoint in time) or a right to access (revenue recognized over time) the intellectual property of BASF. Rights to use intellectual property are characterized  by  the  fact  that  the  licensed  technology  remains largely unchanged during the term of the license and, after initial provision  of  the  licensed  technology,  BASF  has  no  further performance obligations. Rights to access intellectual property, by contrast, imply that BASF will perform ongoing development and enhancement  of  the  technology,  and  the  licensee  will  take  a material interest in this ongoing development and enhancement. Accordingly, sales  revenue from license agreements granting rights to access BASF's intellectual property is recognized over the term of the  license. Sales revenue from sales and usage-based royalties is recognized in accordance with the underlying settlement agreements.\n\nSales  revenue  from  the  sale  of  precious  metals  to  industrial customers  is  recognized  on  delivery  and  the  corresponding purchase prices are recorded as cost of sales. In the trading of precious metals and their derivatives with traders, where there is usually  no  physical  delivery,  revenues  are  netted  against  the corresponding  costs.\n\nIf a consideration that is contractually agreed upon by a customer includes variable components, BASF estimates the amount of the consideration. Variable components are recognized as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that previously recognized sales revenue will not have to be cancelled as soon as there is no longer uncertainty about the actual amount of the consideration. Primarily rebates and other discounts are recognized as a reduction in revenue in accordance with the principle of individual measurement. BASF grants customers rebates if the goods purchased by the customer exceed a contractually defined threshold within the period  specified.  Rebates  are  usually  deducted  from  amounts payable by the customer. Taking into account the specific terms of the underlying contract, BASF uses the expected value method or the most likely amount to estimate a variable consideration amount.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nThe method is selected based primarily on number of possible results such as the number of volume thresholds with rebates. All available  information,  particularly  historical  values,  is  used  for making  estimates.\n\nIn some contracts, BASF grants the customer the right to return goods within a specific period of time, even if they meet the agreed specifications (sale with right of return). The actual expected amount of the consideration BASF is entitled to receive in this case is estimated using the expected value method. Refund liabilities are recognized in the amount of considerations paid by the customer for goods that are expected to be returned.\n\nBASF opts to apply the practical expedient in IFRS 15.63 to not adjust the amount of the agreed consideration for the effects of a material financing component if, at the beginning of a contract, no more than one year is expected to lapse between the transfer of control of the goods or services and payment by the customer.\n\nBASF also applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121 of not reporting information on  remaining  performance  obligations resulting from a contract with a maximum expected original term of one year. Furthermore, information on performance obligations is not reported if the resulting revenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15.B16.",

Provisions were reversed or adjusted if, based on the circumstances on the balance sheet date, utilization was no longer expected, or expected to a lesser extent.\n\nAs in the previous year, revenue from miscellaneous other activities primarily included income from rentals, catering operations, cultural events and logistics services. In 2020, \u20ac24 million in revenue from finance leases was also included.\n\nIncome from foreign currency and hedging transactions as well as from the measurement of LTI options pertained to the foreign currency  translation  of  receivables  and  payables  as  well  as  of currency derivatives and other hedging transactions. No income from  the  release  of  provisions  for  the  long-term  incentive  (LTI) program was recognized in 2020. Only a minor amount was  released in 2019.\n\nIncome from the translation of financial statements in foreign currencies included  gains  from  the  translation  of  companies' financial  statements  whose  local  currency  is  different  from  the functional  currency.\n\nAt  \u20ac62  million, gains  on  divestitures  and  the  disposal  of noncurrent  assets were significantly below the figure in the  previous year. They included primarily gains from the sale of fixed assets in the amount of \u20ac44 million. Income of \u20ac390 million was recognized in 2019  from  the  transfer  of  BASF's  paper  and  water  chemicals business  to  the  Solenis  group  and  the  sale  of  assets  in  the Agricultural Solutions segment in accordance with the conditions imposed by antitrust authorities in connection with the acquisition of the Bayer businesses. Furthermore, income of \u20ac421 million resulted in 2019 from real estate divestitures in several countries, mainly relating to the sale of a building complex in Switzerland in the amount of \u20ac400 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was due in both years to research project funding, government grants in multiple countries, regional business development subsidies in China and insurance refunds. Further income in 2020 resulted from gains in connection with the premature termination of a long-term supply agreement in North America in the amount of \u20ac103 million. Additional income resulted in 2019  from  plan  adjustments  for  pension  benefits  and  similar obligations  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac137  million  as  well  as  from  a contractually  agreed  compensation  payment  in  the  amount  of \u20ac46 million.

The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  impairments  amounting  to \u20ac2,368 million resulting from the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and affected all segments. In addition, impairments in the amount of \u20ac377 million arose due to restructuring in North  America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Depreciation, amortization and impairments of noncurrent assets amounting to \u20ac426  million in 2019 related primarily to the impairment of project costs for a planned methane-based propylene production plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast, as  well  as  to  the  optimization  of  production  sites  within  the Nutrition & Health division in Europe.\n\nFor more information, see Note 14 from page 264 onward and Note 15 from page 268 onward\n\nCosts from other miscellaneous revenue-generating activities relate to the items presented in other operating income.\n\nExpenses from foreign currency and hedging transactions as well as from the measurement of LTI options related to foreign currency translation of receivables and payables as well as changes in the fair value of currency derivatives and other hedging transactions. Expenses resulting from the measurement of LTI programs amounted to \u20ac35 million in 2020 and \u20ac39 million in 2019.\n\nIn  both  years, losses  from  divestitures  and  the  disposal  of noncurrent  assets were mainly in connection with the planned divestiture of the global pigments business.\n\nIn both years, other expenses included expenses for litigation, for REACH, for the provision of services, for warranties and for activities related to the BASF 4.0 project and for planning the new Verbund site in Guangdong, China. Additional other expenses resulted in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic, especially due to BASF's 'Helping Hands' aid campaign.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## 10 Investments accounted for using the equity method and other financial assets\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amounts of shareholdings are adjusted annually based on the pro rata share of net income, dividends and other changes in equity. Should there be indications of a reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment test is conducted and, if necessary, an impairment is recognized in the income statement. Furthermore, earnings and the carrying amount are adjusted when accounting policies deviate or as a result of purchase  price  allocations,  which  primarily  affects  Wintershall Dea GmbH, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany.\n\nExploration and development expenses in the oil and gas  business, for which the equity method is applied, are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, costs of successful exploratory drilling as well as successful and dry  development wells are capitalized.\n\nIncome from integral companies accounted for using the equity method is presented in the BASF Group's EBIT, and income from non-integral companies accounted for using the equity method is presented together with income from other financial assets in the BASF Group's net income from shareholdings. Similarly, integral and non-integral shareholdings accounted for using the equity method are also shown separately in the balance sheet.",

This  was primarily due to impairments of assets of Wintershall Dea Group amounting to \u20ac791  million as a result of lower oil and gas price forecasts and changed reserve estimates. As part of the impairment tests, the expected cash flows in euros from the exploration and production  assets  held  by  Wintershall  Dea  were  updated  and discounted. This assumed an oil price of $43 per bbl of Brent crude in 2021 that expected rises to a nominal $62 per bbl by 2023 and then develops in line with cost increases. The development of gas prices assumed a price of $3.8 per mmBtu (TTF) for 2021 that rises to a nominal $7.7 per mmBtu in 2025 and then follows the expected cost  trend.  The  expected  cash  flows  were  discounted  using country-specific cost of capital rates, which reflect the relevant country risks and tax rates. The cost of capital rates in euros, calculated using the capital asset pricing model, were between 3.4% and 14.4%.

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## 12 Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as well as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon are levied on all distributed and retained earnings. In addition to corporate income tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a trade tax.  It varies depending on the municipality in which the company is represented. As in the previous year, the weighted average tax rate was 14.5% in 2020. The 30% rate used to calculate deferred taxes for German Group companies remained unchanged in 2020. The income of foreign Group companies is assessed using the tax rates applicable in their respective countries. These are also generally used to calculate deferred taxes to the extent that tax rate adjustments for the future have not yet been enacted.\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements according to IFRS and the carrying amounts for tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. These also comprise temporary differences arising from business combinations, with the exception of goodwill. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the respective country-specific tax rates applicable for the period in which the asset or liability is realized or settled. Tax rate changes enacted or substantively enacted on or before the balance sheet date are taken into consideration.\n\nDeferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided they are related to the same taxation authority. Surpluses of deferred tax assets are only recognized provided that the tax benefits are likely to be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets is based on the probability of a reversal of the differences and the assessment of the ability to utilize tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. This depends on whether future taxable profits will exist during the period in which temporary differences are reversed and in which tax\n\nloss carryforwards and unused tax credits can be claimed. The assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on internal projections of the future earnings of the particular Group company.\n\nChanges in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are recorded as deferred tax expense or income unless the underlying transaction is not to be recognized directly in equity or in income and expenses recognized in equity. For those effects which have been recognized in equity, changes to deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are also recognized directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences between the proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the investment in a consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these differences is expected in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for dividend  distributions  planned  for  the  following  year  if  these distributions lead to a reversal of temporary differences.\n\nProvisions for German trade tax, corporate income tax and similar income taxes are calculated and recognized based on the expected taxable income of the consolidated companies less any prepayments that have been made. Provisions are set up for interest accrued. This interest is reported under other financial result, not tax expense. Other taxes to be assessed are considered accordingly.\n\nIFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement policies from IAS  12 when there is uncertainty regarding income tax-related treatment of individual transactions. They are accounted for with the assumption that tax authorities will examine the questionable transaction and have all relevant information. The amount of risk provisions is calculated and reviewed with consideration for the results of past tax audits as well as the legal assessment of not yet audited transactions and the risk of a  deviating tax-related interpretation by the tax authorities. The most probable value of the individual risks is recognized.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Tax expense and tax rate\n\nThe decline in current tax expense was due mainly to tax income for previous years, especially from incentives offered by the CARES Act in the United States, and lower earnings, mainly in Germany and North America.\n\nChanges in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards  resulted  in  income  of  \u20ac5  million  in  2020  (2019: expense of \u20ac1 million).\n\nThe BASF Group tax rate amounted to 5.8% in 2020 (2019: 22.9%). The relatively low tax income in relation to pre-tax result in 2020 resulted primarily from a rise in nondeductible operating  expenses due to the non-tax-effective impairment of goodwill and the overall negative earnings contribution from companies  accounted for using the equity method, mainly due to impairments of assets of the Wintershall  Dea  Group,  Kassel/Hamburg,  Germany.  This  was partially offset by a rise in tax income for previous periods, due mainly to incentives offered by the CARES Act in the United States.\n\nOther taxes included real estate taxes and other comparable taxes totaling \u20ac106 million in 2020 and \u20ac101 million in 2019.",

The useful life is determined using the period of the underlying contract or the period of time over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used.\n\nImpairments are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows, and the weighted average cost of capital after taxes, depending on tax rates and country-related risks. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized. Depending on the type of intangible asset, amortization is reported under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development expenses or other operating expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade names and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions. These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value has declined.\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets primarily comprise internally developed software. Such software and other internally generated intangible assets are measured at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairments are recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. In addition to those costs directly attributable to the asset, costs of internally generated intangible assets also include an appropriate portion of overhead costs.\n\nThe expected useful lives and amortization methods of intangible assets are based on historical values, plans and estimates. The weighted average amortization periods of intangible assets were as follows:\n\n## Weighted average amortization in years\n\n|                                               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Distribution and similar rights               |     14 |     15 |\n| Product rights, licenses and trademarks       |     30 |     19 |\n| Know-how, patents and production technologies |     16 |     15 |\n| Internally generated intangible assets        |      4 |      4 |\n| Other rights and values                       |      5 |      5 |\n\nEmission rights: Emission certificates, which are granted free of charge  by  the  German  Emissions  Trading  Authority  (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are recognized in the balance sheet with a value of zero. Certificates purchased on the market are capitalized at cost as intangible assets. Emissions generated create an obligation to surrender the emission certificates.  Emission  certificates  purchased  on  the  market  are subsequently measured at fair value, up to a maximum of the amount of the acquisition costs. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount on the balance sheet date, the emission rights are impaired.\n\nGoodwill is  only  written  down  in  the  case  of  an  impairment. Impairment testing is performed once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill impairments are not reversed.\n\nBASF's goodwill is allocated to 20 cash-generating units (2019: 22), which are defined either on the basis of business units or at a higher level. The reduction was due to the reclassification of goodwill for two of these cash-generating units, Pigments and Construction\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nChemicals, to the disposal groups in 2019. Impairment tests were performed on goodwill for both cash-generating units prior to their respective reclassifications in the previous year.\n\nThe respective recoverable amounts were determined using the value in use. Plans approved by company management and their respective cash flows for the next five years were used. For the period thereafter, a terminal value was calculated using a forward projection from the last detailed planning year as a perpetual  annuity. Planning  is  based  on  experience,  current  performance  and management's best possible estimates on the future development of individual parameters, such as raw materials prices and profit margins. Market assumptions regarding, for example, economic development, inflation expectations and market growth are included based on external macroeconomic and industry-specific sources.\n\nThe required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which  is  determined  using  the  capital  asset  pricing  model.  It comprises a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group.",

        "page_content": "Triggering events for potential impairment first became evident over the course of the summer due to the significant economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. All cash-generating units were evaluated for potential impairment risks based on analyses. Except for the cash-generating unit and business unit, Surface Treatment, in the Surface  Technologies  segment,  the  analyses  resulted  in  solid findings indicating no impairment risk.\n\nThe impairment test for the cash-generating Surface Treatment unit was accelerated; and future cash flows were adjusted downward given  the  market  environment  in  the  automotive  and  aviation industries due to the significant drop in demand from effects of the coronavirus pandemic and expectations for slow recovery. The impairment test also took into consideration measures approved and  being  taken  due  to  the  pandemic,  such  as  efficiency improvements across the unit's entire value chain. Assuming a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of 6.53% (2019: 5.17%), the changed assumptions resulted in a goodwill impairment of \u20ac786 million of the Surface Treatment unit, recognized  in other expenses. The recoverable amount corresponds to the unit's value in use and was \u20ac1,946 million as of September 30, 2020. A growth rate reduction of 0.5 percentage points would lead to a further need for impairment in the amount of \u20ac138 million. If all basic assumptions remained constant, a reduction of 10 percentage points in income from operations within the period of detailed planning would lead to a  further  need  for  impairment  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac161  million. Irrespective  of  that,  an  additional  impairment  in  the  amount  of \u20ac185 million would result from an increase of 0.5 percentage points to the cost of capital rate.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Goodwill of cash-generating units\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                | 2020     | 2020          | 2019 a, b   | 2019 a, b     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Cash-generating unit                                     | Goodwill | Growth rate c | Goodwill    | Growth rate c |\n| Agricultural Solutions division                          | 3,039    | 2.0%          | 3,219       | 2.0%          |\n| Catalysts division (excluding battery materials)         | 1,244    | 2.0%          | 1,315       | 2.0%          |\n| Personal Care Ingredients in the Care Chemicals division | 493      | 2.0%          | 515         | 2.0%          |\n| Surface Treatment in the Coatings division               | 696      | 2.0%          | 1,512       | 2.0%          |\n| Other cash-generating units                              | 1,487    | 0.0%-2.0%     | 1,544       | 0.0%-2.0%     |\n| Goodwill as of December 31                               | 6,959    | 6,959         | 8,105       |               |\n\n- a Reclassification of goodwill from the construction chemicals business to the disposal group in the amount of \u20ac772 million as of December 21, 2019\n- b Reclassification of goodwill from the pigments business to the disposal group in the amount of \u20ac414 million as of August 29, 2019\n- c Growth rates used in impairment tests to determine terminal values in accordance with IAS 36\n\nThe annual impairment tests of the other 19 cash-generating units were performed in the fourth quarter of 2020. The calculation also takes into account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash-generating unit. Impairment tests were performed on the units assuming a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of between 4.86% and 6.92% (2019: between 5.16% and 7.73%). This corresponds to a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes of between 6.50% and 8.85% (2019: between 6.38% and 10.00%).\n\nAfter determining the recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units, the conclusion was that reasonable possible deviations from the key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amounts of 18 units exceeding their respective recoverable amounts.\n\nThis does not apply to the goodwill of the cash-generating unit and business unit, Resins, in the Industrial Solutions segment.\n\nFuture cash flows for the Resins unit were adjusted downward due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the market  environment in the automotive industry. Besides the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, profitability and efficiency-boosting measures, currently being implemented, were factored into the impairment test. The result  of  these  assumptions  was  that  the  recoverable  amount exceeded the carrying amount by \u20ac68  million, given a weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of 6.63% (2019: 7.03%) and a growth rate of 2.0% (2019: 2.0%). The recoverable amount would be equal to the unit's carrying amount if the weighted average cost of capital rate rose by 0.69 percentage points or the growth rate were 1.03 percentage points lower. Goodwill in the amount of \u20ac34 million was allocated to the Resins unit as of December 31, 2020.",

Additions also included internally created intangible assets totaling \u20ac37 million, comprising primarily the development of software not allocated to an operational segment.\n\nAdditions from acquisitions resulted mainly from the acquisition of Solvay's global polyamide business in the Materials  segment, to which the additional goodwill is also allocated.\n\nDisposals of intangible assets amounting to \u20ac249 million primarily concerned the derecognition of fully amortized assets for  distribution and similar rights and of production technologies in the Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments.\n\nTransfers  to  disposal  groups related  to  the  adjustment  of reclassified amounts to the discontinued construction chemicals business.\n\nIn 2020,  additions  to accumulated amortization contained impairments of \u20ac35 million (excluding goodwill). They related mainly to customer relationships and to a production technology in the Nutrition & Care segment. Its use was discontinued prematurely due to the optimization of the production structure. Moreover, customer rights and production technologies were impaired in the Agricultural Solutions  segment  after  the  registration  of  an  active  ingredient expired.\n\nFurther impairments totaling \u20ac11  million were attributable to the Chemicals,  Industrial  Solutions,  Nutrition  &  Care,  Agricultural Solutions, Materials and Surface Technologies segments and  related primarily to know-how, patents and production technologies.",

Additions also included newly acquired software licenses and rights of use.\n\nAdditions  from  acquisitions resulted  from  the  acquisition  of Isobionics  B.V.,  Geleen,  Netherlands,  a  startup  company  that develops  and  produces  natural  flavors  and  fragrances.  This increased goodwill by \u20ac16  million and capitalized know-how by \u20ac31 million. By contrast, there was a decrease of goodwill in the amount of \u20ac65 million due to a retroactive purchase price allocation and purchase price adjustment to assets from the acquisition of significant  parts  of  Bayer's  seed  and  non-selective  herbicide businesses and its vegetable seeds business in the previous year.\n\nDisposals of intangible assets amounting to \u20ac281 million primarily concerned the derecognition of fully amortized assets for distribution and supply rights in the Agricultural Solutions segment and of software licenses.\n\nTransfers to disposal groups were attributable to intangible assets in connection with the construction chemicals business in December 2019 and the pigments business in August 2019.\n\nIn 2019, additions to accumulated amortization contained impairments of \u20ac15  million. These impairments pertained primarily to patents that were not allocated to an operational segment and were revalued due to a planned sale.",

The revaluation method is not applied. Low-value assets are fully expensed in the year of acquisition.\n\nThe  cost  of  self-constructed  plants  includes  direct  costs, appropriate allocations of material and production overhead costs, and a share of the general administrative costs of the divisions involved in the construction of the plants.\n\nExpenses  related  to  the  scheduled  maintenance  of  large-scale plants  are  capitalized  separately  and  depreciated  using  the straight-line  method  over  the  period  until  the  next  planned turnaround.  Costs  for  the  replacement  of  components  are recognized as assets if an additional future benefit is expected. The carrying  amount  of  the  replaced  components  is  derecognized. Costs  for  maintenance  and  repair  as  part  of  normal  business operations are recognized as an expense.\n\nAs lessee, BASF generally recognizes for all leases right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet at the present value of financial commitments entered.\n\n- For more information, see Note 16 from page 272 onward\n\nInvestment properties held to realize capital gains or rental income are immaterial. They are valued at the lower of fair value or cost less depreciation.\n\nBoth  movable  and  immovable  fixed  assets  are  principally depreciated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives and depreciation methods of property, plant and equipment are based on historical values, plans and estimates. The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.\n\nThe weighted average depreciation periods of continuing operations were as follows:\n\n## Weighted average depreciation in years\n\n|                                        |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Buildings and structural installations |     16 |     17 |\n| Machinery and technical equipment      |     10 |     11 |\n| Miscellaneous equipment and fixtures   |      6 |      6 |\n\nIf there is indication of a possible cause for impairment, an  impairment test is performed. Impairments to property, plant and equipment are recognized if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The measurement is based on fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows and weighted average cost of capital after taxes (determined using the capital asset pricing model), depending on relevant tax rates and country-related risks. An impairment is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an impairment not been recognized. Impairments and reversals of impairments are reported in other operating income and expenses.\n\n- For more information on the value in use and the weighted cost of capital rate, see Note 14 from page 264 onward\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nBorrowing costs: If directly incurred as part of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for which the process necessary to make it ready for its intended use or sale is longer than one year. Borrowing costs are capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. Borrowing costs were calculated based on a rate of 1.5% (previous year: 1.5%) and adjusted on a country-specific basis, if necessary. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nGovernment grants: Government grants related to the acquisition or  construction  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  reduce  the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets. Other government  grants  or  government  assistance  are  recognized immediately  as  other  operating  income  or  treated  as  deferred income and released over the underlying period.",

Investments  were  made  at  the  following  sites  in  particular: Ludwigshafen, Germany; Antwerp, Belgium; Geismar, Louisiana; and Shanghai, China. Material investments included the expansion of the vitamin A plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and construction of an ethylene oxide and polyethylene oxide production plant in Antwerp, Belgium. Investments also included the upgrade and capacity expansion of the MDI synthesis unit in Geismar,  Louisiana. Government  grants  for  funding  investment  measures  reduced asset  additions  by  \u20ac11  million.  The  additions  to  right-of-use machinery and technical equipment related mainly to a syngas separation unit facility in Geismar, Louisiana.\n\nAdditions from acquisitions resulted from the acquisition of  Solvay's global polyamide business.\n\nFor more information on acquisitions, see Note 3 from page 235 onward\n\nIn 2020,  impairments  of  \u20ac2,059  million  were  included  in accumulated  depreciation . The  impairments  related  to  all segments and were mainly attributable to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and to restructuring measures.\n\nOf  all  impairments  in  the  Chemicals  segment,  the  majority (\u20ac550 million) was attributable to impairments resulting from  ongoing excess supply and the associated decrease in prices and margins. The  impairments  concerned  nearly  all  asset  classes,  especially machinery and technical equipment (\u20ac414 million), construction in progress (\u20ac53  million) and buildings (\u20ac42  million). They primarily comprised the depreciation of individual production plants in  Europe, North America and Asia. The values in use were calculated using cost of capital rates after taxes between 6.76% and 7.85% and led to full depreciation in the amount of \u20ac456 million.\n\nThe majority of impairments (\u20ac748 million) in the Materials segment was also attributable to ongoing excess supply - amplified by the coronavirus pandemic - as well as to the associated decrease in prices and margins. They related to nearly all classes of fixed assets, especially  machinery  and  technical  equipment  (\u20ac627  million), construction in progress (\u20ac77  million) and buildings (\u20ac40  million). They primarily comprised the depreciation of individual production plants in Europe, North America and Asia. The values in use were calculated using cost of capital rates after taxes between 6.92% and 8.46% and led to full depreciation in the amount of \u20ac676 million.\n\nOf all impairments in the Industrial Solutions segment, \u20ac37 million were  related  to  production  plants  in  Asia  and  resulted  from decreased production and the expectation of a slow recovery in the automotive and aviation industries due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, plants in North America were impaired in the amount of \u20ac43 million in connection with restructuring. The values in use were calculated using cost of capital rates after taxes between  6.66%  and  7.77%.  Impairments  related  chiefly  to machinery  and  technical  equipment  (\u20ac54  million)  and  buildings (\u20ac17 million).\n\nOf all impairments in the Surface Technologies segment, the  majority (\u20ac197 million) related to the partial impairment of the production network for catalysts in Europe with sites in Germany, Poland and South Africa, due mainly to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic  and  current  market  developments  in  the  automotive industry.  The value in use was calculated using a cost of capital rate after taxes of 7.13 %. The impairments concerned nearly all asset classes, with \u20ac123 million attributable to machinery and technical equipment, \u20ac54 million to buildings and \u20ac9 million to construction in progress. Furthermore, full depreciation of production plants and construction in progress in Europe, North America and Asia was recognized in the total amount of \u20ac41 million.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nOf all impairments in the Nutrition & Care segment, \u20ac20 million were attributable to discontinued investment projects in Europe and Asia. The impairments related in particular to miscellaneous equipment and fixtures as well as to construction in progress\n\nImpairments  in  the  Agricultural  Solutions  segment  arose  in  the amount  of  \u20ac280  million  almost  completely  from  measures  to streamline the glufosinate-ammonium production network in North America and Europe. These impairments concerned nearly all asset classes, with \u20ac132 million attributable to machinery and technical equipment, \u20ac60 million to buildings and \u20ac42 million to right-of-use building assets.\n\nDisposals of property, plant and equipment included the sale of a production site in Denmark.\n\nTransfers related mainly to the reclassification of operation-ready assets from construction in progress to other asset categories.\n\nTransfers to disposal groups related to amounts reclassified to the  discontinued  construction  chemicals  business  and  to  the discontinued pigments business.\n\nFor more information on divestitures, see Note 3 from page 235 onward\n\nCurrency  effects lowered  property,  plant  and  equipment  by \u20ac934  million and resulted mainly from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real against the euro.",

Investments  were  made  at  the  following  sites  in  particular: Ludwigshafen,  Germany;  Antwerp,  Belgium;  Shanghai,  China; Geismar,  Louisiana;  and  Freeport,  Texas.  Material  investments included the acetylene plant as well as the expansion of the vitamin A  plant  in  Ludwigshafen,  Germany.  Furthermore,  additions included renovations and major repairs to the steam cracker and the construction of a new propane tank in Antwerp, Belgium. Investments also included the upgrade and capacity expansion of the MDI synthesis unit in Geismar, Louisiana. Government grants for  funding  investment  measures  reduced  asset  additions  by \u20ac9 million.\n\nIn 2019, impairments of \u20ac315 million and reversals of impairments of \u20ac6  million were included in accumulated depreciation . The impairments were primarily attributable to construction in progress resulting from discontinued investment projects in North America within the Petrochemicals division. Furthermore, impairments on buildings and technical equipment at one production site in Europe were also included in accumulated depreciation.\n\nDisposals of property, plant and equipment included the sale of a building complex in Switzerland.\n\nTransfers related mainly to the reclassification of operation-ready assets from construction in progress to other asset categories. Transfers also included reclassification of existing finance leases as of December  31, 2018 to right-of-use assets due to the initial application of IFRS 16.\n\nTransfers  to  disposal  groups included  property,  plant  and equipment, which had been reclassified to the disposal groups for the pigments business and the construction chemicals business.\n\n- For more information on divestitures, see Note 3 from page 235 onward\n\nCurrency  effects raised  property,  plant  and  equipment  by \u20ac190 million and resulted mainly from appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## 16 Leases\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nA lease is an agreement that conveys the right to control the use of identified asset for a defined period of time in return for a payment.\n\nLeases in which BASF is a lessee mainly relate to real estate and transportation and technical equipment.\n\nLeases can be embedded within other contracts. If separation is required under IFRS, the embedded lease is recorded separately from its host contract and each component of the contract is accounted  and  measured  in  accordance  with  the  applicable regulations.\n\nAs  lessee,  BASF  accounts  for  nearly  all  leases,  recognizing right-of-use  assets  for  leased  assets  and  liabilities  for  lease agreements. The following principles are considered:\n\n- - BASF  exercises  the  exemption  for  lease  agreements  with  a maximum term of 12 months from the date of provision and low-value  assets.  Low-value  assets  are  generally  defined  as leased assets worth a maximum of \u20ac5,000.\n- - Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, taking into account the incremental borrowing rate.\n- - As a general rule, BASF separates non-lease components, such as services, from lease payments.\n- - A right-of-use asset is generally recognized at the same amount as the lease liability. Differences may arise from the lease  payments made prior to the provision of the leased asset, less any lease incentives  received.",

Extension and termination options are taken into account on recognition of the lease liability only if BASF is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. When contract terms are being determined, consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that offer an economic incentive for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options. Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension option or non-exercise of a termination option are only considered if sufficient certainty exists. Estimates  and  expectations  which  are  asserted  at  the  commencement date of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future payments not yet determined on the date of provision are assessed continuously during the lease term.

If the market price or the fair value of the sales products, which are based on the net  realizable values, is lower, then the sales products are written down to this lower value. The net realizable value is the estimated price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling costs.\n\nIn addition to direct costs, cost of conversion includes an appropriate  allocation  of  production  overhead  costs  based  on  normal utilization rates of the production plants, provided that they are related to the production process. Pensions, social services and voluntary social benefits are also included, as well as allocations for administrative  costs,  provided  they  relate  to  the  production. Borrowing costs are not included in cost of conversion.\n\nInventories may be written down if the prices for the sales products decline, or in cases of a high rate of days sales of inventory (DSI). Write-downs on inventories are reversed if the reasons for them no longer apply.\n\nThe exception made by IAS 2 for traders is applied to the measurement of precious metals. Accordingly, inventories held exclusively for trading purposes are measured at fair value less costs to sell and recognized in the precious metal trading item (carrying amount as of December  31, 2020: \u20ac1,604  million; as of December  31, 2019: \u20ac977  million) under miscellaneous current assets.

The change in current derivatives with positive fair market values was largely attributable to the increase in fair values of commodity derivatives for precious metals.\n\nBank acceptance drafts are used as an alternative form of  payment in China. Bank acceptance drafts are issued at a discount from their par  value.  They  can  be  held  to  maturity,  traded  or  redeemed prematurely at a discount. If BASF discounts a bank acceptance draft  with  recourse,  a  liability  toward  the  credit  institution  is recognized in the amount of the payment received. The increase relates to higher sales and broader use of this form of payment in China.\n\nPrepaid  expenses in  2020  mainly  included  prepayments  of \u20ac28 million related to operating activities compared with \u20ac30 million in 2019, as well as \u20ac79 million in prepayments for insurance in both 2020 and 2019. Prepayments for license costs decreased from \u20ac74 million in 2019 to \u20ac70 million in 2020. Prepaid expenses in 2020 included  lower  advance  payments  for  received  precious  metal catalysts to be refurbished.\n\nThe change in current tax refund claims was largely attributable to the rise in open income tax receivables at various Group companies.\n\nThe rise in current other receivables and assets, which represent financial instruments, was due to higher deposits on commodity derivatives and increased receivables for other refunds.",

The program has no impact on the calculation of valuation allowances in accordance with IFRS 9. No compensation claims were incurred in either 2020 or 2019.\n\nPayment terms are generally agreed upon individually with customers and, as a rule, are within 90 days. In 2020, valuation allowances of \u20ac142 million were added for trade accounts receivable, and valuation allowances of \u20ac124  million were reversed. In the previous year, valuation allowances of \u20ac168 million were added for trade accounts receivable, and valuation allowances of \u20ac146 million were reversed.\n\nIn 2020, valuation allowances of \u20ac98 million were recognized for other receivables representing financial instruments, and valuation allowances  of  \u20ac13  million  were  reversed.  In  the  previous  year, valuation allowances of \u20ac15 million were recognized and valuation allowances of \u20ac3 million were reversed.\n\nAdditions  included  valuation  allowances  of  \u20ac7  million  due  to  a change  in  valuation  parameters.  Additions  primarily  included valuation  allowances  of  loans  to  former  and  current  Group companies.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes",

There are no preferential voting rights or other restrictions. BASF SE does not hold any treasury shares.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  resolution  of  the  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting on May  3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase, until May 2, 2024, on a one-off basis or in portions on a number of occasions, the company's share capital by a total of up to \u20ac470 million  by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind. In principle, shareholders are entitled to a subscription right. However, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' statutory subscription rights in the cases specified in the authorizing resolution. The Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to lay down the further contents of the share rights and the details of the execution of the capital increase. The total shares issued on the basis of the above authorization with the exclusion of the shareholders' subscription right in the case of capital increases in return for contributions in cash or in kind must not exceed 10% of the share capital at the time that this authorization comes into effect or - if this value is lower - at the time of its exercise. The proportionate amount of the share capital of those shares that are to be issued on the basis of conversion or option bonds  granted  during  the  term  of  this  authorization  under  the exclusion of the subscription right, must be credited against the aforementioned ceiling of 10%. This authorization has not been exercised to date.\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 12, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized,\n\nwith the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue, on a one-off basis or in portions on more than one occasion, bearer or registered convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants, or combinations of these  instruments,  with  or  without  maturity  limitations  up  to  a nominal value of \u20ac10 billion until May 11, 2022. The notional interest in the share capital attributable to the BASF shares to be issued in connection with the debt instruments issued under this authorization may not exceed 10% of the share capital.\n\nIn this connection, the share capital was increased conditionally by up to \u20ac117,565,184 by issuing a maximum of 91,847,800 new registered BASF shares. The conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent to which holders of convertible bonds, or warrants attached to bonds with warrants issued, exercise their conversion  or  option  rights.  This  authorization  has  not  been exercised to date.\n\n## Authorization of share buybacks\n\nBy way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 12, 2017, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to buy back shares until May  11, 2022, in accordance with section 71(1) no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The buyback may not exceed 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed and can take place via the stock exchange, a public purchase offer addressed to all shareholders, or a public invitation to the shareholders to submit sales offers. This authorization has not been exercised to date.\n\n## Subscribed capital\n\nSubscribed capital remained unchanged year on year at \u20ac1,176 million and comprises 918,478,694 qualifying shares.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital  reserves  include  effects  from  BASF's  share  program, premiums from capital increases and consideration for warrants and negative  goodwill  from  the  capital  consolidation  resulting  from acquisitions of subsidiaries in exchange for the issue of BASF SE shares at par value.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThe acquisition of shares in companies that BASF already controls or that are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a joint arrangement is treated as a transaction between shareholders, as long as this does not lead to a change in the consolidation method. There were no material transactions of this type in 2020, as in the previous year.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\n| Million \u20ac               | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Legal reserves          | 901                 | 830                 |\n| Other retained earnings | 37,010              | 41,226              |\n| Retained earnings       | 37,911              | 42,056              |\n\nLegal reserves rose by \u20ac70 million in 2020 and by \u20ac66 million in 2019 due to reclassifications from retained earnings.\n\nOther retained earnings include, among other things, earnings generated in the past by companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because of the disposal of the construction chemicals business on September 30, 2020, the amount of \u20ac53 million  from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans was reclassified from income and expenses to retained earnings, in equity. In the previous year, this type of reclassification resulted in the amount of \u20ac140 million from the merger concluded on April 30, 2019 between Wintershall and DEA.",

The remaining \u20ac868,110,024.68 in retained profits was allocated to retained earnings.\n\n## 20 Other comprehensive income\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe expenses and income shown in other comprehensive income are divided into two categories: Items that will be recognized in the income statement in the future (known as 'recycling') and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in the future. The first category includes gains and losses from currency translation, the measurement of certain securities classified as debt instruments, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to hedge future cash flows. Items that will not be reclassified to the income statement at a future date include effects from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans.\n\n## Remeasurement of defined benefit plans\n\nChanges in the value of defined benefit plans reduced equity by \u20ac973 million in 2020, and by \u20ac393 million in the previous year (after taxes in both years). Of that amount, -\u20ac19 million was attributable to investments accounted for using the equity method in 2020 (2019: -\u20ac46 million). Deferred taxes amounted to \u20ac422 million in 2020, and \u20ac359 million in 2019.\n\nBecause of the disposal of the construction chemicals business on September  30,  2020,  the  amount  of  \u20ac53  million  from  the remeasurement  of  defined  benefit  plans  was  reclassified  from income and expenses to retained earnings, in equity. In the previous year, this type of reclassification resulted in the amount of \u20ac140 million  from  the  merger  concluded  on  April  30,  2019  between Wintershall and DEA.\n\n- For more information on the remeasurement of defined benefit plans, see Note 22 from page 282 onward\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Currency translation\n\nDifferences resulting from currency translation reduced equity by a total of \u20ac2,598 million. This included deferred taxes in the amount of \u20ac19 million. At-equity investments accounted for \u20ac1,125 million. In 2020, the differences  resulted primarily from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real relative to the euro in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of divestitures, \u20ac71 million after taxes was reclassified to the income statement in 2020 and \u20ac834 million after taxes in 2019.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  designated  to  hedging relationships (cash flow hedge) adjusted for deferred taxes in the amount of \u20ac24 million reduced equity by a total of \u20ac108 million. Of that amount, -\u20ac163 million related to the hedging of cash flows at shareholdings accounted for using the equity method.\n\n- For more information on cash flow hedge accounting, see Note 26.5 from page 301 onward",

As in the previous year, there were no secured contingent liabilities in 2020.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## 22 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIn addition to state pension plans, most employees are granted company  pension  benefits  from  either  defined  contribution  or defined benefit plans. Benefits generally depend on years of service, contributions or compensation, and take into consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social security laws of the countries where the companies are located. To limit the risks of changing financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, employees have, for a number of years now, been almost  exclusively offered defined contribution plans for future years of service.\n\nThe accounting policies presented in the following relate to defined benefit pension obligations.\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  are  calculated  on  an  actuarial  basis  in accordance with the projected unit credit method using  assumptions relating to the following valuation parameters, among others: future developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, employee turnover and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. Obligations are discounted based on the market yields on high-quality corporate fixed-rate bonds.\n\nSimilar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by North American Group companies to pay the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired staff and their dependents, are reported under provisions for similar obligations.\n\nActuarial  reports  are  used  to  calculate  the  amount  of  pension provisions.",

The organization, responsibilities, strategy, implementation and reporting requirements are documented for the units involved.\n\n## Economic and legal environment of the plans\n\nIn some countries - especially in Germany, in the United States, in the  United  Kingdom  and  in  Switzerland  -  there  are  pension obligations  subject  to  government  supervision  or  similar  legal restrictions. For example, there are minimum funding requirements to  cover  pension  obligations,  which  are  based  on  actuarial assumptions that differ from those pursuant to IAS 19. Furthermore, there are qualitative and quantitative restrictions on allocating plan assets  to  certain  asset  categories.  This  could  result  in  annual fluctuations in employer contributions, financing measures and the assumption of obligations in favor of the pension funds to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe obligations and the plan assets used to fund the obligations are exposed to demographic, legal and economic risks. Economic risks are primarily due to unforeseen developments on commodity and capital  markets.  They  affect,  for  example,  pension  adjustments based on the level of inflation in Germany and in the United  Kingdom, as well as the impact of discount rates on the amount of the defined benefit obligation. In previous years, measures taken to close plans with defined benefits for future service, especially benefits based on final pay promises and the assumption of healthcare costs for  former employees, led to a reduction in risk with regard to future benefit levels.\n\nThe strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing pension commitments takes into account country-specific supervisory and tax regulations.\n\nIn some countries, pension benefits were granted for which the employer has a subsidiary liability. Pension benefits in a number of countries include minimum interest guarantees to a limited extent. If the pension fund cannot generate the income needed to provide the minimum guarantee, this must be provided by the employer under the subsidiary liability. To the extent that recourse to the employer is unlikely based on the structure and execution of the pension  benefits as well as the asset situation of the pension fund, these plans are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Description of the defined benefit plans\n\nThe following section describes the typical plan structure in the individual countries. Different arrangements may exist, in particular due to the assumption of plans as part of acquisitions; however, these do not have any material impact on the description of plans in the individual countries.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor BASF  SE and German Group companies, a basic level of benefits  is  provided  by  BASF  Pensionskasse  VVaG,  a  legally independent plan, which is financed by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets. BASF SE ensures the  necessary  contributions  to  adequately  finance  the  benefits promised by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG. Some of the benefits financed via BASF Pensionskasse VVaG are subject to adjustments that must be borne by its member companies to the extent that these cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG due to the regulations imposed by the German supervisory authority. In 2004, the basic benefit plan was closed for newly hired employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a defined contribution plan. At BASF SE, occupational pension promises that exceed the basic  level  of  benefits  are  financed  under  a  contractual  trust\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\narrangement by BASF Pensionstreuhand  e.V.; at German Group companies,  these  benefits  are  financed  primarily  via  pension provisions. The benefits are largely based on cash balance plans. Furthermore, employees are given the option of participating in various deferred compensation schemes.\n\n## United States\n\nEmployees  are  granted  benefits  based  on  defined  contribution plans.\n\nEffective 2010, the existing defined benefit plans were closed to further increases in benefits based on future years of service, and benefits earned in the past were frozen. There is no entitlement to pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases.\n\nThe legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans are based on the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a minimum funding level. Any employer contributions necessary to meet the minimum funding level are based on the results of an actuarial valuation. Furthermore, there are unfunded pension plans that are not subject to ERISA requirements.\n\nAdditional  similar  obligations  arise  from  plans  that  assume  the healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired employees and their dependents. Such plans have been closed to new entrants since 2007. In addition, the amount of the benefits for such plans has been frozen.",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Switzerland\n\nThe employees of the BASF Group in Switzerland receive a  company pension, which is financed through a pension fund by employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan assets. The pension plans are accounted for as defined benefit plans, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed by law under the Swiss Pension Fund Act (BVG) is included in the scheme. All benefits vest immediately. According to government regulations, the employer is obligated to make contributions, so that the pension funds are able to grant the minimum benefits guaranteed by law. The pension funds are managed by boards, where employer and employees are equally represented, which steer and monitor the benefit plans and asset allocation.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nEmployees are granted benefits based on a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe BASF Group also maintains defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, which have been closed for further increases based on future years of service. Adjustments to compensate for increases in the cost of living until the beginning of retirement are legally required for beneficiaries of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe financing of the pension plans is determined by the provisions of the regulatory authority for pensions and the relevant social and labor law requirements. The defined benefit plans are administered by a trust company, whose Board of Trustees, according to the trustee  agreement  and  law,  represents  the  interests  of  the beneficiaries and ensures that the benefits can be paid in the future. The  required  funding  is  determined  using  technical  valuations according to local regulations every three years.\n\n## Other countries\n\nFor subsidiaries in other countries, defined benefits are covered in some cases by pension provisions, but mainly by external insurance companies or pension funds.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe valuation of the defined benefit obligation is based on the following key assumptions:\n\n## Assumptions used to determine the defined benefit obligation as of December 31\n\n|                             |   Germany |   Germany | United States   | United States   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |   United   Kingdom |   United   Kingdom |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                             |    2020   |    2019   | 2020            | 2019            | 2020          | 2019          |             2020   |             2019   |\n| Discount rate               |       0.7 |       1.1 | 2.30            | 3.10            | 0.10          | 0.20          |                1.5 |                2.2 |\n| Projected pension  increase |       1.5 |       1.5 | -               | -               | -             | -             |                3.1 |                3   |\n\n## Assumptions used to determine expenses for pension benefits in the respective business year\n\n|                             |        |        | United States   | United States   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |   United   Kingdom |   United   Kingdom |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                             | 2020   | 2019   | 2020            | 2019            | 2020          | 2019          |             2020   |             2019   |\n| Discount rate               |    1.1 |    1.7 | 3.10            | 4.10            | 0.20          | 0.90          |                2.2 |                2.9 |\n| Projected pension  increase |    1.5 |    1.5 | -               | -               | -             | -             |                3   |                3.1 |\n\nThe assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit obligation as of December 31 are used in the following year to determine the expenses for pension plans.\n\nA Group-wide, uniform procedure is used to determine the discount rates applied for valuation of material pension obligations of the BASF Group.

Accordingly,  plan  assets  are aligned with the long-term development of the obligations, taking into  consideration  the  risks  associated  with  the  specific  asset classes and the regulations relating to the investment of plan assets. The  existing  portfolio  structure  is  based  on  the  target  asset allocation. In addition, current market assessments are taken into consideration. In order to mitigate risks and maximize returns, a widely spread global portfolio of individual assets is held.\n\nLiability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as hedging the risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are used in some pension plans, especially for U.K. and U.S. plans.",

Government bonds primarily relate to bonds from countries with the very high credit ratings, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. Government bonds from emerging nations are also held to a limited extent. Corporate bonds mainly comprise bonds from creditworthy debtors, although particular high-yield bonds are also held to a limited extent. In connection with the continuous monitoring of default risk based on a given risk budget and on the observation of the development of the creditworthiness of issuers, the plan asset allocation may be adjusted in the case of a revised market assessment. Alternative investments largely comprise investments in private and infrastructure  equity,  absolute  return  funds  and  senior  secured loans.\n\nAlmost all of the equities are priced on active markets. The  category debt  instruments includes  promissory  notes  and  debentures (Pfandbriefe) acquired through private placements with a market value in the amount of \u20ac110 million as of December 31, 2020, and \u20ac193  million  as  of  December  31,  2019.  For  such  securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans, there is no active market. The capital market compensates for this lack of fungibility\n\nwith yield premiums depending on the maturity. With only a few exceptions, there is no active market for plan assets in real estate and alternative investments .\n\nPlan assets as of the balance sheet date contained securities issued by BASF Group companies with a market value of \u20ac1 million in 2020 and \u20ac2 million in 2019. The market value of the properties of legally independent  pension  funds  rented  to  BASF  Group  companies amounted to \u20ac112  million on both December  31, 2020 and on December 31,  2019.\n\nSince 2010, there has been an agreement between BASF SE and BASF Pensionskasse VVaG on the granting of profit participation capital  with  a  nominal  value  of  \u20ac80  million,  which  is  used  to strengthen the financing of the BASF Pensionskasse VVaG.

Provisions are recognized at the probable settlement value.\n\nProvisions for environmental protection and remediation costs are recognized for expected costs for rehabilitating contaminated sites, recultivating landfills, removal of environmental contamination at existing production or storage sites and similar measures.\n\nIn  addition,  other  provisions  also  cover  expected  costs  for restoration obligations for dismantling  existing  plants  and buildings. If BASF is the only responsible party that can be identified, the provision covers the entire expected obligation. At sites  operated together with one or more partners, the provision generally covers only BASF's share of the expected obligation. The amount of the provision is  determined based on the available technical information on the site, the  technology used, legal regulations, and official requirements.  The  calculation  accounts  for  expected  significant changes in obligations.\n\nProvisions for restructuring measures include severance payments to departing employees or similar personnel expenses as well as expected costs for site closures, including the costs for demolition and similar measures. Provisions are recognized for these expenses when the relevant measures have been planned and announced by management.\n\nProvisions for employee obligations primarily consist of variable compensation including associated social security contributions, as well as obligations for granting long-service bonuses. Provisions for long-service and are predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles.\n\nProvisions for obligations from sales and purchase contracts largely comprise obligations arising from rebates granted and other price discounts in the Agricultural Solutions segment, warranties and product liabilities, sales commissions and expected losses on contracts.\n\nProvisions for litigation, damage claims, warranties and similar obligations contain anticipated expenses from lawsuits in which BASF is the defendant party, as well as obligations under damage claims against BASF and fines. In order to determine the amount of the  provisions,  the  company  takes  into  consideration  the  facts related to each case, the size of the claim, claims awarded in similar cases  and  independent  expert  advice  as  well  as  assumptions regarding the probability of a successful claim and the range of possible claims. Actual costs can deviate from these estimates.\n\nFor more information, see Note 24 on page 290\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nThe probable amount required to settle noncurrent provisions is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In this case, the provision is recognized at present value. Assumptions must be made in determining the discount rate (2020: 1.5%; 2019: 1.5%) used for calculating noncurrent provisions.  Financing costs related to unwinding the discount of provisions in subsequent periods are shown in other financial result.",

The Lower Passaic River Study Area (LPRSA) is one such site comprising the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River in New Jersey. BASF Corporation and more than 60 other companies (collectively, the Lower Passaic River Study Area Cooperating Parties Group or CPG) agreed to complete a remedial investigation / feasibility study (RI/FS) of the LPRSA. In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) selected a final remedy for the lower eight miles of the LPRSA. A decision from USEPA on a targeted approach for the upper portion of the LPRSA is expected for 2021. BASF Corporation established a provision covering BASF's currently estimated share of the remediation costs.\n\nBetween November 2014 and March 2015, a putative class action lawsuit and several additional lawsuits were filed in the United States District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York  against BASF Metals Limited (BML), based in the United Kingdom, along with other defendants, alleging violations of antitrust and commodities laws stemming from the price discovery process for platinum  and  palladium.  The  lawsuits  were  consolidated  and dismissed on  jurisdictional grounds in March 2017. In May 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended Complaint that renews allegations against defendants and BML. On March 29, 2020, all claims against all defendants were dismissed. On April 27, 2020, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where the matter is still pending. A pro se complaint filed  in  September  2015  that  was  not  consolidated  into  the consolidated class action was ultimately dismissed as of November 18, 2019.\n\nOn February 14/15, 2020, a jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri awarded $15 million in compensatory  damages  and  $250  million  in  punitive  damages  against defendants Monsanto Company and BASF Corporation. The verdict relates to alleged yield losses of a peach farmer in connection with the use of the dicamba herbicide. BASF and Monsanto filed posttrial motions to challenge the jury's verdict. On November 25, 2020, the trial court ruled on the post-trial motions, and the punitive damages award was reduced from $250 million to $60 million. The court did not grant any other relief related to the jury's verdict. BASF and Monsanto filed notices of appeal on December 18, 2020.\n\nSince August 2019, BASF Corporation has been served in various U.S.  federal  and  state  lawsuits  alleging  property  and  resource damages and personal injuries from possible exposure to per- and polyflouroalkyl  substances  (PFAS).  In  December  2018,  a  multidistrict litigation (MDL) was created to coordinate claims brought against manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) in particular, which plaintiffs allege contains toxic levels of certain PFAS compounds including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Plaintiffs  typically allege that exposure to AFFF has caused loss of use and enjoyment of  property,  diminished  property  value,  remediation  costs,  and personal injuries including various types of cancers. The complaints name BASF as a defendant in connection with its 2009 acquisition of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc. and the legacy Ciba/BASF Lodyne fluorochemical product lines. BASF has been named in 638 suits as of Janary 2021 and is defending all litigation.\n\nAt this time, BASF cannot predict the outcomes of resolving these matters  or  what  potential  actions  may  be  taken  by  regulatory agencies. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to BASF's financial results.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nFurthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are defendants in  or  parties  to  a  variety  of  judicial,  arbitrational  or  regulatory proceedings on a recurring basis. To our current knowledge, none of these proceedings will have a material effect on the economic situation of BASF.",

Furthermore, BASF SE assumed guarantees to the Danish Energy Agency  covering  all  obligations  of  Wintershall  Dea  International GmbH and Wintershall Noordzee B.V. related to licenses for exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons  in  the  Danish concession area. In addition, BASF  SE provides guarantees for restoration  obligations  of  Wintershall  Dea  Norge  AS  related  to various oil and gas facilities acquired from Equinor. The guarantees do not stipulate a maximum amount. The risk of a claim being exercised against the guarantees is classified as low.\n\nThe  decline  in  liabilities  from initiated  investment  projects is mainly attributable to the completion of various large-scale projects in 2020.\n\n## Obligations arising from purchase contracts\n\nObligations arising from purchase contracts resulted primarily from long-term purchase obligations for raw materials.

Financial assets are derecognized when BASF no longer has a contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset or when the financial asset is transferred together with all material risks and rewards of ownership and BASF does not have control of the financial asset after it has been transferred. For example, receivables are derecognized when they are definitively found to be uncollectible. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligations expire, are discharged or cancelled. Regular-way  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  instruments  are accounted for using the settlement date; in precious metal trading, the trade date is used.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If pricing on an active market is available, for example in the form of exchange prices, these are used as the basis for the measurement. Otherwise, the measurement is based on either internal measurement models using current market parameters or external measurements, for example, from banks. These internal measurements rely predominantly on the net present value method and option pricing models. These models incorporate, for example, expected future cash flows as well as discount factors adjusted for term and, potentially, risk. Depending on the availability of market parameters, BASF assigns financial instruments' market values one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy pursuant to IFRS 13. Reassignment to a different level during a fiscal year is only carried out if the availability",

        "page_content": "of  observable  market  parameters  for  identical  or  similar  items changes.\n\nExcept for financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, IFRS 9 requires the recognition of impairments for expected credit losses, independent of the existence of any actual default events and individual impairments if evidence of a permanent need for impairment exists. If this evidence no longer exists, the impairment is reversed in the statement of income up to the carrying amount of the asset had the default event not occurred. Impairments are generally recognized in separate accounts.\n\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the 'solely payments of principle and interest' criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset  portfolios.  Based  on  these  two  criteria,  BASF  uses  the following measurement categories for financial assets:\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS  9. At BASF, derivatives, for example, are allocated to this measurement category. In general, BASF does not exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.\n- -Financial assets measured at amortized cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At BASF, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivable, as well as receivables reported under other receivables and miscellaneous assets and certain securities.\n\nInitial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement effects are recognized in income using the effective interest method.\n\nImpairments are recognized for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event. Counterparties are generally considered to default  when  they  become  insolvent,  become  a  debtor  in  a creditor  protection  program  or  are  in  a  finance-related  legal dispute  with  BASF,  or  more  than  half  of  BASF's  receivables portfolio with them is more than 90 days overdue. In these cases, individual impairments are recognized for the financial assets measured at amortized cost that are then considered to be credit impaired. In addition, an impairment must be recognized when the contractual conditions that form the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of the future cash flows decreases.\n\nThe extent of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, expected credit losses are generally  recognized over the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments  are  generally  only  recognized  as  12-month  expected credit  losses.  By  contrast,  under  the  simplified  approach  for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments  for  receivables  such  as  lease  receivables  and  trade\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\naccounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable  concerned.\n\nAt BASF, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information and external rating information on the respective  counterparty.  A  significant  increase  in  the  counterparty's credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed  for  trade  accounts  receivable  or  lease  receivables. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly.\n\nRegional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the extent of impairment as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual impairments. In addition, BASF uses internal and  external  ratings  and  the  assessments  of  debt  collection agencies and credit insurers, when available. Individual impairments are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks. Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortized cost, are likewise considered when calculating impairments. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. Expected  credit  losses  and  individual  impairments  are  only calculated for those receivables that are not covered by insurance or other collateral. Impairments on receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible.\n\nA decrease in impairment due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the  impairment  is  recorded  in  profit  or  loss.  Reversals  of impairments may not exceed amortized cost, less any expected future credit losses.",

Furthermore, the assets in this measurement category may not just be held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows over their term, but also generating cash flows from their sale. At BASF, certain securities that are classified as debt instruments are allocated to this category. BASF does not exercise the option to subse quently measure  equity  instruments  through  other  comprehensive income.\n\nAssets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value,  which  usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities allocated to this category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of.\n\nImpairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe  following  measurement  categories  are  used  for  financial liabilities:\n\n- -Financial  liabilities  measured  at  amortized  cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognized in profit or loss at amortized cost using the effective interest method. At BASF, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial indebtedness are measured at amortized cost.\n- -Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities. These are likewise measured at the value of the consideration received as the fair value of the liability on the date of initial recognition. Fair value is also applied as a measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement.  The  option  to  subsequently  measure  non-derivative financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised.\n\nDerivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS policies require separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is accounted for at fair value in its entirety.\n\nFinancial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts that require compensation payments to be made to the guarantee holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due under the terms of a transaction entered into with the holder of the guarantee. Financial guarantees issued by BASF are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In subsequent periods, these financial guarantees are carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best estimate of the present obligation as of the reporting date.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nIn cash flow hedges , future cash flows and the related income and expenses are hedged against the risk of changes in fair value. To this end, future underlying transactions and the corresponding hedging instruments  are  designated  to  a  cash  flow  hedge  accounting relationship for accounting purposes. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, which often meets the definition of a derivative, and the cost of hedging are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive income over the term of the hedge, taking deferred taxes into account. The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. In the case of future transactions that lead to recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the cumulative fair value changes of the hedge in equity are generally charged against the cost of the hedged item on its initial recognition. For hedges based on financial assets, financial liabilities or future transactions, cumulative fair value changes of the hedges are transferred from equity to the income statement in the reporting period in which the hedged item is recognized in the income statement. The maturity of the hedging instrument is aligned with the effective date of the future transaction.\n\nWhen fair value hedge accounting is used, the asset or liability recognized is hedged against the risk of a change in fair value. The hedging instruments used, which often take the form of a derivative, are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income. The carrying amounts of the assets or liabilities designated as the underlying transaction are also  measured at fair value through the statement of income.",

Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing rate of financial receivables, loans, securities, cash and financial liabilities  into  the  functional  currency  of  the  respective  Group company. Foreign currency contracts in various currencies are used to  hedge  foreign  exchange  risks  from  nonderivative  financial instruments and planned transactions.\n\nThe foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments that are exposed to currency risks. In addition, planned purchase and sales transactions of the respective following year are included if they fall under the currency risk management system. Long and short positions in the same currency are offset against each other.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a 5% and 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency against the other currencies. A 5% appreciation of the respective functional currency would  have  reduced  BASF's  income  before  income  taxes  by \u20ac203 million as of December 31, 2020. A 10% appreciation of the respective functional currency would have resulted in a negative effect on BASF's income before income taxes in the amount of \u20ac390 million. A 5% appreciation of the respective functional  currency resulted in an effect on BASF's income in the amount of -\u20ac187 million as of December 31, 2019 (-\u20ac356 million with a 10% appreciation). The effect from the items designated under hedge accounting would have increased shareholders' equity before income taxes by \u20ac36 million applying a 5% increase to the functional currency and by \u20ac78 million applying a 10% increase to the functional currency as of December 31, 2020 (2019: increase of \u20ac19 million applying a 5%\n\nincrease to the functional currency and increase of \u20ac40  million applying a 10% increase to the functional currency). This only refers to transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\n## Exposure and sensitivity by currency\n\n| Million \u20ac   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|             | Exposure            | Sensitivity         | Sensitivity         | Exposure            | Sensitivity         | Sensitivity         |\n|             |                     | +5%                 | +10%                |                     | +5%                 | +10%                |\n| USD         | 1,965               | -101                | -190                | 1,977               | -111                | -209                |\n| Other       | 1,117               | -66                 | -123                | 1,037               | -56                 | -106                |\n| Total       | 3,082               | -167                | -313                | 3,014               | -167                | -315                |\n\nDue to the use of options to hedge currency risks, the sensitivity analysis is not a linear function of the assumed changes in exchange rates.\n\nInterest rate risks: Interest rate risks arise from changes in  prevailing market interest rates, which can lead to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments and in interest payments for variable-rate instruments. Interest rate swaps and combined interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases to hedge these risks. The derivatives are presented in Note 26.5. Interest rate risks are relevant to BASF's financing activities but are not of material significance for BASF's operating activities.\n\nThe variable interest risk exposure, which also includes fixed rate bonds maturing in the following year, amounted to -\u20ac1,659 million as of December 31, 2020 (2019: -\u20ac1,414 million). An increase in all relevant interest rates by one half of a percentage point would have lowered income before income taxes by \u20ac5 million as of December  31, 2020. An increase in all relevant interest rates by one percentage point would have lowered income before income taxes by \u20ac10 million as of the same date. An increase in all relevant  interest rates by one half of a percentage point would have lowered income before income taxes by \u20ac3 million as of December 31, 2019 (an\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nincrease of one percentage point would have lowered income  before income taxes by \u20ac6 million). Because no interest derivatives were designated  to  hedge  accounting  relationships  as  of  December 31, 2020, a change in interest rates would not have had an effect on shareholders' equity. If the relevant interest rates had changed by one half of a percentage point, the before-tax effect from items designated under hedge accounting would have been an immaterial increase in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2019 (increase of \u20ac1 million applying a 1% change in interest rates).\n\n## Carrying amount of nonderivative interest-bearing financial instruments\n\n| Million \u20ac               | December 31, 2020     | December 31, 2020        | December 31, 2019     | December 31, 2019        |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n|                         | Fixed   interest rate | Variable   interest rate | Fixed   interest rate | Variable   interest rate |\n| Loans                   | 75                    | 115                      | 156                   | 255                      |\n| Securities              | 51                    | 206                      | 89                    | 490                      |\n| Financial  indebtedness | 17,742                | 1,472                    | 15,848                | 2,529                    |",

These result primarily from raw materials (for example naphtha, benzene, natural gas, LPG condensate)  as  well  as  from  precious  metals.  BASF  takes  the following  measures  to  reduce  price  risks  associated  with  the purchase of raw materials:\n\n- - BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge risks from the  volatility of raw materials prices. These are primarily options on crude oil, oil products and natural gas.\n- - The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and long-term purchase  contracts  with  precious  metal  and  battery  metal producers. It also buys precious metals on spot markets from various business partners. The price risk from metals purchased to be sold on to third parties, or for use in the production of catalysts  and  battery  materials,  is  hedged  using  derivative instruments. This is mainly performed using forward contracts, which are settled by either entering into offsetting contracts or by delivering the precious metal.\n- - In the Agricultural Solutions division, the sales prices of products are  sometimes  pegged  to  the  price  of  certain  agricultural commodities.  To  hedge  the  resulting  risks,  derivatives  on agricultural commodities are concluded.\n\nIn addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and oil product positions, which can also include derivatives, for trading on\n\nits own account. The value of these positions is exposed to market price volatility and is subject to constant monitoring.\n\nBy  holding  commodity  derivatives  and  precious  metal  trading positions,  BASF  is  exposed  to  price  risks.  The  valuation  of commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions at fair value means that adverse changes in market prices could  negatively affect the earnings and equity of BASF.\n\nBASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity derivatives and precious metal trading positions. Using the value-at-risk  analysis enables continual quantification of market risk and  forecasting of the maximum possible loss within a given confidence interval over a defined period. The value-at-risk calculation is based on a confidence interval of 95% and a holding period of one day. BASF uses the variance-covariance approach.\n\nBASF uses value at risk in conjunction with other risk management tools. Besides value at risk, BASF sets volume-based limits as well as exposure and stop-loss limits.\n\n## Exposure to commodity derivatives\n\n| Million \u20ac                                   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                             | Exposure            | Value at risk       | Exposure            | Value at risk       |\n| Crude oil, oil  products  and  natural  gas | 56                  | 5                   | 87                  | 3                   |\n| Precious metals                             | 88                  | 1                   | 112                 | 2                   |\n| Agricultural  commodities                   | 37                  | 0                   | 163                 | 0                   |\n\nThe exposure corresponds to the net amount of all long and short positions of the respective commodity category.\n\n- For more information on BASF's financial risks and risk management, see Opportunities and Risks from page 158 onward\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Default and credit risk\n\nDefault and credit risks arise when customers and debtors do not fulfill  their  contractual  obligations.

The carrying amount of all receivables, loans  and  interest-bearing  securities  plus  the  nominal  value  of financial obligations stemming from contingent liabilities not to be recognized represents the maximum default risk for BASF.\n\nFor more information on credit risks, see Note 18 from page 275 onward\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nBASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as part of liquidity planning.

Derivatives with positive fair values are assets and are therefore not taken into account.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Maturities of contractual cash flows from financial liabilities as of December 31, 2020\n\n| Million \u20ac           | Bonds and   other liabilities to  the capital market   | Liabilities to credit  institutions   | Accounts   payable,   trade   |   Derivative   liabilities | Miscellaneous   liabilities   | Total   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| 2021                | 2,531                                                  | 1,128                                 | 5,276                         |                         76 | 749                           | 9,760   |\n| 2022                | 2,161                                                  | 295                                   | 12                            |                        287 | 267                           | 3,022   |\n| 2023                | 2,150                                                  | 301                                   | 3                             |                        103 | 178                           | 2,735   |\n| 2024                | 673                                                    | 868                                   | -                             |                         28 | 132                           | 1,701   |\n| 2025                | 1,749                                                  | 215                                   | -                             |                         70 | 91                            | 2,125   |\n| 2026 and thereafter | 8,133                                                  | 1,035                                 | -                             |                         80 | 605                           | 9,853   |\n| Total               | 17,397                                                 | 3,842                                 | 5,291                         |                        644 | 2,022                         | 29,196  |\n\n## Maturities of contractual cash flows from financial liabilities as of December 31, 2019\n\n| Million \u20ac           | Bonds and   other liabilities to  the capital market   | Liabilities to   credit institutions   | Accounts   payable,   trade   | Derivative   liabilities   | Miscellaneous   liabilities   | Total   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| 2020                | 2,483                                                  | 1,149                                  | 5,087                         | 404                        | 969                           | 10,092  |\n| 2021                | 1,252                                                  | 89                                     | -                             | 146                        | 334                           | 1,821   |\n| 2022                | 2,244                                                  | 212                                    | -                             | 52                         | 209                           | 2,717   |\n| 2023                | 1,239                                                  | 221                                    | -                             | 31                         | 139                           | 1,630   |\n| 2024                | 683                                                    | 776                                    | -                             | -                          | 101                           | 1,560   |\n| 2025 and thereafter | 9,541                                                  | 888                                    | -                             | 101                        | 493                           | 11,023  |\n| Total               | 17,442                                                 | 3,335                                  | 5,087                         | 734                        | 2,245                         | 28,843  |",

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: \u20ac439 million). Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is applied to shareholdings for which valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.\n- b AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 26.1 from page 291 onward.\n- c Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.\n- d Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.\n- e Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.\n- f Does not include separately shown derivatives or receivables and liabilities from finance leases. If miscellaneous receivables are valued at fair value through profit or loss, their valuation is generally based on parameters observable on the market. These are adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective assets in the fair value.",

For positive fair values of combined interest rate and currency swaps, the respective counterparties provided cash collaterals in an amount comparable to the outstanding fair values.\n\nDeviations  from  the  derivatives  with  positive  fair  values  and derivatives with negative fair values reported in other receivables and  other  liabilities  at  the  end  of  2020  and  2019  arose  from derivatives not subject to any netting agreements as well as from embedded derivatives. These are therefore not included in the table above.\n\nIn addition to the offsetting of derivatives presented in the table above, trade accounts receivable in 2020 were offset against trade accounts payable and advance payments received on orders, which\n\nwere included in current other liabilities, provided specific netting agreements with customers existed. As a result, trade accounts receivable were reduced by \u20ac616 million. The reduction in trade accounts payable was \u20ac45  million and the reduction in advance payments received on orders was \u20ac571 million.  Accordingly, the net amount for trade accounts receivable was \u20ac9,466 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac10,082 million). The net amount for trade accounts  payable  was  \u20ac5,291  million  (gross  amount  before offsetting: \u20ac5,336 million). The net amount for advance payments received on orders was \u20ac679 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac1,250 million). In 2019, trade accounts receivable were only offset against  the  advance  payments  received  on  orders  included  in current other liabilities. Both balance sheet items were reduced by \u20ac647  million.  Accordingly,  the  net  amount  for  trade  accounts receivable  was  \u20ac9,093  million  (gross  amount  before  offsetting: \u20ac9,740  million). The resulting net amount for advance payments received on orders was \u20ac537 million (gross amount before offsetting: \u20ac1,184 million).",

        "page_content": "## 26.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedge  accounting\n\n## The use of derivative financial instruments\n\nBASF is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks during the normal course of business. These risks are hedged using derivative instruments as necessary in accordance with  a  centrally  determined  strategy.  Hedging  is  employed  for existing underlying transactions from the product business, cash investments and financing as well as for planned sales, raw material purchases and capital measures. Furthermore, hedging is also used for cash flows from acquisitions and divestitures. The risks from the hedged items and the derivatives are continually monitored. Where derivatives have a positive market value, BASF is exposed to credit risks from derivative transactions in the event of nonperformance of the other party. To minimize the default risk on derivatives with positive market values, transactions are exclusively conducted with creditworthy banks and partners and are subject to predefined credit limits.\n\nTo ensure efficient risk management, risk positions are centralized at BASF  SE  and  certain  Group  companies.  The  contracting  and execution of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes are conducted according to internal guidelines, and subject to strict control mechanisms.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated using valuation models that use input parameters observable on the market. Exceptions to this are some commodity derivatives, whose valuation is based directly on market prices.\n\nIn addition to the derivative instruments presented in the following table, BASF also has derivatives that are embedded in other  financial instruments. This primarily relates to options embedded in a loan on the borrower's equity instruments. The fair value of these derivatives was \u20ac33 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## Fair value of derivative instruments\n\n| Million \u20ac                                                                       |                   |                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                 | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2019 |\n| Foreign currency forward contracts                                              | 10                | 26                |\n| Foreign currency options                                                        | 35                | 22                |\n| Foreign currency derivatives                                                    | 45                | 48                |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | 35                | 18                |\n| Interest rate swaps                                                             | -                 | -4                |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | -                 | -4                |\n| Combined interest rate and currency swaps                                       | -163              | 60                |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | 90                | 138               |\n| Interest derivatives                                                            | -163              | 56                |\n| Commodity derivatives                                                           | -321              | -186              |\n| of which designated hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9 (hedge accounting) | 7                 | 6                 |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                | -439              | -82               |\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nBASF is exposed to commodity price risks in the context of  procuring naphtha. Some of the planned purchases of naphtha are hedged using  swaps  and  options  on  oil  and  oil  products.  The  main contractual  elements  of  these  items  are  aligned  with  the characteristics of the hedged item. Cash flow hedge accounting was employed for a portion of these hedging relationships in 2020 and 2019. The average exercise price of the designated options was $454.45 per metric ton as of December  31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: $529.53 per metric ton). Cash flows from designated hedging instruments and hedged transactions occur in the following year and are also recognized in profit or loss for that year.\n\nFurthermore, cash flow hedge accounting continued to be employed to a minor extent for procuring natural gas, which is likewise  exposed\n\nto commodity price risks. Commodity price-based options serve as hedging instruments, for which contract terms are defined to reflect the risks of the hedged item. Depending on where trading took place, the average exercise price of the designated options was \u20ac13.35 per MWh or $2.7410 per mmBtu as of December 31, 2020. The average exercise price of the designated options was $2.4539 per mmBtu as of December 31, 2019. Cash flows from the hedging transaction and hedged item are generally recognized in profit or loss for the following year.\n\nThe change in the options' time value is recognized separately in equity as costs of transaction-related hedging and, in the year during which the hedged items mature, it is initially derecognized against the carrying amount of the procured assets and recognized in profit or loss when the assets are consumed. In 2020, a decrease in fair value of \u20ac17 million was recognized in equity attributable to",

In 2019, a decrease in fair value  of  \u20ac3  million  was  recognized  in  equity  attributable  to shareholders of BASF SE, and \u20ac2 million was derecognized against the carrying amount of the assets.\n\nBASF's planned soybean procurement is also exposed to  commodity price risks. These commodity price risks are hedged with soybean futures. The contractual conditions for these hedging transactions correspond to the respective hedged item, and some are  designated as cash flow hedge accounting relationships. The average price hedged using these instruments was $12.5175 per bushel as of December  31, 2020 (December  31, 2019: $9.4559 per bushel). Cash flows from these futures and the hedged expected future transactions are generally recognized in profit or loss for the  following year.\n\nBASF is exposed to foreign currency risks due to planned sales in U.S. dollars. To some extent, cash flow hedge accounting is applied using currency options. The hedged transaction - the designated share of expected sales in U.S. dollars - is calculated based on internal thresholds. The hedged volume is always below the total amount of expected sales in U.S. dollars for the following fiscal year. The average hedged rate was $1.1583 per euro as of December 31, 2020, and $1.1105 per euro in the previous year.  The impact on earnings from designated transactions in 2020 will be recognized in  the  following  year.  The  decrease  in  the  options'  time  value component  arising  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac30  million  in  2020  was recognized separately in equity as the cost of hedging and resulted in a reduction in equity. Accumulated changes in the options' time values were reclassified to profit or loss due to the maturity of hedged items in the amount of \u20ac34 million. In 2019, -\u20ac38 million was recognized separately in equity as a change in the options' time value component, and \u20ac35 million was reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nThe interest rate risk of the variable-rate bonds issued by BASF SE in 2013 was hedged using interest rate swaps, which converted the bonds into fixed-interest rate bonds with a rate of 1.45%. The key terms  of  the  interest  rate  swap  contracts  used  as  hedging instruments generally correspond to the contractual elements of the hedged item. The bond and the interest rate swaps were designated to hedge accounting. The hedge relationship ended in 2020 due to maturity of the hedging transaction and hedged item.\n\nFurthermore,  BASF  SE's  fixed-rate  U.S.  private  placement  of $1.25  billion,  issued  in  2013,  was  converted  to  euros  using cross-currency swaps, as the private placement exposes BASF to a combined  interest/currency  risk.  The  hedged  interest  rate  was 4.13% in the fiscal years 2020 and 2019. The hedged foreign exchange rate in both years was $1.3589 per euro. This hedge was designated as a cash flow hedge.\n\nIn 2020, the expected sale price associated with the disposal of the construction  chemicals  and  pigments  businesses  was  partially hedged against exchange rate fluctuations. The occurrence of the hedged  transactions  was,  due  to  contractual  agreements, considered highly probable; and the transactions and derivatives used for hedging were designated to a cash flow hedge accounting relationship.  The  hedge  was  initially  achieved  through  foreign currency forward contracts and, following the discontinuation of this hedging relationship, with foreign currency options. Both cases were transaction-related hedges. The change in the forward rate and the change in the time value component are recognized as hedging costs at a point in time. These costs were recognized in BASF Group equity in the amount of -\u20ac18 million  Due to the sale of the construction chemicals business as of September  30,  2020, \u20ac11 million was reclassified to profit or loss and included in disposal gains  from  the  discontinued  construction  chemicals  business. There was no ineffectiveness at any time during the year. The average  hedged  rate  was  $1.1964  per  euro  as  of  December 31, 2020.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nThe effects of the hedging relationships on the balance sheet, the cash flow hedge reserve, hedged nominal value and ineffectiveness to be determined are presented in the following tables by fiscal year.",

Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve for  commodity price risks are derecognized against the carrying amount of acquired assets  once  the  hedged  transaction  occurs.  Thus,  there  is  no immediate reclassification of the amounts recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss in these cases.\n\nIn connection with its catalyst production, BASF is exposed to commodity price risks associated with holding physical precious metal items. These production-related precious metal inventories are hedged with forward contracts in accordance with a defined hedging  strategy.  In  2020,  a  portion  of  these  precious  metal inventories was designated for the first time to a fair value hedge accounting  relationship  with  forward  contracts  on  the  precious metals. Changes in the forward rate were considered costs of hedging, and \u20ac2  million was recognized in other comprehensive income  and  reclassified  successively  to  profit  or  loss,  being  a time-period-related hedge.  All hedging instruments expired in 2020. The hedged precious metals were sold.  Cash flows in connection with the hedging instruments were recognized in profit or loss in 2020.

This transfer was not cash effective and therefore had no effect on the statement of cash flows.\n\nCash  flows  from  investing  activities  included  \u20ac1,240  million  in payments made for acquisitions for the polyamide business  acquired from Solvay (2019: \u20ac239 million for various transactions).\n\nIn 2020, payments received for divestitures arose in the amount of \u20ac2,520  million  due  to  the  sale  of  the  construction  chemicals business. These included tax payments in the amount of \u20ac150 million that were directly associated with the transaction. In 2019, payments received for divestitures recognized in the amount of \u20ac2,600 million were mainly due to the merger of the oil and gas businesses of Wintershall and DEA. The effects of the deconsolidation of the Wintershall companies and the simultaneous recognition\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nof the equity-accounted interest in Wintershall Dea GmbH offset each other. The only effect on cash was the outflow of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of \u20ac800 million, as well as the repayment of BASF SE's open finance-related receivables against the Wintershall Dea group and capital decreases at Wintershall Dea  GmbH, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany, in the total amount of \u20ac3.2 billion. In connection with the transfer of the paper and water chemicals  business to the Solenis group in the first quarter of 2019, the  majority of the purchase price was settled with the contribution of the interest in Solenis UK International Limited, London, United Kingdom (\u20ac590 million). The rest of the purchase price (\u20ac178 million) was recognized in cash.\n\n- For more information on acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 from page 235 onward\n\nPayments made for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac3,129 million, \u20ac695 million lower than in the previous year.\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand and bank balances with maturities of less than three months.\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the amount of \u20ac4,335 million reported in the statement of cash flows as of December 31, 2020, consisted of the balance sheet value (\u20ac4,330 million) and the value reclassified to the pigments business disposal group (\u20ac5 million). Cash and cash equivalents in the amount of \u20ac2,455 million reported in the  statement of cash flows as of December 31, 2019, consisted of the balance sheet value (\u20ac2,427 million) and the values reclassified to the disposal groups for the construction chemicals business (\u20ac21 million) and the pigments business (\u20ac7 million). At the beginning of the 2019 reporting period, the cash and cash equivalents of the oil and gas business (\u20ac219 million) were reclassified to the disposal group.\n\n- For more information on the contribution of discontinued operations on BASF's statement of cash flows, see Note 3 from page 235 onward",

The objectives of the company's financing policy are to ensure solvency, limit financial risks and optimize the cost of capital.\n\nCapital structure management focuses on meeting the requirements needed to ensure unrestricted access to the capital market and a solid A rating. The capital structure is managed using selected financial ratios, such as dynamic debt ratios, as part of the  company's financial planning.\n\nThe equity of the BASF Group as reported in the balance sheet amounted to \u20ac34,398 million as of December 31, 2020 (December  31, 2019: \u20ac42,350  million); the equity ratio was 42.8% on December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 48.7%).\n\nBASF prefers to access external financing on the capital markets.

This  amount  included proportional personnel expenses for 2020 from the disposal group for the construction chemicals business in the amount of \u20ac291 million.  In 2019, personnel expenses from the disposal groups for the construction chemicals business and proportionally for the oil and gas  business  totaled  \u20ac557  million.  The  decrease  in  personnel expenses was primarily due to lower bonus provisions and the lower average number of employees which resulted, in particular, from the divestiture of the construction chemicals business. A higher wage and salary level as well as higher pension expenses because of increased service costs had an offsetting effect.\n\n## Personnel expenses\n\n| Million \u20ac                                              |        |        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                        | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Wages and salaries                                     | 8,416  | 8,825  |\n| Social security contributions and assistance  expenses | 1,424  | 1,545  |\n| Pension expenses                                       | 736    | 554    |\n| Personnel expenses                                     | 10,576 | 10,924 |",

        "page_content": "- 3 Corporate Governance\n\n## Number of employees\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the number of employees decreased to 110,302  employees  compared  with  117,628  employees  as  of December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to the sale of the  construction  chemicals  business,  which  affected  around 7,500  employees.  An  offsetting  factor  was  the  acquisition  of Solvay's  polyamide  business  due  to  which  the  BASF  Group's number of employees rose by around 1,200 people - including the employees  of  the  Butachimie  SNC  and  Alsachimie  S.A.S.  joint operations, both in Chalamp\u00e9, France - which were counted on a pro rata basis.\n\nAs of December  31, 2020, a total of 1,137 employees (2019: 96 employees) worked at joint operations. The rise was mainly due to additions related to the aforementioned acquisition of Solvay's polyamide business.\n\nThe development of the number of employees was distributed over the regions as follows:\n\n## Number of employees as of December 31\n\n|                                    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Europe                             | 68,849  | 72,153  |\n| of which Germany                   | 51,961  | 54,028  |\n| North America                      | 16,948  | 19,355  |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 17,753  | 18,634  |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 6,752   | 7,486   |\n| BASF Group                         | 110,302 | 117,628 |\n| of which apprentices and trainees  | 3,120   | 3,161   |\n| temporary staff                    | 2,128   | 2,606   |\n\nThe average number of employees was distributed over the regions as follows:\n\n## Average number of employees\n\n|                                    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Europe                             | 71,329  | 73,126  |\n| of which Germany                   | 53,080  | 54,722  |\n| North America                      | 18,599  | 19,624  |\n| Asia Pacific                       | 18,719  | 18,843  |\n| South America, Africa, Middle East | 7,326   | 7,607   |\n| BASF Group                         | 115,973 | 119,200 |\n| of which apprentices and trainees  | 2,821   | 2,811   |\n| temporary staff                    | 2,518   | 2,922   |\n\nEmployees from joint operations are included in the average number of employees relative to BASF's share in the company. On average, these had a total of 1,055 employees (2019: 206 employees).\n\nThe BASF Group's average number of employees for 2020 included 5,400  employees  from  the  disposal  group  for  the  construction chemicals business (2019: 6,801 employees).\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n29\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs and BASF incentive share program\n\n## Share price-based compensation programs\n\nThe  BASF  Group  offered  its  share  price-based  compensation program (the long-term incentive (LTI) program) known as BOP (BASF Option Program), which started in 1999, for the last time in 2020.  Effective  retroactively  as  of  January  1,  2020,  a  new  LTI program - known as Strive! - was also introduced in the form of a performance  share  plan.  Generally,  members  of  the  Board  of Executive   Directors  and  all  senior  executives  are  entitled  to participate in the LTI programs.\n\n## BASF Option Program (BOP)\n\nThis program grants virtual option rights. When exercised, the  option rights are settled in cash.\n\nIn accordance with the program's deadline requirement, approximately 1,100 people, in particular members of the Board of Executive Directors and senior executives, were eligible to  participate in the BOP program as of April 1, 2020. Around 90% of those eligible participated.\n\nParticipation in BOP is voluntary. In order to take part in the  program, a participant must make a personal investment: Participants are required to hold BASF shares representing between 10% and 30% of their respective variable compensation for a two-year period from the granting of the option (holding period). The number of shares to be held is determined by the amount of variable compensation and the volume-weighted average market price of BASF shares on the first trading day after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which was \u20ac51.26 on June 19, 2020.",

        "page_content": "Participants receive four option rights per invested share. Each option consists of two parts, right A and right B, which may be exercised if defined thresholds have been met: The threshold of right A is met if the price of the BASF share has increased by more than 30% in comparison with the base price on the option grant date (absolute threshold). The value of right A is the difference between the market price of BASF shares on the exercise date and the base price; it is limited to 100% of the base price. If the  cumulative percentage performance of BASF shares exceeds the percentage performance of the MSCI World Chemicals Index SM (MSCI Chemicals), right B may be exercised (relative threshold). The value of right B is the base price of the option multiplied by twice the percentage by which the BASF share outperforms the MSCI Chemicals Index on the exercise date. It is limited to the closing price on the date of  exercise less the calculated nominal value of the BASF share. From the 2013 BOP program onward, right B may only be exercised if the price of the BASF share equals at least the base price. The options granted as of July  1, 2020 may be exercised between July  1, 2022, and June  30, 2028, following a two-year vesting period. During the exercise period, there are certain times (closed periods) during which the options may not be exercised. Each option can only be exercised in full. This means that one of the thresholds must be  exceeded. If the other threshold is not exceeded and the option is exercised, the other option right lapses. A participant's maximum gain from exercising an option is limited to five times the original  individual investment starting with the 2013 BOP program. Option rights are nontransferable and are forfeited if the option holders no longer work for the BASF Group or have sold part of their individual investment before the expiry of the two-year vesting period. They remain valid in the case of retirement. For the members of the Board of Executive Directors, the long-term orientation of the program is significantly strengthened compared with the conditions applying to the other participants. Members of the Board of Executive Directors are required to participate in the BOP program with at least 10% of their actual annual variable compensation. In view of this binding personal investment (in the form of BASF shares), an extended holding period of four years applies. Members\n\nof the Board of  Executive Directors may only exercise their option rights four years after they have been granted at the earliest (vesting period).\n\nThe 2013 to 2019 programs are similar in structure to the 2020 BOP program.\n\nThe models used in the valuation of the option plans are based on the arbitrage-free valuation model according to Black-Scholes. The fair values of the options are determined using the binomial model.\n\n## Fair value of options and parameters used as of December 31, 2020\n\n|                                               |    |   BOP program of the year |   BOP program of the year |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                               |    |                   2020    |                   2019    |\n| Fair  value                                   | \u20ac  |                     27.95 |                     17.48 |\n| Dividend yield                                | %  |                      5.1  |                      5.1  |\n| Risk-free interest rate                       | %  |                     -0.67 |                     -0.7  |\n| Volatility BASF share                         | %  |                     28.22 |                     29.32 |\n| Volatility MSCI Chemicals                     | %  |                     17.87 |                     18.71 |\n| Correlation BASF share price - MSCI Chemicals | %  |                     79.66 |                     80.05 |\n\nThe stated fair values and the valuation parameters relate to the 2020 and 2019 BOP programs. The fair value calculation was based on  the  assumption  that  options  will  be  exercised  in  a  manner dependent on their potential gains. For the programs from  preceding years, corresponding fair values and valuation parameters were determined/used.\n\nVolatility was determined on the basis of the monthly closing prices over a historical period corresponding to the remaining term of the options.\n\nThe number of options granted amounted to 1,693,748 in 2020 (2019: 2,099,028).\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\nAs a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive Directors in 2002 to settle option rights in cash, all outstanding option rights under the 2013 to 2020 programs were valued at fair value as of December  31, 2020. A proportionate provision is recognized for programs in the vesting period. The LTI provision for BOP increased from \u20ac90 million as of December 31, 2019 to \u20ac115 million as of December 31, 2020, due to higher fair values of the outstanding option rights. No utilization of provisions was recognized in 2019 or 2020.  The expense from the addition of provisions totaled \u20ac25 million in 2020 and \u20ac34 million in 2019. Of this amount, \u20ac1 million was attributable to the disposal group for the discontinued pigments business in 2020 and \u20ac1 million for the discontinued construction chemicals business in 2019.\n\nThe  exercisable  options  had  no  intrinsic  value  as  of  December 31, 2020 or as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## Strive!\n\nIn 2020, a new LTI program - known as Strive! - was established in the form of a performance share plan for senior executives and members of the Board of Executive Directors. The new LTI plan is based on achievement of strategic targets and takes into account BASF's share price and dividend performance (total shareholder return) over a four-year period.  Participation in Strive! is voluntary and  is  linked  to  a  share  ownership  obligation.  Approximately 700 people were eligible to participate in Strive! in 2020. In contrast to the BOP  program, Strive! offers rolling eligibility, without a deadline for  participation. Members of the Board of Executive Directors as well as about 90 % of eligible senior executives participated.\n\nA Strive! plan includes a four-year performance period with a fixed disbursement date.  A target amount is determined at the beginning of a new Strive! plan for every participant. This target amount is converted into a preliminary number of virtual performance share units (PSUs) by dividing it by the average BASF share price in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The number of PSUs that are",

        "page_content": "ultimately paid out at the end of the performance period depends on the  achievement  of  the  three  strategic  targets:  growth  (volume growth  compared  with  global  chemical  production),  profitability (increase in EBITDA before special items) and sustainability (CO2 emissions).\n\nAchievement of each strategic target is calculated for each year of the four-year performance period. Upon conclusion of the performance period, the average degree of target achievement for each strategic goal is equal to the arithmetic mean of the degrees of target achievement for the four years. The total target achievement for Strive!2020 is determined by adding the target achievement degree for the three strategic targets after having multiplied each by the corresponding weighting factor. To calculate the final number of PSUs,  this  weighted  target  achievement  is  multiplied  by  the preliminary number of PSUs. The payment amount upon conclusion of the four-year performance period is calculated by multiplying the final number of PSUs by the average BASF share price for the fourth quarter of the last year of the performance period, plus the accumulated dividend payments in the four fiscal years. The payment occurs in May of the following year and is capped at 200% of the target amount. The payment amount therefore not only reflects achievement of the strategic targets, but performance of BASF's dividend and share price as well (total shareholder return).\n\nLike BOP, a personal investment in BASF shares is a prerequisite for participation in Strive!. Participants are required to own BASF shares amounting to a predetermined percentage of their base salary for the duration of the performance period. A set-up phase applies to first-time participants. During this period, they are required to hold a percentage of shares as their predetermined personal investment. The set-up phase for 2020 ends on December 31, 2023.\n\n## Fair value of PSUs and parameters used as of December 31, 2020\n\n|                             |    | Strive! program of the   year   | Strive! program of the   year   |\n|-----------------------------|----|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                             |    | 2020                            | 2019                            |\n| Number of PSUs granted      |    | 767,308                         | -                               |\n| Number of PSUs vested       |    | 191,827                         | -                               |\n| Fair value / PSU            | \u20ac  | 55.04                           | -                               |\n| Weighted target achievement | %  | 92.50                           | -                               |\n| Base price                  | \u20ac  | 64.72                           | -                               |\n| Dividend                    | \u20ac  | 3.30                            | -                               |\n\nThe number of PSUs granted amounted to 767,308 in 2020. PSUs vested by the deadline totaled 191,827 and were recognized at fair value in the amount of \u20ac55.04 in 2020. Fair value is determined using the BASF share price of \u20ac64.72 on the balance sheet date and the dividend payment of \u20ac3.30 in 2020, plus expected dividend payments during the term of the program. The weighted target achievement degree of 92.50 % in 2020 is also taken into account. A fluctuation rate of 4 % is assumed in the fair value calculation.\n\nThe  resulting  LTI  provision  for  Strive!  totaled  \u20ac11  million  as  of December 31, 2020. As Strive! was offered for the first time in 2020, it represents an addition to provisions.  No provisions were allocated to the disposal group.\n\nThe same plan conditions generally apply to members of the Board of Executive Directors. Unlike for senior executives, share ownership obligation is not voluntary for the Board of Executive Directors and is outlined in their service contracts.\n\n- 4 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes\n\n## BASF 'Plus' Incentive Share Program\n\nThe 'plus' incentive share program was introduced in 1999 and is currently  available  to  employees  in  Germany,  other  European countries and Mexico. Simultaneous participation in both the 'plus' program and an LTI program is not permitted.\n\nEmployees who participate in BASF's 'plus' incentive share  program and acquire shares in BASF as a personal investment from their variable compensation. For every 10 BASF shares purchased in the program, a participant receives one BASF share at no cost after one, three, five, seven and 10 years of holding these shares. As a rule, the first and second block of 10 shares entitles the participant to receive one BASF share at no extra cost in each of the next 10 years.\n\nThe right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells the individual investment in BASF shares, if the participant stops  working for a Group company or one year after retirement. The number of free shares to be granted has developed as follows:\n\n## Number of free shares to be granted\n\n| Shares                      |           |           |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                             | 2020      | 2019      |\n| As of January 1             | 3,025,462 | 2,927,843 |\n| Newly acquired entitlements | 942,685   | 758,255   |\n| Bonus shares issued         | -490,050  | -527,170  |\n| Lapsed entitlements         | -226,521  | -133,466  |\n| As of December 31           | 3,251,576 | 3,025,462 |\n\nThe free shares to be provided by the company are measured at the fair value on the grant date. Fair value is determined on the basis of the BASF share price, taking into account the present value of dividends, which are not paid during the term of the program. The weighted-average fair value on the grant date amounted to \u20ac45.30 for the 2020 program, and \u20ac68.21 for the 2019 program.",

Subject to certain conditions, ROCE is adjusted for special items from acquisitions and divestitures. The ROCE for 2020 is lower than the threshold according to the bonus curve. In this case, the compensation system stipulates that the ROCE factor be determined by a special resolution of the Supervisory  Board.  The  Supervisory  Board  has  determined  an ROCE factor of 0.3.\n\nThe members of the Board of Executive Directors were granted 166,272 option rights under the previous long-term incentive (LTI) program for the last time in 2020.\n\nMarket valuation of the option rights of active and former members of the Board of Executive Directors resulted in an expense totaling\n\n\u20ac1.1 million in 2020. In 2019, option rights led to an expense in the amount of \u20ac3.0 million.\n\nIn 2020, members of the Board of Executive Directors were granted 151,247 performance share units for the first time in connection with the new LTI performance share plan, which led to an expense of \u20ac2.9 million in 2020.\n\n- For more information on the compensation of members of the Board of Executive Directors, see the Compensation Report from page 183 onward\n\nFor more information on the members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Executive Directors, including their memberships on other boards, see page 180 onward",

SDGs)\n\nThe  U.N.  officially  adopted  its  Sustainable  Development  Goals (U.N.  SDGs)  in  September  2015.  These  replaced  the  previous Millennium Development Goals. The 17 SDGs provide a framework for bringing together U.N. member states, NGOs, industry associations and employee representatives, academia, politics and business to combat international challenges such as poverty, food and water scarcity, and climate change.\n\n## V\n\n## Value chain\n\nA  value  chain  describes  the  successive  steps  in  a  production process: from raw materials through various intermediate steps, such as transportation and production, to the finished product.\n\n## Value to Society\n\nBASF developed the Value to Society approach in cooperation with external experts to measure and assess in monetary terms the economic, ecological, and social impacts of its business activities along the entire value chain.\n\n## Verbund\n\nIn the BASF Verbund, production facilities and technologies are intelligently networked, with high-output chemical processes that use energy and resources efficiently. The by-products of one plant serve as feedstock elsewhere, creating efficient value chains - from basic chemicals to high value-added solutions such as coatings or crop protection products. Our Verbund concept - realized in production, technologies, the market and digitalization - enables innovative solu tions for a sustainable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water stress areas\n\nWe report on water stress areas as regions in which 40% or more of available water is used. Our assessment is based on Aqueduct 3.0 (WRI, 2019). Our sustainable water management goal also takes into account all sites that we defined prior to 2019 as sites in water stress areas in accordance with Pfister et al. (2009), as well as the Verbund sites.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nWe calculate the water consumption of the BASF Group as the sum of evaporation in cooling processes, water content in sales products, and other water use at the sites.\n\n## Trademarks a\n\n## DRYREF TM\n\nRegistered trademark of Linde AG\n\n## Net Promoter System \u00ae\n\nRegistered trademark of Bain & Company, Inc.\n\n## Responsible Care \u00ae\n\nRegistered trademark of the European Chemical Industry  Council\n\nAll other trademarks referred to in the BASF Report are registered trademarks of the BASF Group (identified with the \u00ae symbol), trademarks pending (identified with the TM symbol), or trademarks used by the BASF Group.\n\n- a Trademarks are not registered/used in all countries.\n\n<!-- image -->",
