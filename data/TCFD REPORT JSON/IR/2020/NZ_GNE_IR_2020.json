But it is also worth re/flecting on a /financial year that started out with intense and prolonged climate change protest action across the globe, the passing of the Zero Carbon Act domestically and concluded with the announced closure of Tiwai Point aluminium smelter in Southland, which will permanently realign the domestic electricity market.\n\nWe are proud of how our teams have stood up and performed under pressure, supporting our customers through trying times. This is testament to our strong team culture. We are con/fident in stating that our business has been stress tested at every level and we have come through well.\n\n## Stress tested\n\n## Strong retail performance\n\nAs New Zealand's largest energy retailer to residential homes, maintaining service to our customers through the COVID-19 lockdown was crucial. Our long-standing investments in technology, innovation and /flexible working were invaluable. This enabled our customer service teams to rapidly adapt, maintaining high levels of customer service while working safely and remotely from their homes.\n\nWe also used the relationships built through School-gen to partner with Mind Lab to make online learning content available to New Zealand children throughout the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nOur generation and LPG operations sta/ff have been continuing their essential work to ensure energy is delivered to New Zealand homes and businesses.\n\nOur Tekapo upgrade works, which ran from January to June, were able to continue throughout the lockdown, safely and e/fficiently. This phase was completed with only minor delays and utilised new technologies such as HoloLens Augmented Reality helmets.\n\nA strong retail performance has been anchored by the development of our digital capability, with 77 per cent of customers engaging with our products via our digital platforms. More than 150,000 customers took up our last Power Shout, and 141,000 unique users engaged with EnergyIQ in May alone. We're using the insights gained from these interactions to iterate and improve our products, to help us innovate into a data-driven future and Reimagine Energy for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeyond our technological innovation, we're also partnering with Emirates Team New Zealand ahead of the 2021 America's Cup and we've leveraged our\n\nCHAIR AND CEO JOINT LETTER\n\n40 per cent equity position in electric car share company, Zilch, to support our new Auckland o/ffice in Wynyard Quarter. This will not only solidify our own 'electric' /first approach to our sta/ff transportation, but also provides a low-carbon car share option to the local business community.\n\n## Wholesale market volatility\n\nThe wholesale market has been extremely volatile this year, and the value provided by our diverse portfolio of generation assets has been clear. The North Island drought during the second half of the year saw the second lowest in/flows in 95 years, with some lakes dropping to as low as 20 per cent of capacity. Kupe, Pohokura and the HVDC Inter-Island link's planned outages meant Genesis' Rankine units were vital in stabilising electricity prices.\n\nTowards the end of the year, all swaptions were activated with our partners, enabling Huntly Power Station to support the other major generators facing similar hydrology challenges, as well as smaller retailers.\n\n## Proposed Tiwai Point closure\n\nThe proposed closure of Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter in August 2021 is disappointing news for the people of Southland. This will equate to the removal of approximately 13 per cent of New Zealand's national electricity demand. As such, this marks a fundamental shift in the New Zealand electricity market's supply/demand balance. The announcement was not unexpected and is a scenario we have planned for. Genesis Energy's fuel and generation /flexibility will be able to react well to the conditions as they change. Most notably, it removes a large uncertainty that has hung over the sector for many years. This presents an opportunity to accelerate the electri/fication of industry and transportation, something we have been a strong advocate for.\n\n## Regulatory reform\n\nWe have responded to regulatory changes, such as the opportunities presented by the Electricity Pricing Review in late 2019 to redesign our residential products to better meet our customers' needs. These new\n\nthe most preferred brand in the\n\nConsidered Genesis residential market\u00b9 %\n\nproducts better position our digital capabilities and put control in our customers' hands. Our EnergyIQ platform continues to go from strength to strength, and new features such as EcoTracker have enabled our customers to make better decisions about their energy use and manage their own carbon footprints.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe recent Zero Carbon Act and changes to the emissions trading scheme have been signi/ficant movements in New Zealand's response to climate change, and you will see throughout this report a range of measures to increase transparency and support our transition to a low-carbon future.\n\n## Future-gen and climate-related risk\n\nFuture-gen is Genesis' strategy to identify renewable opportunities that enable the transition away from baseload thermal generation. Thermal will still ful/fil an important function in New Zealand's electricity market, /filling the gaps when the rain doesn't fall or the wind doesn't blow. We see Huntly Power Station continuing this backup role for the near future, which is necessary for the New Zealand energy sector's resilience.\n\nYou can read more about this strategy throughout this report. It has been one of the reasons we have been quite ambitious in reporting our climate change-related targets this year.\n\nThere are a number of /firsts here\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease in 'brand love' amongst existing customers during COVID-19\u00b2\n\n- - this will be the /first time we've reported in line with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures' recommendations, which forms the basis of this report.\n\nIt is also the first time as a publicly listed company we will report our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in our Annual Report . We will also be setting a Science Based Target in FY21 which demonstrates alignment between our low-carbon transition with the commitments of the Paris agreement, and we have set ourselves an ambitious target of 2,650GWh of new renewables generation development . Waipipi Wind Farm will achieve the first 450GWh.\n\nWe were also accredited as a Living Wage employer earlier this year and reported our gender pay gap for the first time - important milestones that further support our people.\n\nWe firmly believe Genesis is going to be a key enabler to New Zealand's decarbonisation journey over the next decade, maintaining a secure and affordable electricity system for all New Zealanders and backing up the renewable system.\n\nThe underlying strength and flexibility of Genesis' business strategy, leadership and governance has been strongly validated this year. We are confident that our strong and resilient business culture positions Genesis well for the future.\n\nNg\u0101 mihi,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarc England Chief Executive\n\n1: Purpose Business Monthly Brand Tracking June 2020. 2: Purpose Business Campaign Tracking May 2020.",

Developing innovative new ways of reducing the Company's emissions, outside of its generation activities, remains a key strategic focus for the business.\n\nEnabling greater energy e/fficiency and managing peak demand is a critical part of meeting New Zealand's energy challenges, both now and into the future.\n\nGenesis works alongside its customers to help them better manage their energy use, control their costs and lower their environmental impact.\n\nGenesis does this by enabling greater consumer choice at the household/retail level through its multiple EnergyIQ propositions,\n\nwhich can be read about on the coming pages.\n\nKey to all of this is providing accessible information to our customers that enables better decision-making. Although investments in energy e/fficiency are already economically sound, customers often defer them due to competing priorities.\n\nHomeGen, for example, supports renewables at the household level by increasing the price paid for energy produced from Genesis customers' rooftop solar panels.\n\nGenesis believes providing the appropriate incentives, for suppliers and consumers, will lower the information barrier and fast-track meaningful action to reduce energy consumption in the short term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Zilch Electric Car Share\n\nGenesis acquired a 40 per cent ownership interest in Zilch, New Zealand's only fully electric vehicle (EV) carsharing business.\n\nAs part of the design of the new Auckland o/ffice, Genesis will focus on encouraging low emissions commuting by our sta/ff by using a combination of our EV /fleet and Zilch for work trips during the day.\n\nOur teams will also bene/fit from sta/ff discounts for Zilch use outside work hours, and the creation of Zilch parking pods in Wynyard Quarter will also enable the local business community to lower their carbon footprints.\n\nI N N O V A T I O N\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n70% of customers engaging with Eco Tracker have expressed a willingness to take an action, proof that information is the best tool to help kiwis lower their household carbon emissions.\n\nEco Tracker\n\nUnique users\n\n## Power Shout 8\n\n## Free electricity that can be used whenever customers want\n\nGenesis Power Shouts are a gift of free electricity to say thank you to our customers for being with Genesis.\n\nEligible Genesis customers can jump into EnergyIQ and choose when they want to activate their free hour of power and plan ahead of time when to perform energy intensive tasks, such as running the dryer and heaters.\n\nGenesis decided to bring Power Shout 8 forward by a month to support customers during COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nGenesis broke a number of its own records:\n\n- \u00b7 A record 16 hours of free power o/ffered to customers, in two blocks of eight hours.\n- \u00b7 A record 141,000 customers redeeming their Power Shouts in May - a 71 per cent redemption rate (also a record).\n- \u00b7 All up, Genesis gave away a record 2.1 million hours or 240 years of free power.\n\n## EnergyIQ's Eco Tracker\n\nHelping customers make sustainable consumption choices\n\nLast year Genesis launched Eco Tracker, a tool within its EnergyIQ platform that allows Genesis customers to view New Zealand's carbon emissions from electricity generation in real time and plan their energy usage accordingly.\n\nEco Tracker is designed to help educate customers about how electricity is generated, how it comes through the grid to homes and how it impacts customers' carbon footprints. Combined with EnergyIQ's energy saving tips, the goal is to provide customers with clear suggestions about how to change their usage habits and make more sustainable choices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn May 2020 nearly 141,000 customers engaged with EnergyIQ\n\n<!-- image -->",

The solar installation was a year in the making, from planning, design, production, testing and installation, on one of Auckland's most iconic buildings. These panels will power Emirates Team New Zealand through their defence of the 36th America's Cup and supply the building with energy for many years to come.\n\nRevolve Energy worked with Genesis to explore the feasibility, design and installation of the solar panels, as well as monitoring and optimising energy production. The panels were designed not only to suit the unique design of the building but to withstand the waterfront's strong winds. Solar panels are typically rigid and bolted to the roof but, due to the curved shape of the roof, the project used bonded /flexible solar modules.\n\nGenesis also provides electricity, solar and energy monitoring to the base, including tracking and sharing\n\nhow much energy the solar panels are generating in real time and bringing that data to life through a dashboard. Both the team and public can now see it displayed on the giant digital screen outside the base, and those not in Auckland will be able to see it on the Genesis website.\n\nGenesis thanks all the partners who helped make this project a success, especially the teams at Revolve Energy, Reid Technology, SuperCity Solar, Regional Facilities Auckland and Panuku Development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kenehi@Wynyard:\n\n## Genesis' new sustainable home\n\n## New 6 Green Star-rated o/ffice will focus on sustainable transport options\n\nIn October Genesis will be moving its Auckland o/ffice to 155 Fanshawe Street, in Auckland's innovation hub, Wynyard Quarter. The name Kenehi@Wynyard (K@W) was chosen by sta/ff.\n\nThe 6 Green Star-rated o/ffice building is currently under construction by Mansons TCLM. It boasts world-class facilities, superior transport options and new ways to network and collaborate with customers and business partners.\n\nThe o/ffice will align to Genesis' wider sustainability goals. K@W is being built to the highest quality energy e/fficiency standards: it recycles rainwater, utilises solar power and onsite battery storage and also features state-of-the-art heating and cooling systems.\n\nGenesis will also take on the role of site energy manager, enabling Genesis to showcase its solar management systems and demonstrate its innovative digital\n\nproducts and customer service /first-hand. It also enhances brand proximity to sponsor partner Emirates Team New Zealand ahead of the America's Cup in 2021.\n\nTo reduce Genesis' carbon footprint, it will feature on-site EV parking spaces and chargers for its electric vehicle /fleet and end-of-trip facilities to encourage teams to cycle and run to work. No sta/ff car parking will be made available by design, lowering Genesis' commute emissions, but also reducing congestion and encouraging the use of Auckland's public transport network.\n\nElectric car sharing is an innovative and cost-e/ffective way for businesses to reduce the emissions associated with /fleet management.\n\nAs part of the Company's Zilch investment (see Page 7) EV carsharing will be a key part of the new o/ffice's transport infrastructure.\n\nThe central location presents a great opportunity to weave carsharing transport options throughout Genesis' operations and push the future of sustainable mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI N N O V A T I O N",

Engineers can interact from thousands of kilometres away via a laptop - drawing lines, circling or pointing arrows at power station components in the operator's /field of view while they're talking - while also keeping the worker's hands free.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGenesis moved HoloLens out of its testing phase in FY20, and its\n\nimplementation was accelerated by COVID-19. Specialists in the Hamilton o/ffice were able to engage with remote workers at Tekapo, assisting in their maintenance and inspections while travel was banned during lockdown.\n\nIt also allowed engineers at Huntly Power Station to successfully perform a re-certi/fication of vacuum sealers via overseas inspectors 20,000kms away in the UK, in real time. This also would not have been able to be completed under COVID-19 Level 4 due to international travel restrictions.\n\nGenesis is now using HoloLens as a part of its training programmes, recording veterans performing tasks on legacy technology to train the next generation of engineers.\n\n## Genesis' Predictive Analytics Platform\n\nGenesis' Predictive Analytics Platform (GPAP) utilises machine learning algorithms to examine historical and current data from thousands of sensors on the power generation sites to predict when the health of an asset is deteriorating and at risk of failure. This provides valuable early warning and intervention on emerging issues with the aim of reducing plant down time and repair costs.\n\nBuilt completely on open source software developed inhouse, the project has now been live for a year. In that time Genesis has more than 900 predictive models running on the platform, covering approximately 80 per cent of its key generation assets. Already GPAP has identi/fied more than 40 asset health issues that would not have been picked up as quickly using traditional, manual asset monitoring techniques.\n\nThis industry-leading programme provides greater certainty to engineers and asset management planners on the ground, but also reinforces Genesis' vital role in providing security of supply to the entire New Zealand electricity market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New ways of keeping our people safe\n\n## Safety and Wellness innovations\n\nIn FY20 Genesis built its new Safety and Wellness Management Framework, completely overhauling its existing health and safety management systems.  The new framework includes a new strategic focus on mental health and wellbeing, prioritisation of critical risks, as well as improved quality and transparency of safety reporting. Genesis has continued to see the roll out of new technologies to manage workplace hazards, such as the AutoSense fatigue and distraction management system for our heavy and light vehicle /fleets.  Over this period Genesis has seen a 44 per cent decline in contractor injuries, which is a very pleasing result.\n\n## Underwater drone inspections at Moawhango\n\nGenesis also completed over 20 inspections using both aerial and submersible drones, with one notable inspection being the assessment of the Moawhango Dam Diversion Valve Intake, located 50 metres below the surface of Lake Moawhango.  The use of drone technology has signi/ficantly reduced the Company's critical risk exposure, reduced the costs of inspection, reduced outage time and improved inspection data quality.\n\nGenesis uses Blue Robotics BlueROV2 drones to conduct underwater inspections, saving on the health and safety risks (and costs) of commercial diver-based inspections\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe /first major work took place at Tekapo in 1951, using very di/fferent 'dive' technologies and safety standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tekapo Power Station intake gate works\n\nGenesis' sole South Island generation asset, the Tekapo Power Scheme, underwent substantial upgrades and maintenance works, including rebuilding its intake gate. This involved alternating shutdowns of Tekapo A and Tekapo B power stations across the January to June 2020 period. Genesis was designated as an Essential Services provider during the COVID-19 lockdown and worked closely with government agencies to ensure this work was uninterrupted, while also keeping our dedicated engineers and contractors safe. The project was completed with minimal delay due to the exceptional e/fforts of these teams. These upgrades will further enhance the e/fficiency and reliability of this valuable generation asset.",

These strike a balance between several key objectives, and are underpinned by extensive scenario mapping, including those that span di/fferent carbon transition pathways.\n\nGenesis recognises the impact climate change is already having and supports meaningful, economy-wide planning to reduce emissions and transition New Zealand to a lowcarbon future.\n\nGenesis, along with the wider electricity sector, must play a critical role in driving decarbonisation\n\nseasonal challenges in New Zealand. The wholesale electricity market will become increasingly tested as the country becomes more reliant on renewable generation, which is subject to seasonal and intraday weather conditions that could intensify with climate change.\n\nThis does not take away from the fact that as New Zealand's largest thermal electricity generator, Genesis is very aware of the role it plays - and the responsibility it has - in supporting New Zealand's transition to a lowcarbon future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

With one of the most renewable electricity systems in the OECD, New Zealand has an opportunity to lead the world in electri/fication. However, this transition is subject to its own climate-related risks. For example, poor regulatory or policy settings could have the opposite e/ffect and disincentivise electri/fication through a higher-cost and less reliable electricity system.\n\nGenesis has a plan to transition its thermal generation assets away from baseload, while still providing backup options for renewable generation. The economics of renewable baseload electricity generation have now reached the tipping point where it is coste/ffective to build geothermal, wind and solar. Consumers have also stated that they want secure and low-cost electricity\u00b9.

New Zealand currently requires about 7,000 GWh of deep energy storage to deal with the seasonal shifts in demand - in which 2,000 GWh more energy is needed in winter than summer. In dry years in/flows can be as much as 5,000 GWh or more below average. This e/ffect may be exacerbated by climate change over time.\n\nExisting hydro lakes provide about 4,000 GWh of that storage, leaving a 3,000 GWh gap. For scale, 3,000 GWh is about /five times what Lake Taup \u014d currently stores for generation\u2074 or 140 Tesla Powerwall batteries for every household in New Zealand. The Tesla option would cost in the order of $2 million per dwelling. That storage gap is currently met by thermal electricity generation, particularly at Huntly Power Station.\n\nNew Zealand has 60 per cent of electricity generated from hydropower stations, yet only six weeks of hydro storage at any given time (this assumes ideal hydrological conditions and full lake storage).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an island, New Zealand does not have any international interconnect backup options when renewables aren't available. There are also additional risks from the North Island/South Island split and how supply/demand is managed via transmission over the HVDC InterIsland link.\n\nThermal electricity generation (including at times coal) provides the crucial backup support that has allowed New Zealand to enjoy such a high level of renewable electricity. The multi-month seasonal risk we face when the lakes are low is unique to New Zealand and will require longer-term technology solutions that are currently uneconomic, particularly if we are to keep\n\nelectricity prices low enough to encourage other sectors to decarbonise through electri/fication.\n\nIn addition, the wholesale electricity market will become more volatile as New Zealand further increases electricity generation from renewable sources, given the intermittent nature of wind generation in particular and as the cost of owning the remaining thermal plant that runs less and less becomes unsustainable. These risks are all exacerbated by long-term e/ffects of climate change.\n\n## New Zealand's Unique Winter Challenge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS T R A T E G Y\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change scenario mapping\n\n## TCFD requirement\n\n- c)  Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration di/fferent climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n- \u00b7 Genesis stress tests its strategy against a number of scenarios, these include (but are not limited to) three scenarios speci/fically modelled to align to climate-related risks. These scenarios contribute towards a comprehensive climaterelated risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 The /first two scenarios involve global e/fforts to heavily reduce emissions and limit global temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C (ideally 1.5 \u00b0C). These two scenarios di/ffer in their methods needed to reach this target. The /first scenario is driven primarily by stringent government legislation. The second is energy sector transformation via the private sector, such as innovative technological advances and change in consumer choices. Both potentially succeed in being the main driving force in keeping climate change within the 2\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 The third scenario de/fined, is where greenhouse gas concentrations continue unabated (the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5) and includes greater climate change and associated physical impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 These scenarios were selected to provide integrated scenarios with a mix of factors but also allowed a stress test against extremes from both a transitional and physical perspective. Speci/fics of the scenarios were created from published climate-risk related models, including work published by NIWA and the Ministry for the Environment for physical risks. This is supported by long-term scenarios mapping the supply and demand balance in the New Zealand electricity system from internal subject matter experts.\n- \u00b7 The scenarios used to test company strategy have di/ffering timescales applied. For the three climatespeci/fic scenarios, the timeframes applied are:\n- \u00bb Short Term: one to 10 years\n- \u00bb Medium Term: 10 to 20 years\n- \u00bb Long Term: 20+ years\n\n- \u00b7 In all scenarios modelled Genesis' strategy proved resilient. A key aspect is that with many risks, a corresponding opportunity is also created. Genesis' strategy seeks to identify these opportunities, while also providing a level of risk mitigation where executed successfully.\n- \u00b7 An example would be the entrance of new types of renewables into the market. While this is needed to reduce the reliance on thermal generation, and potentially diversify away from hydro-dominated renewables, this also creates a /financial risk of displacement for Genesis' thermal assets. However, this also places the Company in a strong position to make informed and structured investment in renewables in the long term.",

For example, extreme weather events present a physical risk of catastrophic failure of infrastructure and generation assets, similar to seismic or volcanic risks.\n\nManagement is primarily through mitigation. Although /financial risks are transferred through insurance, the primary focus is ensuring the highest level of safety. Assets are proactively managed to ensure the continued resilience of these assets in the face of potential events, such as the Tekapo intake gate works (see page 12).\n\nGenesis constantly assesses and reviews these assets and their management plans, leveraging engineering best practice and evaluating new technologies to identify any opportunities to improve their resilience.\n\naspect of the business and these risks are managed in a 'waterfall' e/ffect from senior leadership down through the business.\n\nTransition Risks\n\nThe nature of Transition risks aligns to other 'strategic risks' and as such climate-related transition risks are managed through existing strategic risk management processes.\n\nGenesis proactively manages these risks as part of its long-term strategy.\n\nThis management includes regular monitoring against key risk indicators, designed to proactively identify associated risks.\n\nThis macro-level monitoring best positions Genesis to detect, prepare and adapt to shifts in the wider business landscape (such as the introduction of a standardised emissions trading platform, or a ban on coal mining) while also ensuring potential opportunities are fully considered.\n\ngeneration assets, Genesis has a responsibility to be transparent about climate change and the related risks it poses to the business and the opportunities a/fforded by a decarbonised and electri/fied New Zealand.

This activates social bene/fit in a meaningful way in support of the community of Raahui Pookeka (Huntly).\n\nThe kupu (word) POU literally means 'a stake'.   Its meaning draws from the name Raahui Pookeka (Huntly) and ngaa taonga (the carvings) surrounding the Huntly Power Station site (Te Whare Hiko).\n\nRaahui Pookeka as the original name of Huntly (1869) was bestowed during times of famine and intertribal disputes. Waikato chief, Te Putu, intervened and placed a 'raahui' (restriction) on the eel food source, with a 'pookeka' (stake) used as an indicator of when the 'raahui' would be lifted.\n\nNgaa taonga surrounding Te Whare Hiko (Huntly Power Station), unveiled in 1990 and 1998 respectively, symbolises unity with the community and story of the people of Raahui Pookeka and Waikato-Tainui.\n\nThe POU name was given by Huirama Matatahi, a board member of Matawhaanui and Chair of Waahi Whaanui Trust and Waahi Marae.   His gift draws on the legacy of Queen Te Ataiirangikaahu and her vision of unity with Te Whare Hiko (the Huntly Power Station).\n\nThis work includes grounds maintenance, cleaning and general labour supply, with a clear mandate to partner together on additional employment opportunities and workstreams as the relationship grows and matures.\n\n## Key aspirations were de/fined as:\n\n- \u00b7 Acknowledging the history of Raahui Pookeka (Huntly), the legacy of its people and respect of the leadership across the township and the wider community.\n- \u00b7 Developing a model that displayed a long-term commitment to leadership, partnership, that is sustainable over time while ensuring ongoing collaboration across the community.\n- \u00b7 Developing meaningful career pathways for the people of Raahui Pookeka (Huntly) and employing locally as a priority.\n- \u00b7 Supporting the building of resilience in the local community.\n- \u00b7 POU to develop and grow to serve other companies and organisations.\n- \u00b7 Partnering and operating as 'one entity' onsite at Huntly Power Station, based on principles of unity of purpose, shared aspirations and respect.\n\nGenesis was formally accredited as a Living Wage supplier on 1 April 2020. All sta/ff were being paid the Living Wage from November 2019.\n\nGenesis and POU Limited have also worked together to develop a programme of cultural induction for all on-site sta/ff in recognition of the cultural signi/ficance of the area in which we operate and out of respect for the land and its peoples.\n\nFor Genesis, we seek that our workforce and the way in which we think and act as a business is deeply respectful of, and in better alignment with, tangata whenua.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Genesis accredited as Living Wage Employer\n\nGenesis has been accredited as a Living Wage Employer, the /first electricity generator in New Zealand to do so.\n\nThe Living Wage is calculated independently each year by the New Zealand Family Centre. It is the hourly rate a worker needs to pay for life's necessities and actively participate in the community. It re/flects the basic expenses of workers and their families, such as food, transportation, housing and childcare.\n\nAchieving Living Wage accreditation has been an important goal for Genesis, aimed at contributing to stronger communities and enhancing the wellbeing of our people. Genesis already pays its full-time employees well above the current Living Wage, which is set at $21.15 per hour. Through the Living Wage accreditation programme Genesis is working with several of its contractors to ensure those that provide regular and ongoing services to us will also pay their employees no less than the Living Wage.\n\nAs part of the Pou Limited agreement, all sta/ff and Pou Limited contractors receive at least the Living Wage working at Huntly Power Station.\n\nAnother of Genesis' key contractors, Matrix Security, now also pays their sta/ff the Living Wage, which has\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenabled them to win other contracts.\n\nPaying the Living Wage is the right thing to do for our people and our communities, and Genesis is committed to making a positive di/fference in the lives of the people who work for and with us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is the criteria for achieving Accredited Living Wage Employer status?\n\n- \u00b7 All directly employed workers are on the current Living Wage prior to accreditation.\n- \u00b7 All indirectly paid workers employed by contractors, delivering a service to the business/ organisation on a regular and ongoing basis, are either on the current Living Wage or on milestones agreed as part of the license.\n- \u00b7 Employers have provided workers with access to a union.\n- \u00b7 Employees' terms and conditions have not been reduced in order to meet the current Living Wage rate. An example of this may be the reduction of hours or other bene/fits in order to pay for the cost of delivering the Living Wage.\n\n'Genesis Energy was our /first major customer to initiate a move to the Living Wage. We were subsequently awarded a signi/ficant new contract with an international /firm who saw value in this move by Matrix Security with Genesis Energy, and who then also incorporated the Living Wage standard across their service agreement.'\n\nScott Carter, CEO, Matrix Security\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is vital to bringing fresh perspectives to decisionmaking and developing the innovative solutions our customers demand.\n\nGenesis is passionate about creating a diverse, inclusive and empowering place to work where everyone can be themselves, where trust and transparency helps us all to continuously learn, grow and adapt for whatever the future brings.\n\nIn February 2020 Genesis published its /first Gender Gap Statement. There are three factors that make up the statement - the Pay Equity Gap, Leadership Progression Gap and the Total Gender Gap.\n\nGenesis has reduced inequity of base pay for males and females doing 'equal value' work from 1.6 per cent to 1.4 per cent in FY20.\n\nIn November 2019 Genesis received the YWCA's GenderTick accreditation, further demonstrating Genesis' commitment to gender equality in the workplace.\n\nThe Company commits to a 40:40:20 gender split (40 per cent male, 40 per cent female, 20 per cent either gender) across the entire workforce. Already, this strategic focus has seen Genesis achieve 50 per cent female representation at senior leadership level.\n\nHowever, a large proportion of STEM roles (science, technology, engineering and maths) at Genesis are held by men. This is particularly evident in engineering roles. Conversely, a large proportion of customer service roles are held by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwomen. This means when looking at the average pay of males and females across the organisation, Genesis has a Total Gender Gap of 37.2 per cent. While this is representative of the industry, Genesis is continuing its focus on reducing this imbalance.\n\nThe aim is to look for ways Genesis can improve its ability to attract, develop and retain females in STEM roles where there is a high imbalance. This ensures we go beyond assuring our people are paid fairly for their valuable contributions to Genesis' success, to working with our people to create more opportunities for both genders in a range of career types.\n\n\"Understanding what really drives the Gender Gap is the /first step towards developing actions to address it, which will ultimately create more equitable opportunities for women and men.\"\n\nMarc England Genesis CEO, Champion for Change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What makes up the Gender Gap\n\n## reporting for Genesis?\n\n## Pay Equity Gap\n\nThe Pay Equity Gap measures whether males and females at Genesis are paid the same for performing 'equal value' work. The Company uses the Hay Job Evaluation methodology to standardise its approach to job sizing and reward. It then audits pay every six months to look for any gaps by grouping the data and analysing it. It's important this is done regularly as people join the organisation all year round.\n\nIn 2020 Genesis now measures equal value of work using total pay so we can include potential earnings between males and females. The /first measure of this median gap is 1.9 per cent, which is analysed thoroughly to ensure there are no unexplainable reasons for the di/fference when including total pay elements, such as bonuses or car allowances.\n\n## Leadership Progression Gap supporting females to advance\n\nThe Leadership Progression Gap measures the progress being made in advancing females into senior leadership roles by calculating leadership balances. We count the number of males and females in the most senior positions; 50 per cent of people in these most senior positions are female.\n\nSupporting females to progress and advance at Genesis is an important focus. Recent talent programmes have accelerated senior females into new and larger roles for their continued careers. Enhanced parental leave rights, exercised by both genders, /flexible work and leave policies and wellbeing programmes have all been put in place to help women /flourish into leadership positions. Since the introduction of such policies Genesis has more than\n\n%\n\nMedian Pay Gap for equal value of work (total pay)\n\n## As at June 2020\n\nPay Equity Gap\n\n% 2019: 1.6%\n\nMedian Pay Gap for equal value of work (base salary only)\n\n## Leadership Progression Gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSenior leadership roles\n\nTotal workforce\n\n## Total Gender Gap\n\nWhen comparing median total hourly wages, women earn $0.63 for every $1 that men earn. Women's median total hourly wage is 37.2% lower than mens'.\n\ndoubled the return-to-work rates and the e/fforts to help women /flourish has had knock-on e/ffects for men too.\n\n## Total Gender Gap\n\nThe Total Gender Gap is a measure of the median pay between males and females regardless of the nature of work across the Company.

Refer to the 'General information and signi/ficant matters' section in the notes for a reconciliation to the previously reported information.\n\nThe above statement should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.\n\n## Notes to the consolidated /financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2020\n\n## General information and signi/ficant matters\n\n## General information\n\nThese consolidated /financial statements comprise Genesis Energy Limited ('Genesis'), its subsidiaries, controlled entities and the Group's interests in associates and joint operations (together, the 'Group'). Refer to section D for more information on the Group structure.\n\nGenesis is registered under the Companies Act 1993.  It is a mixed ownership model company, majority owned by the 'Crown', bound by the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989. Genesis is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and has bonds listed on the NZX debt market. Genesis is an FMC reporting entity under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.\n\nThe core business of the Group and activities carried out by each segment is disclosed in note A2.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese /financial statements have been prepared:\n\n- \u00b7 In accordance with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice ('GAAP') and comply with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') and New Zealand equivalents ('NZ IFRS'), as appropriate for pro/fit-oriented entities;\n- \u00b7 In accordance with the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the Financial Reporting Act 2013 and the Companies Act 1993;\n- \u00b7 Using the historical-cost convention, modi/fied by the revaluation of derivatives, emission units held for trading and generation assets;\n- \u00b7 In New Zealand dollars rounded to the nearest 100,000;\n- \u00b7 On a Goods and Services Tax ('GST') exclusive basis with the exception of receivables and payables, which include GST where GST has been invoiced;\n- \u00b7 Using the accounting policies set out in the notes to the /financial statements. The impact of adopting new and revised accounting standards, interpretations and amendments is disclosed below.\n\n## Estimates and judgements\n\nIn the process of preparing the /financial statements Management makes a number of estimates and judgements based on historical experience and various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances. The table below lists the key estimates and judgements:\n\n| Key estimates and judgements                                                       | Note   | Page   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Determining whether or not a subsequent event  is an adjusting event - refer right |        |        |\n| Fair value of generation assets                                                    | B1     | 53     |\n| Depletion of oil and gas producing assets                                          | B2     | 55     |\n| Valuation of rehabilitation and restoration  provisions                            | C4     | 59     |\n| Valuation of electricity derivatives                                               | F8     | 71     |\n\nEstimates are also used in determining other items such as the expected credit loss provision (note C1), the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and software (note B2 and B3), and whether assets with inde/finite useful lives are impaired (note B3). Judgements are further used in determining whether an event gives rise to a provision or a contingent liability (note G4).\n\n## New Zealand Aluminium Smelters' announcement to close Tiwai Point Smelter\n\nOn 9 July 2020 New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS) announced its intention to close the Tiwai Point smelter by August 2021. As a result it has given notice to Meridian to terminate its electricity supply agreement. Tiwai Point's electricity usage represents 13 per cent of total electricity demand in New Zealand and is likely to impact electricity prices and generation volumes. The impact of the closure on the Group's assets and liabilities is dependent on a number of interrelated factors including:\n\n- \u00b7 The timing of Tiwai Point's exit and how the operations will be wound down;\n- \u00b7 Approval and timing of transmission upgrades required to move the surplus electricity north and how the cost of these upgrades will be recovered;\n- \u00b7 Level of demand from new and existing industrial plant and electri/fication projects;\n- \u00b7 Potential retirement of any existing generation assets;\n- \u00b7 Postponement of the development of proposed generation assets - what proposals are unlikely to go ahead and what proposals will be delayed and for how long;\n- \u00b7 Management of seasonal variations in hydrology, wind and demand in the upper North Island and what combination of generation assets will provide this service in the future;\n- \u00b7 Demand and pricing of electricity hedging contracts; and\n- \u00b7 Demand for and pricing of gas.\n\nChanges in these interrelated factors will impact the wholesale electricity price path and generation volumes, which are key estimates used to calculate the fair value of generation assets and electricity derivatives (refer to note B1 and F8). Greater clarity and more information on these factors is required before Genesis can estimate the /financial e/ffect these factors will have on the carrying value of generation assets and electricity derivatives. The sensitivity information disclosed in note B1 and F8 provides the estimated impact of a 10 per cent increase/decrease in the wholesale price path and generation volumes.\n\nThe announcement on 9 July 2020 is considered to be a non-adjusting subsequent event on the basis that the formal announcement to close Tiwai Point was a condition that arose after 30 June 2020, Genesis did not have any direct communications with NZAS or Rio Tinto in relation to this matter and Genesis was not aware of NZAS' decision to close Tiwai Point prior to the announcement.  While NZAS had announced prior to 30 June 2020 that it was undertaking a strategic review of operations, closure was only one of many options available. The formal announcement on 9 July 2020 of NZAS' intention to close Tiwai Point is considered the key condition in relation to this matter and therefore is not considered to clarify a condition that existed at 30 June 2020. This is considered a key judgement in the preparation of these /financial statements.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

        "page_content": "The wholesale electricity price path used to value generation assets and electricity derivatives at 30 June 2020 assumed the ongoing operation of Tiwai Point. This assumption is consistent with the assumption used in the price paths published by independent third parties and market data available at 30 June 2020. While there was a possibility of closure, the external and internal analysis at 30 June 2020 indicated that the broadly held view was that Tiwai Point would remain open.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAs the energy sector provides an essential service it has been relatively una/ffected by COVID-19 compared to other sectors of New Zealand's economy. During the nationwide level 4 lockdown and level 3 restrictions, which commenced on 25 March 2020, there was a decrease in electricity and gas demand and the wholesale electricity price path, which impacted both electricity revenue and purchases.  Since this time demand and the price path have returned to broadly similar levels to those experienced prior to the level 4 lockdown and level 3 restrictions. This is a trend which is expected to continue. Given Genesis is both a generator and a retailer, the change in the price path did not have a material impact on the reported result. As the price path and generation volumes at 30 June 2020 has broadly returned to pre lockdown levels it has not had a material impact on the valuation of generation assets and electricity swaps and options and electricity power purchase agreements ('PPA') (refer note B1 and F8). On 12 August 2020 the alert level for the Auckland region was raised to level 3, while the rest of the country was raised to level 2. To date, no material business impact has been noted as a result of the current lockdown. The expected credit loss provision on trade receivables and accrued revenue has also been updated to re/flect the impact of COVID-19 and any potential recession that may follow. This resulted in a small increase in the expected credit loss provision (refer note C1). A small adjustment was also made to deferred tax / tax expense as a result of the Government reintroducing tax depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings as part of the relief package for COVID-19 (refer note A6).\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nAssets that have inde/finite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to depletion, depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, the di/fference is recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement, except where the asset is carried at a revalued amount then it is treated as a revaluation decrease up to the amount previously recognised in the revaluation reserve.\n\nAdoption of new and revised accounting standards, interpretations and amendments\n\nDuring the year the Group adopted NZ IFRS 16 Leases ('NZ IFRS 16'). The impact of adopting this standard, using the full retrospective method, is disclosed below.\n\n## NZ IFRS 16 Leases\n\nThe Group leases o/ffice buildings, land for its generation sites and LPG depots. The adoption of NZ IFRS 16 has resulted in changes to how leases are recognised, measured and disclosed. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right-of-use assets (leased assets) and lease liabilities for all lease arrangements that meet the de/finition of a lease, except for short-term leases where the lease term is 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. For these leases the Group recognises the lease payments as operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nThe lease liability on initial recognition comprises the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date. This includes /fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable and variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate. The lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to re/flect interest on the lease liability (using the e/ffective interest method) and reducing the carrying amount to re/flect the lease payments made. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related lease asset) whenever the lease term changes, the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a lease contract is modi/fied and the lease modi/fication is not accounted for as a separate lease.\n\nThe lease assets comprises the amount of the corresponding initial lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct costs and restoration costs. The lease asset is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The lease asset is depreciated over the lease term, on a straight-line basis. The lease term ranges from 4 to 38 years.\n\nNZ IFRS 16 was adopted using the retrospective method and as a result the comparative information has been restated. Retained earnings as at 1 July 2018 was adjusted by $5.7 million as a result of retrospectively adopting the standard. The Group elected not to reassess whether a contract contains a lease at the date of initial application. For contracts entered into before the transition date, the Group relied on the assessment made applying the previous standard, NZ IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease . The impact of adopting the standard is disclosed below.\n\n| Comprehensive income statement  For the year ended 30 June 2019   | As originally   presented  $ million   | NZ IFRS 16   $ million   | Restated   $ million   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| EBITDAF                                                           | 363.4                                  | 6.0                      | 369.4                  |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortisation                          | (196.5)                                | (5.2)                    | (201.7)                |\n| (Impairment) / impairment reversal of non-current assets          | (7.0)                                  | 2.8                      | (4.2)                  |\n| Finance expense                                                   | (73.9)                                 | (3.8)                    | ( 7 7. 7 )             |\n| Pro/fit before income tax                                         | 83.1                                   | (0.2)                    | 82.9                   |\n| Income tax expense                                                | (23.9)                                 | 0.1                      | (23.8)                 |\n| Net pro/fit after tax                                             | 59.2                                   | (0.1)                    | 59.1                   |\n| Total comprehensive income for the year                           | 326.8                                  | (0.1)                    | 326.7                  |\n\nEarnings per share reduced from 5.84 cents per share to 5.83 cents per share as a result of adopting NZ IFRS 16.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n| Consolidated balance sheet As at 30 June 2019   | As originally   presented  $ million   | NZ IFRS 16   $ million   | Restated   $ million   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment*                  | 3,392.8                                | 56.2                     | 3,449.0                |\n| Inventories                                     | 130.2                                  | 0.6                      | 130.8                  |\n| Borrowings                                      | (1,289.8)                              | (65.2)                   | (1,355.0)              |\n| Provisions                                      | (165.6)                                | 0.4                      | (165.2)                |\n| Deferred tax                                    | (656.0)                                | 2.2                      | (653.8)                |\n| Retained earnings                               | (213.0)                                | 5.8                      | (207.2)                |\n\n* Leased assets disclosed in note B1 as at 30 June 2019 were $57.3 million, $56.2 million was recognised on transition to NZ IFRS 16 and $1.1 million previously recognised in buildings and improvements is now recognised as part of leased assets.\n\nDetermining the number of renewal periods to include in the lease term can have a material impact on the value of the leased asset included in property, plant and equipment and the lease liability included in borrowings.\n\n| Consolidated balance sheet As at 1 July 2018   | As originally   presented  $ million   | NZ IFRS 16   $ million   | Restated   $ million   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                  | 3,051.6                                | 58.9                     | 3,110.5                |\n| Inventories                                    | 75.6                                   | -

Financial performance\n\n## A1. Underlying EBITDAF and underlying earnings\n\nUnderlying EBITDAF and underlying earnings are performance measures used internally to provide insight into the operating performance of the Group by adjusting for items that are outside Management's control or items that relate to strategic rather than operational decisions. Items are excluded from underlying EBITDAF and underlying earnings when they meet the criteria outlined in the Group's non-GAAP /financial information policy (refer to www.genesisenergy.co.nz/investors/governance/ documents for a copy of the policy). These measures are not\n\nde/fined in NZ IFRS and therefore are considered to be nonGAAP performance measures. They should not be viewed in isolation nor considered a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS. Underlying EBITDAF and underlying earnings are used by many companies, however, because these measures are not de/fined by NZ IFRS they may not be uniformly de/fined or calculated by all companies. Accordingly, these measures may not be comparable.\n\n| Reconciliation of reported net pro/fit to underlying earnings          | Note   | 2020 $ million   | Restated 2019 $ million   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| Net pro/fit for the year                                               |        | 46.0             | 59.1                      |\n| Change in fair value of /financial instruments                         | F5     | 0.6              | 15.2                      |\n| Revaluation of generation assets                                       | B1     | -                | (4.6)                     |\n| Impairment of non-current assets                                       | B1, B3 | 3.0              | 4.2                       |\n| Unrealised (gain) loss on revaluation of carbon units held for trading | A4     | 6.0              | ( 7.4 )                   |\n| Adjustments before tax expense                                         |        | 9.6              | 7.4                       |\n| Tax expense on adjustments                                             |        | (2.7)            | (2.1)                     |\n| Adjustments after tax expense                                          |        | 6.9              | 5.3                       |\n| Underlying earnings                                                    |        | 52.9             | 64.4                      |\n\n|                |   Cents |   Cents |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Underlying EPS |    5.14 |    6.35 |\n\nThere were no di/fferences between reported EBITDAF and underlying EBITDAF.",

All segments operate in New Zealand. No operating segments have been aggregated. The Group has no individual customers that account for 10.0 per cent or more of the Group's external revenue (2019: none). Included in the Retail segment result is $40.5 million of costs (2019: $35.3 million) relating to the Technology and Digital team who provide services to all of the segments.\n\n## Reconciliation of expenses in the consolidated comprehensive income statement to the segment note\n\nExpenses in the consolidated comprehensive income statement includes the following line items in the segment note: external costs, employee bene/fits and other operating expenses.\n\n## Intersegment revenue\n\nSales between segments is based on transfer prices developed in the context of long-term contracts. The electricity transfer price per MWh charged between Wholesale and Retail was $85.97 (2019: $83.01).\n\n## Restatement of comparative segment note\n\nThe structure of the segment note has been updated to re/flect enhanced internal business reporting and as a result the comparative segment note has been restated to provide comparability with the current period.  Key changes to the comparable segment note include:\n\n- \u00b7 Intersegment revenues and expenses of $709.3 million are shown separately by segment (previously disclosed in total by product);\n- \u00b7 Petroleum revenue of $122.2 million previously reported has been split into LPG ($83.4 million) and oil ($38.8 million);\n- \u00b7 Petroleum production, marketing and distribution expense of $62.5 million previously reported has been split into LPG ($31.6 million), oil ($1.0 million), other costs ($13.5 million) and other operating expenses ($16.4 million);\n- \u00b7 Emissions revenue and expense was not reported separately previously. The $19.7 million revenue and $45.2 million expense (made up of $18.4 million emissions associated with electricity generation and $26.8 million emissions associated with fuel sales) was previously reported with the product it related to (electricity ($7.8 million revenue), gas ($10.2 million revenue and $15.2 million expense), fuels consumed in electricity generation ($18.4 million expense), LPG ($1.5 million revenue and $11.1 million expense) and other ($0.2 million revenue and $0.5 million operating expenses));\n\n- \u00b7 Other revenue of $12.5 million has been allocated to products ($13.6 million to electricity and -$1.1 million to gas);\n- \u00b7 Electricity purchase, transmission and distribution of $1,439.6 million previously reported has been split into electricity purchases ($904.3 million) and electricity network, transmission, levies and meters ($535.3 million);\n- \u00b7 Gas purchase, transmission and distribution of $274.7 million previously reported has been split into gas purchases ($197.1 million), gas network, transmission, levies and meters ($79.5 million) and fuels consumed in electricity generation (-$1.9 million);\n- \u00b7 $59.8 million of expenses previously reported in other operating expenses has been reclassi/fied to electricity network, transmission, levies and meters ($57.9 million), gas network, transmission, levies and meters ($1.0 million) and other costs ($0.9 million);\n- \u00b7 All lines below EBITDAF remain unchanged.\n\nIn addition to changes in the structure of the segment note, the comparative numbers have been restated to re/flect:\n\n- \u00b7 The change in the reporting line for Technology and Digital from Corporate to Retail. Lines impacted by the change are employee bene/fits, other operating expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortisation and impairment of non-current assets, which have decreased by $7.1 million, $22.1 million, $5.9 million and $0.2 million respectively for Corporate with a corresponding increase for Retail;\n- \u00b7 Removal of corporate cost allocations, which has resulted in a $7.5 million increase in employee bene/fits and a $19.6 million increase in other operating expenses for Corporate, a $4.0 million and $11.8 million decrease respectively for Retail, a $3.4 million and $7.7 million decrease respectively for Wholesale and a $0.1 million and $0.1 million decrease respectively for Kupe;\n- \u00b7 Adoption of the new lease standard NZ IFRS 16, which has resulted in a $0.3 million increase in fuels consumed in electricity generation for Wholesale, $0.9 million decrease in other operating expenses for Retail, a $0.8 million decrease for Wholesale and a $4.6 million decrease for Corporate. An increase in depreciation, depletion and amortisation of $0.8 million for Retail, $0.6 million for Wholesale and $3.8 million for Corporate. Impairment of non-current assets decreased by $2.8 million for Wholesale and /finance expense increased by $0.3 million for Retail, $1.5 million for Wholesale and $2.0 million for Corporate.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## A2.

Revenue\n\nThe accounting policies applied to material revenue streams are disclosed below and the quantum of each revenue stream is disclosed in note A2. Emissions on fuel sales and electricity contracts is not a separate performance obligation under the revenue standard. It has been reported separately as it provides useful information to the /financial statement users.\n\n| Revenue stream                                              | Contract term   | Nature of goods or services and revenue recognition                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Payment terms                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Electricity (retail),   gas and LPG   (including emissions) | 0-36  months    | Daily supply of electricity, gas or metered LPG over the  contract period. Revenue is recognised over time at the  end of each day when the consumption is known. The  amount of revenue recognised is based on the amount the  Group has the right to invoice. | Customers are invoiced  monthly and payment is due  between two weeks to one  month after invoice. |\n| Electricity (wholesale)                                     | No term         | Half hourly supply of electricity. Revenue is recognised  over time when each trading period is concluded and the  electricity generation is known.                                                                                                             | calculates and invoices the  revenue.

Revenue is recognised at the  point in time that the emission unit is con/firmed as being  transferred into the acquirer's emission unit account.                                                                                       | Payment is due within /five  business days of the units  being transferred.                        |\n| Oil                                                         | 12 months       | Individual oil shipments. Revenue is recognised on the bill  of lading date.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Payment is due no later  than 30 days from the bill of  lading date.                               |\n\n## Judgement used in determining revenue\n\nWhere customer meters are unbilled at balance date the Group uses judgement to determine the volume of the unbilled revenue. The Group estimates the unbilled volume using historical consumption information.  Unbilled revenue is disclosed in note C1. Where a discount is o/ffered for prompt payment, revenue is initially recognised net of the estimated discount. The estimated discount is based on historical trends in customer payments.\n\n## A4. Other gains (losses)\n\nIn the prior year other gains (losses) included a $7.4 million unrealised gain in relation to the change in fair value of carbon units held for trading as a result of units being acquired at below current market prices. The current year includes a $6.0 million unrealised loss mainly due to the reversal of the unrealised gain recorded in the previous year as a result of the sale of the units. When the units are sold the cost of the units is recorded in operating expenses.\n\n| A5.

Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas assets has decreased by $22.3 million due to lower production as a result of a major inspection being undertaken during the year and an increase in the estimated remaining reserves of the Kupe /field.",

The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Reintroduction of tax depreciation on buildings\n\nOn 25 March 2020 the Government passed legislation which reintroduced tax depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings. This legislative change resulted in a $1.6 million adjustment to deferred tax.\n\n| Deferred tax                              | Restated  property,  plant and  equipment $ million   | Oil and gas  assets $ million   | Provisions  $ million   | Intangibles  $ million   | Derivatives $ million   | Other  $ million   | Restated total  $ million   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Balance as at 1 July 2018                 | 516.1                                                 | 93.0                            | (44.9)                  | 24.1                     | (9.4)                   | (11.6)             | 567.3                       |\n| Recognised in the income statement        | (0.7)                                                 | (14.2)                          | (0.4)                   | (3.7)                    | (4.1)                   | 5.5                | ( 1 7. 6 )                  |\n| Recognised in other comprehensive  income | 110.5                                                 | -                               | -                       | -                        | (6.4)                   | -                  | 104.1                       |\n| Balance as at 30 June 2019                | 625.9                                                 | 78.8                            | (45.3)                  | 20.4                     | (19.9)                  | (6.1)              | 653.8                       |\n| Recognised in the income statement        | (10.8)                                                | (6.6)                           | 0.9                     | (2.4)                    | 0.2                     | (10.1)             | (28.8)                      |\n| Recognised in other comprehensive  income | -                                                     | -                               | -                       | -                        | 6.6                     | -                  | 6.6                         |\n| Balance as at 30 June 2020                | 615.1                                                 | 72.2                            | (44.4)                  | 18.0                     | (13.1)                  | (16.2)             | 631.6                       |\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## B.

Generation assets are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value at the date of the valuation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The underlying assumptions used in the valuation are reviewed at each reporting date. Revaluations are performed with su/fficient regularity to ensure the carrying amount does not materially di/ffer from the estimated fair value at balance date.\n\nAny increase in the valuation is recognised in other comprehensive income, unless it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which case it is recognised in the income\n\nstatement to the extent it reverses a decrease previously recognised. A decrease in carrying amount arising on revaluation is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the asset revaluation reserve for that asset. Accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying value so that the gross carrying amount after revaluation equals the revalued amount.\n\nSubsequent additions to generation assets are recognised at cost. Cost includes the consideration given to acquire the asset plus any other costs incurred in bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use, including major inspection costs, resource consent, relationship agreement costs and /financing costs where appropriate.",

A valuation of generation assets has been undertaken. The results indicate the carrying value approximates the fair value and, as a result, the Group has not undertaken a full revaluation of generation assets at 30 June 2020.\n\nThe valuation is based on a discounted cash /flow model prepared by Management, calculated by generating scheme except for the Huntly site where it is calculated by type of unit (units 1 to 4, unit 5 and unit 6). As the key inputs into the valuation are based\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe wholesale electricity price path is the key driver of changes in the valuation. The price path is an average of the internally generated price path and price paths published by independent third parties. Changes in electricity demand, hydrology and new generation build a/ffect the price path. These factors are reviewed for reasonableness by senior management personnel who are responsible for the price path used by the business.\n\nThe internally generated price path assumes national demand growth based on the latest available industry analysis and Genesis' view of economic growth. Forecast hydrology is based on 83 years of historical hydrological in/flow data, and new\n\non unobservable market data, the valuation is classi/fied as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. It requires signi/ficant judgement and therefore there is a range of reasonably possible assumptions that could be used in estimating the fair value. Refer to note F8 for an overview of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIf generation assets were carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, the carrying amount would be approximately $1,534.6 million (2019: $1,558.4 million).\n\ngeneration build assumptions are based on public information and an assessment of the wholesale electricity prices required to support new generation build. The internally generated price path assumed the ongoing operation of NZAS at Tiwai Point. This assumption is consistent with the assumption used in the price paths published by independent third parties and market data available at 30 June 2020. On 9 July 2020, NZAS announced its intention to close the Tiwai Point smelter. Greater clarity and more information is required before Genesis can estimate the /financial e/ffect this will have on the fair value of generation assets.

The costs of drilling exploration wells are initially capitalised pending the determination of the success of the wells. Costs are expensed immediately where the work does not result in a successful discovery. Costs incurred before the Group has obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed as incurred.\n\nExploration, evaluation and development expenditure assets are not amortised; instead, they are assessed annually for indicators of impairment. Any impairment is recognised in the income statement. Once development of a project has been completed, the accumulated expenditure in relation to the project is transferred to oil and gas producing assets.\n\n## Oil and gas producing assets\n\nOil and gas producing assets include costs associated with the production station, platform and pipeline transferred from exploration, evaluation and development expenditure, mining licences and major inspection costs. Depletion of oil and gas producing assets, excluding major inspection costs, is calculated on a unit-of-production basis using proved remaining reserves ('1P') estimated to be obtained from, or processed by, the speci/fic asset. Major inspection costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period up to the next major inspection. Major inspections occur every two to 10 years depending on the nature of the work undertaken.\n\n## Other oil and gas assets\n\nOther oil and gas assets include land, buildings, storage facilities, sales pipeline and motor vehicles. The cost of other oil and gas assets, less any estimated residual value, is depreciated on a straight-line basis.\n\n| Asset category     | Estimated useful lives   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| Buildings          | 50 years                 |\n| Storage facilities | 25 years                 |\n| Sales pipeline     | 25 years                 |\n| Motor vehicles     | 5 years                  |",

Oil and gas assets (continued)\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nProved reserves ('1P') are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs, under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved reserves ('1P') are de/fined as those that have a 90 per cent likelihood of being delivered. Because the geology of the Kupe oil and gas /field subsurface cannot be examined directly, an indirect technique, known as volumetrics, has been used to estimate the size and recoverability of the reserve. There are high levels of uncertainty in terms of accessibility of reserves through sealing faults and pressure support. The Joint Venture\n\nOperator performed a review of Kupe's reserves during the year. Genesis engaged Ga/ffney Cline, an independent expert, to review and verify the Operator's reserve estimate, which resulted in an increase in remaining reserves for both proved reserves ('1P') and proved and probable reserves ('2P'). The increase in reserves resulted in a $17.4 million reduction in depletion expense for the year. A reduction of 10 per cent in these reserves would increase depletion charges going forward by approximately $3.5 million per annum at current production rates. The table below presents the remaining Kupe oil and gas /field reserves in Peta joule equivalents ('PJe') of which the Group has a 46.0 per cent interest (2019: 46.0 per cent).\n\n|                                              | Proved reserves ('1P')   | Proved reserves ('1P')   | Proved and probable reserves ('2P')   | Proved and probable reserves ('2P')   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                              | 2020 PJe                 | 2019 PJe                 | 2020 PJe                              | 2019 PJe                              |\n| Opening remaining /field reserves at 1 July  | 188.1                    | 209.8                    | 319.0                                 | 351.1                                 |\n| Change in reserve estimate                   | 94.5                     | 15.0                     | 54.1                                  | 4.6                                   |\n| Production                                   | (32.6)                   | (36.7)                   | (32.6)                                | (36.7)                                |\n| Closing remaining /field reserves at 30 June | 250.0                    | 188.1                    | 340.5                                 | 319.0                                 |\n| Developed                                    | 83.5                     | 93.3                     | 140.2                                 | 126.5                                 |\n| Undeveloped                                  | 166.5                    | 94.8                     | 200.3                                 | 192.5                                 |\n| Closing remaining /field reserves at 30 June | 250.0                    | 188.1                    | 340.5                                 | 319.0                                 |\n\nFurther investment will be required to access the undeveloped /field reserves disclosed above.\n\n| B3.

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identi/fiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is assessed as having an inde/finite useful life and is not amortised but is subject to impairment testing at each reporting date or whenever there are indications of impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the following cash-generating units ('CGU'):\n\n| Goodwill by CGU              |   2020 $ million |   2019 $ million |\n|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Retail - electricity and gas |            102.6 |            102.6 |\n| Retail - LPG                 |            112.6 |            112.6 |\n| Kupe                         |             13.2 |             13.2 |\n| Total goodwill               |            228.4 |            228.4 |\n\n## Retail - electricity and gas\n\nThe goodwill associated with the electricity and gas business mainly relates to the acquisition of NGC electricity and gas business in 2002 and 2003. The impairment test is based on an estimated discounted cash /flow analysis (value in use). Estimated future cash /flow projections are based on the Group's /five-year business plan for the CGU. Cash /flows beyond the /five-year business plan are extrapolated using a 1.0 per cent year-on-year growth rate (2019: 1.0 per cent). The estimated future cash /flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax equivalent discount rate of 9.4 per cent (2019: 9.9 per cent). Any reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based is not expected to cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## Retail - LPG\n\nThe goodwill associated with LPG relates to the acquisition of the LPG business from Nova Energy on 1 June 2017. The impairment test is based on an estimated discounted cash /flow analysis (fair value less disposal costs) using ten years of forecast information. Cash /flows beyond the forecast period are based on an EBITDAF multiple of 7.5x (2019: 7.5x). The estimated future cash /flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax equivalent discount rate of 9.4 per cent (2019: 9.9 per cent). The forecast takes into consideration both the acquired and existing LPG business, as the assets of the acquired business are used to service the pre-acquisition LPG customers. Any reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based is not expected to cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount. As the valuation is based on inputs that are not based on observable market data the valuation is classi/fied as level three in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to note F8 for an overview of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Kupe\n\nThe goodwill associated with Kupe relates to the acquisition of the Kupe subsidiaries from New Zealand Oil and Gas Limited ('NZOG') on 1 January 2017. The impairment test is based on an estimated discounted cash /flow analysis (value in use). The estimated future cash /flow projections are based on proved and probable reserves ('2P'), as disclosed in note B2. The pre-tax equivalent discount rate was 9.4 per cent (2019: 9.9 per cent). Any reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based is not expected to cause the carrying value of the goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## Key assumptions in the impairment tests for electricity and gas and LPG were:\n\n| Assumptions                          | Method of determination                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer numbers and  customer churn | Review of actual customer numbers and historical data regarding movements in customer  numbers (the historical analysis is considered against expected market trends and competition for  customers). |\n| Gross margin   (electricity and gas) | Review of actual gross margins and consideration of expected market movements and impacts.                                                                                                            |\n| EBITDAF (LPG)                        | Review of actual EBITDAF and consideration of expected market movements and impacts.                                                                                                                  |\n| Cost to serve                        | Review of actual costs to serve and consideration of expected future costs.                                                                                                                           |",

These assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset from the date it is available for use. The estimated useful life is between one and ten years.\n\nImpairment in the current year relates to internally developed software projects which have been discontinued.\n\n## Emission units held for own use\n\nEmission units held for own use are used to settle the Group's emission obligation. The units are initially recognised at fair value and are not revalued. As the units do not have an expiry date they have an inde/finite useful life. The units are not amortised but are subject to impairment testing.\n\n## Contractual arrangements\n\nContractual arrangements include customer contracts and relationships acquired through business acquisitions, and sponsorship contracts.\n\n## Customer contracts and relationships\n\nCustomer contracts and relationships are assets with /finite lives. These assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\nAmortisation of customer contracts and relationships related to Kupe are recognised in the income statement on a units-ofuse basis, using proved remaining reserves ('1P') expected to be obtained over the contract period. Remaining reserves used in the calculations range from 160.7 to 250.0 PJe (2019: 164.7 to 188.1 PJe). Refer to note B2 for further information on the reserves estimate.\n\nAmortisation of customer contracts and relationships related to the LPG business are recognised in the income statement on a diminishing-value basis over the estimated life of the contract or relationship to re/flect the likely churn of customers. The majority of the assets have 50-year lives with one contract having a /fiveyear life.\n\nImpairment in the prior year relates to a change in the term of a contract.\n\n## Sponsorship contracts\n\nSponsorship contracts are assets with /finite lives. These assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset from the date it is available for use. The useful life is based on the contract period, which ranges between one and 15 years.\n\n## Deferred customer acquisition costs\n\nCustomer acquisition costs that are directly attributable to securing a particular customer contract are capitalised and amortised over the length of the average customer tenure (30 months). Amortisation of these costs is included within operating expenditure.\n\n## C. Working capital and provisions\n\n| C1.

Trade receivables and accrued revenue that are known to be uncollectable are written o/ff. Total bad debts written o/ff during the year was $6.2 million (2019: $6.4 million).\n\n## Expected credit loss provision\n\nThe expected credit loss provision is calculated using the simpli/fied approach, which takes into account the lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables and accrued revenue. The allowance for expected credit losses is calculated using a provision matrix, which is based on historic write o/ffs. Where possible the percentages are adjusted for foreseeable future economic conditions which may impact the collectability of trade receivables and accrued revenue. It is possible New Zealand may enter into a recession as a result of COVID-19, which may impact the collectability of trade receivables and accrued revenue. As a result an additional amount has been provided for based on the increase in write o/ffs experienced during the last economic down turn (Global Financial Crisis). In the prior year the provision for trade receivables and accrued revenue was based on 0.76 per cent of revenue and the provision for customers at collection agencies and unoccupied households was 85 per cent and 100 per cent respectively of the debtor balance.\n\n| Expected credit loss      | Residential   | Business   |\n|---------------------------|---------------|------------|\n| 0-30 days overdue         | 0.79%         | 0.12%      |\n| 30-60 days overdue        | 2.92%         | 1.20%      |\n| 60-90 days overdue        | 5.77%         | 2.75%      |\n| 90+ days overdue          | 3.09%         | 0.47%      |\n| Debt at collection agency | 82%           | 55%        |\n| Unoccupier debt           | 100%          | 100%       |\n\n## Deferred customer account credits\n\nAccount credits given to customers are included in the measurement of revenue. The account credit is spread over the term of the customer contract.\n\n| C2.

Cost is determined using the weighted average cost basis, which includes expenditure incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, including shipping and handling. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nFuel inventories mainly consist of coal used in electricity production. Fuel inventories (excluding natural gas) expensed during the year amounted to $103.1 million (2019: $101.3 million).\n\nPetroleum products consist of LPG and light crude oil held for resale produced from the Kupe production facility. Petroleum products expensed during the year amounted to $25.8 million (2019: $26.9 million).\n\nConsumables and spare parts are held to service or repair generating assets. Consumables and spare parts relating to Huntly unit 6 are impaired when incurred, as the fair value of this unit is nil.\n\n## Emission units held for trading\n\nEmission units held for trading are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement within other gains (losses). The fair value is determined using the OM Financial forward curve.

Provisions made in respect of employee bene/fits are measured using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\n\n## Emission obligations\n\nEmission obligations are recognised as a liability when the Group incurs the emission obligation. Emission units payable to third parties are recognised at the average cost of emission units on hand, up to the amount of units on hand at the recognition date. Where the emission obligation exceeds the level of units on hand, the excess obligation is measured at the contract price where forward contracts exist or the market price for any obligation not covered by units on hand or forward contracts.",

The provisions represent the present value of the best estimate of cash /flows required to settle the Group's obligations under the agreements. The timing of the out/flows is expected to occur over the next 19 years.\n\n## Rehabilitation and restoration\n\nThe majority of this provision relates to the remediation of the Huntly ash ponds and the Kupe production facility. The provision represents the present value of the Group's best estimate of future expenditure to be incurred to remediate the sites at balance date. Key assumptions include: an estimate of when the rehabilitation and restoration is likely to take place, the possible remediation alternatives available, the expected expenditures attached to each alternative and the foreign currency exchange rate.\n\nThere is no provision for the remediation of the Huntly generation site because the Group has the right to lease the site in perpetuity, there is no /fixed or planned termination date for the Huntly lease and the site remains a key electricity generation site for the Group. The lease of the site is independent of decisions around the retirement of Huntly units 1 to 4, which are planned to be available to the electricity market until such time they are uneconomic to run. There may be costs and recoveries associated with retiring Huntly units 1 to 4 but these cannot be reliably estimated at this time.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe key assumptions that could have a material impact on the Kupe production facility rehabilitation estimate relate to foreign exchange rates, mobilisation and demobilisation costs for rig and o/ffshore supply vessel and regulatory requirements in relation to the removal of the subsea pipeline. The majority of costs are based in United States dollars and, therefore, are sensitive to /fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If the foreign exchange rate were to decrease by 10 per cent the provision would increase by $10.7 million. Given the equipment required to complete the rehabilitation comes from overseas, the mobilisation and demobilisation costs can /fluctuate signi/ficantly depending on the volume of work the contractor has nearby at the time the rehabilitation is required to be completed. The full cost of mobilisation and demobilisation has been provided for, given the uncertainty around the ability to share these costs with other entities. If the costs could be shared with other entities the provision would decrease by between $10.0 million and $20.0 million. The provision is based on the removal of the shore section of the subsea pipeline. The remaining pipeline will be /flushed and left in situ. If all of the pipeline needed to be removed, the cost would increase the provision by $16.6 million. The rehabilitation is estimated to be completed in approximately 16 years.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## D. Group structure\n\n## D1.

Capital management\n\nThe Group manages its capital to ensure that each entity in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. This is achieved by ensuring that the level and timing of its capital investment programmes, equity raisings and dividend distributions are consistent with the Group's capital structure strategy. This strategy remains unchanged from previous years. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note E5, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the shareholders of Genesis, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the balance sheet.\n\nUnder the Group's debt funding facilities, the Group has given undertakings that the ratio of debt to equity will not exceed a prescribed level and the interest cover will not be below a prescribed level. For the purpose of these undertakings the capital bonds and related interest costs are treated as 50 per cent equity. The covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure they are complied with. There were no breaches in covenants during the year (2019: nil).\n\n| E2.

The redeemed capital bonds were replaced by $240.0 million capital bonds with a maturity date of 16 July 2048. This issue pays a quarterly coupon of 4.65 per cent per annum. On the /first reset date and every /five years thereafter, the interest rate will reset to be the sum of the /fiveyear swap rate on the relevant reset date plus the margin of 2.01 per cent per annum plus the step-up margin of 0.25 per cent per annum. Issue costs are amortised over /five years to the /first reset date.

The next interest rate reset is June 2022 for the FY47 bonds and July 2023 for the FY49 bonds.\n\n## USPP\n\nDuring the 2015 /financial year the Group issued $150.0 million United States dollar-denominated unsecured notes to United States-based institutional investors. Cross currency interest rate swaps ('CCIRS') have been used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate risks on the notes (refer to note F4 for further information on CCIRS).\n\nWhile the New Zealand dollar amount required to repay the USPP is /fixed as a result of the CCIRS, the USPP is required to be translated to New Zealand dollars at the spot rate at the reporting date.

Risk management (continued)\n\n## Other risks\n\n## Nature and exposure to the Group\n\n## Note How the risk is managed\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its /financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will always have su/fficient funds to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in /financial loss to the Group. The Group has no signi/ficant concentrations of credit risk and the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and derivative assets in the balance sheet represent the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at balance date.\n\nF7\n\nC1\n\nBS, F1\n\nThe Group has a policy that requires the debt facilities to be maintained with a minimum headroom amount above the projected peak debt levels over the next 12 months. Liquidity risk is monitored by continuously forecasting cash /flows and matching the maturity pro/files of /financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group's ability to attract cost-e/ffective funding is largely driven by its credit standing (Standard & Poor's = BBB+). Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining su/fficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the spreading of debt maturities.\n\n## Wholesale electricity sales\n\nThe Group purchases wholesale electricity for its retail customer base, therefore the credit risk is limited to the net amount receivable after deducting purchases. Market participants are required to provide letters of credit to the market-clearing agent (NZX Limited), which would be called upon should any market participant default.\n\n## Retail electricity sales, gas, LPG and oil sales\n\nThe Group minimises its exposure to credit risk by applying credit limits, obtaining collateral where appropriate and applying credit-management practices, such as monitoring the size and nature of exposures and mitigating the risk deemed to be above acceptable levels. The credit risk is mitigated by the Group's large customer base and the diverse range of industries customers operate in.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts\n\nCredit risk is managed by using high-credit quality /financial institutions and other organisations. The Group's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored to ensure the risk is spread among approved counterparties.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n| F1.

However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-/financial asset (for example, inventory) or liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in the cash /flow hedge reserve are reclassi/fied from the cash /flow hedge reserve and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.\n\nOnce hedge accounting is discontinued the cumulative gain or loss remains in the cash /flow hedge reserve and is reclassi/fied to the income statement either when the transaction occurs or if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, it is reclassi/fied immediately.\n\nFair value hedges where the derivative is used to manage the variability in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nOnce hedge accounting is discontinued the fair value adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to the income statement from that date through to maturity of the hedged item.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting.\n\nThe Group's policy is to designate derivatives in hedge relationships on inception when their fair value is zero, applying a hedge ratio of 1:1. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the amount and timing of their respective cash /flows, reference rates, pricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been e/ffective in, o/ffsetting the changes in cash /flows of the hedged item.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nThis category includes derivatives that economically hedge /financial risks but have not been designated in hedge relationships for accounting purposes. In these cases changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement within the change in fair value of /financial instruments line (refer to note F5).\n\nCertain electricity derivatives, electricity future contracts and PPAs cannot be hedge accounted under NZ IFRS 9. These are principally swap and option contracts that provide dry year cover for counterparties, electricity futures o/ffered to the market to enable other counterparties to hedge their electricity risks and PPAs with renewable energy suppliers. The variable nature of renewable energy makes it di/fficult to demonstrate that the PPA is highly e/ffective as required by NZ IFRS 9, despite the fact the PPA is an e/ffective economic hedge.\n\nForward purchase and forward sale agreements for emission units are entered into for both 'own use' and 'held for trading'. Agreements to purchase emission units for the Group's own use are not recognised in the /financial statements until the units are delivered. Forward purchase and forward sale agreements held for trading do not meet the 'own use' exemption and are accounted for as derivatives. These contracts are measured at fair value and any gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe e/ffects of the Group's application of hedge accounting in respect of derivatives used to manage /financial risks are shown in notes F2 to F5.",

Oil price swaps are entered into to manage the variability of cash /flows from oil sales. Cash /flow hedge accounting is applied.\n\nGains and losses on electricity swaps are recognised in electricity revenue and gains and losses on oil price swaps are recognised in oil revenue. Electricity revenue includes $25.6 million (2019: $22.6 million) of option fees on electricity swaps and options.\n\nThe main source of ine/ffectiveness for electricity swaps relates to the di/fference between the market price and the strike price at inception of the contracts. For oil price swaps ine/ffectiveness\n\narises due to price premiums and discounts on oil sales (the hedged item) that are not present in the hedging instrument.\n\nAt balance date the carrying value of non-hedge accounted electricity swaps and options and PPAs was a $13.0 million asset and electricity future options was a $3.5 million liability (2019: $19.1 million asset, $5.0 million liability). The nominal value at balance date of non-hedge accounted electricity swaps and options and PPAs was $930.6 million (2019: $202.3 million).

Cash /flow hedge accounting is applied. The amount and maturity of the derivative and forecast transactions are aligned to ensure the hedge relationship remains e/ffective.\n\nThe Group uses CCIRS to manage foreign exchange risk on the USPP. All interest and principal repayments are hedged. The combination of the foreign-denominated debt and CCIRS results in a net exposure to New Zealand dollar /floating interest rates and a /fixed New Zealand dollar-denominated principal repayment.\n\nThe principal, basis and margin components of the CCIRS are designated as a cash /flow hedge and the benchmark component of the CCIRS is designated as a fair value hedge of the USPP notes. The change in fair value relating to the foreign currency basis spread component of the CCIRS is excluded from the hedge relationship. The change is recognised in other comprehensive income in a separate Cost of Hedging Reserve (CoHR).\n\nGains and losses on foreign exchange contracts reclassi/fied to the income statement are recognised in operating expenses and oil revenue. Gains and losses reclassi/fied to the income statement on CCIRS are recognised in /finance expenses.\n\n## F5.

Fair value measurement\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nGeneration assets disclosed in note B1, emission units held for trading disclosed in note C2 and derivatives disclosed in note F1 are the only assets and liabilities carried at fair value in the balance sheet. In addition to this goodwill associated with the retail LPG business is tested for impairment using fair value less disposal costs (refer to note B3). While borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, they are subsequently measured at amortised cost in the balance sheet. The fair value of borrowings is required to be disclosed (refer to note E5). The nature of the inputs into the fair value calculation determines the level applied in the fair value hierarchy. Each level is outlined below:\n\nLevel one - the fair value is determined using unadjusted quoted prices from an active market for identical assets and liabilities. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, a dealer, a broker, an industry group, a pricing service or a regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's-length basis.\n\nLevel two - the fair value is derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for\n\nthe asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Financial instruments in this level include interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts, oil price swaps, CCIRS and electricity derivatives valued using the ASX forward price curve.\n\nLevel three - the fair value is derived from inputs that are not based on observable market data. Financial instruments included in this level are electricity derivatives and PPAs valued using the wholesale electricity price path.\n\nThe Group's policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the date the change in circumstances occurred. Refer to the reconciliation of level three electricity swaps and options and PPAs table for transfers between levels.\n\nAll derivatives disclosed in F1 other than electricity swaps and options and PPAs are considered level two. The $2.0 million electricity swap and option and PPAs net asset comprises a $2.0 million liability classi/fied as level two and a $4.0 million asset classi/fied as level three (2019: $1.3 million liability and $25.0 million liability respectively).\n\n## Valuation of level two derivatives\n\nThe fair values of level two derivatives are determined using discounted cash /flow models.

The key inputs and assumptions are: the callable volumes, strike price and option fees outlined in the agreement, the wholesale electricity price path ('price path'), 'day one' gains and losses, emission credits and the discount rate. The options are deemed to be called when the price path is higher than the strike prices after taking into account obligations relating to the speci/fic\n\nterms of each contract. No calling is required for the swaps and there are no option fees. The price path is the signi/ficant unobservable input in the valuation model. Refer to note B1 for information in relation to the method used to determine the price path.

The contract price of non-exchange traded electricity derivative contracts and PPAs are agreed on a bilateral basis, the pricing for which may di/ffer from the prevailing derived market price for a variety of reasons. In these circumstances an adjustment is made to bring the initial fair value of the contract to zero at inception. The adjustment is called a 'day one' gain (loss) and is deferred and amortised, based on expected volumes over the term of the contract. The following table details the movements and amounts of deferred 'day one' gains (losses) included in the fair value of level three electricity swaps and options and PPAs:\n\n|                                      | 2020 $ million   | 2019 $ million   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Balance as at 1 July                 | 134.5            | 69.4             |\n| New derivatives                      | -                | 78.6             |\n| Amortisation of existing derivatives | (16.1)           | (13.5)           |\n| Balance as at 30 June                | 118.4            | 134.5            |\n\n## G. Other\n\n## G1. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates four share-based payment plans (Long-Term Incentive Plan ('LTI'), Performance Share Rights Plan ('PSR'), Talent Retention Plan ('TRP') and Employee Share Scheme ('ESS')) to enable sta/ff to share in the ownership of Genesis.\n\nThe cost of the plans is recognised over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are ful/filled. The total amount expensed is based on the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest, taking into consideration the likelihood that service conditions will be met, multiplied by the initial fair value of each share.\n\n|                            | Note                       |   2020 $ million | 2019 $ million   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| LTI                        | G2                         |              0.4 | 0.6              |\n| PSR                        | G2                         |              0.3 | -                |\n| TRP                        |                            |              0.2 | 0.2              |\n| ESS                        |                            |              0.2 | 0.6              |\n| Total expense for the year | Total expense for the year |              1.1 | 1.4              |\n\n## G2. Related party transactions\n\n## Majority shareholder and entities controlled by, and related to, the majority shareholder\n\nThe majority shareholder of Genesis is the Crown. The Group transacts with Crown-controlled and related entities independently and on an arm's-length basis for the following goods and services: royalties, emission obligations, scienti/fic consultancy services, electricity transmission, postal services, rail services and energy-related products (including electricity derivatives). All transactions with Crown-controlled and related entities are based on commercial terms and conditions and relevant market drivers.\n\nDuring the year the Crown received $90.1 million in dividends (2019: $88.4 million) of which $71.0 million was paid in cash (2019: $67.5 million) and $19.1 million was paid in shares (2019: $20.9 million). There were no other individually signi/ficant transactions with the Crown (2019: nil).\n\nThe Group has /five signi/ficant electricity swap and option contracts with Meridian Energy, a Crown-controlled entity. The electricity swap and option contracts period and pro/file vary between the range of 12.5MW and 150MW, from the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2025. In addition to these contracts there are a small number of insigni/ficant contracts with Crowncontrolled and related entities.\n\nApproximately 16.6 per cent of the value of electricity derivative assets and approximately 16.8 per cent of the value of electricity derivative liabilities at year end are held with Crown-controlled and related entities (2019: 36.4 per cent and 54.1 per cent respectively). The contracts expire at various times; the latest expiry date is December 2025.\n\n## Key management personnel compensation\n\nKey management personnel of the Group consists of the Directors and the Executive Management team.\n\n|                                              | Note   | 2020 $ million   |   2019 $ million |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|------------------|\n| Short-term bene/fits                         |        | 7. 3             |              6.9 |\n| Post-employment bene/fits                    |        | 0.3              |              0.2 |\n| Termination bene/fits                        |        | -                |              0.2 |\n| Share-based payments    (LTI and PSR)        | G1     | 0.7              |              0.6 |\n| Total key management  personnel compensation |        | 8.3              |              7.9 |\n\nIncluded in short-term bene/fits are directors' fees of $0.9 million (2019: $0.9 million).\n\n## LTI\n\nUnder the LTI plan senior executives purchase shares at market value, funded by interest-free loans from Genesis. The shares are held on trust by the Trustee until the end of the vesting period. Dividends on the shares during the vesting period are deducted from the loan balance. If the shares vest, each executive is entitled to a cash amount which, after deduction for tax, is equal to the outstanding loan balance on day one for the shares that have vested. That cash amount must be applied towards repayment of the loan balance and the corresponding shares and dividends on the shares during the vesting period are released to the executive.\n\nVesting of shares is dependent on continued employment throughout the vesting period and achievement of certain performance targets (a relative TSR hurdle compared against industry peers and an absolute TSR hurdle compared against the NZX and ASX).\n\nIf the performance targets are not met or if the executive ceases to be employed by the Group other than for qualifying reasons, no shares will vest and the shares will be forfeited to the Trustee without compensation. The relevant executive will receive no bene/fits under the plan unless the Board exercises its discretion to allow some or all of the shares to vest.\n\n|                            | $         | Number of  options   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Balance at 1 July 2018     | 1,559,680 | 801,063              |\n| Granted - FY19 tranche     | 835,871   | 336,700              |\n| Vested - FY16 tranche      | (331,542) | (181,088)            |\n| Forfeited                  | (122,382) | (57,323)             |\n| Dividends                  | (70,436)  | -                    |\n| Balance as at 30 June 2019 | 1,871,191 | 899,352              |\n| Vested - FY17 tranche      | (419,852) | (258,018)            |\n| Dividends                  | (96,478)  | -                    |\n| Balance at 30 June 2020    | 1,354,861 | 641,334              |\n\n| Grant date   | Performance period         |\n|--------------|----------------------------|\n| FY18 *       | 1 July 2017 - 30 June 2020 |\n| FY19         | 1 July 2018 - 30 June 2021 |",

        "page_content": "## G2. Related party transactions (continued)\n\n## PSR\n\nDuring the year the Group implemented the PSR plan. Under the PSR senior executives are granted performance share rights. Vesting of the rights is dependent on continued employment throughout the vesting period and achievement of certain performance targets (a relative TSR hurdle compared against industry peers and an absolute TSR hurdle compared against the cost of equity). Each performance share right that vests entitles the participant to one ordinary share in Genesis for no consideration and 'dividend equivalents' that would have been earned on the share over the vesting period. No share rights will vest if the performance targets are not met or if the participant ceases to be employed by the Group other than for qualifying reasons, unless the Board exercises its discretion to allow some or all of the shares to vest. The performance period is from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2022.\n\n## Other transactions with key management personnel or entities related to them\n\nKey management personnel and their families may purchase gas, electricity and LPG from the Group on an arm's-length basis and may purchase shares in Genesis. Key management personnel also participate in the LTI plan and PSR plan discussed on the previous page and above. The total number of shares held by key management personnel (excluding LTI shares) as at 30 June 2020 was 439,252 (2019: 314,713). During the year dividends paid to key management personnel and their families was $238,663 (2019: $69,150). No other transactions took place between key management personnel and the Group (2019: nil). As at 30 June 2020 the balance payable to key management personnel was nil (2019: nil).\n\n## G3. Auditor's remuneration\n\nAudit fees comprise $0.1 million for the review of the interim /financial statements and $0.5 million for the audit of the annual /financial statements (2019: $0.1 million and $0.5 million respectively). In addition to the audit Deloitte provided the following services during the year: provision of secretarial services for the Corporate Taxpayer Group (of which Genesis is a member), trustee reporting and whistleblower hotline service (2019: provision of secretarial services for the Corporate Taxpayer Group (of which Genesis is a member), trustee reporting, leadership development initiatives for senior employees, customer management software support and whistleblower hotline service). Total fees relating to other services was $0.038 million (2019: $0.139 million).\n\n## G4.

If the lease had commenced on the date the contract was signed, the Group would have recognised an additional $23.9 million lease asset and $31.3 million lease liability. These amounts are indicative values only, given the incremental borrowing rate will not be known until the commencement of the lease in October 2020.\n\n## G5. Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group had contingent assets and liabilities at 30 June 2020 in respect of:\n\n## Land claims, law suits and other claims\n\nGenesis acquired interests in land and leases from Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Limited ('ECNZ') on 1 April 1999. These interests in land and leases may be subject to claims to the Waitangi Tribunal and may be resumed by the Crown. Genesis would expect to negotiate with the new M \u0101 ori owners for occupancy and usage rights of any sites resumed by the Crown. Certain claims have been brought to, or are pending against, ECNZ and the Crown under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975. Some of these claims may a/ffect land and leases purchased from ECNZ. In the event that land is resumed by the Crown, the resumption would be e/ffected by the Crown under the Public Works Act 1981 and compensation would be payable. The Board cannot reasonably estimate the adverse e/ffect (if any) of the claims and cannot provide any assurance that should a claim be raised it would not have a material adverse e/ffect on the Group's business, /financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Gas supply agreement\n\nGenesis is currently engaged in a contractual dispute relating to the carbon terms of one of its long-term gas supply agreements. Following an escalation process, the matter has been referred to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Details of the dispute remain con/fidential and have not been disclosed to avoid any prejudice to the ongoing arbitration process. Genesis is con/fident of a favourable outcome. However, should there be an adverse outcome from the proceedings, potentially up to 1,227,000 carbon units may need to be transferred. As the cost of any unit transfer will depend on when the units are required to be transferred and the make up of units held at that time, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the /financial e/ffect of any transfer.\n\nThere are no other known material contingent assets or liabilities (2019: nil).\n\n## G6. Subsequent events\n\nThe following events occurred subsequent to balance date:\n\n- \u00b7 $90.0 million of dividends were declared on 19 August 2020 (refer to note E4);\n- \u00b7 A $50.0 million additional revolving credit facility was entered into which expires in July 2022;\n- \u00b7 $50.0 million additional wholesale term notes were issued at a /fixed rate of 1.32 per cent which expire in July 2022;\n- \u00b7 On 9 July 2020 NZAS announced its intention to close the Tiwai Point smelter.

The Auditor-General has appointed me, Bryce Henderson, using the sta/ff and resources of Deloitte Limited, to carry out the audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the Group on his behalf.\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated /financial statements of the Group on pages 40 to 73, that comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2020, the consolidated comprehensive income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash /flow statement for the year ended on that date, and the notes to the consolidated /financial statements that include accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated /financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated /financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2020, and its consolidated /financial performance and its consolidated cash /flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the AuditorGeneral's Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Professional and Ethical Standards and the International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated /financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Auditor-General's Auditing Standards, which incorporate Professional and Ethical Standard 1: International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nIn addition to the audit we have carried out assignments in the areas of trustee reporting, scrutineer's notice, secretarial services for the corporate tax payer group, whistleblower hotline service, and review of the interim report which are compatible with those independence requirements. These services have not impaired our independence as auditor of the Group.\n\nIn addition to these assignments, principals and employees of our /firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the Group. Other than the audit and these assignments and trading activities, we have no relationship with, or interests in the Group.\n\n## Audit Materiality\n\nWe consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the consolidated /financial statements of the Group, that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or in/fluenced (the 'quantitative' materiality). In addition, we also assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or in/fluence the decisions of such a person (the 'qualitative' materiality). We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\n\nWe determined the quantitative materiality for the consolidated /financial statements as a whole to be $10 million.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matters and results\n\n## Valuation of Generation Assets\n\nGeneration assets are measured at fair value as set out in note B1 of the consolidated /financial statements. The carrying amount at 30 June 2020 is $3,177 million.\n\nThe fair value of generation assets is estimated using an internally generated discounted cash /flow model. A valuation was undertaken at 30 June 2020 which showed the net book value approximated its fair value and as such, there has been no revaluation increase or decrease recorded in the current year.\n\nThe signi/ficant inputs used to assess the fair value of the generation assets are the wholesale electricity price path, generation volumes, and the discount rate. The signi/ficant inputs inherently factor in the impacts of COVID-19. The wholesale electricity price path is estimated by Genesis Energy as described in note B1 of the consolidated /financial statements and assumed the ongoing operation of New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS) at Tiwai Point, which was consistent with market data available at 30 June 2020.\n\nAs disclosed under note B1 and 'General information and signi/ficant matters', NZAS announced on 9 July 2020 the closure of Tiwai Point Smelter. This is considered a nonadjusting subsequent event and is therefore not re/flected in the wholesale electricity price path at 30 June 2020.\n\nThe estimate of the wholesale electricity price path is the most signi/ficant input in estimating the fair values determined for the generation assets and a/ffects the estimated generation volumes which are also used in the fair value calculation. Changes to the forecast of the wholesale electricity price path could signi/ficantly change the estimated fair value of the generation assets.\n\nWe included the valuation of generation assets as a key audit matter due to the level of judgement required in forecasting the wholesale electricity price path.\n\n## Valuation of Electricity Derivatives\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a number of market risks, including electricity, gas and oil price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, which are managed using derivative /financial instruments.\n\nAt 30 June 2020 derivative assets were $148.6 million and derivative liabilities were $111.3 million as set out in note F1 of the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nMany of the Group's derivatives are valued using standard valuation techniques based primarily on observable inputs. However, some electricity swaps, options and Power Purchase Agreements are valued using inputs that are not based on observable market data, such as the wholesale electricity price path forecast which is prepared by Genesis Energy valuers.\n\nAs explained in the 'Valuation of Generation Assets' section above, the wholesale electricity price path forecast requires signi/ficant judgement.\n\nValuations which re/flect signi/ficant unobservable inputs are considered to be 'level 3' valuations as described in note F8 of the consolidated /financial statements. At 30 June 2020, the Group had $4 million of electricity derivatives considered to be within level 3.\n\nWe included the valuation of level 3 electricity derivatives as a key audit matter due to the judgement involved in evaluating the inputs to the valuation models.\n\nOur audit procedures included assessing the key inputs to the model used to estimate the fair value of the generation assets. Our procedures, which included the use of our internal valuation experts, were primarily focused on evaluating the process undertaken by Genesis Energy in forecasting the wholesale electricity price path and assessing whether the forecast was consistent with internal and external data.\n\nWe assessed the professional competence of the Genesis Energy valuers involved in the forecasting of the electricity price path and valuation of the generation assets.\n\nWe also compared budgeted performance information from prior periods to actual data to assess the accuracy of the forecasting process.\n\nWe assessed the forecast wholesale electricity price path which included internal and externally derived data.\n\nWe also evaluated the assumptions used in forecasting the electricity price path to determine whether they were consistent with assumptions used across the business, including management budgets and valuations of other assets including certain electricity derivatives.\n\nThis also included assessing the determination that the key assumptions in the model were not signi/ficantly impacted by COVID-19, as disclosed under 'General information and signi/ficant matters' in the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nWe assessed the treatment of the announcement of the intention to close the Tiwai Point smelter by August 2021 as a non adjusting subsequent event.\n\nWe performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions applied in determining the fair value of the generation assets and considered the adequacy of the Group's disclosures.\n\nWe have found the assumptions and resulting valuation to be reasonable.\n\nWe tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of key controls related to the recording and valuation of the level 3 electricity derivative transactions.\n\nWe challenged key assumptions applied by management and agreed underlying data to the contract terms on a sample basis. We have independently recalculated the fair value of a sample of electricity derivatives.\n\nOur internal valuation experts have evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology applied in valuation models for the level 3 electricity derivatives.\n\nWe also performed audit work on the wholesale electricity price path as explained above under the section entitled 'Valuation of Generation Assets'.\n\nWe have found the assumptions and resulting valuations to be reasonable.\n\nI N D E P E N D E N T   A U D I T O R ' S   R E P O R T\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated /financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of audit opinion or assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated /financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Directors' responsibilities for the consolidated /financial statements\n\nThe Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated /financial statements in accordance with New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated /financial statements, the Directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Directors' responsibilities arise from the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated /financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Auditor-General's Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of shareholders taken on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Auditor-General's Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the directors and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7  Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\nOur responsibilities arise from the Public Audit Act 2001.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBryce Henderson Deloitte Limited On behalf of the Auditor-General\n\nAuckland, New Zealand 19 August 2020",

It sets out remuneration information for the Chief Executive, the Executive Team and Directors. Director and employee remuneration is also discussed in the Company's Corporate Governance Statement which can be viewed at www.genesisenergy.co.nz/ investors/governance/documents.\n\nGenesis Energy follows the New Zealand Shareholder Association's guide to assist all investors to understand how remuneration is aligned with value creation for its shareholders. Genesis' remuneration policy for the Executive Team including the Chief Executive is designed to have them remunerated with competitive salaries, a wide range of bene/fits and use of performance incentives to achieve outstanding performance and alignment with our shareholders' interests. The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the remuneration policy. For the Executive Team the policy provides the opportunity to achieve, where performance has been outstanding, a total remuneration package in the upper quartile for equivalent market matched roles. Each year the Committee reviews the performance and remuneration appraisals of the Executive, with the Board approving the Chief Executive's remuneration.\n\nTotal remuneration for the Executive Team is made up of three elements: /fixed remuneration, short-term incentives and long-term incentives.\n\nFixed remuneration consists of base salary and bene/fits and is targeted to be in the third quartile of the market. External benchmarking is commissioned by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee to be carried out independently by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nShort Term incentives (STIs) are 'a pay for performance' component designed to motivate and reward performance in a single /financial year. The target value of an STI is set annually as a percentage of the Executive's /fixed remuneration. For FY20 the target for the Chief Executive was 50 per cent and for other Executives was between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. The performance measures to achieve the STI are then set across Company KPIs for EBITDAF, Customer, Health and Safety and individual KPIs. Within each measure, there are three performance levels, 'threshold', 'on target' and 'outstanding'. On appraisal at the end of each year an Executive will be awarded an STI payment based on their performance between a range of zero per cent for below threshold performance, to 150 per cent for outstanding performance.\n\nThe Long Term incentives (LTI) are also 'a pay for performance' component designed to align rewards for the Executive with shareholder value over a three year period. Only the Executive are eligible to participant in the LTI. Genesis Energy's LTI scheme was reviewed and a new performance share rights plan established in FY20\n\n## The total remuneration earned by the Chief Executive, Mr Marc England for FY19 & FY20 is as follows:\n\nTOTAL\n\n| FIXED REMUNERATION   | FIXED REMUNERATION   | FIXED REMUNERATION   | FIXED REMUNERATION   | PAY FOR PERFORMANCE   | PAY FOR PERFORMANCE   | PAY FOR PERFORMANCE   | REMUNERATION   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Period               | BASE SALARY          | BENEFITS             | SUBTOTAL             | STI                   | LTI                   | SUBTOTAL              |                |\n| FY20                 | 1,226,464            | 79,678               | 1,306,142            | 495,793               | 269,678               | 765,471               | 2,071,613      |\n| FY19                 | 1,164,730            | 90,447               | 1,255,177            | 719,291               | 377,163               | 1,096,454             | 2,351,631      |\n\nThe Base Salary is inclusive of holiday pay paid as per New Zealand legislation. Bene/fits include employer contributions towards KiwiSaver on the base salary, short term incentives (STI) and long term incentives (LTI).  The FY18 LTI grant, which matured in FY20, met the absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) metric measured against the NZX and ASX performance, but did not meet the relative TSR metric measured against the Peer group ending 30 June 2020 and achieved a 50 per cent vesting outcome.\n\nThe FY20 LTI value above represents the gross LTI bonus earned on vesting of the FY18 LTI grant. The net LTI bonus was applied to repay Marc England's LTI loan balance. The accumulated cash dividends net of withholding tax of $33,526 was paid to Marc England in July 2020. The dividends are earned subsequent to the initial grant and are excluded from the LTI amount above. Following repayment of his LTI loan balance, 75,017 ordinary Genesis shares with a market value of $3.03 were transferred to Marc England on 17 July 2020.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURES\n\nto ensure it continues to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executive members to drive outstanding outcomes for our customers and our shareholders.\n\nUnder the new LTI plan, executives are granted a number of  share rights determined by dividing the gross value of the grant by the value of one Genesis share at the date of the grant. At vesting, subject to meeting the performance hurdles set at the time of grant, each share right is converted to one ordinary share. LTI payments, if achieved, are made in Genesis shares rather than cash. The executive may also receive additional shares representing the value of dividends paid over the vesting period. The executive is liable for tax on the shares received at this point. Under the new plan, grants will continue to be made annually with performance measured over a three-year period. The Board retains discretion over the /final outcome.\n\nIn FY20 LTI grants were made to the Executive Team and the value of the grants were set at a percentage of /fixed remuneration between a range of 25 per cent to 60 per cent.\n\n## Breakdown of Chief Executive's pay for performance FY20\n\n|     | DESCRIPTION                                                                                       | PERFORMANCE MEASURES                                                                                                                                                 | MAXIMUM   PERCENTAGE POSSIBLE   | PERCENTAGE  ACHIEVED %   |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| STI | Set at 50% of /fixed remuneration                                                                 | 60% based on Company shared KPIs, of  EBITDAF, Customer and Enhancing our Right  to Operate to include Safety and Wellness  performance 40% based on Individual KPIs | 150%                            | 85%                      |\n| LTI | Conditional awards of shares under  a Long Term Incentive Plan set at  60% of /fixed remuneration | 50 weighting relative TSR performance  against generator peer group, 50% weighting  absolute TSR against NZX  performance                                            | 100%                            | 50%                      |\n\nThe above STI and LTI payments for FY20 were paid in FY21\n\n## The following new interests granted in FY20 for vesting in FY22\n\n| GRANT YEAR   | LTI GROSS VALUE                                    | PERFORMANCE PERIOD    | PERFORMANCE MEASURE                                                  |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| FY20         | $699,943 in the form of   performance share rights | July 2019 - June 2022 | 50% weighting relative TSR performance against  generator peer group |\n|              | $699,943 in the form of   performance share rights |                       | 50% weighting absolute TSR performance                               |\n\nIn FY20 Marc England's annual LTI was granted as performance share rights under the Genesis Performance Share Rights Plan. Under the Plan the CE was granted rights that when vested at the expiry of a three-year performance period will entitle him to acquire fully paid Genesis ordinary shares. The number of rights granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Genesis shares for the 10 trading days prior to the share price purchase date. Subject to satisfaction of performance hurdles related to the above Performance Measures and continued employment, at vesting each right converts to one fully paid Genesis ordinary share. If a performance hurdle is not met (or the CE leaves Genesis prior to the vesting date) then the rights associated with the performance hurdle lapse.\n\n## Five year summary - Chief Executive remuneration\n\n| CHIEF EXECUTIVE   |      | TOTAL   REMUNERATION   | PERCENTAGE STI  ACHIEVED AGAINST   MAXIMUM %   | PERCENTAGE   VESTED LTI AGAINST  MAXIMUM   | LTI   PERFORMANCE   PERIOD   |\n|-------------------|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Marc England      | FY20 | $2,071,613             | 57%                                            | 50%                                        | July 2017 - June 2020        |\n| Marc England      | FY19 | $2,351,631             | 85%                                            | 100%                                       | July 2016 - June 2019        |\n| Marc England      | FY18 | $2,061,265             | 79%                                            | 100%                                       | July 2015 - June 2018        |\n| Marc England      | FY17 | $1,429,928             | 68%                                            | N/A                                        | N/A                          |\n| Marc England      | FY16 | $308,070               | 43%                                            | N/A                                        | N/A                          |\n| Albert Brantley   | FY16 | $2,114,862             | 43%                                            | N/A                                        | N/A                          |\n\nTotal remuneration including Salary, Bene/fits, and STI and LTI earned in the year but paid in the following year.\n\n## Five year summary - TSR Performance\n\n<!-- image -->",

This could additionally include heightened environmental focus and restrictions when renewing operating consents for Genesis' generation assets.\n- \u00b7 Carbon price increases, either due to regulatory intervention or supply/demand shift in ETS, increasing the cost of thermal generation.\n\nThe primary /financial risk is one of stranded thermal assets. Genesis values these assets based on a discounted cash/flow method.\n\nThese valuations align to our short-term categorisation of this risk category, factoring that this is when the biggest impact on our strategy and the /financial consequence could be seen. Beyond this timeframe our strategy provides for a signi/ficantly reduced level of thermal generation, hence the impact of these risks would be lower.\n\nThese /financial risks are also factored into the risk impact rating, noting that the /financial risk of stranded assets reduces every year as the discounted cash /flows reduce the balance sheet asset value.\n\nThe moderate residual risk impact rating also includes other consequences unrelated to asset values. For example, a fasterthan-expected reduction in thermal generation could result in reduced earnings, costs associated with long-term fuel purchase commitments and a potentially over-hedged carbon position.\n\nAdditionally, some aspects of our strategy involve New Zealand's energy transition which is reliant on a stable electricity market which thermal generation 'backup' currently supports. Shortterm uncertainty could result in increased or more volatile prices representing a risk to these strategic paths, for example, slower electri/fication of transport or industrial process heat.\n\n## Key mitigations considered when assessing these risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Thermal generation is only a part of our overall generation /fleet. Renewable generation would not be impacted by these risks, or could bene/fit from increased market prices or volatility.\n- \u00b7 Baseload thermal generation is a decreasing aspect of our business, and we have assumed achieving our carbon emission reduction targets and other publicised statements, such as coal reduction commitments.\n- \u00b7 A hedged position is held against carbon price increase, including investment in o/ffsetting forestry projects.\n\n## Key market opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Many of these risks would be economy-wide, impacting many emissions-intensive businesses. This could contribute to them electrifying and increase electricity demand. For example, transport and industrial heating sectors look to electrify in the coming years, meeting this demand with a/ffordable, renewable generation. This creates opportunities and also the potential for partnering with these companies during their transition.\n\n## Environmental and physical changes that impact thermal generation\n\nThe primary risk is one of reduced short-term availability of generation assets due to weather or climate-related events.\n\nThere are a number of physical changes associated with climate change that could a/ffect our ability to operate thermal generation or reduce our generation capacity. Risks predominantly relate to the Huntly Power Station's operating consents (such as river heating) or physical impacts to production at our Kupe joint-venture with Beach Energy.\n\n## Example risks for Genesis:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased constraints on Huntly's generation due to warmer Waikato River temperatures; either due to general atmospheric heating or reduced river /flow due to drought.\n- \u00b7 Reduced Huntly gas turbine output due to higher ambient air temperatures for the inlet and cooling water cycle.\n- \u00b7 Gas supply restrictions resulting from storms and strong sea currents restricting platform access or if these conditions lead to supply disruptions.\n\nShort-term and moderate classi/fications align to other thermalbased risks, factoring that it is only one aspect of our business and forecast to diminish.\n\n## Key mitigations considered when assessing these risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Major disruptions to gas supply restrictions from storms would likely be short term, and similar incidents in the past have been remedied in a small number of days. The Huntly Power Station stockpile of alternative fuel could act as a mitigation in that period, if required. For a larger impact, multiple events would have to coincide, so are less likely (for example, a severe storm damaging gas pipelines at the end of a very dry period, a/ffecting multiple diverse thermal fuel supplies both from New Zealand and abroad).\n- \u00b7 Additional supplementary cooling equipment could be added if necessary to extend asset life. This would however have to be weighed against the economics of that additional life, factoring in potential reduced thermal generation, and long term regulatory uncertainty.\n- \u00b7 Planned thermal reduction creates 'headroom' in some consents as the plant may be running at lower capacity.\n\n## Key Opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 As disclosed within the previous category our thermal assets are valued for, on average, the next 10-12 years. This assumes that a solution for New Zealand's dry-year risk has been found and implemented by the market. If this is not the case beyond this period, the market may still need  thermal generation to secure supply, creating value not currently recognised.",

        "page_content": "## TCFD Appendix: Strategy 1 (a)\n\n## Consumer and investor preferences impacting our operating landscape\n\nRisks in this area re/flect potential shifts in investor, customer and stakeholder sentiment, particularly brand and reputation risks that lead to a perceived loss of 'social license to operate'.\n\nThis could require a response in the form of our strategy, business structure or operations, and the success of this response would determine the impact level. If capitalised upon, the opportunities could outweigh the risks.\n\n## Example risks for Genesis:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased consumer awareness of carbon-emitting businesses, with sentiment shifting against non-renewable energy, reducing our retail demand as customers migrate to other retailers/ generators.\n- \u00b7 Access to capital and a downward shift in investor preference. Investors and insurers may look to reduce their exposure to carbon-emitting businesses or blacklist investment in their activities, similar to blacklisting of tobacco, weaponry or gambling investments in the past.\n- \u00b7 Direct government intervention, such as forcing the closure of Huntly or banning coal imports.\n\nThe moderate risk rating and short-to-medium term timeframe applied to these risks factor the level of unpredictability in how engaged investors and consumers will be in the required transition to a low emissions economy, as well as key mitigations below.\n\n## Key mitigations factored into our risk assessment:\n\n- \u00b7 Ability to adapt to market dynamics and customer expectations.\n- \u00b7 Corporate agility, ability to expand into new markets and evolve business models.\n- \u00b7 Our strategy to transition our generation business to renewables and our commitment to exit coal by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Our strategy to reinvent how customers engage with energy.\n\n## Key market opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 As consumer awareness of carbon footprints increases, this creates an opportunity to engage with customers, and have them engage with their energy, a key part of our strategy. This year the Genesis Energy IQ platform introduced EcoTracker so customers can track electricity use and make eco-friendly consumer choices, which in turn can reduce demand.\n- \u00b7 Increased emissions awareness from investors also increases interest from potential partners to develop renewable energy solutions.\n\n## Technological disruption to existing business models\n\nChanges in technology could disrupt demand or the market. Risks in this area re/flect potential market shifts, many of which would also create opportunities. This could require a response in the form of our strategy, business structure or operations, and the success of this response would determine the impact level. If capitalised on then the opportunities could outweigh the risk.\n\nThe risks at a macro level could also be summarised as management making unsuccessful investment or strategic decisions in the transition to a lower emission company and country.\n\n## Example opportunities/risks for Genesis:\n\n- \u00b7 E/fficiencies and costs of baseload renewable energy generation (i.e. the cost of solar panels, next-gen wind turbines) falls below the cost of baseload thermal generation.\n- \u00b7 Electric vehicle uptake accelerates signi/ficantly, lowering the costs of fossil fuels but increasing load on the grid.\n- \u00b7 Consumers' use technology such as EcoTracker to plan their energy consumption around o/ff-peak times, reducing the need for thermal baseload or peaker generation.\n- \u00b7 Grid-scale and customer battery power storage, alleviating NZ's seasonal storage challenges.\n\nThe risk rating, and short-to-medium term timeframe applied to these risks, factor in a level of unpredictability, such as the speed of technology advancement and adoption. The extent to which that is a risk, or opportunity, depends on Genesis' ability to learn and adapt. Genesis has made signi/ficant progress in becoming a forwardlooking, customer-centric business and recognise that this must remain a focus of ongoing e/ffort to navigate these risks.\n\nA key aspect of Genesis' strategy involves capitalising on this transition with a focus on this changing landscape. We are actively pursuing new technologies that could contribute to a more renewable future. One example is that we took a 40 per cent share in the EV car-sharing platform Zilch, demonstrating this strategic outlook. We also capitalised on this recently with o/ff-take agreements in the Waipipi Wind Farm in Taranaki.\n\n## Key mitigations factored into our risk assessment:\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate agility, ability to expand into new markets and evolve business models.\n- \u00b7 Our strategy involves transitioning thermal generation to renewables.\n- \u00b7 Our strategy to reinvent how customers engage with energy, using new and emerging technology solutions.\n\n## TCFD Appendix: Strategy 1 (a)\n\n## Long-term climate changes that impact hydro generation\n\nThe long-term gradual e/ffects of climate change have the potential to shift the conditions in which the market currently operates. This could impact water as a resource, decreasing or increasing the amount in our catchment in/flows. This could also have a wider e/ffect such as shifting energy usage in New Zealand: increasing summer temperatures could see an increase in cooling demand, while warmer winters could reduce heating load. Also, global disruption due to climate change, such as displaced populations, could increase immigration to New Zealand and thus energy demand. This long-term unpredictability adds to the risk.\n\n## Example risks for Genesis:\n\n- \u00b7 Altered catchment in/flows due to warmer temperatures, less snowpack and more irregular and intense rainfall e.g. /floods, droughts, increased Probable Maximum Flood (PMF).\n- \u00b7 Less water being available to use. Water may be required for other uses, such as agricultural irrigation, meaning regulation to restrict the amount of water /flowing into our catchments.\n- \u00b7 Increased temperature could reduce generation capacity of current assets. For example, weed proliferation due to elevated water temperatures, which then constrains hydrological generation sites.\n\nPrimary risks relate to our current hydrology-based assets. Our strategy involves diversifying our generation assets but hydro assets likely remain a key part of our business long term. This is re/flected in our asset valuations which extend to ~80 years. Therefore climaterelated risks or uncertainty which impact these assets have the potential to be signi/ficant to our business, which is re/flected in our 'high' impact rating.\n\nForecasts and predictions for long-term climate change constantly evolve. Our current forecast shows that at a catchment level, the Waikaremoana scheme is projected to experience drier conditions at all times of the year, while rainfall may vary in the Tongariro\n\nregion from season to season. Summer may see reduced levels of precipitation, with higher levels over winter. Rainfall events in the Tekapo catchment are expected to increase over the coming decades, driven by warmer average temperatures around the Southern Alps. The latter may reduce the amount of snowpack thereby reducing in/flows from melt during summer, while winter in/flows would increase as precipitation would fall as rain instead of snow.\n\n## Key mitigations considered when assessing these risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Genesis will continue to track and forecast the impacts of the changing climate on our generation assets, and if necessary make generation decisions based on these impacts; continually maintaining a pipeline of development options. Genesis has a diverse portfolio of longer-term generation growth prospects to increase capacity as required, or to displace higher-cost generation in the future.\n- \u00b7 The risks are concentrated around our hydro catchments and the change in generation potential and availability at each. However, with the three catchments being geographically spread, Genesis has some /flexibility and risk mitigation.\n\n## Key opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Although there is a risk of decreased in/flows into our hydro catchments, this is unpredictable and climate changes could also result in increased in/flows to Genesis' catchments, or in/flows which are better aligned to seasonal energy demand (such as increased winter in/flows when energy demand is high).\n- \u00b7 Increased hydrology volatility could drive demand for alternative generation sources, creating development opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Increased international migration as a result of climate change could increase immigration to New Zealand, driving electricity demand and economic growth.\n\n## Acute climate events causing damage to critical infrastructure and assets\n\nExtreme climate-related events represent a risk of damage to generation assets or other infrastructure. While our assets are well placed to manage events much larger than the current historical high, in the long term the extremity of events could become unpredictable and what may be considered a probable maximum event currently could change and be surpassed.\n\n## Example risks for Genesis:\n\n- \u00b7 Loss of civil integrity of generation and ancillary infrastructure (e.g. dams, spillways, storage ponds) due to signi/ficant rainfall or /flood events.\n- \u00b7 Dry days combined with extreme rain increases the risk of landslides in many areas, these have the potential to disrupt transport and communication (restricting access to generation assets), gas pipelines or transmission lines.\n- \u00b7 Prolonged drought leading to bush /fires a/ffecting transmission lines or generation infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Increased wind speed or an extreme wind event could damage transmission lines or wind turbines.\n\nT C F D   A P P E N D I X\n\n* These risks are not currently rated as 'high risk', however, are included above as this category is 'long term' and we are aware that these risks could develop and increase as generation mix evolves.\n\nWe have researched the latest literature to inform our view of these 'long-term' risks. We are aware of the unpredictability presented, and these are actively managed to reduce residual risks to the lowest level possible. It can be observed throughout the world already whereby unprecedented weather events occur.\n\nTherefore although these are categorised long-term, it would not be responsible to delay these risk decisions (for example strengthening a dam), due to that unpredictability. As such we continually assess for structural or infrastructure improvements to reduce these risks to the minimum feasible level.\n\nOne key factor in the high rating is the unpredictability associated with long-term climate predictions.\n\n## Key mitigations considered when assessing these risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining and managing the safety of our dams consistent with best practice, constantly assessing to identify any opportunities to strengthen these assets on an ongoing basis and as technologies advance.",

Governance\n\nGenesis' Chief Executive and Executive Leadership team are accountable for Genesis' actions and commitments to embed climate change into risk management, business strategy and planning, budgeting processes and frameworks.\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee\n\nA sub-committee of the Board forms the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC), overseen by the ARC Chair. The principal purpose of the ARC is to support the Board in its oversight of the Company's risk framework, including the Risk Management Policy and to monitor compliance within that framework. ARC's core functions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Periodically provides a formal review of Genesis' risk management framework and policies. ARC ensures these policies remain /fit for purpose, with appropriate and e/ffective risk management strategies in place. Within the framework is Genesis' Risk Appetite Statement which has a speci/fic carbon emissions section. This Risk Appetite Statement underpins the overall Risk Management Framework.\n- \u00b7 Receiving quarterly risk reports from Executive Management. This covers a range of risk topics, grouped as: key risks, emerging risks, strategic risks and conduct risks. Climate-related risks are de/fined as 'key risks' but also straddle multiple risk categories on occasion.\n- \u00b7 Reporting to the Board on the outcomes of ARC meetings, including discussions concerning risks.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, the Board receives six-monthly updates on key sustainability trends and issues. As an example, the ARC formally endorses both the scenarios used for Genesis' climate related risk assessments and any potential output of those assessments.\n\nThis includes identifying, considering and monitoring climaterelated risks and opportunities and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board.\n\n## Executive risk management\n\nThe core functions of the Executive with regards to managing climate-related risk:\n\n- \u00b7 The Executive are ultimately held accountable by the Board to provide a robust risk overview.\n- \u00b7 The Executive implements the risk mitigation strategies as approved by ARC and, where applicable, the Board. Quarterly risk reports are delivered to ARC, which includes actions taken to mitigate risks previously disclosed.\n- \u00b7 At an operational level the day-to-day management of climaterelated risks, including monitoring performance against targets and delivering on commitments, is dispersed throughout Genesis. Everyone has their part to play, which is emphasised by a strong 'tone at the top' which /flows down throughout the wider business' operations.\n- \u00b7 Emerging and developing risks, including those that are climaterelated, are monitored periodically. This is primarily performed by Genesis' strategy team, the management of which is closely aligned to the Risk team through the Group Manager Strategy and Risk role.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, the Executive review quarterly sustainability updates on the Company's progress against its Sustainability goals.\n\n## TCFD Appendix: 4. Risk Management\n\n## Risk Identi/fication\n\nGenesis is cognisant of the ongoing and developing e/ffects of climate change, along with the potential environmental impacts, and associated operational, regulatory and /financial risks to the business. Climate-related risks are a subset of the Genesis' overall risk management process.\n\n- \u00b7 Risks are identi/fied, assessed and managed by the Risk Management and Strategy teams, under the supervision of the Group Manager Strategy and Risk. The Group Manager Strategy and Risk reports to the Chief Financial O/fficer.\n- \u00b7 Risk specialists are tasked with constant research and market analysis to monitor the Company's risk landscape to identify new, emerging or developing risks. This includes staying up-to-date with all emerging risks including the latest climaterelated research. Each business unit also has a nominated risk champion.\n- \u00b7 The Risk Team provide day-to-day guidance to business units on how best to identify or manage risks.\n- \u00b7 The Risk Team monitor emerging risks, both within the industry, the wider economy, and across international markets, including reporting on such to the Executive and Board. One aspect of this includes contrasting identi/fied key business risks, strategic risks and climate risks against industry publications such as the World Economic Forum's Global Risk report.\n- \u00b7 In addition to the overarching risk management framework, additional procedures are tailored towards speci/fic risk categories. For climate-related risk we apply the recommendations of the TCFD and undertake climate scenario modelling and analysis, described further on Page 18.\n\n## Process of risk management\n\nThe processes for managing climate-related risks are incorporated into Genesis' Risk Framework, which applies to all risks. Developing the systems and policies to manage climate-related risk is a highly adaptive, ongoing process.\n\nDatasets are leveraged from both historical precedent and /flexible forecasting to develop plausible scenario mapping. These scenarios factor in the environmental impacts and associated operational, regulatory and /financial risks to the business. Genesis continues to track and forecast the impacts of the changing climate on our generation assets, and make well-informed decisions based upon that data.\n\nT C F D   A P P E N D I X\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nGiven the Company's exposure to climate-related risk, this has long been factored and deeply incorporated into every aspect of our risk assessments. Our climate-risk processes, including assessment, recognise that climate-related risks are both fundamentally di/fferent to the other risks the Company faces, while also being integrated with the wider risk management operation.\n\n- \u00b7 All risks, including climate-related risk, are assessed using the same framework, whilst also recognising key di/fferences in the underlying characteristics of speci/fic risk categories.\n- \u00b7 Genesis assesses the signi/ficance of each identi/fied climaterelated risk using a risk management matrix. Aligning with the assessment of all risks, the matrix encapsulates a likelihood and consequence aspect, which allows the Company to determine the appropriate level of response for each key risk.\n- \u00b7 Like many companies, key risks and risk management are historically weighted toward the near term to establish prioritisation. This simply does not work for risks such as climate change which can occur across decades. One key di/fference between climate-related risk and other key risks is the 'likelihood' aspect. By its very nature this is di/fficult to accurately quantify especially over these long-term periods and including large numbers of variables.\n- \u00b7 This di/fferentiation is recognised in the way we assess climaterelated risks speci/fically. A greater level of weighting is placed on the 'consequence' aspect of the matrix, than the likelihood. This ensures the correct level of emphasis is placed on mitigating the risks ahead of time.\n- \u00b7 This consequence aspect therefore has a large factor when determining the materiality of the risks we face. Due to the magnitude of climate-related risks and their possible e/ffects on every aspect of the business, this elevates risks to ensure they receive the appropriate attention even if extremely long-term, or of low probabilty. Applied to this, we develop appropriate mitigations such as carbon o/ffsetting and carbon displacement as part of the Company's overall emissions reduction strategies.\n\nDepending on the characteristics of the speci/fic climate risk identi/fied an appropriate management response will be applied, aligning to other risks of a similar nature. Depending on that nature the approach, that will be to mitigate, monitor, transfer or avoid.\n\nThe climate risks we face are integrated within our Risk Management Framework, aligning to other risks of similar characteristics. We regularly monitor whether climate science requires us to reassess these approaches.",

Based on our limited assurance procedures, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that Genesis' GHG inventory for the year ended 30 June 2020 disclosed on page 21 of  the  Genesis 2020 Annual Report, has not been prepared and presented fairly, in all material respects,  in accordance with the Criteria defined below.\n\n## What our assurance covered\n\nWe reviewed  Genesis' total GHG  inventory  (including  scope 1, scope 2 and certain scope 3 emissions from business travel, office waste and use of sold products) for the year ended 30 June 2020, disclosed on page 21 of Genesis' 2020 Annual Report.\n\n## Criteria applied by Genesis\n\nIn preparing the GHG inventory, Genesis applied the Greenhouse Gas  Protocol:  A  Corporate  Accounting and Reporting Standard ('The  GHG  Protocol').  Emissions  factor s ources i nclude t he following (together the 'Criteria'):\n\n- New Zealand Ministry for the Environment, Measuring Emissions: A Guide for Organisations (2019) ('the Criteria').\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n## EY's responsibility and independence\n\nOur  responsibility w as t o  express  a  conclusion o n  Genesis' voluntary  GHG  inventory  disclosure  for  the  year ended 30  June 2020 based on our review.\n\nWe have complied with the relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance  engagements, which include independence  and  other requirements f ounded o n  fundamental  principles o f  integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nIn a ccordance  with t he P rofessional a nd E thical S tandard  3 (Amended),  Ernst  &  Young  Limited  maintains  a  comprehensive system o f  quality  control  including  documented p olicies  and procedures r egarding c ompliance  with e thical r equirements, professional s tandards a nd a pplicable  legal  and  regulatory requirements.\n\n## Genesis' responsibility\n\nGenesis  management ( 'management')  was  responsible  for selecting the Criteria, and preparing and fairly presenting the GHG inventory for the year ended 30 June 2020 in accordance with that Criteria.  This responsibility  includes establishing  and  maintaining internal controls, adequate records and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n## Our approach to conducting the engagement\n\nWe conducted this  review i n  accordance with  the  International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE (NZ) 3000: Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information , ISAE ( NZ)  3410 A ssurance E ngagements o n Greenhouse Gas Statements and the terms of reference  for  this engagement as agreed with Genesis on 12 June 2020.\n\n93\n\n## Summary of assurance procedures performed\n\nA limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries and applying a nalytical, a ppropriate t esting,  and  other  evidencegathering procedures.\n\nOur procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- Conducting interviews with personnel to understand the business and reporting process\n- Checking that the flow of information from site metering or monitoring through to calculation spreadsheets is accurate and any calculations are appropriate\n- Identifying and testing assumptions supporting the calculations\n- Tests of calculation, aggregation and controls\n- Comparing year-on-year activities-based greenhouse gas and energy data, where possible\n- Checking organisational and operational boundaries to test completeness of greenhouse gas emissions sources\n- Checking that emissions factors and methodologies have been correctly applied as per the criteria\n- Reviewing the appropriateness of the presentation of disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.\n\n## Limited Assurance\n\nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance  engagement.  Consequently t he l evel o f  assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than t he a ssurance t hat  would  have b een  obtained h ad a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nWhile we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or p erforming  procedures r elating  to c hecking  aggregation  or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\n## Use of our Assurance Statement\n\nWe disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons other than management and the Directors of Genesis or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\nErnst & Young Limited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGraeme Bennett Partner - Assurance Auckland 19 August 2020\n\nOFFI C E   L O C A T I O N S\n\nHead/Registered O/ffice Genesis Energy Building 660 Great South Road, Greenlane, Auckland 1051 P: 64 9 580 2094 F: 64 9 580 4894 E: info@genesisenergy.co.nz investor.relations@genesisenergy.co.nz board@genesisenergy.co.nz W: genesisenergy.co.nz energyonline.co.nz\n\nHamilton\n\n94 Bryce Street, Hamilton\n\nHuntly Power Station Cnr Te Ohaki and Hetherington Roads, Huntly\n\nTokaanu Power Station State Highway 47, Tokaanu\n\nWaikaremoana Power Station Main Road, Tuai RD5, Wairoa 4195\n\nTekapo Power Station 167 Tekapo Power House Road, Tekapo 7999\n\nA U D I T O R\n\nBryce Henderson for Deloitte Limited has been appointed to perform the audit on behalf of the Auditor-General.\n\nB A N K E R S\n\nWestpac\n\nD E S I G N E D   B Y\n\nJade Shen\n\nP R I N T E D   R E P O R T   P A P E R   S T O C K Our Annual Report is printed on Tauro O/ffset paper stock, which is made from material from well-managed, FSC\u00ae -certi/fied forests and other controlled sources.
