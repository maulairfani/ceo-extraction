Since 2012, we have taken into consideration the recommendations of the International Integrated Reporting Framework.\n\nThe SAP Integrated Report also serves as our United Nations (UN) Global Compact progress report. Since 2018, we have also reported on our contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and embedded the recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nOur combined management report is prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code and the relevant German Accounting Standards.  The combined management report is also a management commentary complying with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Practice Statement Management Commentary.\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our executive management has confirmed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nOur non-financial report is prepared in accordance with sections 289b and 315b of the German Commercial Code, which require us to report, for both, SAP SE and SAP Group, on social, environmental, and other non-financial matters. All non-financial information stipulated in the German Commercial Code, sections 315c and 289c that is relevant to understand SAP's development, performance of the business, and the position of the Group and SAP SE is included in our combined management report. Rather than repeating this information, our Non-Financial Report (which is part of this integrated report at http://www.sap.com/investors/sap2020-combined-non-financial-report) provides references to the sections of our combined management report in which the required disclosures are made.\n\nThe social and environmental data and information included in the SAP Integrated Report is prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. This GRI option indicates that a report contains the minimum information needed to understand the nature of the organization, its material topics and related impacts, and how these are managed. We apply the GRI principles (sustainability context, stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, and completeness) for defining report content. We also report on SDGs identified as material to our strategy.\n\nGreenhouse gas data is prepared based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n## Data\n\nAll financial and non-financial data and information for the reporting period is reported utilizing SAP software solutions and sourced from the responsible business units.\n\nThe reporting period is fiscal year 2020. The report encompasses SAP SE and all subsidiaries of the SAP Group. To make this report as current as possible, we have included relevant information available up to the auditor's opinion dated February 24, 2021. The report is available in English and German.\n\n## Independent Audit and Assurance\n\nKPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft has audited our consolidated financial statements and our combined management report (including the information to which our non-financial report makes references). Additionally, KPMG has provided assurance on selected sustainability information in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, a pertinent standard for the assurance of sustainability reporting. Both the Independent Auditor's Report and the Assurance Report of the Independent Auditor for sustainability information are available in the Independent Auditor's Report section and the Independent Assurance Report section.\n\n## Concept and Realization\n\nThis report was designed by SAP and created with SAP S/4HANA software and the SAP Disclosure Management application.",

The coronavirus has turned the world upside down, and the year has also brought into focus other major challenges - just think climate change or geopolitical tensions. Despite the difficulties the year posed, I hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. For everyone impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, my sincerest thoughts are with you.\n\nAt SAP, we live by our purpose to help the world run better and improve people's lives. So, as the pandemic took hold, in addition to supporting our communities, our priority was to ensure the safety of our employees, partners, and customers, while safeguarding business continuity. We moved nearly all our interactions with customers to a virtual context, including sales, go-lives, and support. Through the year, our software helped companies develop and distribute vaccines, make their supply chains more resilient, adjust business processes, and stay close to their employees' and customers' needs; in short, our resources and solutions helped them move forward.\n\n2020 also brought changes to SAP. In April, I took over as SAP's sole CEO. This is both an honor and a huge responsibility, and I am wholeheartedly committed to the long-term success of SAP.\n\nIn the face of headwinds from the pandemic and ensuing economic crisis, SAP showed our resilience, strength, discipline, and agility in 2020, exceeding all of the topline outlook indicators of our revised outlook and achieving the upper end of the revised profit outlook 1) .\n\nI would like to share an overview of our results:\n\n- -Cloud revenue continued to be the major growth driver, growing 18%. This was impacted by a decline in transactional revenue in our Intelligent Spend business mainly due to a decrease in business travel. Excluding Intelligent Spend, growth across our SaaS/PaaS offerings was 27%.\n- -Current cloud backlog increased by 14%.\n- -Total revenue grew 1%.\n- -Operating profit increased by 4%.\n- -Cloud gross margin increased 3.1pp, reflecting increased efficiency in cloud delivery.\n- -Operating cash flow doubled since last year to \u20ac7.2 billion, while free cash flow increased to \u20ac6.0 billion.\n\nWe achieved strong performance in our non-financials. A renewed focus on putting our customers first led to a strong 10point increase in the Customer Net Promoter Score. The Employee Engagement Index increased a further three percentage points to a record high. And thanks to our continued efforts, together with reduced travel, we were able to decrease our net greenhouse gas emissions to 135 kt, less than half of the prior year's emissions.\n\nWith this, we are pleased that we were able to pay a full dividend in 2020 and returned an additional \u20ac1.5 billion to shareholders through a share buyback. For 2020, we have proposed an annual dividend of \u20ac1.85 per share, representing an increase of 17%.\n\nOur share price performance experienced volatility through the year. While it ended 2020 down 10.9%, SAP remained the most valuable company in the DAX with a market capitalization of \u20ac132 billion. The volatility during the first part of the year was related to\n\nthe pandemic. SAP stock dropped sharply in October after we announced an adjustment to our strategy and medium-term outlook. I know that this was not easy for our shareholders, but we must respond decisively to the requirements of our customers in a fast-changing world.\n\nWe will not weigh the success of our customers and the significant growth potential of SAP against short-term priorities. This is why we are making investments in our portfolio and innovations that further enable customers to adapt to today's highly volatile environment and accelerate our growth in the cloud. Sustainable value creation will continue to be our top priority.\n\nTo this end, we have worked tirelessly to further strengthen our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2020, we have focused our application portfolio on areas where we win clearly, shifting our application workloads to the cloud and embedding intelligence in all our applications. We have tremendously improved integration across our portfolio and will continue our efforts in 2021 at full speed. We are moving away from our legacy infrastructure and accelerating migration to one harmonized cloud delivery platform. We have made SAP Business Technology Platform THE platform for integration, extensibility, and data-to-value, based on one domain model and many other world-class application services. We strengthened our partner ecosystem, extending our solutions and leveraging game-changing capabilities. We have entered new markets, building on the strength of our core:\n\n- -With SAP's industry cloud, we are providing modular cloud solutions to extend the core business of our customers in an open environment, tailored to their individual needs.\n- -We are embedding sustainability into our applications, to manage not only the top- and bottom line of an enterprise, but also to measure and account for environmental factors - the 'green' line.\n- -SAP Business Network enables our customers to manage complex supply chain dependencies no longer along sequential process steps but with all stakeholders in real time.\n- -We initiated our business process intelligence offering to allow customers to model, understand, improve, and transform their business processes at scale.\n\nAnd already in 2021, we introduced the RISE with SAP offering, supporting our customers' holistic business transformation and their move of mission-critical core ERP processes to the cloud.\n\nThe challenges we faced over the last year reconfirmed the relevance of SAP as well as our extensive responsibility and the impact we can have on the economy, the society, and the environment.\n\nWe are honored to support the global fight against COVID-19. In Germany, together with Deutsche Telekom, we developed a contact tracing app (Corona-Warn-App), which is key to breaking infection chains. In fact, seventeen of the top 20 global vaccine producers run SAP solutions. We also support many logistics companies and organizations around the globe that are at the forefront of vaccine distribution.\n\nWe looked at ways we can drive social justice and equality. Among efforts worldwide, we have set a new goal to double the share of Black and African-American employees in the workforce in the United States within the next three years. The share of women",

At the same time, pressure on investments remained high in the persistently low interest rate environment. Comprehensive federal support packages and advances in vaccine development also served to whet investors' risk appetite, which increased rapidly following the initial shock. The stock markets not only rebounded significantly from their year lows as a result, they even reached record highs in several countries, including Germany and the United States. Against this backdrop, SAP stock was also influenced by company-specific events. Losing 10.9% year on year, it significantly underperformed the benchmark indexes DAX 30 and NASDAQ 100, which grew 3.5% and 47.6%, respectively. With a market capitalization of \u20ac131.7 billion at year end, SAP nevertheless continued to be the most valuable company on the DAX.\n\n## SAP Stock Loses Ground Despite Good Growth Prospects\n\nSAP stock started the year at \u20ac 120.32, the Xetra closing price on December 31, 2019, and, with the markets rallying, reached an interim high of \u20ac 129.44 on February 19, the same day SAP announced an increase in the dividend to \u20ac1.58 and a share buyback in the amount of \u20ac1.5 billion. This upward trend included a brief slump at the end of January following publication of our preliminary full year 2019 results, which, despite a raised forecast for 2020, disappointed investors on account of weaker than expected growth in cloud business. From February 24 onwards, the stock markets experienced a massive downturn caused by the pandemic, which saw the SAP share price plunge more than 30% to reach its lowest level for the year of \u20ac87.63 on March 19.\n\nNevertheless, SAP stock clearly outperformed the market in the coming months and was able to maintain this lead during the recovery that followed. The quick implementation of comprehensive economic stimulus and aid packages raised the capital markets' hopes of a swift economic recovery. Technology stocks that benefited from pandemic-driven digitalization trends thus performed significantly better than other stocks in the process.\n\nOur preliminary results for the first quarter of 2020, released on April 8, impressed with strong growth in cloud business; the numbers and the COVID-19-related forecast adjustment both exceeded market expectations, pushing our share price up 4.8%.\n\nSAP stock continued its recovery, and by the end of June even exceeded the previous year's level. Better-than-expected preliminary figures for the second quarter of 2020 then gave the share price an additional strong boost on July 9, taking it a new alltime high on July 22 before lifting it even higher to \u20ac142.26 on August 26. Several waves of selling triggered by profit-taking in U.S. technology stocks, plus rising COVID-19 infection rates, subsequently brought the share price back down to the \u20ac130 range in September.\n\nOn October 25 we published our third-quarter results together with the announcement of our accelerated cloud transition and our revised mid-term outlook. The markets responded with great disappointment. The stock plunged 22% on a single day, and continued to fall until November 2, closing at \u20ac90.18. While the accelerated cloud transition will slow revenue and operating income growth over 2021 and 2022, the revised strategy enables a new path of sustainable and highly profitable growth, and as such, both metrics should return to a strong upward trajectory in the medium term. At year's end, the regulatory approval of vaccines and the start of immunization in many countries increasingly lifted investor sentiment despite new waves of infections. SAP stock benefited from this good mood, climbing to \u20ac107.22 on December 30. Nevertheless, the stock ended the year with a loss of 10.9%.",

Throughout the year, members of the Executive Board of SAP SE and the Investor Relations (IR) team discussed our latest strategy and business development as well as how SAP was helping customers during the pandemic with institutional investors, analysts, and private investors worldwide. With the onset of the pandemic, SAP decided to host all events virtually as of March 2020 to ensure the health of all investors, employees, and service providers. An event for European buy-side analysts at SAP's global headquarters in Walldorf (Germany) on February 20 was the last physical event in the Investor Relations program in 2020.\n\nThe IR team, together with senior management, held more than 110 meetings last year including one-on-one phone calls, video conferences and virtual road shows to maintain the dialog with investors and analysts. Members of the Executive Board and the IR team and participated in more than 20 conferences worldwide. In June, we hosted a special event at the virtual SAPPHIRE NOW conference, which included a Q&A session for investors and financial analysts. Moreover, SAP held the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AMG) virtually without physical presence for the first time, in accordance with the German emergency legislation to cope with the COVID-19 outbreak. We held an extended third quarter financial analyst conference call in October 2020 highlighting our new strategic vision.\n\nWe continued our dialogue with socially responsible investors (SRI), providing them with insights into our environmental, social, and corporate governance policies. SAP representatives engaged with retail shareholders at virtual events. The IR team and the Treasury team also maintained regular communication with the debt investor community.\n\nWe provide a wide range of information about SAP and its shares online. Our communications channels include our Twitter feed @sapinvestor and the quarterly SAP INVESTOR magazine. Shareholders can reach the IR team directly by telephone hotline\n\nand by e-mail at investor@sap.com. We also publish an overview of the latest analyst consensus in collaboration with Vara Research.\n\nWe provide a Webcast for all key investor events at which members of our Executive Board speak, and we post all relevant presentations on the Investor Relations Web site.\n\n## Key Facts About SAP Stock/SAP ADRs\n\n|                                        | Listings                     |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Germany                                | Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart |\n| United States (ADRs)                   | New York Stock Exchange      |\n| IDs and symbols                        |                              |\n| WKN/ISIN                               | 716460/DE0007164600          |\n| NYSE (ADRs)                            | 803054204 (CUSIP)            |\n| Reuters                                | SAPG.F or .DE                |\n| Bloomberg                              | SAP GR                       |\n| Weight (%) in indexes as at 12/31/2020 |                              |\n| DAX 30                                 | 10.22                        |\n| Prime All Share                        | 7.41                         |\n| CDAX                                   | 8.47                         |\n| HDAX                                   | 7.92                         |\n| Dow Jones STOXX 50                     | 3.07                         |\n| Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50                | 4.52                         |",

We were directly involved when the Executive Board made any decision of fundamental importance to SAP.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received regular, full, and timely reports from the Executive Board, both from members in person and in written documents. This ensured that we were always up to date, even between meetings, on the Company's strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk management, compliance (in other words, adherence to laws, to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, and to internal policies), and on transactions of special significance for SAP. In its reports, the Executive Board also informed us in particular where business deviated from plan or target, and why. In addition, the Supervisory Board members can turn to SAP Digital Boardroom at any time to call up comprehensive metrics for all business areas in real time and generate evaluations and analyses as required. The solution affords us an up-to-date view of SAP's business performance whenever we need it - with maximum transparency.\n\nThe content and scope of the Executive Board's reports to us fully met our requirements for them, The Executive Board came to Supervisory Board meetings for discussion of the agenda items. We questioned and probed the Executive Board to satisfy ourselves that the information it gave us was plausible. We approved, after careful examination and discussion with the Executive Board, all transactions requiring approval by the Supervisory Board whether by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or the Supervisory Board's list of transactions requiring its consent.\n\nThe Supervisory Board chairperson and the two Co-CEOs, and subsequently the sole CEO, were in continuous contact, which meant that the Supervisory Board chairperson was always informed without delay of all important events that were significant for assessing SAP's situation and progress or for the management and governance of the Company. Moreover, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board discussed SAP's strategy, business performance, risks, risk management, compliance, and other key topics and decisions regularly with the CEO. This enabled the Supervisory Board chairperson to update the members of the Supervisory Board between meetings.\n\n## Supervisory Board Meetings and Resolutions\n\nIn the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE held four ordinary meetings and three extraordinary meetings at which we\n\ndeliberated and resolved on all matters of relevance to the Company. Due to the travel and contact restrictions imposed on us as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, we conducted the majority of our plenary meetings and Committee meetings, which are normally held as physical meetings, in 2020 as video conferences or as hybrid sessions, where some members attended physically and the remainder online. We also adopted 10 resolutions by correspondence vote. The table on the following page provides an overview of the individual members' attendance at the Supervisory Board's plenary sessions and committee meetings in the year under review.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees also convened wholly or partly without the Executive Board as necessary in 2020 to deliberate on items that pertained to the Executive Board or required internal discussion among Supervisory Board members alone. This was notably the case in two of the seven plenary sessions and in the Nomination Committee meetings. In addition, the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives independently discussed individual agenda items as required prior to the adoption of resolutions in plenary sessions. The Supervisory Board addressed the following key topics during the year:\n\n## Adjustment of Company Strategy\n\nThe effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy and the accelerated transition of our customers to the cloud are two major factors that prompted the Executive Board to adjust SAP's corporate strategy and thus its medium-term goals. We assessed and discussed the planned strategy updates in depth with the Executive Board. At a special strategy session on July 21 and 22, 2020, ahead of the Supervisory Board's July meeting, we consulted with the Executive Board on changes to the Company's strategic direction for the coming years and examined in detail the advantages, risks, and implementation of the contemplated measures. In an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting on October 25, 2020, the Executive Board subsequently informed us about the financial impacts it expected the planned strategy adjustment - namely a faster transition of SAP to the cloud - and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic would have on SAP's medium-term goals. With the customers' needs in mind, the Executive Board has opted for a series of measures and investments designed to expedite the harmonization of SAP's cloud business, create more room for organic innovation, and, ultimately, speed our customers' transition to the cloud. We support this decision by the Executive Board to focus on the long-term success of our customers and thus of SAP.\n\n## IPO of Qualtrics\n\nAcquired by SAP in 2019, Qualtrics International Inc. ('Qualtrics') is one of the leading providers of experience management software. At the Supervisory Board's extraordinary meeting on July 26, 2020, the Executive Board presented its plans to take Qualtrics public. The aim of the initial public offering (IPO) is to fortify the acquiree's finances and to create the necessary conditions for unlocking the full market potential of Qualtrics. Immediately prior to the plenary session, the Finance and",

The Committee had submitted a comprehensive list of questions in this regard to the Executive Board and, on this basis, analyzed and discussed with the latter the advantages and disadvantages of listing Qualtrics. The Executive Board had reaffirmed that SAP would remain the majority shareholder of Qualtrics after the IPO and continue to fully consolidate it. On the recommendation of the Finance and Investment Committee, we gave our approval in principle to tackle the Qualtrics IPO and begin the planning of the transaction. Once the Executive Board had worked out the framework conditions and details of the IPO, the basic principles of pricing, and options for a possible time plan, we returned to this subject in our October meeting - following intensive groundwork by the Finance and Investment Committee. The Executive Board gave us a status update on the IPO preparations, the envisaged schedule, and the price indications. After discussing these details with the Executive Board, we approved, on the recommendation of the Finance and Investment Committee, the proposed implementation roadmap. In addition, we gave advance approval for certain members of the SAP Executive Board to assume mandates on Qualtrics' Board of Directors as part of the IPO. Given the ongoing, complex preparations for Qualtrics' stock market entry, important questions regarding the exact timing of the IPO, the pricing, and internal corporate structure still needed to be clarified and decided upon. We therefore tasked the Finance and Investment Committee to discuss these questions with the Executive Board and approve the\n\nfinal agreed approach on our behalf. In its meeting on December 16, 2020, the Finance and Investment Committee deliberated on the aforementioned details of the IPO and, after extensive discussions with the Executive Board, approved the listing based on the information and data presented to us.\n\n## Matters Relating to Compliance and Cybersecurity\n\nSAP's Office of Ethics & Compliance (OEC) kept the Audit Committee continually apprised throughout the reporting year on the ongoing investigations being conducted with the assistance of external counsel into potential violations of anticorruption laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)). The Audit Committee in turn reported on the status of these compliance matters to the full Supervisory Board at the ordinary plenary meetings held in February, July, and October 2020. Said updates included the status of SAP's voluntary cooperation with local authorities, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as the status of investigations into the export controls and economic sanctions violations that SAP had voluntarily self-disclosed. The Audit Committee also monitored the effectiveness of the improvement measures introduced by the Executive Board in the preceding years.\n\nIn our February 19, 2020, meeting, the Executive Board reported that an internal assessment launched by it had identified potential cybersecurity gaps in certain of SAP's cloud products. We responded by tasking the Audit Committee to monitor the further",

We also resolved to seek assistance from external consultants to help us address the complex technical and legal questions in this regard. We were subsequently updated on the status of these investigations in our meeting on April 9, 2020. The Executive Board reported to the Audit Committee regularly on this matter throughout the year, especially after it was discovered that one or more contractually agreed IT security standards were not being met for all our cloud products at that time. We closely monitored the effectiveness of the remedial measures that had been implemented. In our ordinary sessions on July 23 and October 22, 2020, the chairperson of the Audit Committee and senior internal officers gave the full Supervisory Board a progress report on the investigations, the correction of the security gaps that had been identified, and the corresponding communication with affected customers. We were also informed that the abovementioned deviations from the contractually agreed or statutory IT security standards had been rectified at the end of July 2020.\n\n## Realignment of the Executive Board\n\nThere were a number of changes on the Executive Board in 2020 on both personal and organizational level. At our meeting on February 19, 2020, the Executive Board presented its planned organizational changes aimed at further strengthening the focus on customers in SAP's internal processes, as well as the associated adjustments in the Group structure and the impacts these adjustments would have on segment reporting. A key part of the realignment was the bundling of the sales, services, and support organizations in the Customer Success Board area led by Adaire Fox-Martin, the merging of the product management, development, and support organizations led by Thomas Saueressig, and the consolidation of integrated data management solution development and SAP platform and technology development headed by Juergen Mueller. Prior to this meeting, the Executive Board members Michael Kleinemeier and Stefan Ries had each reached a mutual decision with the Supervisory Board to end their employment with SAP effective April 30, 2020, and May 31, 2020, respectively, which is why we were also able to approve the terms of their Executive Board termination agreements when we convened in February. The organizational changes presented to us were then implemented step by step over the remainder of fiscal 2020. We approved the resulting adjustments to the Executive Board members' portfolios at our May, August, and October meetings, by means of circular correspondence vote in each case. The Supervisory Board held an extraordinary meeting on April 20, 2020, at which we discussed and approved the appointment of Christian Klein as sole CEO of the Executive Board and his corresponding assumption of additional tasks. At the same time, we mutually agreed with former Co-CEO Jennifer Morgen the terms of the early termination of her SAP Executive Board contract effective April 30, 2020. Having already dealt with the search for candidates to replace Stefan Ries as head of SAP's Human Resources (HR) department at our April 9, 2020, meeting, we subsequently approved the appointment of Sabine Bendiek as the new chief people officer and labor relations director when we met on July 23. The appointment to this position was initially for a term of three years with effect from March 1, 2021. We further agreed that six\n\nmonths after taking up her post on the Executive Board, Ms. Bendiek would additionally assume the role of COO. When we met in October, we were able to resolve on her earlier appointment to the Executive Board effective January 1, 2021, as she was in a position to join the Executive Board earlier than originally expected. In December 2020, the Supervisory Board appointed Scott Russell as a new member of the Executive Board effective February 1, 2021. He took over the Customer Success Board area from Adaire FoxMartin, who resigned her seat on the Executive Board at her own wish and departed the Company on January 31, 2021. Also in December, we appointed Julia White as a further member of the Executive Board effective March 1, 2021. She will lead the new Marketing and Solutions Board area as chief marketing and solutions officer. The Supervisory Board resolved these appointments by way of circular correspondence vote.\n\n## Other key topics addressed at our meetings in 2020 notably included the following:\n\n## Meeting in February (Meeting to Discuss the Financial Statements)\n\nIn a plenary session on February 19, 2020, the Executive Board reported on the outcome of the 2019 employee survey and the Company's 2019 financial results. We then discussed in detail the finance plan for 2020 as presented to us by the Executive Board, and approved same. Next, we turned our attention to Executive Board compensation. We first determined the amount of Executive Board compensation for 2019 by deciding on the total target achievement and the payouts for the individual Executive Board members under the Short-Term Incentive (STI) 2019 Plan. After that, we deliberated on Executive Board compensation for 2020. We defined the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the STI 2020 and set the target numbers for each KPI and their relative weightings. In addition, we set the specific target numbers for each KPI of the Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020). The Supervisory Board, as required, evaluated the appropriateness of the individual Executive Board members' total compensation for fiscal 2020, and in each case found it to be appropriate in terms of amount, structure, objective criteria, and for each member's responsibilities and tasks. We referred in this regard to an appropriateness certificate obtained beforehand from an external compensation consulting firm. Continuing, we set a cap for Executive Board pay in accordance with new regulatory requirements to then deliberate and finally resolve on the new compensation system for the Executive Board that had been developed step by step since the autumn of 2019. For more information about the STI 2020, the LTI 2020, and the other elements of the compensation package for Executive Board members, see the Compensation Report. On recommendation of the General and Compensation Committee, the Supervisory Board also resolved that members of the Executive Board shall not have more than one supervisory board mandate at a non-group entity in the future. In addition, the Supervisory Board turned its attention to the SAP SE financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2019, the audits conducted by KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (KPMG), and the Executive Board's proposed resolution on the appropriation of retained earnings for 2019. The auditor attended the meeting and reported in detail on the audit and its findings for each of the focus areas that had been agreed between the auditor and the Audit",

The auditor then discussed the results of the audit with the Supervisory Board and answered our questions. The Audit Committee had comprehensively prepared all topics in connection with the financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2019, and in particular reported on the form and scope of its examination of the documents relating to the financial statements, which it recommended we approve. The Supervisory Board approved the audit. There were no findings from our own examination, so we gave our consent to the SAP SE and consolidated financial statements for 2019. We then reviewed the Executive Board's proposal to appropriate retained earnings as well as its proposal to buy back SAP shares in fiscal year 2020. In accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation, we endorsed the Executive Board's proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings and approved the capital return for 2020 proposed by the Executive Board by authorizing treasury stock purchases totaling \u20ac1.5 billion. Next, we passed our further proposed resolutions for the agenda of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 20, 2020. In particular, this included approving the proposal to the Annual General Meeting concerning the election of an auditor for 2020, which followed the Audit Committee's recommendation to us. Also in this meeting, we extended the list of transactions and business management measures for which the Executive Board must obtain the Supervisory Board's consent, and were informed about SAP's equity investments during the fiscal year 2019 as well as SAP's donation activities.\n\n## Meeting in April\n\nOn April 9, 2020, we resolved to renew Lu k a Mucic's Executive Board contract for a further five years to May 31, 2026, and resolved that as a general rule, Executive Board contracts in future be renewed for only three years. The Executive Board then gave us an overview of the first-quarter results for 2020, and we consented to the Executive Board's requested authorization to conduct external financing transactions worth up to \u20ac2.5 billion. Together with the Executive Board, we decided to make use of the legislation that was enacted in response to the coronavirus pandemic and published in the Federal Law Gazette on March 27, 2020, and hold the Annual General Meeting in virtual form. We also resolved, based on the updated German Corporate Governance Code (Code), which came into effect on March 20, 2020, to remove the deductible for Supervisory Board members in the D&O liability insurance as of July 1, 2020. Further, we examined the new rules on the treatment of 'related-party transactions', that is, business transactions with related companies and persons, under the German Act on the Implementation of the Second EU Shareholders' Rights Directive (ARUG II), and consented to an internal recording and evaluation procedure in this regard. The Supervisory Board thereby delegated its power of approval for relevant related-party transactions to the Finance and Investment Committee.\n\n## Resolutions Adopted by Correspondence in June and July\n\nBy way of correspondence vote, we resolved in June on the appointment of the new manager of the Corporate Development and Strategy department, and in July on the appointment of a new\n\nregional manager for Latin America and the Caribbean and a new regional manager for EMEA South.\n\n## Meeting in July\n\nAhead of our July meeting, the Supervisory Board held a special, two-day strategy session which took the place of the Technology and Strategy Committee meeting. In addition, at our meeting in July, the Executive Board gave us an account of business in the second quarter of 2020 and performance in the first half year, emphasizing the unprecedented circumstances brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. Referring to management's presentation, we discussed with the Executive Board its plans to potentially adjust SAP's strategic direction, which are described in more detail at the beginning of this report.\n\n## Resolution Adopted by Correspondence in September\n\nIn September 2020, we approved, on the recommendation of the Finance and Investment Committee, the acquisition of the Austrian company Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG, a leading provider of omnichannel customer engagement platforms in the cloud.\n\n## Meeting in October\n\nAt our meeting on October 22, 2020, the Executive Board first reported on business performance in the third quarter. We next discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the STI 2020, and concluded that we did not want to adjust the targets in the STI 2020 plan. In addition, the Supervisory Board assessed the independence of its shareholder representatives pursuant to the new recommendations contained in the current December 16, 2019, version of the Code. Based on the findings from our own examination, we determined that all shareholder representatives were independent in the meaning of the Code and were therefore to be named in the Corporate Governance Statement. We also resolved on what we believe to be the appropriate number of independent shareholder representative members, and determined that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of independent members in the meaning of the Code, also when the shareholder structure is taken into account. In agreement with the Executive Board, we also adopted, for regular publication in October 2020, the annual Declaration of Implementation of the Code, and updated the profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Resolution Adopted by Correspondence in December\n\nIn December 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved by way of correspondence to set up an additional Committee as of January 1, 2021, to address the preparation and implementation of SAP's business strategy for China.\n\n## The Work of the Supervisory Board Committees\n\nThe committees made a key contribution to the work of the Supervisory Board in 2020, and reported on their work to us, including their preparatory work for and decisions made on the relevant agenda items of the subsequent Supervisory Board",

The following committees were in place in the year under review:\n\n- -General and Compensation Committee: Hasso Plattner (chairperson), Pekka Ala-Pietil\u00e4, Panagiotis Bissiritsas, Aicha Evans, Margret Klein-Magar, Lars Lamad\u00e9, Bernard Liautaud, Christine Regitz, Friederike Rotsch, Ralf Zeiger\n- -Audit Committee: Gunnar Wiedenfels (chairperson), Panagiotis Bissiritsas, Margret Klein-Magar, Gerhard Oswald, Friederike Rotsch, James Wright\n- -Finance and Investment Committee: Friederike Rotsch (chairperson), Panagiotis Bissiritsas, Gerhard Oswald, Christine Regitz, Gunnar Wiedenfels, James Wright\n- -Technology and Strategy Committee: Hasso Plattner (chairperson), Christine Regitz (deputy chairperson), Aicha Evans, Diane Greene (until December 9, 2020), Gesche Joost, Monika Kovachka-Dimitrova, Lars Lamad\u00e9, Bernard Liautaud, Gerhard Oswald, Heike Steck, Christa Vergien-Knopf, James Wright\n- -People and Organization Committee: Gerhard Oswald (chairperson), Pekka Ala-Pietil\u00e4, Aicha Evans, Gesche Joost, Monika Kovachka-Dimitrova, Heike Steck, Christa Vergien-Knopf, Ralf Zeiger\n- -Nomination Committee: Hasso Plattner (chairperson), Pekka Ala-Pietil\u00e4, Diane Greene (until July 2, 2020), Bernard Liautaud, Gerhard Oswald (since July 23, 2020)\n\nEach of the aforementioned committees was active in 2020. For more information about the Supervisory Board committees and their duties, see the Corporate Governance section of SAP's Web site.\n\nBesides the matters described above, the committees focused primarily on the following topics in 2020:\n\n- -The General and Compensation Committee held five ordinary and two extraordinary meetings. In particular, the Committee, in fulfillment of the tasks assigned to it, extensively prepared and discussed in advance the deliberations and resolutions of the Supervisory Board concerning the Executive Board compensation, thetermination agreements for departing Executive Board members, and the HR decisions described above, or it adopted its own resolutions in these matters. At its first meeting in February 2020, the Committee was presented with the annual report from the corporate governance and insider trading compliance officer, and deliberated on how many supervisory board mandates an Executive Board may generally be allowed to have at non-Group listed companies. When it met in July 2020, the Committee focused onthe SAP Flight Travel Policy for Executive Board members, which governed the use of SAP aircraft, as well the new recommendations in the Code regarding the independence of supervisory board members, and updated the Committee's rules of procedure. The Supervisory Board's decisions with respect to the submission of the declaration of implementation of the Code and ascertaining the independence of shareholder representative members were prepared in October 2020.\n- -The Audit Committee held nine meetings - two of which jointly with the Finance and Investment Committee - in 2020. At its meetings, the Committee deliberated on the course of business\n\nover the quarter concerned, the accounting processes, the preparation of quarterly financial reports, and the quarterly reports to be published. Other regular meeting topics included SAP's risk management system, its internal control system, its compliance system (including specific compliance issues, the status of corresponding SAP-internal investigations, and caserelated collaboration with authorities), and cybersecurity. During its physical meeting in February 2020, the Committee focused on the financial accounts of SAP SE and the SAP Group for 2019 and prepared the Supervisory Board's proposals to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders concerning the appointment of the auditor and the appropriation of retained earnings. The decision on the recommendation regarding the appointment of the auditor was preceded by a review of the auditor's independence, qualifications, and quality of work. To monitor the latter, the Audit Committee obtained regular reports from the auditor on its internal quality assurance standards and on any material findings from internal quality audits, from external quality controls via peer review, and from any investigations conducted by the government or regulators into the auditor's audits. In addition, the internal audit department reported on the fiscal year 2019 and its audit plan for 2020. At mid-year, the internal audit department informed the Committee about its audit findings to date as well as its plans for the second half of 2020. Moreover, the Audit Committee continuously adapted and monitored the invitation to tender issued by it in 2020 for the audit of the SAP SE and consolidated financial statements as well as further audit services commencing in the fiscal year 2023. In this connection, an extraordinary meeting was set for December 2020, at which the candidates presented themselves to the Audit Committee, following which the Audit Committee assessed the candidates. When it met in October, the Audit Committee examined, among other things, the potential impact of the planned IPO of Qualtrics on SAP's financial reporting and audit. The auditor also informed the Committee about the potential impact of the Wirecard scandal on external audit and corporate governance. The auditor attended all Audit Committee meetings except for the extraordinary meeting in December, and reported in depth on its audit work and on its quarterly reviews of selected software agreements. The Committee discussed the audit focus with the auditor at its July meeting, and the audit fees with the auditor at its meeting in October. As reported in more detail below, the Committee also held two joint meetings with the Finance and Investment Committee in February and December 2020 to discuss the Group annual plan for 2020 and the preliminary Group annual plan for 2021.\n\n- -The Finance and Investment Committee held seven ordinary meetings and four extraordinary meetings in the reporting year. Two of its meetings, one in February and one in December 2020, were joint meetings with the Audit Committee. An internal training session was also held at which the Committee learned more about capital market topics. In February 2020, the Committee discussed with the Executive Board the Company's plans to buy back its own shares and recommended that the Supervisory Board approve the share buyback in the form proposed. In addition, the Committee discussed Qualtrics and the refinancing measures for the acquisition loan. Further, the Committee received its regular written update on SAP's equity investments during the preceding fiscal year. In the joint meeting",

In the April meeting, the Executive Board reported on selected investor relations topics and updated the Committee on SAP's Best Run initiatives. At the extraordinary meeting held in April, the Committee recommended, after thorough deliberation, that the Supervisory Board approve the establishment of a flexible external financing framework to safeguard liquidity for the period to March 31, 2021. In addition, the Executive Board informed the Committee about its plans to sell off the SAP Digital Interconnect (SDI) division. The Committee subsequently approved the sale of this division to the Swedish company Sinch AB at an ordinary meeting in May. At the Committee's regular meeting in July, the Executive Board presented a revised outlook for fiscal 2020 and explained the portfolio planning which had been based on the targets of the Best Run initiative. The extraordinary meeting in September was dedicated to resolving on the planned acquisition of Emarsys eMarketing Services AG. In October, representatives from Sapphire Ventures, LLC gave the Committee an overview of the European and U.S. market for venture capital in technology and a status report on the active SAP venture capital funds. In addition, the Committee discussed the Executive Board's planned strategy for SAP's presence in the Chinese market, and the Executive Board reported on the events planned for SAP investors. In December 2020, the Committee held a second joint meeting with the Audit Committee, at which the Executive Board presented the preliminary 2021 Group annual plan. This meeting was held in preparation for the Supervisory Board meeting in February 2021, at which the full Supervisory Board routinely resolved to approve the 2021 Group annual plan.\n\n- -The Technology and Strategy Committee met three times in 2020. It discussed key technology trends in the software industry in the years to come and SAP's corporate and product strategies. The Executive Board explained SAP's technology strategy to the Committee members at its February meeting, where the two bodies also discussed the further development and integration of Intelligent Enterprise Suite, which was based on SAP Business Technology Platform and driven by SAP HANA. The meeting participants also discussed what opportunities for innovation and simplification this presented. In April 2020, the Executive Board updated the Committee on the measures to integrate the Ariba, Fieldglass, SuccessFactors, and Concur applications, and provided an outlook for their technical development going forward. It also provided a status report on the realignment of products in the Customer Experience Management segment. In October 2020, the Committee first dealt with a new 'Move to the Cloud' concept that was designed to help existing customers move their SAP applications to the cloud more easily in pre-defined phases. Thereafter, the Committee went over the latest progress reports on SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP's platform strategy.\n- -The People and Organization Committee held four meetings in 2020. When it met in January, the Committee discussed the Company's 2020 organizational structure, focusing particularly on the go-to-market and development areas. It referred in this regard to an overview the Executive Board gave it of the latest organizational changes and the goals of the individual Executive\n\nBoard areas. The Committee was also updated on the Company's HR strategy for 2020 to 2023. The meeting in March was devoted to the coronavirus pandemic and the global measures that had been taken as a result both within and outside the Company. The Committee also revisited the impacts of the organizational changes that had been introduced in January on employees. Key topics of the July meeting were the results of the SAP employee survey, the strategic measures in the area of diversity, and an update on the ongoing coronavirus situation. The effects of the pandemic on employees and their work were again discussed in the October meeting. In addition, the Committee was given an introductory presentation on SAP's location strategy and an overview of the structure and implementation roadmap for the Company's general HR strategy. Following this, the Committee members and the Executive Board discussed the results of the second employee survey of 2020.\n\n- -The Nomination Committee met three times in the reporting year. In February and April, it discussed succession planning for members leaving their posts. When the Committee convened in December 2020, it deliberated on a successor for Diane Greene, who stepped down from the Supervisory Board in December for personal reasons. This meeting had been preceded by an intensive search for suitable candidates, on the basis of which the Committee nominated Dr. Qi Lu as her possible successor.\n\nRegular reports from the committees ensured that we were kept fully informed of all matters covered by the committees and were able to discuss them thoroughly.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nSAP's corporate governance and insider trading compliance officer monitored our compliance with those recommendations in the Code with which we claim to comply in SAP SE's declaration, and reported in full to the General and Compensation Committee in this regard. Detailed information about compliance with the Code is available in the Executive and Supervisory Boards' Corporate Governance Statement. Members of the Supervisory Board and of the Executive Board had no conflicts of interest that recommendations E.1 and E.2 of the Code require to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board. Insofar as Supervisory Board members hold executive positions in companies or have material equity in companies that currently have business dealings with SAP, we do not see any impairment of their independence. The scope of these transactions is relatively small and, moreover, takes place at arm's length. During the year under review, the Compensation Committee approved transactions involving a member of the Executive Board in 2019 which were all consistent with industry standards and immaterial. Other than those contracts mentioned in this report, the Company made no other contracts with members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board that would have required a resolution of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board closely examined the Corporate Governance Statement and, by way of correspondence vote on February 16, 2021, approved same with the combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report.",

Three dedicated training events in February 2020, for example, enabled the Audit Committee members to enhance their knowledge about SAP's non-financial KPIs Customer Net Promoter Score, Employee Engagement, and Carbon Impact, as well as gain a better understanding of the calculation methods, information sources, and control mechanisms behind those values. In July 2020, the Finance and Investment Committee took part in a training event devoted to investor relations topics that focused particularly on finance industry mechanisms relevant to SAP. The above training events were recorded and made available afterwards to the rest of the Supervisory Board. In November 2020, the Supervisory Board members were invited to two one-hour training sessions on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Supply Chain (DSC) scheduled for January 2021. Moreover, the Supervisory Board can also avail itself of a wide range of recorded training sessions from 2019 on a specially configured training platform.\n\n## SAP SE and Consolidated Financial Reports for 2020\n\nKPMG audited the SAP SE and consolidated financial reports for 2020. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders appointed KPMG as the SAP SE and SAP Group auditor on May 20, 2020. The Supervisory Board had proposed the appointment of KPMG on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. Before proposing KPMG to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders as auditor for the year, the chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee obtained confirmation from KPMG that circumstances did not exist that might prejudice or raise any doubt concerning its independence as the Company's auditor. In that connection, KPMG informed us of the volume of the services that were not part of the audit which it had either provided to the Group in the past year or was engaged to provide in the year to come. The Supervisory Board has agreed with KPMG that the auditor should report to the Supervisory Board and record in the auditor's report any fact found during the audit that is inconsistent with the declaration given by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board concerning implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code. KPMG examined the SAP SE financial statements prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as required by the German Commercial Code, section 315e, and the combined SAP Group and SAP SE management report prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code, and certified them without qualification. The auditor thus confirmed that, in its opinion and based on its audit in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the SAP SE and consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position, and results of operations of SAP SE and the SAP Group. The auditor also confirmed that the combined SAP SE and SAP Group management report is consistent with the corresponding financial statements and as a whole gives a suitable view of the position of SAP SE and the SAP Group and of foreseeable opportunities and risks. In accordance with section 317(3b) of the German Commercial Code, the auditor also\n\nexamined and confirmed that the renderings of the financial statements, the management report, the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report contained in the files submitted on an electronic data carrier, which can be accessed by the issuer on the secure client portal, and prepared for the purposes of disclosure comply in all material respects with the requirements of section 328 (1) of the German Commercial Code regarding the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\"). KPMG had completed its audit of SAP's internal control over financial reporting and certified without qualification that it complies with the applicable U.S. standards. The auditor stated in its opinion that it considers SAP's internal controls with respect to the consolidated financial statements to be effective in all material respects. Additionally, it provided assurance on selected qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures included in the Integrated Report but outside of the Management Report. All Audit Committee and Supervisory Board members received - initially in the form of drafts that were identical to the final documents - the documents concerning the financial statements mentioned above, the audit reports prepared by KPMG, and the Executive Board's proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings in good time.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the Executive Board prepared the financial accounts of SAP SE and the SAP Group for 2020, comprising the SAP SE financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report, as well as the combined non-financial report and submitted them without delay to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Executive Board explained the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group and its proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings at the meeting of the Audit Committee on February 23, 2021 (based on the drafts identical to the final documents) and at the meeting of the Supervisory Board on February 24, 2021. Members of the Executive Board answered questions from the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. At the Audit Committee meeting, they also explained the Annual Report on Form 20-F prepared in accordance with the applicable U.S. standards as well as the combined non-financial report.\n\nAfter the Executive Board had explained them, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board reviewed the financial statement documents (based on drafts identical to the final documents) along with the combined non-financial report, taking KPMG's audit reports (or the drafts identical to the final documents) into account. The representative of the auditor who attended presented full reports on the audit and the results of the audit to the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board meetings and explained its audit reports (or final drafts thereof). The auditor also reported that it had not identified any material weaknesses in SAP's internal control and risk-management systems for financial reporting. Both the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board asked detailed questions about the form, scope, and results of the audit. The Audit Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on its own review of the financial statements of SAP SE and the SAP Group, its discussions with the Executive Board and with the auditor, and its supervision of the financial reporting process. It confirmed that as part of its supervisory work, it had addressed the SAP Group's internal control, risk management, and internal auditing systems, and found the systems to be effective.\n\nThe Committee also reported that KPMG had told it that no circumstances had arisen that might give cause for concern about",

The Committee reported that it had examined the auditor's independence, taking the nonaudit services it had rendered into consideration, and stated that in the Committee's opinion the auditor possessed the required degree of independence and expertise.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board satisfied themselves that KPMG had conducted the audit properly. In particular, they concluded that both the audit reports and the audit itself fulfilled the legal requirements. On the basis of the report and the Audit Committee's recommendation, the Supervisory Board approved the audit and, since there were no findings from our own examination, we gave our consent to the SAP SE financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report (including the Executive Board's corporate governance statement pursuant to the German Commercial Code, sections 315d and 289f), as well as the combined non-financial report pursuant to the German Commercial Code, sections 315b and 289b. The financial statements and combined management report were thus formally adopted upon approval by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board's opinion of the Company and the Group coincided with that of the Executive Board as set out in the combined management report. The Supervisory Board considered the proposal presented by the Executive Board concerning the appropriation of retained earnings. We had regard to the requirements of dividends policy, the effects on the liquidity of SAP SE and the SAP Group, and the interests of the shareholders. We also discussed these matters with the auditor. We then endorsed the Executive Board's proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings, in accordance with the Audit\n\nCommittee's recommendation. Finally, we approved this present Report.\n\n## Changes on the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in 2020\n\nChristian Klein became SAP's sole CEO on April 20, 2020, after Jennifer Morgan mutually agreed with the Supervisory Board to leave the Company effective April 30, 2020. Michael Kleinemeier likewise left SAP on April 30; 2020, after 30 years of service to the Company, and Stefan Ries departed the Company on May 31, 2020. Diane Greene resigned from the Supervisory Board on December 9, 2020. Her successor Dr. Qi Lu was appointed to the Supervisory Board by order of the court with effect from December 21, 2020. The Supervisory Board would like to sincerely thank Ms. Greene and the Executive Board members who relinquished their functions in the year under review for their invaluable contribution to the success of the Company.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has affected all areas of life and posed major challenges for people around the world. The Supervisory Board thanks the current members of the Executive Board and all SAP employees for their tireless dedication to SAP under these extraordinary circumstances.\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\nProfessor Hasso Plattner (Chairperson)",

Both compensation systems were approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2020.\n\n## Compensation for Executive Board Members\n\n## Compensation System for 2020\n\nThe compensation for Executive Board members is intended to reflect the demanding role of Executive Board members leading a global company in a rapidly evolving sector. The compensation level is aimed to be competitive to support SAP in the global market for highly skilled executives, especially in the context of the international software industry. It is our goal that our Executive Board compensation provides sustainable incentive for committed, successful work in a dynamic business environment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board - supported by its General and Compensation Committee - determines the compensation for each Executive Board member based on their individual role and performance in its first regular meeting of each fiscal year, following the principles that the compensation:\n\n- -Promotes the business strategy\n- -Ensures that extraordinary performance is appropriately rewarded and any failure to achieve specific targets triggers a tangible reduction in the compensation\n- -Is in line with market standards in terms of its level and structure and reflects the Company's size, complexity, and economic situation\n- -Takes account of the pay structure in the Company as a whole. In this context, the compensation is compared with the pay of SAP executives and non-executive SAP employees to ensure that the principle of proportionality is observed within SAP.\n\nThe compensation system is, to a major extent, already aligned with the compensation agreements currently in place, with the exception of a few provisions relating to fringe benefits and/or pension commitments. When, in future, new members are appointed or members are reappointed, the Supervisory Board will ensure that the specific total compensation is aligned with the compensation system.\n\nFor more information about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees, see the Report by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe compensation contains performance-based elements and non-performance-based elements, as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe amount of performance-based compensation depends primarily on SAP's performance against predefined target values (Key Performance Indicators, KPIs) and on the SAP share price, and is subject to hurdles and caps. These KPIs and their target values as well as their weighting are set by the Supervisory Board each year and are aligned to the SAP budget for that year or to SAP's externally communicated financial ambitions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets the individual total target compensation for each Executive Board member, comprised of the fixed compensation element and the two performance-based elements. This target compensation is benchmarked based on SAP's global strategy, market position, business performance and future prospects of economy, and the compensation paid at comparable national and international companies. The benchmarking was conducted in February 2020 based on the compensation data from the DAX 30 companies as well as U.S.based IT and other technology companies 1 . The performance-based elements each correspond to a target achievement of 100% of all KPIs. The Supervisory Board reviews, assesses, and sets these compensation targets, in its first meeting of each fiscal year (February 19, 2020, for 2020). The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that this approach ensures that the compensation is appropriate.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe compensation system is designed to support the growth in value for the Company over the long term. The long-term incentive element therefore has significant weighting, making up about twothirds of the CEO's compensation target, and more than 50% of each Executive Board member's compensation target.\n\nIn the case of any extraordinary, unforeseeable events, the Supervisory Board is entitled, at its reasonable discretion, to adjust the performance-based compensation before payout upwards or downwards in the interest of SAP. This discretion is limited to +/ -20% for the STI and to +/ -10% for the LTI. No corrections to the payout amounts paid in May 2020 were made.\n\nThe individual elements of SAP's Executive Board compensation are described in more detail below.\n\n## Non-Performance-Based Compensation\n\n## Fixed Compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation is paid monthly in 12 equal installments in the Executive Board member's home currency 2 .\n\n## Fringe Benefits\n\nThe contractually guaranteed fringe benefits mainly comprise additional benefits such as insurance contributions, benefits in kind, expenses for maintenance of two households, use of aircraft, and tax gross-ups according to local conditions. The recurring fringe benefits are limited in terms of value to 10% of fixed compensation for ordinary Executive Board members and to 20% for the CEO. Executive Board members who have their permanent residence abroad are granted reimbursement of expenses for tax advice with a limited value of 15% of fixed compensation for ordinary Executive Board members and 30% for the CEO. In case of a relocation to Germany from abroad, a relocation package of up to 15% of fixed compensation for ordinary Executive Board members and up to 30% for the CEO can be granted.\n\nAdditionally, to the extent that compensation benefit earned prior moving to the SAP Executive Board is lost due to this move, a one-off payment (sign-on bonus) could be granted in an amount of up to 200% of the fixed compensation.\n\n## Retirement Pension\n\nThe retirement pension plan that applies at SAP is based on defined contributions. For Executive Board members whose permanent place of residence is abroad, SAP may specify a retirement pension plan that applies for employees at a company belonging to the SAP Group in the relevant country, limited to 30% of fixed compensation.\n\n## Performance-Based Compensation\n\nShort-Term Incentive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 B ased on SAP's non -IFRS metrics as defined for use in SAP's 2019 full -year external financial reporting\n\nThe short-term, one-year performance-based compensation (Short-Term Incentive, STI) is determined based on a set of financial targets (financial KPIs) and sustainability targets (sustainability KPIs).\n\nFor the STI 2020, the financial KPIs have a total weighting of 80% and comprise non-IFRS constant currency current cloud backlog in 2020; year-over-year growth in non-IFRS constant currency cloud and software revenue in 2020; and non-IFRS constant currency operating margin development in 2020 year over year.\n\nThe sustainability KPIs have a total weighting of 20%, and comprise Customer Net Promoter Score, which measures SAP's customer loyalty; Employee Engagement Index, which measures SAP's employee commitment, pride, and loyalty; and Carbon Impact, which measures SAP's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe KPIs and their respective target values are derived from SAP's budget for the respective year. For more information about KPIs, see the Performance Management System section.\n\nIf the weighted target achievement is below 75%, there is no STI payout. In this case, the target achievement for these KPIs is set to zero. As of the 2021 financial year, the percentage required for total target achievement will be reduced from 75% to 50%.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the Supervisory Board assessed SAP's performance against the agreed targets and determined the amount of the STI 2020 for the entire Executive Board. The target achievement is based on targets set in February 2020. These targets were not adjusted despite significant negative impacts of COVID-19 on SAP's business performance leading to external guidance being lowered during the course of the year. The target achievement was as follows:\n\n- -69.5% for cloud and software revenue growth (100% target equals +7.0%),\n- -100.0% for operating margin increase (100% target equals +60 bp to +92 bp),\n- -0% for current cloud backlog (100% target equals \u20ac8,215 million) due to a target achievement below the 50% hurdle,\n- -105.7% for customer Net Promoter Score (100% target equals a change of -3 points to +3 points),\n- -116% for Employee Engagement Index (100% target equals 84%), and\n- -140% for Carbon Impact (100% target equals 238 kt CO2). As the weighted target achievement of 66.5% for the KPIs is below the 75% hurdle, there is no STI payout.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive\n\nThe Supervisory Board introduced a new long-term multi-year performance-based compensation plan effective from January 1, 2020, and onwards: the SAP Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020). The LTI 2020 is awarded in annual tranches and reflects SAP's long-term strategy and thus sets uniform incentives for the Executive Board members to achieve key targets from the long-term strategic plans. The LTI 2020 also serves to reward the Executive Board members for long-term SAP share price performance as compared to the market, thus ensuring that shareholders' interests are also honored. In addition, the LTI 2020 includes a component designed to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members.\n\nThe LTI 2020 is a virtual share program under which annual tranches with a term of approximately four years each are granted. When the individual tranches are awarded, a certain grant amount specified in the Executive Board member's service contract is converted into virtual shares (Share Units) in each case. The grant amount cannot exceed 700% of the fixed compensation (based on the relevant euro amounts when determining the specific compensation). For this purpose, the grant amount is divided by the SAP share price, which corresponds to the arithmetic mean on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole (grant price). In 2020, the preliminary results were published on January 28, 2020. The Share Units so allocated are composed of 1/3 financial performance share units (FSUs), 1/3 market performance share units (MSUs), and 1/3 retention share units (RSUs). All three types of Share Unit have a vesting period of approximately four years.\n\n## LTI Grant Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn contrast to RSUs, FSUs and MSUs are subject to numerical changes. Moreover, FSUs, MSUs, and RSUs may be forfeited in whole or in part. In this context, the following applies:\n\n## Numerical Change in FSUs\n\nThe final number of FSUs changes depending on SAP's performance against the three equally weighted financial KPI targets over the entire three-year performance period. The financial KPIs for the FSU tranche granted for 2020 are derived from SAP's communicated mid-term ambition for 2023 as published in April 2019. Cloud revenue and total revenue have a cap of 120% and a hurdle of 80% target achievement, while operating income has a cap of 110% and a hurdle of 90% target achievement.",

The performance factor depends on the amount of the total shareholder return (TSR) on the SAP share, measured for an entire performance period of approximately three years, and ranked in relation to the TSR performance of the companies of the NASDAQ-100 Index (Index). TSR means the performance of the share, combining share price development and granted and reinvested dividends. The market performance factor has a cap at 150% at the 75th percentile (P-75) and a hurdle of 50% at 25th percentile (P-25); below the hurdle, no MSUs are considered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n) B ased on SAP's non -IFRS metrics as defined for use in SAP's 2019 full -year external financial reporting\n\nThe following examples of the FSU calculation illustrate possible outcomes assuming 1,000 FSUs granted:\n\n## SAP financial performance is better than targets\n\nTotal revenue performance factor\n\n100%\n\nCloud revenue performance factor\n\n125%\n\nOperating income performance factor capped at\n\n150%\n\nFinancial performance factor\n\n(100% + 125% + 150%) / 3\n\n125%\n\nFinal number of FSUs\n\n125% x 1,000\n\n1,250\n\n## SAP financial performance does not meet the targets\n\n| Total revenue performance factor below 50%   |                       | 0%   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------|\n| Cloud revenue performance factor             |                       | 65%  |\n| Operating income performance factor          |                       | 100% |\n| Financial performance factor                 | (0% + 65% + 100%) / 3 | 55%  |\n| Final number of FSUs                         | 55% x 1,000           | 550  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, an amount is paid out for each Share Unit (subject to the specifics described below) which equals the then-current SAP share price plus those dividends that were disbursed in respect of an SAP share in the period from the beginning of the year in which the Share Units were awarded until the end of the third year following the year in which the Share Units were awarded. The arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole will be used as the payout price.\n\nThe payout amount per Share Unit, including the dividend amounts due on the Share Units, is capped at 200% of the grant price. Due to the potential change in the number of FSUs and MSUs, the maximum possible payout amount under any of the annual tranches of the LTI 2020 thus equals, arithmetically, approximately 267% of the grant amount. Any potential foreign currency exchange rate risk is borne by the Executive Board members themselves.\n\nHowever, all types of Share Unit may expire during the entire term of a tranche under certain conditions.\n\n## LTI Forfeiture Rule\n\nIf an Executive Board member's service contract is terminated before the end of the third year following the year in which the Share Units were granted, the PSUs (FSUs, MSUs) and RSUs are forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or termination of the service contract. In case Share Units are forfeited in part, the percentage of the forfeiture is proportional to the four-year vesting period of each grant. This means that 25% of the grant is earned each year of the vesting period. Unearned grants are forfeited.",

The euro cap for a full financial year equals 120% each for the sum of the fixed compensation and STI\n\ntarget amount converted into euro plus 20% of the grant amount for a tranche under the LTI 2020.\n\n## Target and Maximum Compensation\n\nThe compensation system allows for total target compensation (not considering any fringe benefits, retirement pension, and foreign currency exchange rate cap) of up to \u20ac6.0 million for",

The maximum compensation (not considering any fringe benefits, retirement pension, and foreign currency exchange rate cap) is \u20ac13.2 million for ordinary Executive Board members and \u20ac29.8 million for one CEO. The maximum total compensation including all maximum possible fringe benefits, is \u20ac15.0 million for ordinary Executive Board members and \u20ac34.5 million for one CEO. When determining the compensation structure and the target compensation for the individual members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board must ensure that the potential payments, taking the STI and LTI caps into account, cannot exceed the maximum compensation and the maximum total compensation.\n\nTo illustrate the maximum total compensation, the LTI is allocated as high as the defined ranges allow, and the fixed compensation is allocated as low as the defined ranges allow. For this purpose, the recurring benefits include retirement pension, foreign currency exchange rate cap, and other fringe benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clawback Provisions\n\nSAP has the contractual right to request that the Executive Board member returns any payments made from the STI or LTI if it subsequently emerges that the payment was not justified in whole or in part because targets were not achieved at all or not achieved in the scope assumed when calculating the payment amount due on account of false information having been provided. In such case, the Executive Board member is obliged to repay to SAP the amount by which the payment actually made exceeds the payment amount due on the basis of the targets actually achieved. Such contractually agreed claim to repayment supplements the claim for restitution of unjustified enrichment pursuant to section 812 of the German Civil Code (BGB).\n\n## Offsetting Compensation in Case of Roles Assumed Inside and Outside the Group\n\nAt the request of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board member will assume roles on the supervisory board or similar bodies at affiliates of SAP without receiving separate compensation. If, in exceptional cases, it is impossible to rule out compensation for a role assumed within the Group, it will be offset against the other compensation due to the Executive Board member. The Supervisory Board has to agree before an Executive Board member assumes any roles on supervisory boards or similar bodies at companies outside the Group and will decide in the individual case whether and to what extent any compensation is to be offset against compensation paid by SAP.\n\n## Adjustment of Compensation\n\nBased on the annual compensation review, the Supervisory Board may reduce the total compensation or individual compensation components, but only in the scope required by applicable law. No adjustments were made in 2020.\n\nIn its February meeting, the Supervisory Board resolved granting and payout of supplementary compensation, as permitted under the Compensation system in exceptional situations. Despite unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, related restrictions, and the ensuing economic crisis, the Executive Board exhibited extraordinary performance, ensuring the company remains profitable and positioned for long-term, sustainable success.\n\nSpecifically, the Executive Board members responded swiftly to the dynamic situation, ensuring the safety of employees, partners and customers while safeguarding business continuity, amongst others, by facilitating virtual sales and remote implementations. A Pandemic Taskforce was set-up to stay close to employee needs and ensure their well-being, including through mental health initiatives.  This focus on customers and employees is reflected in an increase of the Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) by 10 points and an increase in Employee Engagement Index. In a completely virtual setting, the Executive Board increased the speed of transformation for SAP. The IPO of Qualtrics and the strategic partnership with Microsoft Teams are just two examples. The Executive Board did not reduce employee hours, consider lay-offs, or accept large state aid packages. It safeguarded profitability by ensuring cloud and software revenue growth and applying costsavings measures where appropriate, which have increased the Company's operating profit. In 2020, the company exceeded all revised 2020 revenue targets and hit the high end of its operating",

Cloud revenue continued to be the major growth driver, growing 18% at constant currencies. This was impacted by a decline in transactional revenue in the Intelligent Spend business mainly due to a decrease in business travel. Excluding this, cloud revenue growth across the Company's Software-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service Cloud solutions was 27% at constant currencies.\n\nIn addition, the company achieved record cash flow results with a 106% increase in Operating Cash Flow and a 164% increase in Free Cash Flow, paid an increased dividend (55% payout ratio) and completed a \u20ac1.5 billion share buyback program in 2020.The Supervisory Board considers the supplementary compensation a positive signal to current and future members of the Executive Board, presenting an opportunity to strengthen their commitment to SAP and contributing to safeguarding the Company's long-term success.\n\nThe Supervisory Board decided on the supplementary compensation for: Christian Klein (\u20ac1,100,000), Adaire Fox-Martin (\u20ac800,000), Luka Mucic (\u20ac700,000), Juergen Mueller: (\u20ac700,000), and Thomas Saueressig (\u20ac700,000). The supplementary compensation will be paid out after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2021. All Executive Board members are obliged to purchase SAP shares worth at least the net payout amount in accordance with appropriate trading period regulations. These shares are subject to a three-year holding period.\n\n## Overview of the Relations Between Target and Payout for Performance-Based Compensation\n\nThe total target achievements of the STI reflect the relation between the target amount and the payout amount. The STIs for the years 2016 to 2019 were already paid out.\n\n## STI Total Target Achievement\n\n| Percentage   |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |   2016 |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|              |      0 |   82.4 |     93 |   88.2 |  104.4 |\n\nThe relation between the LTI target amounts for the 2017 to 2020 tranches and the theoretical payout amounts are based on SAP's share price at year end. The 2016 tranche discloses the relation between the respective target amount and the actual payout amount in May 2020. The payout price for the tranche 2016 was calculated as the average share price between January 29 and February 25, 2020.\n\n## Relation Between Target Amount and Payout Amount of the LTI\n\n| Percentage   | LTI 2020        |                 |                 |                 | LTI 2016 Plan   |\n|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|              | 2020  Tranche 1 | 2019  Tranche 1 | 2018  Tranche 1 | 2017  Tranche 1 | 2016  Tranche   |\n| 12/31/2020   | 45.5            | 100.9           | 48.0            | 49.9            | 79.2            |\n| 12/31/2019   | NA              | 156.6           | 126.4           | 110.5           | 138.7           |\n\n1 Consideration of theoretical payout amounts based on SAP's share price at year end\n\n## Amount of Compensation for 2020\n\nWe present the Executive Board compensation disclosures in accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('GCGC'). Furthermore, the tables below provide a reconciliation statement following the requirements of sections 314 and 315 of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch, or 'HGB') as specified in the German Accounting Standards ('GAS 17'). Pursuant to the recommendations of the GCGC, the value of benefits granted for the year under review as well as the benefits received, that is, the amounts disbursed for the year under review, are disclosed below based on the reference tables recommended in the GCGC (version 2017). In contrast to the disclosure rules stipulated in the German HGB and GAS 17, the GCGC includes the pension expense, that is, the service cost according to IAS 19, in the Executive Board compensation and requires the additional disclosure of the target value for the one-year variable compensation and the maximum and minimum compensation amounts achievable for the variable compensation elements.",

A surviving dependent's pension is paid on the death of a former member of the Executive Board. The disability pension is 100% of the vested retirement pension entitlement and is payable until the beneficiary's 62nd birthday, after which it is replaced by a retirement pension. The surviving dependent's pension is 60% of the retirement pension or vested disability pension entitlement at death. Entitlements are enforceable against SAP SE. Current pension payments are reviewed annually for adjustments and, if applicable, increased according to the surplus in the pension liability insurance. If service is ended before the retirement age of 62, pension entitlement is reduced in proportion as the actual length of service stands in relation to the maximum possible length of service. The applied retirement pension plan is contributory. The contribution is 4% of applicable compensation up to the applicable income threshold plus 14% of applicable compensation above the applicable income threshold. For this purpose, applicable compensation is 180% of annual base salary. The applicable income threshold is the statutory annual income threshold for the state pension plan in Germany (West), as amended from time to time.\n\n- -SAP made contributions to a third-party pension plan for Jennifer Morgan, as disclosed in the tables 'German Corporate Governance Code'. SAP's matching contributions are based on payments by Jennifer Morgan into this pension plan.\n\n## Total Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) and Net Defined Benefit Liability (Asset) to Executive Board Members\n\n| \u20ac thousands                                       | Christian   Klein   (CEO) 1   | Adaire   Fox-Martin 1   | Michael   Kleinemeier  (until  4/30/2020) 1   | Luka   Mucic 1   | Juergen   Mueller 1   | Stefan   Ries   (until  5/31/2020) 1   |   Thomas   Saueressig 1 | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| DBO 1/1/2019                                      | 112.8                         | 183.4                   | 338.6                                         | 543.8            | 0                     | 277.4                                  |                     0   | 1,456.0 |\n| Less plan assets market  value 1/1/2019           | 141.3                         | 257.0                   | 507.6                                         | 635.7            | 0                     | 419.3                                  |                     0   | 1,960.9 |\n| Net defined benefit liability  (asset) 1/1/2019   | - 28.5                        | - 73.6                  | - 169.0                                       | - 91.9           | 0                     | - 141.9                                |                     0   | - 504.9 |\n| DBO change in 2019                                | 244.7                         | 207.6                   | 205.9                                         | 475.0            | 149.7                 | 251.4                                  |                    41.9 | 1,576.2 |\n| Plan assets change in 2019                        | 145.9                         | 160.6                   | 171.2                                         | 147.2            | 0                     | 144.9                                  |                     0   | 769.8   |\n| DBO 12/31/2019                                    | 357.5                         | 391.0                   | 544.5                                         | 1,018.8          | 149.7                 | 528.8                                  |                    41.9 | 3,032.2 |\n| Less plan assets market  value 12/31/2019         | 287.2                         | 417.6                   | 678.8                                         | 782.9            | 0                     | 564.2                                  |                     0   | 2,730.7 |\n| Net defined benefit liability  (asset) 12/31/2019 | 70.3                          | - 26.6                  | - 134.3                                       | 235.9            | 149.7                 | - 35.4                                 |                    41.9 | 301.5   |\n| DBO change in 2020                                | 410.6                         | 174.9                   | - 544.5                                       | 129.7            | 133.1                 | 17.1                                   |                   166.4 | 487.3   |\n| Plan assets change in 2020                        | 147.9                         | 163.7                   | - 678.8                                       | 167.5            | 301.5                 | 75.9                                   |                   163.7 | 341.4   |\n| DBO 12/31/2020                                    | 768.1                         | 565.9                   | 0                                             | 1,148.5          | 282.8                 | 545.9                                  |                   208.3 | 3,519.5 |\n| Less plan assets market  value 12/31/2020         | 435.1                         | 581.3                   | 0                                             | 950.4            | 301.5                 | 640.1                                  |                   163.7 | 3,072.1 |\n| Net defined benefit liability  (asset) 12/31/2020 | 333.0                         | - 15.4                  | 0                                             | 198.1            | - 18.7                | - 94.2                                 |                    44.6 | 447.4   |\n\n- 1 The values shown here only reflect the pension entitlements that Christian Klein, Adaire Fox-Martin, Michael Kleinemeier, Luka Mucic, Juergen Mueller, Stefan Ries and Thomas Saueressig will receive from the retirement pension plan for Executive Board members .",

To the extent that members continue to serve on the Executive Board and that therefore more contributions are made for them in the future, pensions actually payable at the scheduled retirement age will be higher than the amounts shown in the table.\n\n## Postcontractual Non-Compete Provisions\n\nEach Executive Board member's contract includes a 12-month postcontractual non-compete agreement. During this non-compete period, Executive Board members receive abstention payments corresponding to 50% of their average contractual compensation as members. This average is calculated on the basis of the preceding three years. Any other occupational income generated by the Executive Board member is deducted from their compensation. In accordance with the GCGC, the Supervisory Board will offset any severance payments against such compensation for abstention.\n\nThe following table presents the theoretical amounts for the net present values of the postcontractual non-compete abstention payments. The calculation assumes the following:\n\n- -The Executive Board member leaves SAP at the end of their respective current contract term.\n- -Their final average contractual compensation prior to their departure equals their compensation in 2020.\n\nActual postcontractual non-compete payments will likely differ from these amounts depending on the time of departure and the compensation levels and target achievements at the time of departure.\n\n## Net Present Values of the Postcontractual NonCompete Abstention Payments\n\n| \u20ac thousands           | Contract  Term Expires   | Net Present  Value of  Postcontractual  Non-Compete  Abstention  Payment 1   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Christian Klein (CEO) | 4/30/2025                | 3,109                                                                        |\n| Adaire Fox-Martin     | 6/30/2021                | 2,270                                                                        |\n| Luka Mucic            | 3/31/2026                | 1,452                                                                        |\n| Juergen Mueller       | 12/31/2021               | 1,370                                                                        |\n| Thomas Saueressig     | 10/31/2022               | 1,372                                                                        |\n| Total                 |                          | 9,574                                                                        |\n\n1 For the purpose of this calculation, the following discount rates have been applied: Christian Klein -0.02%; Adaire Fox-Martin -0.31%; Luka Mucic 0.07%; Juergen Mueller -0.28%; Thomas Saueressig -0.23%.\n\n## Early End-of-Service Undertakings\n\n## Severance Payments\n\nThe standard contract for all Executive Board members provides that on termination before full term (for example, by the Company without cause where the member's appointment is revoked, where the member becomes occupationally disabled, or in connection with a change of control), SAP SE will pay to the member the outstanding part of the compensation target for the entire remainder of the term, appropriately discounted for early payment. In accordance with the GCGC, section G.13, payments made to an Executive Board member due to early termination must not exceed twice the annual total compensation. In the case of change of control, the payment must not exceed 150% of the severance payment cap. Members are not entitled to that severance payment if they have not served SAP as a member of the Executive Board for at least one year or if they leave SAP SE for reasons for which they are responsible.\n\nIf an Executive Board member's appointment to the Executive Board expires or ceases to exist because of, or as a consequence of, change or restructuring, or due to a change of control, SAP SE and each Executive Board member has the right to terminate the employment contract within eight weeks of the occurrence by giving six months' notice. A change of control is deemed to occur when:\n\n- -A third party is required to make a mandatory takeover offer to the shareholders of SAP SE under the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act;",

The Executive Board member receives, in addition to a potential disability pension under the retirement plan described above, the monthly basic salary (fixed compensation) for a further 12 months starting from the date the permanent disability is determined.\n\n## Payments to Former Executive Board Members\n\nIn 2020, we paid pension benefits of \u20ac3,009,600 to Executive Board members who had retired before January 1, 2020 (2019: \u20ac2,081,100). At the end of 2020, the DBO for former Executive Board members who had retired or left SAP before January 1, 2020, was \u20ac44,042,900 (2019: \u20ac44,306,300). Plan assets of \u20ac32,758,400 are available to meet these obligations (2019: \u20ac31,074,600).\n\n## Executive Board: Other Information\n\nWe did not grant any compensation advance or credit to, or enter into any commitment for the benefit of, any member of our Executive Board in 2020 or the previous year.\n\nAs far as the law permits, SAP SE and its affiliated companies in Germany and elsewhere indemnify and hold harmless their respective directors and officers against and from the claims of third parties. To this end, we maintain directors' and officers' (D&O) group liability insurance. The policy is annual and is renewed from year to year. The insurance covers the personal liability of the insured group for financial loss caused by its managerial acts and omissions. The current D&O policy includes an individual deductible for Executive Board members of SAP SE as required by section 93 (2) of the AktG.\n\n## Compensation for Supervisory Board Members\n\n## Compensation System\n\nSupervisory Board members' compensation is governed by our Articles of Incorporation, section 16.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board receives, in addition to the reimbursement of their expenses, an annual basic compensation of \u20ac165,000. The chairperson receives \u20ac275,000 and the deputy chairperson \u20ac220,000 annually. In addition, we reimburse members of the Supervisory Board for the value-added tax payable on their compensation.\n\nFor membership of the Audit Committee, Supervisory Board members receive an additional fixed annual compensation of \u20ac16,500, and for membership of any other Supervisory Board committee \u20ac11,000, provided that the committee concerned has met in the year. The chairperson of the Audit Committee receives \u20ac27,500, and the chairpersons of the other committees receive \u20ac22,000. The fixed remuneration is payable after the end of the year.\n\nAny members of the Supervisory Board who have served for less than the entire year receive one-twelfth of the annual remuneration for each month of service commenced. This also applies to the increased compensation of the chairperson and the deputy chairperson(s) and to the remuneration for the chairperson and the members of a committee.",

The English language text below is a translation of the independent auditor's report.\n\nTo SAP SE, Walldorf\n\n## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\n## Opinions\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of SAP SE, Walldorf, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2020, consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn addition, we have audited the combined Group Management Report by the SAP Group and the management report of SAP SE, Walldorf ('Group Management Report') for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the Group Management Report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], as well as the IFRSs as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and\n- -the accompanying Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the Group Management Report does not cover the content of those components of the Group Management Report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of the auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No. 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW) as well as in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and guidelines of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\n\nOur responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Software license revenue recognition\n\nRefer to note (A.1) - Revenue and Group Management Report, section Risk Management and Risks.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK\n\nIn the financial year 2020 SAP generated revenue of EUR 27.3 billion, of which EUR 15.1 billion relate to revenues from sales of software licenses and support.\n\nThe evaluation of software licenses revenue recognition bears an inherent risk of errors as SAP's software customer contracts are complex. SAP defined detailed policies, procedures and processes to manage the accounting for its customer contracts, which are also described in the notes. Applying them often requires significant judgments, in particular in the assessment of the following:\n\n- 1. whether various contracts are economically interrelated,\n- 2. whether products and services qualify as separate performance obligations, and",

For the vast majority of the software arrangements entered into during 2020, it was clear which of SAP's revenue recognition policies should be applied. Where there was room for interpretation, SAP's judgment was balanced and appropriate.\n\n## Assessment of the Group's uncertain tax treatments\n\nRefer to note (C.5) - Income Taxes, and Group Management Report section Risk Management and Risks.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK\n\nSAP operates in multiple tax jurisdictions with complexities and uncertainties due to different interpretations of tax laws, such as those involving revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements between SAP Group entities, changing tax laws and intercompany financing transactions. The determination of provisions for tax uncertainties requires SAP to make judgments on tax issues and develop estimates regarding SAP's exposure to tax risks. SAP regularly engages external experts to provide tax opinions to support their own risk assessment. The risk for the\n\nconsolidated financial statements relates to the completeness, measurement and disclosure of the provision for uncertain tax treatments. As of December 31, 2020 SAP disclosed contingent liabilities relating to tax uncertainties of EUR 1.2 billion.\n\n## OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the tax process including controls over the Group's assessment of tax law and the process to estimate the related exposures. We assessed the competency, skills and objectivity of the external experts and evaluated the related expert opinions. We inquired of the Group's tax department and inspected correspondence with the relevant tax authorities. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating SAP's conclusion's over the estimate of tax uncertainties based on their knowledge and experience regarding the application of relevant legislation by tax authorities and the courts.\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes with respect to uncertain tax treatments are complete and appropriate.\n\n## OUR OBSERVATIONS\n\nSAP's judgments as to the amounts recognized as tax provisions for tax uncertainties as of December 31, 2020 are appropriate. The disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are complete and appropriate.\n\n## Recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill for the Concur Segment\n\nRefer to note (D.2) - Goodwill.\n\n## THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK\n\nSAP performs its annual goodwill impairment test at the level of its operating segments as there are no lower levels within SAP at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, SAP reported goodwill of EUR 27.6 billion, of which EUR 3.3 billion was allocated to the Concur segment.\n\nThe respective impairment test is complex and involves significant judgment. The key assumptions relate to the budgeted revenue growth and budgeted operating margin. Minor changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the fair value less costs of disposal. SAP engaged an external valuation expert to support SAP in performing the goodwill impairment test.\n\nThere is the risk for the financial statements that the required impairments were not sufficiently recorded. In addition, there is the risk that the disclosures in the notes associated herewith are not appropriate.\n\n## OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the impairment process including budgeted revenue growth and budgeted operating margin assumptions for the Concur Segment. We involved our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the measurement of the fair value less costs of disposal. We evaluated SAP's budgeted revenue growth and budgeted operating margin assumptions by comparing them to publicly available market data for comparable companies. We performed an independent sensitivity analysis for each assumption listed above",

This also included an assessment as to the appropriateness of the disclosures in the notes pursuant to IAS 36.134(f) with respect to sensitivities resulting from reasonably possible changes of key assumptions underlying the valuation.\n\n## OUR OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe approaches underlying the impairment testing of goodwill are appropriate and consistent with the applicable accounting and valuation principles. SAP applied a balanced set of assumptions in determining the fair value less costs of disposal. The disclosures in the notes associated herewith are appropriate.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, respectively, of SAP SE is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following unaudited information in the Group Management Report:\n\n- -the combined non-financial report, included in section 'General Information About This Management Report' of the Group Management Report,\n- -the corporate governance statement, included in section 'Corporate Governance Fundamentals' of the Group Management Report, and\n- -Information extraneous to the Group Management Report and marked as unaudited.\n\nThe other information also includes the annual report on Form 20-F and remaining parts of the annual report.\n\nThe other information does not include the consolidated financial statements, group management report information and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report do not cover the other information and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- -is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the Group Management Report information audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- -otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nIn addition, we were engaged to perform an independent assurance engagement on selected qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures of the integrated report 2020. In regard to the nature, extent and conclusions of this independent assurance\n\nengagement we refer to our Independence Assurance Report dated on February 24, 2021.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe Executive Board of SAP SE is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB as well as IFRS as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The Executive Board also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the Group Management Report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as the Executive Board has considered necessary to enable the preparation of the Group Management Report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, the German Accounting Standards number 17 and 20 (GAS 17, GAS 20) and the IFRS Practice Statement Management Commentary and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the Group Management Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the Group Management Report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the Group Management Report.",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this Group Management Report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the Group Management Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the Group Management Report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Executive Board and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Executive Board and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the Group Management Report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions.

We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n- -Evaluate the consistency of the Group Management Report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- -Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the Executive Board in the Group Management Report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Executive Board as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

This control system is based on criteria set out in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, SAP maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020 based on the criteria set out in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.",

A company's internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements includes policies and procedures to (1) ensure an accounting system that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflects the transactions and dispositions of the company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility for the Internal Control over Financial Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting in the consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk of material deficiencies in internal control, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on this assessment, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Assurance Report in accordance with Section 317 (3b) HGB on the Electronic Reproduction of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes\n\nWe have performed an assurance engagement in accordance with Section 317 (3b) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the electronic reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file that can be downloaded by the issuer from the electronic client portal with access protection, 'sap-2020-12-31AR.zip' (SHA256 hash value: 524a6c728259ec888\n\nfbcf7f40b8807a71777e3f475e49598987baafe5a335708) and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format').

We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance conclusion.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assessment of the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- -Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- -Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report.\n- -Evaluate whether tagging the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) provides an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n## Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as group auditor at the annual general meeting on May 20, 2020.

The combined group management report is also a management commentary complying with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Practice Statement 'Management Commentary'.\n\nThe German Commercial Code, sections 289b and 315b, requires us to prepare, for both SAP SE and the SAP Group, a nonfinancial statement within the management report or a nonfinancial report outside of the management report in which we report on social, environmental, and other non-financial matters. The required disclosures can be, but do not need to be, a separate section in our management report. Instead, the information required can also be provided, in an integrated manner, in the different sections of the management report. SAP released a combined non-financial report outside of the combined management report but within our online integrated report with references to the sections of our combined management report. This combined non-financial report is available at\n\nhttp://www.sap.com/investors/sap-2020-combined-non-financialreport. We believe that this approach is best aligned with SAP's integrated reporting strategy, also taking into account that all nonfinancial information stipulated in the German Commercial Code, sections 289c and 315c, that is relevant to understand SAP's development, business performance, and the position of the Group and SAP SE is included in our combined group management report.\n\nOur auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (KPMG), audited SAP's combined group management report, except for information that was not subject to the statutory audit of our combined group management report, but on which a limited assurance engagement was performed as stated in this paragraph. Additionally, KPMG performed an independent assurance engagement on selected qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures. The sections SAP's Impact; Security, Data Protection, and Privacy; Employees and Social Investments; Energy and Emissions; Business Conduct; and Human Rights and Labor Standards include information that was not subject to the statutory audit of our combined group management report, but on which a limited assurance engagement was performed. These sections contain further explanations about the audit scope in an info box at the end of the respective section marked by the symbol . For more information about the scope of the assurance and the underlying reporting criteria, see KPMG's Independent Auditor's Report and the Assurance Report of the Independent Auditor on Selected Qualitative and Quantitative Sustainability Disclosures in the SAP Integrated Report.\n\nAll of the information in this report relates to the situation as at December 31, 2020, or the fiscal year ended on that date, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis management report contains forward-looking statements and information based on the beliefs of, and assumptions made by, SAP management using information currently available to them. Any statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, and projections about future conditions and events. As a result, our forward-looking statements and information are subject to uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond our control. If one or more of these uncertainties or risks materializes, or if management's underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from those described in or inferred from our forward-looking statements and information. We describe these risks and uncertainties in the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\nThe words 'aim,' 'anticipate,' 'assume,' 'believe,' 'continue,' 'could,' 'counting on,' 'is confident,' 'development,' 'estimate,' 'expect,' 'forecast,' 'future trends,' 'guidance,' 'intend,' 'may,' 'might,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'predict,' 'project,' 'seek,' 'should,' 'strategy,' 'want,' 'will,' 'would,' and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such statements include, for example, those made in the Operating Results section, our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pursuant to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), namely IFRS 7 and related statements in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Expected Developments and Opportunities section; Risk Management and Risks section; and other forward-looking information appearing in other parts of this report. To fully consider the factors that could affect our future financial results, both this report and our Annual Report on Form 20-F should be considered, as well as all of our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date specified or the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information that we receive about conditions that existed upon issuance of this report, future events, or otherwise unless we are required to do so by law.\n\nThis report includes statistical data about the IT industry and global economic trends that comes from information published by sources including International Data Corporation (IDC), Gartner, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Based on the conviction that technology and digitalization can help solve environmental, economic, and social challenges, SAP considers this overarching theme in our innovation efforts. Today's challenges, including demographic change, rapid technological change, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to disruptions of all kinds across the globe.

Therefore, our vision is tailored to a common goal of being an innovative and trusted partner for our customers - and to support them in reinventing the way their business runs. The dynamic expansion of our technological foundation serves the overarching objectives of creating resilient, profitable, and sustainable business outcomes for our customers.

We are strongly committed to innovating in new markets by building on our core software and technology and by facilitating business change that addresses the future of work. We are aiming to vitalize agility, speed, and integration by creating a world-class business technology platform, together with a strong developer and partner ecosystem.

RISE with SAP provides a path to the cloud for customers, without high upfront cost, and with faster time to value and the flexibility to decide which capabilities to use at what point in time.

By obtaining customer feedback, we strive to continuously improve our solutions, identify further business needs, and deliver enhanced value to our customers across the whole lifecycle.\n\n## Inputs\n\nThis process does not happen in a vacuum. It is enabled by internal and external inputs, and most importantly customer insights, customer experience and broader stakeholder dialogue, financial capital, employees' expertise, intellectual property, products, and services from our partner ecosystem, as well as the IT infrastructure we rely on.\n\n## Impact\n\nOur solutions help create impact for our customers and through them - in the world.\n\nSAP software and programs primarily support the UN SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-Being); 4 (Quality Education); 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth); 9 (Industry, Innovation, and\n\nInfrastructure); 10 (Reduced Inequalities); 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production); and 13 (Climate Action). For example, SAP software helps:\n\n- -Companies work better to bring economic prosperity and fairly paid jobs to people around the world.\n- -Organizations optimize resource utilization, aspiring for a world with zero waste.\n- -SAP customers increase their overall resource productivity and transform their businesses to reduce carbon footprint. We are deeply committed to empowering the world's youth,\n\nexperienced staff pursuing additional education, differently abled people, and the unemployed with the right skills to thrive in the digital economy. We offer programs that range from inspiring early stage innovation to scaling mature social enterprises.\n\nFurthermore, we know there is power in collaboration and therefore we engage in a wide range of partnerships to address SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).",

We view growth and profitability as indicators of our current performance, while we see customer loyalty and employee engagement as indicators of our future performance.\n\n## Measures to Manage Our Financial Performance\n\n## Measures to Manage Our Operating Financial Performance\n\nIn 2020, we used the following key measures to manage our operating financial performance:\n\nCloud revenue (non-IFRS) : This revenue driver comprises the main revenues of our fast-growing cloud business. Revenue from cloud is derived from fees earned from providing customers with any of the following:\n\n- -Software as a service (SaaS)\n- -Platform as a service (PaaS)\n- -Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\n- -Premium cloud support beyond regular support embedded in cloud offerings\n\nFor more information regarding cloud revenue and a description of these services, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (A.1).\n\nWe use the cloud revenue (non-IFRS) measure at both actual currencies and constant currencies.\n\nCloud and software revenue (non-IFRS) : We use cloud and software revenue (non-IFRS) expressed in both actual currencies and constant currencies to measure our revenue growth. Our cloud and software revenue includes cloud revenue plus software licenses and support revenue. Cloud revenue and software revenue are our key revenue drivers because they tend to affect our other revenue streams. Generally, customers that buy software licenses also enter into related support contracts, and these generate recurring support revenue after the software sale. Support contracts cover standardized support services and unspecified future software updates and enhancements. Cloud and software revenue also tends to stimulate services revenue, which is earned by providing customers with professional services, premium engagement services, training services, messaging services, and payment services.\n\nTotal revenue (non-IFRS) : We use total revenue (non-IFRS) to measure our growth at both actual currencies and constant currencies. The total of cloud revenue and support revenue divided by total revenue is the share of more predictable revenue. This measure provides additional insight into our sustained business success.\n\nCurrent cloud backlog (CCB) : We use current cloud backlog, both in actual and at constant currencies, to manage our operating financial performance. The CCB measures our overall go-to-market\n\nsuccess in the committed cloud business. The CCB is the contractually committed cloud revenue we expect to recognize over the upcoming 12 months as of a specific key date. Thus, it is a subcomponent of our overall remaining performance obligations following IFRS 15.120. For our committed cloud business, we believe the CCB is a valuable indicator of go-to-market success, as it reflects both new contracts closed as well as existing contracts renewed.\n\nOperating profit (non-IFRS) : We use operating profit (non-IFRS) expressed in both actual currencies and constant currencies to measure our overall operational process efficiency and overall business performance.\n\nCloud gross margin (non-IFRS) : We use our cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) to measure our process efficiency in our cloud business. Cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) is the ratio of our cloud gross profit (non-IFRS) to cloud revenue (non-IFRS), expressed as a percentage.\n\nOperating margin (non-IFRS) : We use operating margin to measure our overall operational efficiency. Operating margin (nonIFRS) is the ratio of our operating profit (non-IFRS) to total revenue (non-IFRS), expressed as a percentage.\n\n## Measures to Manage Our Non-Operating Financial Performance\n\nWe use the following measures to manage our non-operating financial performance:\n\nFinancial income, net : This measure provides insight into the return on liquid assets and capital investments and the cost of borrowed funds. To manage our financial income, net, we focus on cash flow, the composition of our liquid assets and capital investment portfolio, and the average rate of interest at which assets are invested. We also monitor average outstanding borrowings and associated finance costs.\n\nDays Sales Outstanding (DSO) : We manage working capital by controlling the DSO of trade receivables. DSO measures the average number of days from the raised invoice to cash receipt from the customer. We calculate DSO by dividing the average invoiced trade receivables balance of the last 12 months by the average monthly cash receipt of the last 12 months.\n\n## Measures to Manage Overall Financial Performance\n\nWe use the following measures to manage our overall financial performance:\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) (IFRS and non-IFRS) : EPS measures our overall performance because it captures all operating and nonoperating elements of profit as well as income tax expense. It represents the portion of profit after tax allocable to each SAP share outstanding. EPS is influenced not only by our operating and nonoperating business and income taxes but also by the number of shares outstanding.",

        "page_content": "Effective tax rate (IFRS and non-IFRS) : We define our effective tax rate as the ratio of income tax expense to profit before tax, expressed as a percentage.\n\nOperating, investing, and financing cash flows and free cash flow : Our consolidated statement of cash flows provides insight into how we generate and use cash and cash equivalents. When applied in conjunction with the other primary financial statements, it provides information that helps us evaluate the changes in our net assets, our financial structure (including our liquidity and solvency), and our ability to affect the amounts and timing of cash flows to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities. We use our free cash flow measure to determine the cash flow remaining after all expenditures required to maintain or expand our organic business have been paid off. This measure provides management with supplemental information to assess our liquidity needs. We calculate free cash flow as net cash from operating activities minus purchases (other than purchases made in connection with business combinations) of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, as well as payments for lease liabilities.\n\n## Measures to Manage Our Non-Financial Performance\n\nIn 2020, we used the following key measures to manage our nonfinancial performance in the areas of customer loyalty, employee engagement, leadership trust, and carbon emissions:\n\nCustomer Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS) : The annual assessment of customer loyalty is based on a survey that includes the Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric. The Customer NPS score is calculated based on the NPS Likelihood to Recommend question with its proprietary scoring, identified on a scale of 0-10. We introduced this measure in 2012, as we are convinced that we can achieve our financial goals only when our customers are loyal to, and satisfied with, SAP and our solutions. To derive the Customer NPS, we start with the percentage of 'promoters' of SAP, that is, those giving us a score of 9 or 10 on a scale of 0-10. We then subtract the percentage of 'detractors,' that is, those giving us a score of 0-6. The method ignores 'passives,' that is, those giving us a score of 7 or 8. Consequently, the range of achievable scores is -100 to +100, with the latter being the best achievable score for customer loyalty as measured by the Customer NPS methodology.\n\nEmployee Engagement Index : We use this index to measure the motivation and loyalty of our employees, how proud they are of our company, and how strongly they identify with SAP. The index is derived from our global employee survey program. Applying this measure is recognition that our growth strategy depends on engaged employees.\n\nLeadership Trust Score : We use this score to further enhance accountability and to measure our collective effort to foster a work environment based on trust. It is derived from a question in our global employee survey program that gauges employees' trust in our leaders. We measure leadership trust by using the same NPS methodology that we use to compute the Customer NPS.\n\nStarting in 2021, we will determine the Employee Engagement Index and the Leadership Trust Score as the average of the scores retrieved in each of the surveys we run within a fiscal year. Adopting the Experience Management (XM) philosophy of Qualtrics, we changed our engagement survey concept to a continuous listening approach that includes multiple data collections throughout the\n\nyear. This new average score will provide a more valid evaluation of the full-year engagement level of our employees.\n\nCarbon emissions : We use carbon emissions to manage our non-financial performance. It is used as a metric to strengthen our ambitious short-term and long-term carbon reduction targets. We measure our net carbon emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. The net carbon emissions are calculated by deducting emission savings such as self-produced renewable energy, renewable energy certificates, and carbon offsets from our gross carbon emissions.\n\n## Value-Based Management\n\nOur holistic view of the performance measures described above, together with our associated analyses, comprises the information we use for value-based management. We use planning and control processes to manage the compilation of these key measures and their availability to our decision-makers across various management levels.\n\nSAP's long-term strategic plans are the point of reference for our short-term and mid-term planning and controlling processes. We initially identify future growth and profitability drivers at a highly aggregated level. In a first step, the resulting financial plan is broken down into (i) our deployment models 'On Premise,' 'Software as a Service/Platform as a Service,' 'Infrastructure as a Service,' and 'Intelligent Spend Management'; and (ii) functions such as development, sales, and administration. In a second step, the planned total revenues and total expenses are generally allocated to the areas of functional responsibility of the individual members of the Executive Board ('Board area'). If a Board area represents not only a functional department but also has a responsibility for operating segments within this Board area, the allocation is done at the lower segment level. Budget adjustments may be applied during the year to reflect changes in priorities, to achieve efficiency targets, and to reflect endogenous and exogenous factors. Such budget adjustments, as well as the assessment of the Executive Board's performance, are handled at the Board area level if the Board area is part of a segment, or at the segment level if the Board area comprises several segments. It is then the individual Executive Board member's responsibility to break down the allocated budget adjustments within the segment budget boundary. Based on an integrated portfolio process running in parallel to the budgeting process, we ensure aligned investment behavior across Board areas with regards to specific solutions or solution areas. In a final step, customer-facing revenue targets and cost-of-sales and marketing targets are broken down into sales regions.\n\nBased on our detailed annual plans, we determine the budget for the respective year. We also have processes in place to forecast revenue and profit on a quarterly basis, to quantify whether we expect to realize our financial goals, and to identify any deviations from plan. We continuously monitor the affected units in the Group to analyze these developments and define any appropriate actions. Our entire network of planning, control, and reporting processes is implemented in integrated planning and information systems, based on SAP software, across all organizational units so that we can conduct the evaluations and analyses needed to make informed decisions.",

        "page_content": "## Non-IFRS Financial Measures Cited in This Report\n\n## Explanation of Non-IFRS Measures\n\nWe disclose certain financial measures such as revenue (nonIFRS), expense (non-IFRS), and profit measures (non-IFRS) that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS and are therefore considered non-IFRS financial measures. Our non-IFRS financial measures may not correspond to non-IFRS financial measures that other companies report. The non-IFRS financial measures that we report should only be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, or superior to, our IFRS financial measures.\n\nWe believe that the disclosed supplemental historical and prospective non-IFRS financial information provides useful information to investors because management uses this information, in addition to financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS, to attain a more transparent understanding of our past performance and our anticipated future results. We use non-IFRS revenue and profit measures consistently in our internal planning and forecasting, reporting, and compensation, as well as in our external communications, as follows:\n\n- -Our management primarily uses these non-IFRS measures rather than IFRS measures as the basis for making financial, strategic, and operating decisions.\n- -The variable components of our Executive Board members' and employees' remuneration are based on revenue (non-IFRS), operating profit (non-IFRS), operating margin (non-IFRS), as well as current cloud backlog (CCB) measures rather than the respective IFRS measures.\n- -The annual budgeting process for all management units is based on revenue (non-IFRS) and operating profit (non-IFRS) numbers rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.\n- -All forecast and performance reviews with all senior managers globally are based on these non-IFRS measures, rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.\n- -Both our internal performance targets and the guidance we provide to the capital markets are based on non-IFRS revenue and profit measures rather than the respective IFRS financial measures.\n\nOur non-IFRS financial measures reflect adjustments based on the items below, as well as adjustments for the related income tax effects.\n\n## Revenue (Non-IFRS)\n\nNon-IFRS revenue measures have been adjusted from the respective IFRS financial measures by including the full amount of software support revenue, cloud revenue, and other similarly recurring revenue that we are not permitted to record as revenue under IFRS due to fair value accounting for the contracts in effect at the time of the respective acquisitions.\n\nUnder IFRS, we record at fair value the contracts in effect at the time entities were acquired. Consequently, our IFRS software support revenue, IFRS cloud revenue, IFRS cloud and software revenue, and IFRS total revenue for periods subsequent to acquisitions do not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been recorded by entities acquired by SAP had they remained stand-alone entities. Adjusting revenue numbers for this revenue impact provides additional insight into the comparability of our ongoing performance across periods.\n\n## Operating Expense (Non-IFRS)\n\nOperating expense numbers that are identified as operating expenses (non-IFRS) have been adjusted by excluding the following expenses:\n\n- -Acquisition-related charges\n- \u25aa Amortization expense/impairment charges for intangibles acquired in business combinations and certain stand-alone acquisitions of intellectual property (including purchased inprocess research and development) as well as sale/disposal gains and losses for these intangibles\n- \u25aa Settlements of preexisting business relationships in connection with a business combination\n- \u25aa Acquisition-related third-party expenses\n- -Share-based payment expenses\n- -Restructuring expenses, that is, expenses resulting from measures which comply with the definition of restructuring according to IFRS.\n\nWe exclude certain acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating operating profit (non-IFRS), operating margin (nonIFRS), and earnings per share (non-IFRS) when evaluating SAP's continuing operational performance because these expenses generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the relevant acquisition other than by disposing of the acquired assets. Since management at levels below the Executive Board does not influence these expenses, we generally do not consider these expenses for the purpose of evaluating the performance of management units. For similar reasons, we eliminate share-based payment expenses as these costs are impacted by share price developments and other factors outside our control. We also eliminate restructuring expenses because they are volatile and mostly cannot be influenced by management at levels below the Executive Board.\n\n## Operating Profit (Non-IFRS), Cloud Gross Margin (Non-IFRS), Operating Margin (Non-IFRS), Effective Tax Rate (Non-IFRS), and Earnings per Share (Non-IFRS)\n\nOperating profit, cloud gross margin, operating margin, effective tax rate, and earnings per share identified as operating profit (nonIFRS), cloud gross margin (non-IFRS), operating margin (non-IFRS), effective tax rate (non-IFRS), and earnings per share (non-IFRS) have been adjusted from the respective IFRS measures by adjusting for the aforementioned revenue (non-IFRS) and operating expenses (non-IFRS) and the income tax effects thereon.\n\n## Constant Currencies Information\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to have information that provides insight into the development of our sales. Revenue measures determined under IFRS provide information that is useful in this regard. However, both sales volume and currency effects impact period-over-period changes in sales revenue. We do not sell standardized units of products and services, so we cannot provide relevant information on sales volume by providing data on the changes in product and service units sold. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors in breaking down and evaluating changes in sales volume, we present information about our revenue and various values and components relating to operating profit that are adjusted for foreign currency effects. We calculate constant currencies measures by translating foreign",

We include the revenue adjustments outlined above and exclude the expense adjustments outlined above when making decisions to allocate resources. In addition, we use these non-IFRS measures to facilitate comparisons of SAP's operating performance from period to period.\n- -The non-IFRS measures provide investors with additional information that enables a comparison of year-over-year operating performance by eliminating certain direct effects of acquisitions, share-based compensation plans, and restructuring plans.\n- -Non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures are widely used in the software industry. In many cases, inclusion of our non-IFRS measures may facilitate comparison with our competitors' corresponding non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures.\n\n## Limitations of Non-IFRS Measures\n\nWithout being analyzed in conjunction with the corresponding IFRS measures, the non-IFRS measures are not indicative of our present and future performance, foremost, but not limited, for the following reasons:\n\n- -While our profit (non-IFRS) numbers reflect the elimination of certain acquisition-related expenses, no eliminations are made for the additional revenue or other income that results from the acquisitions.\n- -While we adjust for the fair value accounting of the acquired entities' recurring revenue contracts, we do not adjust for the fair value accounting of deferred compensation items that result from commissions paid to the acquired company's sales force and third parties for closing the respective customer contracts.\n\n- -The acquisition-related amortization expense that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers is a recurring expense that will impact our financial performance in future years.\n- -The remaining acquisition-related charges that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are likely to recur should SAP enter into material business combinations in the future. Similarly, the restructuring expenses that we eliminate in deriving our profit (non-IFRS) numbers are likely to recur should SAP perform restructurings in the future.\n- -The revenue adjustment for the fair value accounting of the acquired entities' contracts and the expense adjustment for acquisition-related charges do not arise from a common conceptual basis. This is because the revenue adjustment aims to improve the comparability of the initial post-acquisition period with future post-acquisition periods, while the expense adjustment aims to improve the comparability between postacquisition periods and pre-acquisition periods. This should particularly be considered when evaluating our operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) numbers, as these combine our revenue (non-IFRS) and expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common conceptual basis.\n- -Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash outflows in the past and could do so in the future. The same applies to our share-based payment expense because most of our share-based payments are settled in cash rather than shares.\n- -The valuation of our cash-settled share-based payments could vary significantly from period to period due to the fluctuation of our share price and other parameters used in the valuation of these plans.\n- -In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards to our employees every year and we intend to continue doing so in the future. Thus, our share-based payment expenses are recurring, although the amounts usually change from period to period.\n\nWe believe that constant currencies measures have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated constitute a significant element of our revenue and expenses and could materially impact our performance. Therefore, we limit our use of constant currencies measures to the analysis of changes in volume as one element of the full change in a financial measure. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering both constant currencies and nominal measures of revenue (non-IFRS) and operating profit (non-IFRS) measures on the one hand, and changes in revenue, operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS on the other. We caution the readers of our financial reports to follow a similar approach by considering nominal and constant currencies non-IFRS measures only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, changes in revenue, operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\nDespite these limitations, we believe that the presentation of our non-IFRS measures and the corresponding IFRS measures, together with the relevant reconciliations, provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.",

Our customers want to succeed, and, even in a crisis, to be resilient, adaptable, and a best-run business.\n\nTo fulfill our purpose and respond to changing market conditions, SAP has evolved our strategy to support our customers in their transformation to intelligent enterprises, with a clear focus on driving innovation, integration, agility, and speed. Our product portfolio aims to deliver on this strategy. For a visual overview, see the Strategy and Business Model section.\n\n## Business Network\n\nInterconnected value chains and business networks incorporate customers, suppliers, distributors, and other key stakeholders across businesses and beyond company and country borders. By sharing data and information in a global network, enterprises can gain real-time visibility to sense demand, anticipate risks, and manage business processes along the supply chain. In addition, adaptable networks aim to help companies adjust quickly and responsibly to meet changing market demands, and a flexible ecosystem of suppliers and partners can handle sudden shortfalls, or even produce new products that aim to help companies react quickly to change and disruption. SAP Business Network aims to bring end-to-end visibility, increased efficiency, and improved collaboration across supply chain processes - from design, planning, sourcing, and procurement, to manufacturing, logistics, designed to use insights from real-time ERP, advanced analytics, and existing network solutions - including Ariba Network ,\n\nNetwork , and SAP Fieldglass solutions - to deliver collective network. By creating a network of intelligent enterprises, we aim to help companies digitalize multi-enterprise business processes for insight and collaboration across the supply chain ecosystem.\n\nand asset operations.

With business process intelligence (BPI) , we help ensure customers get the value out of their business processes in a data-driven and intelligent way, thanks to process and data mining. BPI describes a range of SAP offerings that help customers identify, analyze, and rectify business process events. Our software includes functionality for process discovery and recommendation and user behavior mining, along with services and support offerings. In addition, BPI is integrated in\n\nSAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation\n\n(SAP Intelligent RPA) technology that aims to help customers get the most out of their business processes in cloud, on-premise, and hybrid environments.\n\n## Experience Management\n\nExperience Management (XM) refers to both the technology and the discipline of seeking out and closing the experience gaps found in the four core areas of businesses - customer, product, employee, and brand. With Qualtrics XM technology integrated into our intelligent suite and industry cloud solutions - spanning customer experience and human resources (HR), to procurement and supply chain - customers can bring real-time sentiment into decisions and actions.\n\n## Industry Cloud\n\nExpanding our reach and expertise in more than 25 industries, SAP introduced new modular cloud solutions as part of our industry cloud strategy in the first half of 2020. Industry cloud solutions aim to digitalize and differentiate industry-specific processes, with a faster time to value for our customers. These cloud-native industry applications are built by SAP and our partners using technologies in SAP Business Technology Platform .\n\nWhile we co-innovate with customers and partners to help meet the needs of an intelligent enterprise, system integration also remains a focus area for our teams. In 2020, we published SAP's integration plan in the cloud and made significant progress implementing planned integration qualities across organic and acquired cloud offerings.\n\n## Intelligent Suite\n\n## Customer\n\nOur SAP Customer Experience solutions -integrated with XM capabilities from Qualtrics -bring together customer data, machine learning technology, and microservices to support realtime customer engagements across sales, service, marketing, and commerce.\n\nWith the recent acquisition of leading omnichannel customer engagement platform provider Emarsys , SAP aims to enhance our SAP Customer Experience portfolio and provide customers with a 'commerce anywhere' strategy. More information on this acquisition can be found in the Strategy and Business Model section.\n\nAlso released in 2020, SAP Customer Data Platform equips companies with 360-degree customer profiles that will help them to know more about their customers - wherever they are in the customer lifecycle. Insights include real-time data from sources inside and outside the company, including online content and social channels. Combined with Emarsys technology, the solution aims to help customers collect and manage real-time customer data,",

These solutions aim to increase our customers' operational agility and accelerate business outcomes.\n\n## Sustainability Management\n\nSAP has an opportunity and responsibility to use our position to create a lasting positive impact for future generations. By integrating sustainability data with business processes across industries and value chains to drive performance, new products, and new markets, we can have a significant impact in this area against a fragmented competition.\n\nEmbedding sustainability as a new dimension of success into analytical and transactional applications will help optimize resources across value chains. Our focus is on climate and natural capital accounting; resource efficiency, tracking, and reuse; protecting and developing people and communities; and nextgeneration sustainability steering and reporting.\n\nReleased in the first half of 2020, our Climate 21 program focuses on software solutions for emissions management, carbon accounting, and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). The program aims to define and develop business and solution capabilities to help our customers manage their ' green line ' for sustainable competitive performance.\n\n## Enterprise Information Management\n\nSAP solutions for enterprise information management (EIM) provide capabilities to understand, integrate, cleanse, manage, associate, and archive data.

        "page_content": "called hyperscalers ). The business-centric technologies that power SAP BTP aim to enable integration, extensibility, and innovation across the entire intelligent suite.\n\n## Database and Data Management\n\n## SAP HANA and SAP HANA Cloud\n\nThe architecture in SAP HANA allows both transactional processing for data capture and retrieval and analytical processing for business intelligence and reporting. It enables businesses to process and analyze live data and make business decisions based on the most up-to-date information. SAP HANA is available both on premise and through the new SAP HANA Cloud data platform, which was released in March 2020.\n\n## Analytics\n\nBusiness analytics tools from SAP are designed to help customers gain insights that will enable them to adapt their businesses in real time.\n\n## SAP Analytics Cloud\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud is a cloud analytics solution running on SAP HANA that brings together the domains of business intelligence, predictive capabilities, and enterprise planning.

As an open product, SAP Data Warehouse Cloud can be integrated into an existing customer landscape, while giving customers the ability to connect to SAP, third-party, cloud, and on-premise data sources. In addition, besides SAP Analytics Cloud, other consumption tools such as Microsoft Power BI, can also leverage the benefits of SAP Data Warehouse Cloud by connecting via SQL and APIs.\n\n## SAP BW/4HANA\n\nSAP BW/4HANA is our on-premise data warehouse solution built entirely on SAP HANA. It includes an analytics layer that processes data directly in-memory in the database instead of the application layer, as is the case with traditional analytical engines.\n\n## Application Development and Integration\n\nOur open SAP BTP extends and integrates SAP applications with third-party solutions and allows us and our partners to build new business applications with intelligent capabilities at scale. Going forward, SAP BTP will be our one technology platform to empower customers to become intelligent enterprises through integration, data to value, and extensibility. To that end, we have begun to sunset the SAP Cloud Platform brand in January 2021 with the proven capabilities from SAP Cloud Platform now available as products and\n\nservices in the renamed SAP Integration Suite and SAP Extension Suite.\n\n## SAP Integration Suite\n\nSAP Integration Suite is an enterprise integration suite for hybrid and heterogenous environments that aims to help customers with holistic integration across different integration styles, such as process integration and data integration, as well as API-based and event-based integrations.\n\n## SAP Extension Suite\n\nSAP Extension Suite is the extension layer for SAP BTP. The suite aims to help realize faster time to value by providing ready-touse business services designed to accelerate and simplify the development of application extensions.\n\n## Intelligent Technologies\n\nSAP uses the term 'intelligent technologies' to describe tools and technology meant to turn intelligence into business outcomes. Examples include AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and robotic process automation (RPA). Intelligent technologies are embedded in many of our software offerings and applied to processes that integrate both SAP and third-party data and applications.\n\n## SAP Internet of Things\n\nSAP Internet of Things (SAP IoT) offers a managed cloud solution that aims to generate business outcomes by combining real-world usage data from sensors and devices with business semantics, such as master and transactional data. SAP IoT enriches our offerings that address Industry 4.0 - SAP S/4HANA software, our SAP solutions for digital manufacturing , SAP Digital Supply Chain solutions, and the SAP Customer Experience portfolio - with real-world IoT context to assist decision-making and help customers respond to critical events. In addition, SAP Edge Services is customized technology that allows customers to deploy selected microservices at the edge of their networks and thereby help them execute IoT-enabled enterprise business processes\n\nlocally.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nAI functionality has been integrated into some of our product portfolio to provide intelligent capabilities in SAP S/4HANA as well as SAP Customer Experience, SAP Concur, SAP Fieldglass, and SAP SuccessFactors solutions, among others. We have continued to broaden AI integration throughout our software portfolio.\n\n## SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation\n\nSAP Intelligent RPA technology refers to an automation suite in which software robots are designed to mimic human actions and responses, and where manual steps are replaced by automated, definable, and repeatable business processes across lines of business.

        "page_content": "## Offering Freedom of Choice Through Hyperscalers\n\nAs cloud adoption grows, so does the need for cloud services. We are working to meet this growing need through a multi-cloud strategy to give our customers the freedom to choose the cloud services they need, either within SAP's own cloud infrastructure, or from the hyperscalers that offer cloud infrastructure as a service. SAP maintains strategic relationships with major hyperscalers so that we can offer customers this flexibility and freedom of choice.\n\n## Ecosystem\n\n## Extending Our Reach Through a Broad Ecosystem\n\nSAP's ecosystem consists of more than 22,000 partners worldwide that build, sell, service, and run SAP solutions and technology. Our partner ecosystem drives the bulk of our business presence among small and midsize enterprise (SME) customers. During 2020, we continued to build on the Next-Generation\n\nPartnering initiative started last year to make partnerships simpler and more profitable for the ecosystem. The initiative aims to meet customers' specific needs by focusing on partner innovation that extends SAP technology and solutions. As SAP increases investments in the cloud, strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and others will help maximize innovation opportunities. One such opportunity was the expansion of SAP's partnership with Microsoft through the integration of Microsoft Teams across the portfolio, in SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP Customer Experience solutions, for example.\n\n## SAP Services and Support\n\nComplementing our software and technology offerings, SAP provides services and support to help customers realize business outcomes and experiences. We provide proactive, predictive, and preventive support across cloud, on-premise, and hybrid landscapes to support customers' move to the cloud and business transformation into an intelligent enterprise.\n\n## Essential Business Services\n\nTo help customers maintain business continuity, we released a portfolio of essential business services from SAP in 2020 to help deliver business outcomes faster. The scenarios contained within this portfolio, created in collaboration with customers, are intended to help companies address business challenges and opportunities caused by the pandemic. Examples include scenarios designed to assess e-commerce performance, optimize inventory, and build technology-based solutions, such as applications for emergency aid.\n\n## Continuous Success Programs\n\nWe expanded SAP Enterprise Support offerings in 2020 with the release of the following:\n\n- -New SAP Enterprise Support guides provide a structured support approach for SAP S/4HANA deployments.\n- -SAP Cloud ALM is an application lifecycle management tool that aims to help enable cloud-centric customers to efficiently implement and operate cloud solutions from SAP. This was\n\nreleased and included in SAP Enterprise Support, cloud editions .\n\n- -Our Next-Generation Support approach has an expanded selfservice digital support experience that now includes a support assistant that helps categorize a customer issue, an incident solution-matching service driven by AI and machine learning capabilities that automatically proposes solutions based on incident data, and automatic translation for Expert Chat and last incident interaction.\n- -Service bundles were released to help customers address new challenges such as those posed by the pandemic. One example is that of services that aim to enable business continuity when companies experience spikes in sales and production. Also, in 2020, we continued a multiyear expansion of the\n\nSAP Preferred Success offering with the following products, services and assets:\n\n- -We extended the coverage of the offering to more cloud solutions and technologies from SAP, including SAP S/4HANA Cloud, extended edition; SAP Ariba solutions; and SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain.\n- -We added new services and assets that aim to help with the adoption of cloud-based solutions and support the enablement of better user experiences. These include success checks, online knowledge sessions, expert advisory services, release guidance, adoption journeys, value scorecards, and tools such as a usage analyzer for SAP S/4HANA.\n\n## Continued Focus on Security\n\nSAP is committed to keeping customers' data safe, to processing it in compliance with local legislation, and to protecting it from malicious use.\n\nDuring a routine cybersecurity review in the first half of 2020, we identified that some of our cloud products did not meet one or more contractually agreed or statutory IT security standards. All identified gaps were resolved by July 2020.\n\nFor more information on our strategy for the security and integrity of our customers' data, see the Security, Data Protection, and Privacy section. For more information on how SAP evaluates and handles risk, see the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\n## COVID-19 Response\n\n## Supporting Customers and the Community Through Challenging Times and Beyond\n\nSAP has been taking action to help customers adapt their businesses and prepare their organizations for the new and unexpected challenges that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents. Our goal was to provide solutions that aim to help companies mitigate risks, ensure business continuity, and manage the needs brought on by a rapidly changing business and health environment. All these changes are intended to have a positive impact beyond 2020.\n\n## Working with Partners and the Public Sector to Disrupt the Spread\n\nSAP, in close collaboration with Deutsche Telekom and other partners, developed the Corona-Warn-App . The app was designed to track COVID-19 infections and break transmission chains in",

        "page_content": "Germany. Since its launch by the German government mid-2020, the app has been downloaded over 25 million times. The app is also connected to COVID-19 contact tracing apps in Croatia, Denmark, Italy, Latvia, Spain, Poland, and the Republic of Ireland, all enabled through a system called the European Union (EU) interoperability gateway - an intergovernmental and cross-border initiative set up in October 2020.\n\n## Helping Companies Run Safely and Efficiently\n\nSolutions such as Qualtrics Return to Work Pulse , Qualtrics Workforce Contact Tracing , and Qualtrics Digital XM for Telehealth help companies address the types of challenges that have arisen in 2020. In addition, the SAP Ariba Discovery solution was offered free of charge to help buyers source suppliers, goods, and services globally, while SAP Concur solutions were made available to help curb the impact of global travel disruptions. Software updates were also delivered to help meet compliance with legal, tax, and payroll obligations brought about by the pandemic. With regards to support, new assets were added to SAP Preferred Success such as  best practice guides, live and recorded enablement sessions, and adoption journey maps, with a number of assets aiming to help address cash flow management as well as supply chain challenges that have come about during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Making Education Available and Attainable\n\nSAP also views learning as crucially important. To underline this, we launched a digital learning initiative in 2020 that provides virtual education-related offerings and certifications for university students, professionals, subject-matter experts, or anyone wishing to continue their education during this critical time. These learning opportunities were made accessible through the openSAP platform.\n\nAdditionally, customers, partners, and consultants can access live instructor-led training events in virtual SAP Live Class sessions; while SAP Live Access gives users a place to practice their skills and build experience in a live and fully supported SAP environment for free.\n\n## Ensuring Service and Support Continuity\n\nWe extended our off-site service delivery framework to provide services and the ability to run systems remotely at scale, and thereby eliminate the need for travel. Additionally, we activated business continuity plans so that we could deliver support from our home offices.\n\n## Investment in R&D\n\nSAP's strong commitment to R&D is reflected in our expenditures (see graphic below).\n\n## \u20ac millions | change since previous\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, our IFRS R&D ratio, reflecting R&D expenses as a portion of total operating expenses, increased by 2.9 percentage points (pp) to 21.5% (2019: 18.6%). Our non-IFRS R&D ratio increased by 2.0pp to 21.8% year over year (2019: 19.8%). At the end of 2020, our total full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount in development work was 29,580 (2019: 27,634). Measured in FTEs, our R&D headcount was 29% of total headcount (2019: 28%).\n\nTotal R&D expense not only includes our own personnel costs but also the external costs of work and services from the providers and cooperation partners we work with to deliver and enhance our products. We also incur external costs for the following:\n\n- -Translating, localizing, and testing products\n- -Obtaining certification for products in different markets\n- -Patent attorney services and fees\n- -Consulting related to our product strategy\n- -Professional development of our R&D workforce\n\n## Patents\n\nSAP actively seeks intellectual property protection for innovations and proprietary information. Our software innovations continue to strengthen our market position as a leader in business solutions and services. Our investment in R&D has resulted in numerous patents. As at December 31, 2020, SAP held a total of more than 10,931 validated patents worldwide. Of these, 897 were granted and validated in 2020.\n\nWhile our intellectual property is important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not dependent on any particular patent or a combination of patents.",

Our customers need to know that our goal is to keep their data safe, process it in a manner that complies with local legislation, and protect it from malicious use. For this reason, cybersecurity and security, as well as data protection and privacy, are of paramount importance to us.\n\n## SAP Global Security\n\nCloud solutions and services are increasingly important to many companies' daily operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that digital solutions are critical to business resilience and accordingly, it is accelerating digital transformation. Cybersecurity today is even more critical to IT security professionals and business leaders, particularly for those enterprises that have moved their core processes to the cloud.\n\nThe SAP strategy is based on helping customers transform into intelligent enterprises. Our SAP Global Security (SGS) organization supports this journey by aligning people, procedures, and technology to protect business processes and data, limiting risk and promoting regulatory compliance. The security team embraces and promotes a security-minded culture that embeds security in our development and deployment processes and to help secure digital transformation.\n\nSGS supports key stakeholders in our lines of business (LoBs), IT, and the presales organization in securing solutions and driving operational excellence for security across the enterprise. To protect the organization's data and assets, SGS regularly reviews and adapts our security policies, standards, and frameworks to ensure high-quality risk management and reporting.\n\n## Data Protection\n\nAs part of our global product and services portfolio, SAP aims to protect the rights of individuals involved and meet relevant local requirements when processing personal data. In addition, we strive to strengthen SAP's reputation in the long term as a sustainable and trustworthy partner in the market. We have implemented safeguards to help protect the fundamental rights of everyone whose data is processed by SAP, whether they are customers, suppliers, partners, prospects, employees, or applicants.\n\nWe develop and pursue our global data protection and privacy strategy in accordance with our business strategy. The global data protection and privacy strategy is to constantly monitor the global regulatory data protection compliance landscape, identify relevant stakeholders, and enable them to take necessary measures for their adoption. It is also designed to safeguard the processing of personal data. The strategy consists of four pillars to help meet compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. These pillars comprise the global data protection and privacy policy; mandatory global data protection and privacy training for employees; global data protection and privacy coordinator network; and the global\n\ndata protection management system - and are all designed to ensure that we comply with applicable data protection laws.\n\n## Due Diligence for Security Topics\n\n## Governance\n\nSGS is led by a chief security officer who reports directly to the SAP CEO. SGS divisions are responsible for areas such as product and application security, cyberdefense, operational security risk management, executive protection, physical security, and a Trust Office that supports customers and partners with security-related issues.\n\nThe SAP Security Governance Model ensures executive engagement and facilitates shared responsibility in semiannual SAP Security Advisory Board and monthly Security Council meetings, as well as in biweekly updates to the Executive Board.\n\nOur commitment to customers is to be open and transparent about security vulnerabilities. To ensure this, we work with several external stakeholder groups including SAP user groups for the Americas and German-speaking countries.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe purpose of the SAP Global Security Policy is to provide governance and structure for an appropriate and effective level of information security within SAP and its affiliated businesses. Aligned with the overall SAP corporate strategy and vision, it sets the strategic goals and objectives for SAP security.\n\nThis policy, under the responsibility of the chief security officer, provides high-level requirements for numerous security domains including, but not limited to, access control, physical security, network security management, incident response, and acceptable use, while elaborating management intent, expectations, and strategic goals for maintaining high levels of security. It is applicable to, and mandatory for, all SAP employees and our contractors and consultants, as well as external parties that are granted access to SAP information and information assets. SAP reviews the SAP Global Security Policy annually and enacts modifications as deemed appropriate and required to protect SAP, our own, and our customers' data and assets, as new threats, vulnerabilities, or changes to the risk profile are identified.\n\nAll SAP employees are required to make themselves familiar with and apply this internal policy. The SAP Security Policy Framework consists of several levels of security documents supporting the requirements set forth in the policy. In addition, the different LoBs at SAP may have supporting policies, standards, procedures, and practices.",

        "page_content": "## Due Diligence for Data Protection Topics\n\n## Governance\n\nWithin the scope of his responsibilities, our global data protection officer (DPO) monitors the compliance of all activities involving the processing of personal data. The DPO reports to the SAP CFO. Within the Executive Board, the SAP CFO is responsible for compliance and enforcement of data protection and privacy. The DPO owns the SAP Global Data Protection and Privacy Policy that addresses SAP's data protection governance, and regularly informs the SAP CFO about the status of data protection compliance in the SAP Group.\n\nTo meet and ensure consistent security and data protection compliance, SAP has implemented a formal governance model that assigns clear responsibilities across the SAP Group. Upon request, the DPO attends steering committee meetings and reports on matters relevant to data protection to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of SAP.\n\nSAP has established a global network of data protection and privacy coordinators (DPPCs) across all SAP Group entities that process personal data ('DPPC network'). This DPPC network is designed to ensure data protection and privacy compliance on a local level. Local data protection and privacy coordinators increase awareness by conducting local training. Where new data protection laws evolve, they help the Data Protection and Privacy team (DPP) acting on behalf of the DPO identify and analyze them. If this requires compliance activities, they align with the affected LoBs of businesses and help drive the relevant implementation. Additional regional DPPCs further support and monitor changes to applicable laws. The DPPC network regularly engages with SAP's government relations team to represent SAP's interests in the legislative process. In this regard, SAP is participating in external working groups to help align industry-specific interests with respective governments.\n\nGlobal data protection and privacy training is conducted globally every two years and mandatory for all SAP employees. This training helps our workforce handle personal data with due care and in accordance with the law and to maintain compliance with data protection requirements during their work.\n\nSAP has implemented a data protection management system (DPMS) over our entire organization. The DPMS is set according to the generally recognized standard for data protection management systems as defined in the British Standard BS 10012, which comprises the data protection requirements of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since version 10012:2017. It covers almost all LoBs (excluding Qualtrics) and is planned to be implemented in all acquired companies as well. The DPMS is designed as a framework covering all aspects of data protection compliance of SAP organizations and employees. It is used as SAP standard methodology to ensure compliance with data protection legislation. The maintenance of the framework is subject to a certification from the British Standards Institution that confirms data protection compliance annually.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe SAP Global Data Protection and Privacy Policy outlines a group-wide minimum standard for data protection-compliant processing of personal data. It defines requirements for business processes that involve personal data and assigns clear\n\nresponsibilities. The principles established by this policy take into account the requirements of the EU GDPR. They apply generally and globally to all SAP Group affiliates. Additional data protection and privacy requirements, if applicable, are adopted on a local level as necessary. We actively monitor changes to applicable laws and regulations so that we can update our standards on an ongoing basis as necessary to meet data protection compliance. The policy was last updated in 2019.\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\n## Security\n\nCompliance processes at SAP adhere to trust-service criteria established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Security compliance audits are conducted by independent, external auditing body partners. Our security, availability, privacy, confidentiality, and processing integrity controls are designed to achieve these control objectives.\n\nSAP discloses vulnerabilities on the second Tuesday of every month ('Patch Day'). This disclosure mechanism provides customers with authoritative, public information about SAP software vulnerabilities from SAP that can be integrated with their existing risk management processes and tools.\n\nSAP strives to reduce risk by continuously improving our processes for detecting and remediating attacks and vulnerabilities. To improve our processes, we:\n\n- -Engage in approximately 130 internal and external audits across SAP globally\n- -Monitor and support our cloud and IT units with 1,700 controls that are audited and tested for design and operating effectiveness\n- -Offer service organization control (SOC) reports - such as SOC 1 Type II/ISAE 3402 and SOC 2 Type II/ISAE 3000 - to provide insights into the design and operating effectiveness of internal control systems implemented within cloud delivery units\n- -Let external, internationally accredited auditors assess and certify our cloud services according to various reporting standards and ISO certifications, such as 9001, 27001, 27017, 27018, and 22301, in addition to BS 10012\n- -In the first half of 2020, we identified that some of our cloud products did not meet one or more contractually agreed or statutory IT security standards. All identified gaps were resolved by July 2020. For more information, see the Risk Management and Risks section, specifically the Operational Business Risks subsection.\n- -In addition, some SAP cloud services also comply with regional or industry-specific standards, for example:\n- \u25aa Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalogue (C5) from the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI); BSI C5\n- \u25aa Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX)\n- \u25aa GxP Compliance (via SOC2 Plus)\n- \u25aa Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)\n- \u25aa Federal Service for Technical and Export Control - FSTEC (Russia); Cybersecurity Criteria Protection Scheme - CCPS (China)",

        "page_content": "## Data Protection\n\nTo help ensure necessary knowledge about data protection, the global data protection and privacy training is mandatory for all SAP employees globally. The latest training was rolled out in 2019.\n\nWe monitor compliance of data protection-relevant procedures across SAP. We maintain a record of processing activities ('procedure enrollment tool'), in which procedures that process personal data must be documented. The record entries contain general information about the procedure according to defined criteria necessary to meet proper documentation. The record entries are reportable and regularly reviewed.\n\nWe also track the quality of our data protection compliance level based on the annual recertification of our DPMS by the British Standards Institution. SAP has been audited by the BSI annually and rewarded with certifications according to BS 10012 since 2011. The recent certification is valid until 2022.\n\nSAP's own quality standards and international regulations require careful selection and monitoring of subprocessors processing personal data on behalf of SAP and SAP customers. With the goal that all subprocessors meet protection and security requirements for the processing of personal data, SAP has implemented a subprocessor verification process. All of SAP's subprocessors (for example, suppliers, vendors, and partners) are subject to this process. The process comprises of three main\n\ncompliance criteria for data protection-relevant subprocessors: (i) contractual compliance; (ii) self-assessments based on questionnaire; and (iii) remote and/or on-site audits.\n\nSAP respects the rights of the data subjects to obtain information as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed. All necessary information is made available to the data subjects within the framework of the privacy statements on the respective SAP Web sites.\n\nIn 2020, SAP experienced no significant incidents in processing personal data - on our own behalf or on behalf of our customers that were subject to GDPR only and were reported to the competent authorities.\n\n## Related Risks for SAP\n\nFor related risks, see the Risk Management and Risks section, specifically the Cybersecurity and Security and Data Protection and Privacy subsections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Scope\n\nThe content of this section was not subject to the statutory audit of our combined group management report.

This move enables customer-facing groups to work more closely in unison, providing the foundation for SAP to deliver on the value and experience customers require to be successful. Additionally, we have introduced our new operating model , which aligns sales, services, and customer engagement activities for a seamless experience across customer interactions. Over the next three years, we will roll out this operating model with the aim of improving customers' adoption and consumption of our solutions and ultimately their business outcomes.\n\nThe year 2020 also brought a new challenge, with the world facing the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to strain the global economy. Throughout this unprecedented situation, SAP continues to provide our customers with support, reviewing their requirements and providing solutions where appropriate. Further, SAP has expanded our use of virtual customer-engagement tools to adapt to the impact of pandemic-related lockdowns and travel restrictions. To provide our customers with quick time-to-value, we rolled out Project Amplify , with over 30 solutions that aim to more quickly solve specific business challenges and to help ensure business continuity. These solutions enable customers to leverage existing SAP investments or get started quickly using SAP solutions with minimal upfront commitments.\n\n## Building Programs to Facilitate Customer Feedback\n\nSAP has implemented numerous global initiatives to ensure our focus on customers remains paramount. This includes improvements in the way we work with and care for our customers, taking measures to provide a consistent, end-to-end experience.\n\nSAP implements improvements based on the feedback we get from customer surveys, which we conduct using Qualtrics solutions. We have also launched a number of new tools to support the customer journey, including SAP Road Map Explorer , an interactive tool outlining SAP's future product portfolio. Additionally, we created a digital portal SAP for Me as a single source of information for interactions with SAP.\n\nOur Insights to Action program continues to look in detail at customers' sentiment and informs how we can improve both account management, as well as our solutions and services. We have extended this program by launching an engagement process spanning regions, solutions, and services, enabling a holistic approach to how we operate as an organization, develop solutions, and support our customers. In this way, we can measure, manage, and improve the value and experience our customers - across regions and industries, and regardless of company size - derive from their relationship with SAP.\n\nThrough a focus on empathy, we aim to be a company that listens and responds to its customers. We want customers to experience an SAP that is continuously improving. Through this\n\napproach, we aim to improve customer loyalty, as measured by the Customer Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS).\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\nWe use the Customer NPS as one feedback mechanism to measure customer loyalty. This allows us to directly understand what our customers are thinking and identify key pain points for action. Because of the importance of customers to SAP, Customer NPS is one of our main KPIs.\n\nIn 2020, our Customer NPS increased 10 points year over year to 4 (2019: -6), strongly exceeding our target of -3 to -1. Using Qualtrics technology has enabled us to listen more closely to our customers and take action on the things that matter to them.\n\nWe aim to continue to increase our Customer NPS to a range of 5 to 10 points in 2021. Further, we aim to increase the score steadily in the medium term.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Customer NPS has been included as a KPI in Executive Board remuneration as part of the short-term incentive component. For more information about executive compensation, see the Compensation Report section. For more information about the Customer NPS, see the Performance Management System section.",

By ensuring a highly engaged, diverse workforce equipped with the right skills, SAP aims at attracting the best talent, building great products, and winning the hearts of our customers.\n\nInterlocked with our product and customer-related strategies, our people strategy is centered along the employee journey and lived experience. It introduces seven strategic pillars, three of them covering the employee journey and experience of each individual, the other four building the people and organizational foundation. The strategy describes how we build the cultural elements across our organization with all seven pillars contributing to our business strategy and value generation.\n\n## Our People Strategy with Seven Strategic Pillars\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Due Diligence\n\n## Governance\n\nUntil the end of May 2020, our Human Resources (HR) Board area was led by Stefan Ries, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and member of the Executive Board of SAP. After his departure, SAP CEO Christian Klein assumed responsibility as interim CHRO. Since January 1, 2021, Sabine Bendiek has served as Chief People Officer and Labor Relations Director and has led the HR organization.\n\nOur HR organization comprises HR Business Partner organizations for each Board area and region as well as the following functional areas: COO HR, HR Global Service Delivery, People Sustainability (including Diversity & Inclusion as well as Global Health and Well-Being Management teams), Talent Attraction, ONE SAP Learning, and Total Rewards.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nSAP is committed to ensuring a fair and equal treatment of all employees in a sustainable manner. For that reason, we established comprehensive policies that guide us in our daily business. Examples are our Global Anti-Discrimination Policy and Global Health & Safety Policy .\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\nThe success of our people strategy is measured by seven KPIs. Five out of the seven KPIs are from our redesigned engagement survey program '#Unfiltered .' With #Unfiltered, we strengthen our approach to continuously listen, understand, and act on the feedback of our employees. In 2020, we switched from an annual engagement measurement to gauging engagement multiple times throughout the year. The last data collection was in September 2020.\n\nThe Employee Engagement Index increased to 86% (+3pp compared to 2019) and reached the upper end of our target range. For 2020 through 2023, our ambition is to keep the Employee Engagement score between 84% and 86%. Leadership Trust Net Promoter Score increased to 62 in 2020 (2019: 59). For more information about the measurement of leadership trust, see the Performance Management System section. During 2020, we focused again on innovation and process simplification. Our Innovation Index was last measured in the annual employee survey in 2019 and thus remains at 79%. Simplification of Processes decreased by 6pp compared to 2019 to 58%. We also measure the progress of the individual and organizational health through the Business Health Culture Index (BHCI). In 2020, the BHCI was 80% (2019: 80%) and remains at the upper end of our target range. For 2020 through 2023, our ambition is a BHCI between 78% and 80%.\n\nIn addition, we measured a Retention Rate of 95.3% (2019: 93.3%). We define retention as the ratio of the average number of employees minus employees who voluntarily departed",

For 2020 through 2022, our ambition remains to increase the rate of women in management to 30%.\n\n## Our Key People-Related KPIs at a Glance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBelow is an overview of how we put the seven pillars of our people strategy and overall KPIs into practice.\n\n## Attracting, Hiring, and Onboarding the Best Talent\n\nTalent is becoming increasingly scarce. Our unique employer value proposition is key for us to attract people with the right fit.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our hiring activities have been impacted, resulting in a lower number of hirings. While 2020 remained a unique year, we were still able to build a highly inclusive workforce across various demographic aspects (generations, gender, and so on). Overall, we externally hired 8,486 (2019: 12,833) employees, thereof 29.4% (2019: 21.4%) are considered ' Early\n\nTalents ' (defined as new hires with 0-2 years of post-graduate nonprofessional experience) and 35.5% (2019: 37.5%) are women.\n\nWe continue to be successful in positioning SAP as a talent magnet. SAP has earned 125 employer awards, notably the 100 Best Companies by Fortune and Forbes Best Workplaces for Women for SAP America.\n\nTo position SAP for future talent, we work closely with approximately 3,200 universities on events, executive lectures, office visits, competitions, student club sponsorships, and workshops to recruit top students and graduates. In 2020, more than 1,000 students were enrolled in SAP's vocational training program (in Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States). The conversion rate (number of students who stayed with SAP after completing their dual studies) for vocational training students was 67% in 2020 (2019: 71%).\n\nWe are passionate about developing deep and lasting relationships with all our employees. The average tenure with SAP remains at the same high level (2020: 7.6 years; 2019: 7.3 years).\n\nEven when employees leave SAP, it is important that we stay connected. Our SAP Alumni Network offers a program to reconnect with former colleagues and to unleash the power of a trusted network for the benefit of SAP and our ecosystem. In 2020, our alumni community included 9,096 former and 4,082 current SAP employees.\n\n## Growing Talent and Building Skills of Tomorrow\n\nSAP expects a shift from skills that will cease to exist and new capabilities that will be needed in the future. This requires that we establish an adaptive workforce management approach that focuses on continuous skill transformation to ensure our people become equipped for future work requirements. Our career and growth framework helps employees discover who they are, identify the areas where they want to grow, and develop an action plan to get there.\n\nAt SAP, learning mainly happens on the job - through interactions with colleagues and formal learning activities. Selfpaced online programs, plus training courses for technical and soft skills, are open to all employees. Our peer-to-peer learning portfolio encompasses coaching, mentoring, job shadowing, and facilitation opportunities. In 2020, we provided 1,007,464 courses (excluding compliance training) to 81% of our employees.\n\n## Building Next-Generation Performance Management\n\nOur next-generation performance management establishes a high-performance culture, linking business goals to impact of individuals and teams with development opportunities and meaningful reward packages. Smart and transparent goal-setting approaches and continuous review processes, as well as equitable, competitive, and differentiated compensation structures, are a necessary foundation to drive high performance.\n\nDuring 2020, we continued with our performance appraisal approach called SAP Talk - a continuous, needs-driven, and flexible dialogue between employees and managers.\n\nMove SAP and Own SAP are exemplary components of our reward offerings: Move SAP is our long-term incentive plan that rewards employees who provide a significant impact to business success. In addition, 76% of our employees overall participated in our global share purchase plan Own SAP , with an investment of 5,451,242 shares in 2020.

We added three new leadership behaviors to the established five behaviors: Unlock potential, explore possibilities, and make it happen together. These relaunched ' How We Run and Lead ' behaviors ensure cultural consistency and clarity for leaders and employees.\n\nWe offer a career path for experts in parallel to our management development track. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we provided a virtual version of our flagship leadership program , enabling our leaders to achieve better results and foster innovation. By the end of 2020, 5,170 SAP people managers (51%) and 4,283 SAP experts (17.4%) had completed it.\n\n## Pursuing an Agile, Entrepreneurial, and Innovative Organization\n\nOur environment is changing at an increasing pace and the needs of our customers are shifting quickly. To deliver our business ambitions in this environment, SAP needs to evolve into a selforganized, agile organization fostering a culture of innovation. One initiative to achieve this is called ' Unlearning Hierarchy .' We support our teams and organizations in experimenting with selforganization including different pioneers across all Board areas at SAP. Furthermore, our ' New Work Movement ' community has over 2,400 members.\n\nIn addition, and in support of our entrepreneurial journey, SAP.iO Venture Studio helps us identify high-potential entrepreneurial employees at SAP and develop them into successful leaders, with the objective of building new ventures that will have a positive impact on business and society. In 2020, SAP.iO Venture Studio engaged more than 5,566 employees and was able to jump-start close to 535 venture ideas.\n\nAnother initiative to foster innovation is the prestigious Hasso Plattner Founders' Award . It provides the highest internal employee recognition at SAP, based on the three categories Customer Success (CS), Operational Excellence (OE), and Products and Technology (P&T). For 2020, the awards went to 'Intelligent Case Routing' (CS), 'Monitor of Monitors' (OE), and 'Hidden Champion' (P&T). Winners were chosen from 220 nominations and with a total of 1,339 employees participating from 37 countries.\n\n## Striving for Inclusion and Reflecting the Diversity of Society\n\nAs a global organization with employees from over 150 nationalities, our aspiration is that SAP's workforce mirrors the diversity in society that includes gender parity and demographics of all of the regions where we have employees. In 2020, we focused on inclusive career journeys to attract and retain the best diverse talent, as well as inclusive culture to build inclusive processes and encourage inclusive behaviors.\n\nGender inclusion, advancement, and equality : Currently, SAP's representation of women in the overall workforce is 33.6%, with the representation of women in management roles at 27.5%. One example confirming our ambition of gender inclusion and equality\n\nwas the selection of SAP for the first time in the Bloomberg GenderEquality Index in 2019 and again in 2020.\n\nAutism inclusion : The Autism at Work Program and Autism Inclusion Network support and engage with a workforce that includes over 180 autistic colleagues across 34 locations in 16 countries. The SAP Autism Inclusion Pledge extends SAP's autism inclusion endeavors by sharing what we have learned with our customer and partner ecosystem.\n\nRace and ethnicity : Back in 2016, SAP identified challenges with underrepresentation of Black, African American, Latinx, and Native American employees in the workforce. We created reporting to track progress toward better representation in accordance with required regulations in different countries and in line with our diversity and inclusion objectives. In 2020, SAP took a stand against racism to drive change inside and outside of our organization to promote social justice and equality. Among many efforts across the globe, this included the establishment of a new goal to double the share of Black and African American employees in the workforce in the United States within the next three years.\n\nLGBTQ+ inclusion : SAP was among the first supporters of the United Nations Global LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business and has been recognized by organizations including Human Rights Campaign, Stonewall, and Workplace Pride for our inclusion efforts.\n\nIn addition, SAP supports numerous global Employee Network Groups that offer activities and events from which SAP can help attract and retain people from diverse backgrounds.\n\n## Caring for the Health and Well-Being of Our People\n\nSAP fosters a culture that empowers people to run at their best supported by providing innovative health and well-being programs and solutions. When people are healthy, respected, and cared for, it results in higher productivity, engagement, innovation, and customer satisfaction.\n\nIn 2020, COVID-19 was the dominant topic. As early as January 2020, SAP installed a cross-Board area Global Pandemic Taskforce to establish and coordinate countermeasures around the globe. Frequent pulse checks help us understand how employees experience their individual situation and allow us to adjust our crisis management accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, SAP is committed to a no stigma, inclusive culture that supports maintaining the mental health of our employees by prevention, early detection, case management support, and reintegration. The ' Are You OK? Mental Health Initiative ' helps counteract the increase of mental distress due to pandemic-related life challenges. It supports employees in fostering good mental health and in tackling mental health issues by supporting open dialogue inside and outside of SAP.\n\n## Pushing Operational Excellence and Showcasing Human Experience Management to Customers\n\nDelivering engaging experiences for SAP's customers starts with our own workforce. A continued emphasis on operational excellence and experience management are key for delivering on our human experience management (HXM) solutions and services efficiently, with both empathy and compliance.\n\nSAP runs SAP SuccessFactors solutions as the global software to manage our people data. Additionally, the adoption of Qualtrics solutions enables us to understand ways to improve the experience",

Such data insights are the fuel to leverage intelligent technologies such as SAP Conversational AI services in our SAP Careers site and in our internal HR chatbot to provide instant responses to HR-related questions around the clock.\n\n## Related Risks for SAP\n\nFor more information on employee-related risks, see the Risk Management and Risks section in the Human Capital Risks subsection.\n\n## Headcount and Personnel Expense\n\nThe year 2020 was overshadowed by COVID-19 and the pandemic has affected our headcount development as well, resulting in a lower number of hirings. As at December 31, 2020, we employed 102,430 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees worldwide (2019: 100,330). This represents an increase in headcount of 2,100 FTEs (781 thereof from acquisitions) in comparison to 2019. The average number of employees in 2020 was 101,476 (2019: 99,157).\n\nWe define headcount in FTE as the number of people on permanent employment contracts considering their staffing percentage. Students, individuals employed by SAP currently not working for reasons such as maternity leave, and temporary employees on limited contracts of less than six months, are excluded from our figures. The number of temporary employees is not material.\n\nOur average personnel expense for each employee decreased to approximately \u20ac132,000 in 2020 (2019:approximately \u20ac150,000). This reduction is primarily attributable to a decrease of restructuring expenses and share-based payment expenses. The personnel expense for each employee is defined as the overall personnel expense divided by the average number of employees. In 2020, we had 1,037 restructuring-related terminations (1%) compared to 2,859 in 2019 (2.9%).\n\nFor more information about employee compensation and a breakdown of the components of personnel expense, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (B.1) and Note (B.2).\n\n## Social Investments\n\n## Vision and Strategy\n\nTechnology and innovation continue to rapidly change the competencies needed to succeed in today's digital world. Our global corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy is tackling this skills gap head on, putting SAP's purpose to help the world run better and improve people's lives into action through our mission: ' Powering Opportunity Through Digital Inclusion .' As such, our initiatives consider issues including access, adoption, and application of skills to ensure everyone can benefit from and participate in the digital economy. To achieve SAP's CSR mission, we focus on three strategic areas that foster socioeconomic stability and create opportunity for all people by:\n\n- -Building digital skills\n- -Accelerating best-run nonprofit organizations and social enterprises\n- -Connecting employees with purpose\n\nFor our CSR work to be both sustainable and successful, it is crucial to closely link the strategy that drives that work with our\n\nbusiness strategy. SAP's social engagement and philanthropic investment are understood and perceived as an essential part of our company success. In this way, we can ensure ongoing, long-term support and funding from executive management - particularly in times of economic downturn.\n\n## COVID-19 Response\n\nIn March 2020, SAP acted quickly to help combat the negative global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while also remaining committed to the CSR mission and strategic partners and programs. SAP established a COVID-19 emergency fund, managed by the SAP CSR team, totaling \u20ac3 million. As part of that response, \u20ac1 million were donated to the World Health Organization's COVID19 Solidarity Response Fund. SAP also supported local responses to urgent infrastructure requests and provided funding to our CSR partners that are smaller nonprofit organizations and social enterprises that experienced difficulties in serving their communities due to the pandemic and may struggle to survive financially. Therefore, it is important we continue offering support to our partners and to allow them to shift restricted funding for unrestricted use. We also offered support to help ensure the world's most vulnerable people, enterprises, and communities received the necessary resources to withstand the long-term impact of COVID19. This support included a donation to Acumen's Emergency Facility, which helped, in part, to fund 96 enterprises across 16 countries, serving low-income communities whose customers live on less than U.S.$6 a day.\n\n## Taking Action Towards Social Justice\n\nSAP is also doubling down on our commitment to serving those who are underrepresented in technology. Our nonprofit partners have always operated in this space. More than ever, we believe that quality education and economic opportunity are integral parts of an equal society. As an example, we are currently developing a pro bono offering in North America to specifically foster economic equity by supporting Black-owned businesses as well as creating a longer-term, digital skills-focused program with a focus on lifting up Black youth. Both projects will be launched in 2021. Due to COVID19 and racial unrest, SAP joined Global Citizen's Unite for Our Future campaign, which called on citizens, businesses, government, and the social sector to tackle the enormous injustices the world is facing. SAP has pledged our financial support alongside other global corporations to help end the pandemic, eliminate injustice, and fight for the world we want. Further examples of how we serve underrepresented communities can be found below at Pillar 1 Building Digital Skills.\n\n## Due Diligence\n\n## Governance\n\nOur head of global CSR leads the global SAP CSR team that is part of the Global Corporate Affairs organization in the Office of the CEO Board area. In addition, SAP has established a Global CSR Governance Committee and additional Regional CSR Governance Committees to advise and supervise the work of the Company's global and regional SAP CSR teams. Our Global CSR Governance Committee, consisting of executive-level representatives from different Board areas at SAP, advises and approves the strategic direction of our overall CSR mission. In addition, Regional CSR Governance Committees advise and approve all major CSR",

They articulate our strategic areas of focus, set the standards and policies under which we operate, and explain the different roles and responsibilities between global CSR, regional CSR, and line-of-business activities ('field donations'). The policy ensures lawful, compliant donations and good stewardship of SAP's social investment budget to create positive sustainable impact.\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\nWe measure the performance and impact of our CSR engagements and investments on a regular basis and report the following indicators for all our initiatives and regions. Every signature initiative also follows a logic model and develops a clear impact measurement framework as part of the initiative that includes:\n\n- -Number of employees engaged\n- -Number of (virtual) volunteering projects delivered\n- -Number of lives impacted\n- -Number of engagements with customers and partners\n- -Number of nonprofits and social enterprises enabled\n- -Number of employees on our engagement and donation platform SAP Together\n\nCOVID-19 created both significant challenges and opportunities for our CSR programs and partnerships, which led to signature initiatives transforming into virtual delivery models to reach partners and beneficiaries. At the same time, we significantly expanded cross-border virtual volunteering opportunities for employees. In 2020, SAP donated \u20ac24 million, impacting eight million lives.\n\n## Pillar 1 -Building Digital Skills\n\nIn 2020, digital skill-building and coding programs trained 117,000 teachers and engaged 2.3 million underserved people and youth, of which 53% were girls. SAP and UNICEF launched a three-year partnership at the UN General Assembly week in 2019, aimed at bringing together businesses, governments, civil society, and young people to develop scalable education models that will equip and empower young people with the 21st-century digital and life skills they need to find suitable work. Year one of the partnership was dedicated to curriculum development and digitalization of solutions, laying the groundwork for a scaled rollout that could impact 1.5 million young people across India, Turkey, and Vietnam. Africa Code Week was transformed into a completely virtual experience expanding our reach from 37 countries to 44 countries and focusing our efforts on enabling teachers using the Africa Code Week mobile app.\n\n## Pillar 2 -Accelerating Best-Run Nonprofit Organizations and Social Enterprises\n\nIn 2020, SAP built capacity for over 1,500 innovative nonprofit organizations and social enterprises through in-kind contributions of \u20ac0.9 million. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily paused the SAP Social Sabbatical for global, regional, and executive engagement programs. In its place, we successfully\n\npivoted our SAP Social Sabbatical for local engagement programs planned in Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada, to a virtual engagement model. In the Reimagining Health Systems\n\nChallenge , 12 SAP employees worked together with employees from three other companies to help digitalize Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving Medically Underserved Areas across the United States. In support of SAP's 5 & 5 by '25 initiative for social procurement, SAP CSR launched new partnerships with Social Traders (Australia) and Buy Social Canada (Canada), as well as a capacity-building partnership with MovingWorlds called the S-GRID (Sustainable Growth of Revenues for International Development) program, aiming to accelerate access for social enterprises to enter global value chains. SAP joined the COVID-19 Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs and supported the digital transformation for the inaugural Social Enterprise World Forum Digital event reaching 2,600 participants across 102 countries as its strategic global technology partner.\n\n## Pillar 3 -Connecting Employees with Purpose\n\nSAP Together, our new global employee engagement and donation platform provided by Benevity, Inc. has 34,155 employees registered. In 2020, the platform offered employees 246 virtual volunteering projects and nine missions with 73% of SAP's corporate volunteer hours globally skills-based. The virtual offerings allowed us to engage employees in a truly cross-border manner, for example, due to the virtual nature of Africa Code Week, for the first time in three years, 72 SAP employees from nine countries were able to engage directly by leading virtual sessions. This year's Month of Service has engaged 10,000 employees in over 50 virtual, live education, enablement, and awareness-building sessions focusing on four high-level purpose themes: Equality for All; Building a Digitally Inclusive Workforce; Cultivating Climate Action; and Promoting Inclusive, Diverse, and Social Entrepreneurship.\n\n## Related Risks for SAP\n\nNo relevant risks were identified through our framework which is detailed in the Risk Management Methodology and Reporting section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Scope\n\nNot all information in this section was part of the statuatory audit of our combined group management report by our external auditor KPMG.

In light of the aggravating climate change impacts and other intensifying global challenges, climate action has been put at the top of SAP's corporate sustainability agenda - which was also reconfirmed by the latest conducted materiality analysis.\n\nOur strategy to create positive impact and to address climate action is implemented through a dual approach: (1) SAP as enabler : We aim to provide products and services to our customers to reduce their carbon emissions and pave the way towards a low-carbon future together; and (2) SAP as exemplar : To live up to our corporate responsibility and to build climate resilience, we strive towards leading by example in SAP's business operations and practices by running our own operations more sustainably.\n\n## Due Diligence\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Executive Board sponsor for sustainability, including climate action, is the SAP CFO. Led by the chief sustainability officer, a dedicated sustainability team coordinates SAP's response to climate change (including assessing and managing climate-related risks through a quarterly risk review, setting reduction targets, quarterly measuring and monitoring of carbon emissions, and embedding sustainability-related initiatives across SAP). This happens in close cooperation with various other departments such as the global procurement organization that ensures purchasing energy-efficient, sustainable products and services. Global facility management designs and operates our facilities based on robust environmental standards such as ISO 14001. Global cloud services optimize the energy consumption in our data centers, while SAP's IT operations personnel is committed to responsible usage of IT equipment and business software.\n\nTo be able to innovate and embed sustainability further, we regularly engage internally with our sustainability council and externally with various stakeholder groups such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), nonprofit organizations (NPOs), and academia. This notably includes an external sustainability advisory panel comprised of expert representatives from our customers, investors, partners, NGOs, and academia.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nOur global environmental policy provides the core framework for how we manage our environmental impact - in our own operations and with our customers. Last updated in May 2019 and approved by\n\nthe CFO, this policy guides our efforts to reduce our ecological footprint, provide environmental performance transparency, and demonstrate sustainable leadership through transformational strategies. In addition, it helps us to comply with internationally recognized sustainability standards as well as stakeholder expectations, primarily those of customers, investor, and employees.\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\n## Our Targets\n\nIn 2017, we set our leading environmental target of making our operations carbon neutral by 2025. This target refers to our total net carbon emissions, which are calculated by deducting purchased renewable energy certificates, self-generated renewable energy, and carbon offsets from our gross carbon emissions in the respective reporting period. Our carbon neutral target includes all direct and indirect emissions from running our business (Scope 1 and Scope 2) 3 as well as a selected subset of indirect emissions from our value chain (Scope 3). 4 This objective is key to reducing SAP's own environmental footprint and to combatting climate change - one important step towards contributing to SAP's overarching purpose.\n\nTo achieve our carbon neutral target and to track its progress, we have derived annual targets for our internal operational steering. Since the beginning of 2020, these annual targets have been firmly integrated in the Executive Board's short-term performance-based compensation.\n\nSince 2017, we have complied with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are committed to reducing emissions by 85% by 2050 compared to the base-year level 2016, including emissions of our products in use at our customers. This target reflects the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5\u00b0C compared to preindustrial temperatures. This has been confirmed by the SBTi in a target reassessment in 2019.\n\n## Performance and Measures to Progress\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant decrease in our 2020 carbon emissions due to a reduction in carbon-intensive business activities, in particular, business flights. Even though our employee headcount increased by 2.1%, our carbon emissions dropped to 135 kilotons (kt) (2019: 300 kt). That remains 10% below our latest target of 150 kt as updated in October 2020 to reflect the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SAP's business results (original target for 2020: 238 kt).\n\nTo consider the impact of COVID-19 on our carbon emissions, to uphold our role model position in sustainability, and to maintain our ambition level, we decided to revise and accelerate our carbon",

As a result, our focus on climate action has contributed to a cumulative cost avoidance of \u20ac354.3 million in the past three years. We achieved 92% of this cost avoidance in 2020.\n\nTo become carbon neutral even in times of ongoing growth in our business, we continue to drive our three-pillar strategy of 'avoid reduce - compensate.' In 2020, key initiatives following this approach included:\n\n## Facilities, Data Centers and Renewable Electricity\n\nTo help reach SAP's ambition to continuously increase sustainability in its own operations, we implemented an environmental management system (EMS) at 55 sites in 30 countries worldwide. The EMS is certified by the renowned ISO 14001:2015 standard and was successfully recertified in 2020.\n\nIts scope will be gradually increased from currently 75% to 100% of SAP's major company-owned sites in 2025. SAP's headquarters in Germany also implemented an effective energy management system. This system is ISO 50001:2018-certified and enables us to continuously improve our energy performance.\n\nAs more business moves to the cloud, data centers play an increasing key role in SAP providing solutions to our customers. Running solutions on SAP data centers and using hundreds of cloud solution transactions per day requires CPUs, memory, storage, and cooling, and therefore electricity - which ultimately results in carbon emissions. This is why our internal data centers have become a primary focus of our carbon reduction efforts. The term 'data center' refers to both SAP-owned and external data centers (colocation data centers and hyperscalers).\n\nWe have introduced initiatives to drive efficiency and innovation with respect to our buildings, data center operations, and infrastructure (such as replacement of the old, uninterruptible power supply system in the data centers in St. Leon-Rot, Germany). At our SAP headquarters in Germany and North America, we operate our own data centers with an efficient power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.41. The PUE is a ratio that describes the efficiency of a data center, with 1.0 being the ideal.\n\nIn 2014, SAP strengthened the integration of our environmental strategy into our business strategy by creating a ' green cloud ' powered by 100% renewable electricity - one major step towards achieving carbon neutrality and upholding our commitment towards the RE100 initiative.\n\nWe realize our green cloud by using two strategic levers: On the one hand, by investing in very high-quality, EKOenergy-certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) to foster renewable energy generation; and on the other hand, by producing renewable electricity in selective SAP locations worldwide through solar panels (in Palo Alto, CA, in the United States, and in Bangalore, India). This allows us to compensate all of our facility and data center emissions (2020: 198 kt). This is why customers can significantly reduce their carbon emissions (Scope 3) by using our green cloud solutions and services.\n\n## Total Data Center Electricity\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable Solutions and Products in Use\n\nThe vast majority of our overall carbon emissions result from the use of our software. To address this, we have developed a downstream emissions strategy to help our customers, hardware providers, and others run greener operations. One of the most important ways we help our customers reduce their energy usage and emissions is by managing their SAP systems through cloud services provided by our carbon-neutral green cloud offerings. In addition, the solutions in our portfolio, such as SAP Environment,\n\nHealth, and Safety Management or SAP Product Carbon Footprint Analytics , the first application in the Climate 21 program, enable our customers to manage their greenhouse gas footprint and resources, such as electricity, more efficiently.\n\nSAP also works with customers to optimize their on-premise landscapes so that they consume less energy. We achieve this by helping them decommission legacy systems, archive unused data, consolidate business applications, and virtualize their system landscape.\n\n## Corporate Cars and Commuting\n\nConsumption of fuel for our company cars remains the single greatest contributor to our direct emissions (Scope 1). To counteract this emission source, we continue to power all electric company cars with 100% renewable electricity, and we set the objective to have one-third of our car fleet consist of ecofriendly company cars, such as electric or fuel cell cars, by 2025. Our target to increase the number of electric vehicles (battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) to 20% by the end of 2020 was not achieved (2020: 16%) due to the lagging appeal of electric vehicles in light of an insufficient public charging infrastructure, long delivery times, and a lack of models. To reach our 2025 e-mobility target, we aim to continue and strengthen our incentive offers for our employees such as:\n\n- -In Germany, we offer employees a battery subsidy that partially offsets the higher costs of an electric vehicle, and a subsidy to install a charging point at home (outlook 2021: SAP plans to set up a program to reimburse electricity for charging at home).\n- -Continuous expansion of the SAP charging infrastructure (2020: over 900 charging stations; 2019: 750 charging stations). To generate a shift in alternative commuting habits, we continue\n\nto offer a company bike program in Germany, where employees can lease bicycles with the option of purchasing them after three years. In 2020, we piloted a mobility budget approach in Berlin to foster inter-/multimodal mobility. A pilot group of employees received a monthly fixed mobility budget at their free disposal to use any mode of transport to commute to work or in their leisure time (bike, escooter, rental car, train, bus, and so on).\n\n## Carbon Offsets\n\nTo offset a share of our Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions that cannot yet be avoided, we invest in different offset schemes to compensate for these emissions (2020: 79 kt):\n\n- -A key part of SAP's compensation strategy is the long-term investment in the Livelihoods Carbon Funds (LCF) and their high-quality carbon credits. The funds have financed muchneeded climate action and sustainable development in developing countries through ecosystem restoration, agroforestry, biodiversity preservation, and clean energy projects. This has generated high-quality carbon offsets certified by the\n\nmost trusted and demanding standards (such as the Gold Standard) and improved people's lives. SAP recently committed \u20ac3 million to the third LFC and will invest an additional \u20ac632,000 in the first LCF. In 2020, the carbon credits we received for our financial contribution to the LCF helped us offset 41.5 kt of our emissions, the majority of which was used to compensate for our business flights.\n\n- -In addition to avoiding business flights by investing in virtual collaboration and communication technologies, we charge an internal carbon price for business flights in the majority of countries we travel from, to counterbalance the carbon emissions caused. Since 2015, we invest the collected internal air travel fees in high-quality carbon offsets (such as the Gold Standard) to support climate projects worldwide and compensate the adverse impact of necessary business flights. As a result, this measure has tangibly impacted our progress towards achieving our emission goals.\n- -For employees who own a so-called climate neutral fuel card for their company car, SAP pays an additional fee per liter fuel purchased, which is then invested in Gold Standard-certified compensation projects or equivalent high quality standards (2020: 2.4 kt).\n\nThe investments in sustainable projects are equivalent to a certain amount of carbon reductions.\n\nFurthermore, SAP pledged in 2018 to plant five million trees by 2025, as forests and their natural ability to capture and store carbon emissions play an important role in mitigating climate change. In 2020, we enabled the planting of almost 1.7 million trees worldwide as part of our carbon offsetting and donation initiatives (including SAP's holiday-related donation to three projects in the Eden Reforestation Projects program).\n\n## Related Risks for SAP\n\nWe have analyzed climate change risks and their potential impact on our largest office buildings, major data centers, and SAP's workforce. Risk drivers were chosen based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports AR5 and SR15 (that is, rising sea levels, temperature extremes, and tropical storms). The risk assessment was performed in accordance with the SAP Global Risk Management Policy as outlined in the Risk Management and Risks section. As part of our last analysis in 2019, no relevant risks have been identified potentially impacting our business operations, revenue, or expenditure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Scope\n\nThe content of this section was not subject to the statutory audit of our combined group management report.

It then rebounded strongly in the third quarter and continued growth in the fourth. That is how the European Central Bank (ECB) summarizes the year in its December 2020 Economic Bulletin. 1 Advanced economies in particular deployed generous policy support at the peak of the pandemic to prop up private consumption, which allowed for the economic recovery in the third quarter. Emerging market economies, on the other hand, benefited from the resulting recovery in external demand, says the ECB.\n\nThe EMEA region suffered an unprecedented economic contraction in the second quarter, but the rebound in economic activity in the third quarter was stronger than expected, reports the ECB. This was the case particularly in the euro area, even though economic activity there remained well below pre-pandemic levels. However, the increase in infection rates and the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility significantly constrained the euro area economy again in the fourth quarter of 2020. Throughout the year, sectors performed unevenly, with the services sector more adversely affected than the industrial sector. In central and eastern Europe and Russia, real GDP rebounded in the third quarter when production normalized amid the easing of containment measures. Towards the end of the year, the ECB's indicators for those countries tightened and economic growth slowed again.\n\nIn the Americas region, reports the ECB, real GDP in the United States increased in the third quarter as well, driven by a strong recovery in consumption and investment, but did not reach prepandemic levels. However, the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and fading fiscal stimulus curbed development of the U.S. economy afterwards. Brazil opted to limit containment measures and instead featured strong monetary and fiscal support measures that were among the largest in Latin America. Thus, the economy rebounded from around the middle of the year, but the severity of the pandemic itself intensified further.\n\nAs for the Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) region, domestic and external demand temporarily supported economic recovery in Japan in the third quarter of 2020, yet the pace of expansion decelerated overall, says the ECB. The economic recovery in China, on the other hand, was swift and even broadened to the service sector. After a sharp rebound in the second quarter, China's GDP expanded at a moderate pace in the third and fourth quarter, driven by private investment and consumption. According to the ECB, China was the only large economy to record economic growth in 2020.\n\n## The IT Market\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the business landscape worldwide and accelerated the shift to digital, says International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.-based market research firm. 2 It was crucial for enterprises to drastically increase\n\ntheir resilience to overcome the disruptions. For this, it turned out to be vital that enterprises broaden their digital capabilities, innovate, and adjust operations and processes. 3 That is why, according to IDC, global spending on digital transformation technologies and services grew 10.4% in 2020 to $1.3 trillion, while overall IT spending declined 5.1% to $2.25 trillion. 3\n\nFaced with the need to accelerate their transformation, many enterprises had to shortcut their IT protocols to get digital solutions into place during the pandemic, reports IDC. 2 At the same time, this rapid innovation had to happen without incurring overall incremental costs. Therefore, while solving immediate problems, this approach created technical debt: infrastructure and systems became less robust, flexible, and scalable than IT solutions would be otherwise. At the end of 2020, it was already foreseeable that these interim solutions would need to be improved when the current pandemic situation had passed.\n\nHowever, it became abundantly clear in 2020 that developing a digital business at record speed does not work with traditional, linear processes starting and ending in an organization. Instead and especially in the long run - according to IDC 2 , digital businesses require a shift toward platform-based, data driven value chains. Applications and data stretching from edge to network and core, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning turned out to be crucial elements of digital transformation. For sustained success in these outstanding circumstances, enterprises need to combine historical data with data from enterprise systems and with global information, and connect that data with external partner ecosystems, describes IDC.\n\nIn this context, cloud turned out to be much more than an alternative IT purchasing model which buyers had all too often regarded it as before. Instead, in 2020, it was adopted by more and more businesses as both a technology platform and an operational model, reports IDC. 4 Cloud-centric operating models became integral components of many enterprises' IT environments: They facilitated flexibility and resilience in the face of the pandemic, delivered infrastructure, application, and data resources to edge locations, and allowed enterprises to react rapidly to customer and end-user demands.\n\nFurthermore, companies increasingly used their cloud settings to develop new apps in-house (over 42% of all new apps developed in 2020, according to IDC). 3 Many even found new business opportunities by commercializing the software they had developed internally to address problems resulting from the pandemic.\n\nSources:",

        "page_content": "## Impact on SAP\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was an accelerator for transformation. Customers were looking to move to the cloud faster, for greater resiliency and agility, and SAP responded, providing the technology and expertise to help its customers migrate their existing IT environments to the cloud and truly transform their businesses end-to-end. A promising development in the first and second quarter was overshadowed by the first noticeable impact of the pandemic on SAP's business performance in the third quarter. Yet performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter even as the COVID-19 situation persisted and lockdowns were reintroduced in many regions - with continued high demand for e-commerce, SAP Business Technology Platform, and Qualtrics solutions producing a strong finish to the year for SAP's cloud business. SAP also saw strong early acceptance of its new holistic business transformation offering RISE with SAP among pilot customers, contributing to the cloud performance in the fourth quarter.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SAP continued to serve its customers with an embedded virtual sales and remote implementation strategy. The Company continued with a disciplined approach to hiring and discretionary spend while capturing natural savings such as from lower travel, facility-related costs, and virtual instead of physical events. In combination with the strong topline performance, these actions drove higher operating profit (IFRS and non-IFRS at constant currencies) and operating margin despite the challenging macro environment.\n\n## Overall Financial Position\n\n## Executive Board's Assessment\n\n2020 was a uniquely challenging year for SAP. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SAP had to revise its outlook during the year. However, the financial performance of the Company developed better than expected. SAP exceeded its revised 2020 revenue targets and hit the high end of its operating profit target in its revised outlook.\n\nSAP also showed strong performance in non-financial metrics. Both the Customer Net Promoter Score and the Employee Engagement Index increased. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions decreased year over year.\n\nAssuming the COVID-19 pandemic will begin to recede as vaccine programs roll out globally, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the second half of 2021, we are confident that we will deliver on both our financial and non-financial outlook for 2021 and on our 2025 mid-term ambitions. SAP's expedited shift to the cloud will drive long-term, sustainable growth while significantly increasing the resiliency and predictability of our business.\n\n## Performance Against Our Outlook for 2020 (Non-IFRS)\n\nAs in previous years, our 2020 operating profit-related goals and published outlook were based on our non-IFRS financial measures at constant currencies. For this reason, in the following section we discuss performance against our outlook only in terms of non-IFRS numbers (at constant currencies) derived from IFRS measures. The subsequent section about IFRS operating results discusses numbers only in terms of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), so the numbers in that section are not expressly identified as IFRS numbers.\n\n## Outlook for 2020 (Non-IFRS)\n\nThe initial outlook for 2020, updated on April 21, 2020 (for more information, see the table ' Comparison of Outlook and Results for 2020 '), is based on the assumption that the difficult market environment, characterized by weak demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, would deteriorate into the second quarter before gradually improving in the third and fourth quarters as countries reopened their economies and lockdowns ended. In this context, we anticipated nonIFRS cloud revenue in a range of \u20ac8.3 billion to \u20ac8.7 billion, and cloud and software revenue in a range of \u20ac23.4 billion to \u20ac24.0 billion. We expected total revenue to range between \u20ac27.8 billion a nd \u20ac28.5 billion, with more predictable revenue anticipated to make up 72% of this result. Furthermore, we projected our full-year 2020 operating profit (non-IFRS) would end between \u20ac8.1 billion and \u20ac8.7 billion.\n\nIn July 2020, we adjusted our outlook for the effective tax rate (IFRS) to between 28.5% and 29.5% and for the effective tax rate (non-IFRS) to between 27.5% and 28.5%. The increase in comparison to the previous outlook mainly resulted from changes in taxes for prior years.\n\nIn our quarterly statement published on October 25, 2020, we revised our outlook again to reflect the restrictions that had been placed on public and economic life during the ongoing pandemic. Further, and for the same reasons, we no longer expected to see a significant recovery in SAP Concur revenues in the remaining months of the year.\n\nIn October 2020, we therefore adjusted our projection for cloud revenue downward to range between \u20ac8.0 billion and \u20ac8.2 billion, which represented a growth rate of 14% to 17% at constant currencies. In addition, the Company then anticipated cloud and software revenue of between \u20ac23.1 billion and \u20ac23.6 billion. This range represented a growth rate of 0% to 2%. We also expected total revenue of between \u20ac27 .2 billion to \u20ac27.8 billion, which represented a growth rate of -2% to 1% at constant currencies and assumed a share of more predictable revenue of 72%. We also set a target range of \u20ac8.1 billion to \u20ac8.5 billion for our operating profit, which represented a growth rate of -1% to 4% at constant currencies. We expected a full-year 2020 effective tax rate (IFRS) of 27.0% to 28.0% and an effective tax rate (non-IFRS) of 26.5% to 27.5%.",

New and existing customers nevertheless continued to show a strong willingness to digitally transform their business processes with SAP and thus emerge from the situation with success.\n\nOur current cloud backlog (contractually committed cloud revenue we expect to recognize over the upcoming 12 months) reached \u20ac7.61 billion at constant currencies (\u20ac7.15 billion at actual currencies; 2019: \u20ac6.68 billion). This was an increase of 14% on a constant currency basis.\n\nAt constant currencies, the resulting non-IFRS cloud revenue grew from \u20ac7.01 billion in 2019 to \u20ac8.24 billion in 2020 and therefore ended above our guidance range of \u20ac8.0 billion to \u20ac8.2 billion. That represented an increase of 18% at constant currencies.\n\nCloud and software revenue (non-IFRS) grew 3% at constant currencies to \u20ac23.72 billion (2019: \u20ac23.09 billion), and thus ended above our range forecasted for 2020 of \u20ac23.1 billion to \u20ac23.6 billion.\n\nThanks to the strong increase in cloud business described above, we were able to increase the share of more predictable revenue by 4.4pp to 72% (2019: 67%). As such, our total revenue (non-IFRS) increased slightly despite a decline in software license business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTotal revenue (non-IFRS) on a constant currency basis rose 1% in 2020 to \u20ac27.90 billion (2019: \u20ac27.63 billion), thus exceeding the guidance for 2020 that had been amended in October (\u20ac27.2 billion to \u20ac27.8 billion).\n\nOperating expenses (non-IFRS) in 2020 on a constant currency basis remained constant at \u20ac19.39 billion (2019: \u20ac19.43 billion). Not only did we demonstrate cost discipline in 2020 when it came to discretionary spend and employee hiring, we cut costs naturally through less travel, lower facility-related costs, and virtual rather\n\nthan physical events. This enabled us to keep our 2020 operating expenses at the previous year's level.\n\nOur expense base in 2020 was impacted by our transformation to a fast-growing cloud business. In our outlook for 2020, we expected to see an increasing cloud gross margin. The cloud gross margin for 2020 was 70%, an increase of 1.4pp on a constant currency basis year over year. The gross margin improvement was due to the increasing efficiency in the operation of our offerings as we continued to invest in the cloud.\n\nAll cloud gross margins on our various cloud offerings developed positively in 2020:\n\nThe cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) on our 'Intelligent Spend' offerings improved slightly by 0.8pp (on a constant currency basis), resulting in 79% for 2020 (2019: 78%).\n\nThe cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) on our 'infrastructure as a service' (IaaS) cloud offering continued to develop well in 2020, improving 4.9pp on a constant currency basis to achieve a cloud gross margin (non-IFRS) of 34% for the full year.\n\nProfitability in our 'software as a service/platform as a service' (SaaS/PaaS) cloud offerings was 71% at constant currencies (nonIFRS) for 2020. Despite ongoing investments in the further development and harmonization in the operation of our various SaaS/PaaS offerings on a single platform, we were able to increase the gross margin by 2.3pp.\n\nWe saw efficiency improvements in both our cloud and traditional on-premise business, which drove continued operating profit expansion.\n\nNon-IFRS operating profit in 2020 was \u20ac8.50 billion on a constant currency basis (2019: \u20ac8.21 billion), reflecting an increase of 4%. As a result, we were able to surpass our excellent results from 2018 and 2019, despite our continued investment in our business transformation during the reporting year. The positive development of our operating profit was largely influenced by investment decisions focused on customers and products which,",

Our employee headcount (measured in full-time equivalents, or FTEs) grew by 2,100 FTEs year over year to 102,430.\n\nAs a result of these effects, our operating profit increased by 48% to \u20ac6,623 million (2019: \u20ac4,473 million) and our operating margin increased by 8.0pp to 24.2% (2019: 16.2 %).\n\n## Operating Profit\n\n\u20ac millions | change since previous\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nPercent | change since previous year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChanges to the individual elements in our cost of revenue were as follows:\n\n## Cost of Cloud and Software\n\nCost of cloud and software consists primarily of costs for deploying and operating cloud solutions, the cost of developing custom solutions that address customers' specific business requirements, and customer support costs.\n\nIn 2020, the cost of cloud and software increased slightly to \u20ac4,707 million (2019: \u20ac4,692 million) and our cloud margin widened by 3.1pp from 63.5% in 2019 to 66.6% in 2020.\n\nA 6% decrease in software licenses and software support revenue to \u20ac15,148 million (2019: \u20ac16,080 million), primarily arising from a 20% decline in software revenue, and a corresponding decrease of 7% in the software licenses and software support costs to \u20ac2,008 million (2019: \u20ac2,159 million), saw our software licenses and software support margin at 86.7% (2019: 86.6%), slightly above the prior-year level. The gross margin on cloud and software, defined as cloud and software profit as a percentage of cloud and software revenue, increased by 0.1pp in 2020 to 79.7% (2019: 79.6%).\n\n## Cost of Services\n\nCost of services consists primarily of the cost of consulting, premium services and training courses, and the cost of bought-in consulting and training resources.\n\nThe services revenue decreased by 9% year over year to \u20ac4,110 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac4,541 million). The cost of services declined 13% to \u20ac3,178 million (2019: \u20ac3,662 million). Our gross margin on services, defined as services profit as a percentage of services revenue, increased to 22.7% (2019: 19.4%). These developments are primarily due to COVID-19-related limitations in personal customer contacts and a correspondingly high remote delivery share of the consulting services. The current challenging economic environment influenced the investment decisions on some big customer projects. As our service business trends away from traditional software licensing and consulting revenue toward more subscription revenue from cloud solutions, we continue to invest by expanding capacities to meet the higher demand.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur research and development (R&D) expense consists primarily of the personnel cost of our R&D employees, costs incurred for independent contractors whom we retain to assist in our R&D activities, and amortization of the computer hardware and software we use for our R&D activities.\n\nDue to growing personnel costs driven by a 7% year-over-year increase in our R&D headcount, and due to continued strategic investments, our R&D expense rose by 4% to \u20ac4,454 million in 2020 from \u20ac4,292 million in 2019. R&D expense as a percentage of total revenue thus increased to 16.3% in 2020 (2019: 15.6%). For more information, see the Products, Research & Development, and Services section.\n\n## Sales and Marketing Expense\n\nSales and marketing expense consists mainly of personnel costs, direct sales costs, and the cost of marketing our products and services.\n\nOur sales and marketing expense declined 8% from \u20ac7,693 million in 2019 to \u20ac7,106 million in 2020. This decline is primarily attributable to cancelation of in-person marketing events such as SAPPHIRE NOW and lower sales-related expenses.",

This decline is primarily the result of careful cost management combined with lower infrastructure costs. The ratio of general and administration\n\nexpense to total revenue declined by 1.0pp year over year to 5.0% (2019: 5.9%).\n\n## Segment Information\n\nAt the end of 2020, SAP had four reportable segments: Applications, Technology & Support; Concur; Qualtrics; and Services.

Software support revenue, ending 2020 with \u20ac11,502 million, remained flat and rose slightly by 1% at constant currencies. Including software licenses revenue, which decreased by 20% (17% at constant currencies) due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift toward cloud revenue, the segment achieved a total software licenses and support revenue of \u20ac15,138 million. Total segment revenue,\n\nhowever, stayed on prior year level ending 2020 with \u20ac21,680 million and increased by 2% at constant currencies.\n\nOverall, the share of more predictable revenue in this segment increased by 4.4pp from 77.5% in 2019 to 81.9% in 2020.\n\nThe segment's cost of revenue remained flat compared to the prior year, ending 2020 with \u20ac4,230 million, and increased by 3% at constant currencies due to increasing efficiency in cloud operations.\n\nSegment profit increased by 2% at constant currencies.

As a result, the services gross margin increased by 5.0pp (4.7pp at constant currencies) to 32.2% in 2020.

Our finance income was \u20ac1,473 million (2019: \u20ac787 million) and our finance costs were \u20ac697 million (2019: \u20ac589 million).\n\nFinance income mainly consists of gains from disposal of equity securities and IFRS 9-related fair value adjustments, mainly of Sapphire Ventures investments, totaling \u20ac1,360 million (2019: \u20ac596 million).\n\nFinance costs mainly consist of interest expense on financial liabilities amounting to \u20ac179 million (2019: \u20ac207 million), negative effects from derivatives amounting to \u20ac76 million\n\n(2019: \u20ac155 million), and losses from disposal or IFRS 9-related fair value adjustments of Sapphire Ventures investments totaling \u20ac345 million (2019: \u20ac152 million). For more information about financing instruments, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.3).\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 was 26.8% (2019: 26.7%). For more information about income taxes, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (C.5).\n\n## Profit After Tax and Earnings per Share\n\nProfit after tax increased to \u20ac5,283 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac3,370 million).\n\n## Profit After Tax\n\n\u20ac millions | change since previous year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBasic earnings per share increased to \u20ac4.35 (2019: \u20ac2.78). The number of shares outstanding remainded constant at 1,194 million in 2020 (2019: 1,194 million).\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\n\u20ac | change since previous year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe believe our shareholders should benefit appropriately from the profit the Company made in 2020. Our dividend policy is to pay a dividend totaling 40% or more of profit after tax.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of SAP SE will recommend to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2021 that the total dividend be increased by 17% to \u20ac1.85 per share (2019: \u20ac1.58). Based on this recommendation, the overall dividend payout ratio (which means the total distributed dividend as a percentage of profit) would be 41% (2019: 55%).\n\nIf the shareholders approve this recommendation and if treasury shares remain at the 2020 closing level, the total amount distributed in dividends would be \u20ac2,182 million. The actual amount distributed may be different from this total because the number of shares held in treasury may change before the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. In 2020, we distributed \u20ac1,864 million in dividends from our 2019 profit after tax. We also completed the buyback of treasury shares with a volume of \u20ac1.5 billion in 2020. These shares are not eligible for dividends.\n\n## Dividend per Share\n\n\u20ac | change since previous year\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Finances (IFRS)\n\n## Overview\n\n## Global Financial Management\n\nWe use global centralized financial management to control liquid assets and monitor exposure to interest rates and currencies. The primary aim of our financial management is to maintain liquidity in the Group at a level that is adequate to meet our financial obligations at all times. Most SAP entities have their liquidity managed centrally by the Group, so that liquid assets across the Group can be consolidated, monitored, and invested in accordance with Group policy. High levels of liquid assets help keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent. In addition, various credit facilities are currently available for additional liquidity, if required. For more information about these facilities, see the Credit Facilities section.\n\nWe manage credit, liquidity, interest rate, equity price, and foreign exchange rate risks on a Group-wide basis. We use selected derivatives exclusively for this purpose and not for speculation, which is defined as entering into a derivative instrument for which we do not have corresponding underlying transactions. The rules for the use of derivatives and other rules and processes concerning the management of financial risks are documented in our treasury guideline, which applies globally to all companies in the Group. For more information about the management of each financial risk and about our risk exposure, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes (F.1) and (F.2) .\n\n## Liquidity Management\n\nOur primary source of cash, cash equivalents, and current investments is funds generated from our business operations. Over the past several years, our principal use of cash has been to support operations and our capital expenditure requirements resulting from our growth, to quickly repay financial debt, to acquire businesses, to pay dividends on our shares, and to buy back SAP shares on the open market. On December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments were primarily held in euros and U.S. dollars. We generally invest only in the financial assets of issuers or funds with a minimum credit rating of BBB, and pursue a policy of cautious investment characterized by wide portfolio diversification with a variety of counterparties, predominantly short-term investments, and standard investment instruments. Our investments in financial assets of issuers with a credit rating lower than BBB were not material in 2020.\n\nWe believe that our liquid assets combined with our undrawn credit facilities are sufficient to meet our operating financing needs in 2021 and, together with expected cash flows from operations, will support debt repayments, currently planned capital expenditure requirements, and capital returns to our shareholders over the near term and medium term. It may also be necessary to enter into financing transactions when additional funds are required that cannot be wholly sourced from free cash flow, to maintain flexibility, and/or limit repayment risk.\n\nTherefore, we continuously monitor funding options available in the capital markets and trends in the availability of funds, as well as the cost of such funding. In recent years, we were able to repay additional debt within a short period of time due to our persistently strong free cash flow. For more information about the financial debt, see the Cash Flows and Liquidity section.\n\n## Capital Structure Management\n\nThe primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and customer confidence, and to support the growth of our business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will allow us to cover our funding requirements through the capital markets at reasonable conditions, and in so doing, ensure a high level of independence, confidence, and financial flexibility.\n\nFor more information about the capital structure and its analysis, see the Analysis of Consolidated Statement of Financial Position section and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,\n\n## Note (E.1).\n\nThe long-term credit rating for SAP SE is 'A2' by Moody's and 'A' by Standard & Poor's, both with a stable outlook.\n\nCapital returns in addition to SAP's regular dividend policy will be decided on an annual basis in line with SAP's capital allocation priorities, market conditions, company performance, and other factors.\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nOther sources of capital are available to us through various credit facilities, if required.\n\nTo retain high financial flexibility, we have available a \u20ac2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility with an end date in November 2024. A possible future utilization is not subject to any financial covenants. Borrowings under the facility bear interest of EURIBOR or LIBOR for the respective currency plus a margin of 0.17%. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.0595% per annum on the unused available credit. So far, we have not used, and do not currently foresee any need to use, this credit facility.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, SAP SE had additional available credit facilities totaling \u20ac433 million. Several other SAP entities have credit facilities available that allow them to borrow funds at prevailing interest rates.\n\nResulting from the acquisition of Qualtrics, a term loan of \u20ac1.25 billion was still outstanding on December 31, 2020. The amount can be flexibly repaid until maturity of the loan on January 23, 2022.",

We paid, net of cash received, a total of \u20ac0.6 billion mainly for the Emarsys acquisition in 2020, compared to \u20ac6.1 billion mainly for the Qualtrics acquisition in 2019. Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment remained at a comparable level. For more information about current and planned capital expenditures, see the Assets section and the Investment Goals section.\n\nIn 2020, free cash flow more than doubled to \u20ac6,000 million (2019: \u20ac2,276 million). The free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow as a percentage of profit after tax, increased to 114% compared to 68% in 2019.\n\nNet cash outflows from financing activities were \u20ac3,997 million in 2020, compared to \u20ac102 million in cash inflows in 2019. The buyback of treasury shares with a volume of \u20ac1.5 billion in 2020 is included herein. Apart from the buyback of treasury shares, cash outflows in 2020 resulted from repayments of \u20ac1.15 billion in Eurobonds, the repayment of \u20ac0.75 billion in the acquisition term loan for Qualtrics, which was drawn in 2019, and US$0.29 billion in U.S. private placements when they matured. Further, we repaid\n\nwith original maturity of three months or less) and current investments (for example, time deposits and debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months, and remaining maturities of less than one year included in other financial assets) as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Group liquidity on December 31, 2020, primarily comprised amounts in euros and U.S. dollars.\n\nThe increase in group liquidity compared to 2019 was mainly due to the cash inflows from our operations.\n\nNet debt is financial debt less group liquidity. For more information about our liquidity, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.3).\n\nFor information about the impact of cash, cash equivalents, current investments, and our financial liabilities on our income statements, see the analysis of our financial income, net, in the Operating Results (IFRS) section.",

There were no material divestitures of facilities within the reporting period.\n\n## Competitive Intangibles\n\nThe (intangible) resources that are the basis for our current as well as future success do not appear in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This is apparent from a comparison of the market capitalization of SAP SE (based on all issued shares), which was \u20ac131.7 billion at the end of 2020 (2019: \u20ac147.8 billion), with the book value of our equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which was \u20ac29.9 billion (2019: \u20ac30.8 billion). This means that the market capitalization of our equity is more than four times higher than the book value. The difference is mainly due to certain internally generated intangible resources that the applicable accounting standards do not allow to be recorded (at all or at fair value) in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These resources include customer capital (our customer base and customer relations); employees and their knowledge and skills; our ecosystem of partners; internally developed software; our ability to innovate; the brands we have built up, in particular, the SAP brand itself; and our organization.\n\nOn December 31, 2020, SAP was the most valuable company in Germany in terms of market capitalization based on all issued shares.\n\nIn 2020, SAP's brand value increased compared to 2019. According to the Interbrand 'Best Global Brands' annual survey, SAP ranked as the 18th most valued brand in the world (2019: 20th). Against other German brands, the SAP brand ranks third behind Mercedes-Benz and BMW, and third globally against other brands in the business services sector. Interbrand determined our brand value to be US$28.0 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the previous year (2019: US$25.1 billion). BrandZ recognized SAP as the world's 17th most valuable brand in the 2020 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking. The ranking estimates SAP's brand value at US$58 billion (2019: US$58 billion).",

SAP SE is the Group holding company and employs most of the Group's Germany-based development and service and support personnel.\n\nAs the owner of the intellectual property in most SAP software, SAP SE derives its revenue mainly from software license fees and bears the Group-wide research and development expenses for the most part.\n\nThe SAP SE annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with the reporting standards in the German Commercial Code and the German Stock Corporation Act. The full SAP SE annual financial report and unqualified audit report are submitted to the operator of the Elektronischer Bundesanzeiger (Online German Federal Gazette) for publication and inclusion in the Unternehmensregister (German Business Register). It is available from SAP SE on request.\n\n## Income\n\nSAP SE's income statement is classified following the nature of expense method and presents amounts in millions of euros.\n\n## SAP SE Income Statement - German Commercial Code (Short Version)\n\n| \u20ac millions                     | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total revenue                  | 14,669  | 15,220  |\n| Other operating income         | 1,385   | 1,028   |\n| Cost of services and materials | - 9,112 | - 9,328 |\n| Personnel expenses             | - 2,362 | - 2,463 |\n| Depreciation and amortization  | - 606   | - 596   |\n| Other operating expenses       | - 2,573 | - 2,755 |\n| Operating profit               | 1,401   | 1,107   |\n| Finance income                 | 1,724   | 729     |\n| Income before taxes            | 3,125   | 1,836   |\n| Income taxes                   | - 626   | - 492   |\n| Income after taxes             | 2,500   | 1,343   |\n| Other taxes                    | - 15    | - 12    |\n| Net income                     | 2,485   | 1,332   |\n\nThe total revenue of SAP SE in 2020 was \u20ac14,669 million (2019: \u20ac15,220 million), an decrease of 4%. Product revenue decreased 6% to \u20ac11,943 million (2019: \u20ac12,715 million). As in previous years, product revenue was primarily generated from license fees paid by subsidiaries of SAP SE.\n\nService revenue decreased 2% to \u20ac453 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac462 million), other revenue increased by 11% to \u20ac2,273 million (2019: \u20ac2,043 million).\n\nSAP SE operating profit increased 27% to \u20ac1,401 million (2019: \u20ac1,107 million). Other operating income increased \u20ac358 million to \u20ac1,385 million (2019: \u20ac1,028 million). The yearover-year increase is primarily due to an increase in gains from currency effects and write-ups on receivables from affiliated companies.\n\nSAP SE cost of services and materials decreased 2% to \u20ac9,112 million (2019: \u20ac9,328 million). Services received decreased by \u20ac219 million to \u20ac6,991 million (2019: \u20ac7,210 million), mainly due to decreased services received in the context of intra-Group cost allocations. The costs for licenses and provisions increased by \u20ac4 million to \u20ac2,094 million (2019: \u20ac2,090 million).\n\nSAP SE personnel expenses, mainly the labor cost of software developers, service and support employees, and administration staff employed by SAP SE, decreased 4% to \u20ac2,362 million (2019: \u20ac2,463 million) primarily due to lower shared-based compensation expenses.\n\nOther operating expenses decreased by \u20ac182 million to \u20ac2,573 million (2019: \u20ac2,755 million). This decrease is mainly attributable to a \u20ac598 million decrease in restructuring costs and a \u20ac51 million decrease in travel costs. The decrease in other operating expenses was partly offset by a \u20ac281 million increase in exchange rate losses and a \u20ac168 million increase in other services expense.\n\nFinance income was \u20ac1,724 million (2019: \u20ac729 million), representing a year-over-year increase of \u20ac995 million. This increase is primarily due to a \u20ac662 million increase in income from investments, a \u20ac150 million increase in results from profit and loss transfer agreements, a \u20ac133 million decrease in write-downs on financial assets, and a \u20ac58 million increase in net interest income.\n\nSAP SE income before taxes increased \u20ac1,289 million to \u20ac3,125 million (2019: \u20ac1,836 million). Income taxes increased by \u20ac134 million to \u20ac626 million (2019: \u20ac492 million). After deducting taxes, the resulting net income was \u20ac2,485 million\n\n(2019: \u20ac1,332 million), an increase of \u20ac1,153 million year over year.",

Against outflows of \u20ac1,864 million associated with the payment of the dividend and \u20ac1,492 million for the repurchase of stock in treasury, there was a \u20ac2,485 million increase due to net income for 2020. The equity ratio (that is, the ratio of shareholders' equity to total assets) is 34% (2019: 36%).\n\nProvisions increased by \u20ac78 million to \u20ac2,046 million (2019: \u20ac1,968 million).\n\nOther provisions decreased by \u20ac159 million to \u20ac1,294 million (2019: \u20ac1,453 million), primarily as a result of a decrease in other obligations toward employees. In contrast, provisions for tax increased by \u20ac235 million to \u20ac739 million (2019: \u20ac504 million).\n\nLiabilities increased by \u20ac673 million to \u20ac27,740 million (2019: \u20ac27,068 million). This increase mainly resulted from a \u20ac797 million increase in liabilities to affiliated companies, primarily due to higher cash contributions by subsidiaries through SAP SE's centralized management of finance and liquidity.\n\n## Opportunities and Risks\n\nSAP SE is subject to essentially the same opportunities and risks as the SAP Group.

The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of SAP SE issued the Corporate Governance Statement on February 23, 2021, and published it on our public Web site at http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/investors/governance.\n\n## Changes in Management\n\nIn February 2020, Executive Board members Michael Kleinemeier and Stefan Ries agreed with the Supervisory Board to leave the Company. Michael Kleinemeier's last day was April 30, 2020, and Stefan Ries departed on May 31, 2020.\n\nAfter the departure of Michael Kleinemeier, most of the former SAP Digital Business Services organization teams were fully integrated into the Board areas Customer Success, led by Adaire Fox-Martin, and SAP Product Engineering, led by Thomas Saueressig.\n\nOn April 20, 2020, Co-Chief Executive Officer (Co-CEO) Christian Klein became sole chief executive officer. Co-CEO Jennifer Morgan mutually agreed with the Supervisory Board to depart the Company effective April 30, 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, SAP announced that Sabine Bendiek had been appointed to the Executive Board. Since January 1, 2021, she has served as chief people officer and labor relations director and has led the Human Resources organization.

One SAP ADR corresponds to one SAP share.\n\nRestrictions applying to share voting rights or transfers : SAP shares are not subject to transfer restrictions. SAP held 48,924,892\n\ntreasury shares as at December 31, 2020 (see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.2)).

The Supervisory Board can revoke appointments to the Executive Board in accordance with the SE Regulation, article 9, and the German Stock Corporation Act, section 84, if compelling reasons exist, such as gross negligence on the part of the Executive Board member. If the Executive Board is short of a required member, one may be appointed in urgent cases by a court in accordance with the SE Regulation, article 9, and the German Stock Corporation Act, section 85. In accordance with the SE Regulation, article 59, and the German Stock Corporation Act, section 179, an amendment of the Articles of Incorporation requires a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders with a majority of at least three-quarters of the valid votes cast. For any amendments of the Articles of Incorporation that require a simple majority for stock corporations established under German law, however, the simple",

Section 11 (2) of the Articles of Incorporation authorizes the Supervisory Board to amend the Articles of Incorporation where such amendments only concern the wording.\n\nPower to issue and repurchase shares : The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 12, 2016, granted powers to the Executive Board, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue convertible and/or warrant-linked bonds, profit-sharing rights and/or income bonds (or combinations of these instruments), and to grant conversion or option rights in respect of SAP SE shares representing a total attributable portion of the share capital of not more than \u20ac100 million secured by a corresponding amount of contingent capital. These powers will expire on May 11, 2021. The Executive Board is also authorized until May 19, 2025, to increase the share capital by not more than \u20ac250 million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash and to increase the share capital by not more than \u20ac250 million by issuing new shares against contributions in cash or in kind. For more information about the different tranches of authorized capital and the aforementioned contingent capital, see the Articles of Incorporation, section 4.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 17, 2018, granted a power to the Executive Board in accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, section 71 (1)(8), to buy back for treasury on or before May 16, 2023, SAP SE shares attributable in total to not more than \u20ac120 million of the share capital. This power is subject to the proviso that the shares repurchased, together with any shares that were previously acquired and are still held by SAP in treasury and any other shares controlled by SAP, must not in total exceed 10% of SAP's share capital. Executive Board powers, such as those described to issue and repurchase stock and to grant rights of conversion and subscription to shares of SAP, are widely followed common practice among German companies such as SAP. These powers give the Executive Board the flexibility it needs, in particular, the option to use SAP shares as consideration in equity investments, raise funds on the financial markets at short notice on favorable terms, or return value to shareholders during the course of the year.\n\nMaterial agreements with change-of control-provisions : SAP SE has concluded the following material agreements with provisions that take effect in the event of a change of control, whether following a takeover bid or otherwise:\n\nThe terms of SAP's syndicated \u20ac2.5 billion revolving credit facility include a change-of-control clause. For more information about this syndicated credit facility, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (F.1). This clause obliges SAP SE to notify the banks in case of a change of control. If, on receiving the notification, banks that represent at least two-thirds of the credit volume so require, the banks have the right to cancel the credit facility and demand complete repayment of the outstanding debt. If no continuation agreement is reached, the credit facility would end and the obligation to repay would become effective at an ascertainable time.\n\nTo finance the acquisition of Qualtrics International Inc., SAP took out a loan of \u20ac2.5 billion, of which \u20ac1.25 billion were outstanding as at December 31, 2020. The loan agreement contains\n\na change-of-control clause which obliges SAP SE to notify the banks in case of a change of control. If, on receiving the notification, banks that represent at least two-thirds of the credit volume so require, the banks have the right to terminate the loan and demand complete repayment of the outstanding debt. If no continuation agreement is reached, the termination of the loan and the obligation to repay would become effective at an ascertainable time.\n\nSAP had bonds totaling \u20ac10.1 billion and US$0.3 billion outstanding as at December 31, 2020. For more information about SAP's bonds, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.3). Under the terms agreed with the buyers, we are required to notify the buyers, without delay, of any change of control. If there is a change of control and SAP is consequently assigned a lower credit rating within a defined period, buyers are entitled to demand repayment.\n\nUnder the terms of our U.S. private placements totaling approximately US$0.87 billion as at December 31, 2020, we are required to offer lenders repayment of outstanding debt if there is a change of control and SAP is consequently assigned a lower credit rating within a defined period. For more information about these private placements, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (E.3). Lenders would have at least 30 days to accept the offer.\n\nWe have entered into relationships with other companies to jointly develop and market new software products. These relationships are governed by development and marketing agreements with the respective companies. Some of the agreements include provisions that, in the event of a change of control over one of the parties, give the other party a right to consent to the assignment of the agreement or to terminate it.\n\nChange-of-control provisions in Executive Board compensation agreements : Agreements have been concluded with the members of the Executive Board of SAP SE concerning compensation in the event of a change of control. These agreements, which are customary internationally, are described in the compensation report, which is an integral part of this management report.

        "page_content": "## Business Conduct\n\n## Vision and Strategy\n\nIn an increasingly complex business environment, making the right decisions and abiding by ethical choices has never been more challenging. As a company operating in numerous countries across the globe, SAP is required to adhere to strict international legislation that defines acceptable business conduct and practices.\n\nAt SAP, we also expect our business practices to not only meet international rules and legal requirements, but to adhere to high standards of ethics and integrity. We understand that our customers expect this as well. SAP's reputation for doing business the right way is one of our most important assets. By making ethical choices and staying within high bounds of compliance, we continue to grow SAP in a way that encourages and is conducive to compliant and ethical behavior.\n\n## Due Diligence\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC) contributes to the Company's success by providing trusted advice to SAP managers, leaders, and employees across the entire business. The OEC strives to advance SAP's business goals by promoting a strong culture of integrity and helping SAP to 'Win the Right Way' by providing guidance and training that enables employees to make ethical and compliant choices.\n\nIn 2020, our aim to maintain a robust compliance program, based on our corporate values and voluntary commitments as well as international standards, had an even greater focus. The OEC team grew for the third consecutive year, from 113 employees in 2019 to 123 employees in 2020. Additionally, at the beginning of 2020, the group chief compliance o fficer's (GCCO) reporting line changed from the group chief financial officer (CFO) to the group chief executive officer (CEO).\n\nThis change, along with the increase in the size of the OEC teams, reflects the importance that SAP places on integrity and on the function of compliance at the Company.\n\nAt SAP, ethical behavior is an intrinsic part of our culture and an indispensable part of our daily decision-making at every level of the business. To help nurture this environment, the OEC's various teams continually address compliance issues and improve policies, guidelines, systems, and measures related to their implementation.\n\nThe OEC has field compliance officers based all around the world, in high-risk and low-risk jurisdictions, and especially in markets where there are local language needs. They are often the first point of contact for the business regarding compliance matters. In those high-risk countries in which the OEC is not physically represented, the OEC operates a network of compliance stewards drawn largely from either our legal, finance, or human resources (HR) departments. They are equipped to offer straightforward advice on specific compliance questions, as well as to amplify compliance messages and provide a link for local employees to the relevant field compliance officer.\n\nCompliance matters are discussed as required with senior leadership within SAP at quarterly Audit Committee meetings as well as at more frequent regular touchpoints with Executive Board and Supervisory Board members. Compliance matters are also discussed by the GCCO in quarterly Global Compliance Governance Committee meetings.\n\nWhere appropriate and in response to identified compliance concerns, the OEC engages external counsel and forensic consulting resources to perform corruption risk assessments of high-risk market units. This process also includes a comprehensive root cause analysis for identified risks.\n\nOutside SAP, the OEC regularly exchanges ideas and best practices for compliance processes with relevant peers in the software industry and beyond. In Germany, where SAP is headquartered, the OEC participates regularly in the DAX 30 Chief Compliance Officer Round Table. SAP is also a Corporate Member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), and the OEC participates in the ACFE's executive roundtable in the United States.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct (CoBC) provides the primary ethical and legal framework within which we conduct business and remain on course for success. It is adapted locally and translated into local languages where required.\n\nWe also expect our partners and suppliers to commit to meeting our high standards of integrity and sustainability. For this reason, we have the SAP Partner Code of Conduct and the SAP Supplier Code of Conduct in place so that partners and suppliers understand what is expected of them.\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\nThe OEC is committed to countering, preventing, and reducing violations from the outset, although we acknowledge that it is not possible to eliminate the potential for non-compliant behavior entirely.\n\nIn 2020, we set out to further improve access and availability of compliance policies and guidelines , channels of communication on compliance, employee participation in compliance training , and compliance processes .\n\n## Enforcing Policies and Guidelines\n\nThe CoBC is communicated to employees globally and contains a fundamental set of rules that define how we conduct our business. It sets SAP's standard for our dealings with each other and with customers, partners, competitors, and vendors, and each of our employees is bound by it.\n\nIn 2020, the Company implemented an additional policy management procedure, containing fundamental requirements and parameters related to content, creation, and maintenance of governance documents. It also provides a detailed and comprehensive step-by-step explanation of the policy lifecycle.",

        "page_content": "Stakeholders from across the business are involved in developing content for new and updated policies, to ensure that all relevant business units are consulted.\n\n## Communication\n\nWe firmly believe that for SAP to succeed, there must be an intrinsic culture of compliant behavior across the Company. In 2020, the OEC established a dedicated communications team to promote consistent distribution of integrity-related communications, at all levels of the Company - from senior leaders, managers, and frontline employees. Executive Board members and senior leaders regularly host all-hands meetings as well as leadership team meetings and smaller gatherings, which include integrity-focused topics, demonstrating their dedication to ethical business.\n\nThe OEC also participates in information sessions, leadership meetings and all-hands meetings with Executive Board members and senior leaders to share with employees their insight into OEC's work and mission.\n\nAll Board areas have re-committed their support for OEC's Compliance Ambassador Program and have nominated employees to participate in the program. In 2020, a third cohort was introduced, bringing the number of participants from 119 in 2019 to over 177 in 2020. The program is designed to give employees a further point of contact in the business when compliance matters arise. Ambassadors participate in an extensive curriculum of monthly onboarding sessions over a two-year period and are expected to cascade and transfer information on the importance of compliance and ethics throughout their teams and lines of business.\n\nQuarterly OEC newsletters provide all employees with information on a range of compliance-related topics. We also include at least one business ethics and compliance-related question in our annual engagement survey and in company-wide polls throughout the year. Employees can use the SAP Corporate Portal at any time to access all global policies, guidelines, and additional information. The SAP Compliance mobile app also provides convenient, ongoing access to compliance-related information.\n\n## Training Offerings\n\nOur training programs cover, for example, guidelines on anticorruption, competition law, and governance for customer commitments, intellectual property, and information security.\n\nOur 'Five Pillars of Compliance' online training is mandatory for all employees wherever legally permissible. The training includes modules on bribery and corruption, conflict of interest, competition, channel and fair business conduct, partner engagement, and hospitality.\n\nEmployee certification on the CoBC for employees worldwide continued in 2020. We recorded that more than 78,000 employees received this certification during the certification cycle. This number includes 30,168 employees in the Americas region, 27,244 employees in the APJ region, and 21,351 employees in the EMEA region. Where legally permissible to make this certification mandatory, a 99.9% completion rate was recorded.\n\nDespite restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, field compliance officers continued to hold training sessions - albeit virtually - for employees across the organization, from customerfacing staff to individuals in supporting roles, such as corporate affairs and marketing.\n\n## Compliance Processes\n\nThe OEC also evaluates SAP's third-party service providers to ensure that SAP's compliance standards are met. New suppliers and third parties seeking a partnership with SAP are scrutinized according to a risk-based compliance due diligence process, which is repeated every two years thereafter. Supplier and partner relationships are formally defined in contracts that outline their obligation to abide by SAP's compliance requirements and a 'right to audit' clause. The OEC also has a team dedicated to conducting audits of partners and suppliers to assess compliance with SAP's requirements and to identify and address compliance risks. The OEC's Compliance Monitoring & Analysis (CMA) team was created in 2020. The team analyzes findings from investigations and partner audit reports to identify potential enterprise-wide process deficiencies and patterns of misconduct that indicate a compliance risk. The CMA team then conducts root cause analyses on the highest-risk topics and recommends remediation actions to mitigate the risks.\n\n## Whistleblower Reporting Tool\n\nSAP has a whistleblower reporting tool primarily intended for employees to anonymously report matters or concerns regarding accounting, auditing, or bribery and corruption. SAP employees can use the tool confidentially, anonymously and without fear of retaliation.\n\nSAP external stakeholders can report concerns through the OEC mailbox or hotline, and SAP suppliers can use the supplier-related fraud Inbox to submit concerns.\n\nIn 2020, changes were made to the whistleblower reporting and review process to improve the timeliness of decisions taken to determine how allegations should be managed, either through investigation or otherwise.\n\nSAP will be introducing an independently managed ethics hotline to emphasize to employees that they can report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation. This hotline will be rolled out in 2021 to all SAP employees and launched with an accompanying campaign to raise its profile.\n\n## Investigating Misconduct\n\nThe OEC engages the assistance of an external law firm when conducting investigations on conduct that may violate antibribery and anticorruption laws.\n\nFor more information about the allegations, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.3).\n\n## Related Risks for SAP\n\nFor more information on related risks, see Ethical Behavior in the Risk Management and Risks section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Scope\n\nThe content of this section was not subject to the statutory audit of the combined group management report.

We set high standards of fairness, diversity, and inclusion for ourselves, and expect all of our business partners to respect human rights and avoid complicity in any abuse.\n\nRespect for human rights is central to our long-term commitment to sustainability and is fundamental to our purpose of helping the world run better and improving people's lives. This is why we have embedded human rights across our business activities.\n\n## Due Diligence\n\n## Governance\n\nOur cross-company agenda on human rights is driven by the Sustainability team and our Human Rights Steering Committee . The committee comprises executives from various Board areas and is responsible for maintaining human rights standards, including topics identified as salient issues during the risk and capacity assessment in 2017. We regularly consult experts from academia, civil society, and industry in our external Sustainability Panel on how SAP can generate the greatest positive social impact.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics Steering Committee guides our internal efforts to implement and enforce AI Ethics operations and policies. It comprises SAP executives from all Board areas with supervision of topics relevant to guiding and implementing AI ethics. Also made up of experts from academia, industry, and public policy, our external AI Ethics Advisory Panel advises us on how to further develop and operationalize our guiding principles for AI.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nWe support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; and the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. A signatory of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative, we are also guided by the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. The SAP Global Human Rights Commitment Statement is our public commitment to respecting and promoting human rights across our value chain.\n\nOverseen by our chief sustainability officer and approved by our Executive Board, the Human Rights Commitment Statement applies to our employees, business activities, solutions, and worldwide ecosystem. Reviewed every two years and enforced and communicated by the Human Rights Steering Committee together with the Sustainability team, the current version is available at www.sap.com/corporate-sustainability.\n\n## How We Measure and Manage Our Performance\n\n## Commitment Statement\n\nThe SAP Global Human Rights Commitment Statement addresses the human rights issues most relevant to SAP. For example, it refers to our policies on discrimination, health and safety management, and data protection and privacy - all topics that all employees receive training.\n\n## Assessment\n\nTo assess our human rights measures, we consider external benchmarks, performance ratings, audit results, and stakeholder feedback. We have been working on the findings of our 2017 risk and capacity assessment to improve due diligence processes and, since 2012, we have conducted regular internal audits to check policy compliance. This helps us verify that subsidiaries are adhering to human rights standards, and check whether employees feel empowered to raise concerns.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted a labor audit at SAP Argentina, whereby we reviewed labor conditions, wages and hours, health and safety, environmental management system, and business practices. We did not encounter any abuses in these areas. We plan to continue our global internal audit program in 2021 in other locations.\n\n## Employees\n\nWe encourage all employees, including groups at heightened risk of becoming disadvantaged or marginalized (also called 'vulnerable groups') such as temporary external staff, to report conduct that violates our policies. Employees can reach out confidentially to their managers, HR officers, compliance officers, or colleagues who are trained to be part of our internal mediation pool. Our global ombudsperson also receives employee complaints and mediates fair settlements as well as helping our Executive Board analyze HR-related complaints and issues. Our grievance mechanisms (for example, HR Compliance Office ) are also accessible to external groups. For more information, see the Employees and Social Investments section .\n\n## Suppliers and Partners\n\nWe expect suppliers and partners to respect human rights, and our codes of conduct require them to uphold labor rights and provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. For more information, see the Sustainable Procurement section.\n\n## Product Development\n\nWe seek to respect human rights throughout the product lifecycle - from design through development to use. Protection of personal information and accessibility are key areas of focus. We follow Web content guidelines such as Section 508 to help ensure inclusive design. For more information, see the Security, Data Protection, and Privacy section.",

Consequently, our Executive Board has established comprehensive internal control and risk management structures that enable us to identify and analyze risks early and take appropriate action. Our internal control and risk management systems are designed to identify potential events that could negatively impact the Company and to provide reasonable assurance regarding the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over our financial reporting .\n\nThese systems comprise numerous control mechanisms and are an important element of our corporate decision-making process; they are therefore implemented across the entire Group as an integral part of SAP's business processes. We have adopted an integrated internal control and risk management approach to help maintain effective global risk management while also enabling us to aggregate risks and report on them transparently.\n\nIn addition, we have a governance model in place across the internal control and risk management systems to ensure both are effective, as well as a central software solution to store, maintain, and report all risk-relevant information .\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nDue to our public listings in both Germany and the United States, we are subject to both German and U.S. regulatory requirements that relate to internal controls and risk management over financial reporting, such as provisions in the German Stock Corporation Act, section 91 (2), and the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, specifically sections 302 and 404. Hence, our Executive Board has established an early warning system (risk management system) to enable compliance with applicable regulations.\n\n## Risk Management Policy and Framework\n\nThe risk management policy issued by our Executive Board governs how we handle risk in line with the Company's risk appetite and defines a methodology that is applied uniformly across all parts of the Group.\n\n## Risk Management Pillars\n\nOur risk management system is based on the framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) entitled 'Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance.' Updated in 2017, this framework is built on four pillars, which include a global risk management governance framework, a dedicated risk management policy, a global risk management organization, and a standardized risk management methodology.\n\nIn accordance with the COSO framework, SAP's enterprise risk management covers risks in the areas of strategy, operations, finance, and compliance.\n\n## Our Global Risk Management Governance Framework\n\nThe risk management governance framework at SAP represents a comprehensive system of approaches and processes to ensure control through a clearly structured risk management system and a supporting risk culture. The risk culture is considered the basis of SAP's risk management system. Risk culture at SAP comprises a system of values, beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and understanding concerning risks and risk management as part of our corporate culture. To support and continuously foster SAP's risk culture, our Global Risk and Assurance Services (GR&AS) organization conducts comprehensive risk awareness activities for the organization.\n\nOur Executive Board is responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the internal control system and the risk management system. The effectiveness of both systems and their implementation in the different Board areas is monitored by each Executive Board member. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly monitors the effectiveness of SAP's internal control and risk management systems. GR&AS regularly provides a status update on the internal control and the risk management systems to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Every year, SAP's external auditors assess as to whether the SAP SE early-warning system for risk detection is adequate to identify risks that might endanger our ability to continue as a going concern. Additional assurance is obtained through the external audit of the effectiveness of our system of internal controls over financial reporting.",

Our global SAP risk management policy clearly states that each employee is responsible for active engagement in the risk management process as well as for the continuous identification of risks, based upon clear rules of engagement in adherence to the policy. Along with the policy, we maintain a system-based Risk Management Policy Cockpit that describes all business process specifics associated with the risk management lifecycle. The risk management system primarily analyzes risks. Opportunities are only assessed or analyzed where it is deemed appropriate.\n\n## Our Global Risk Management Organization\n\nOur global risk management organization is responsible for the implementation of a Group-wide effective risk management system. Furthermore, GR&AS is responsible for the regular maintenance and implementation of our risk management policy as well as the standardized internal and external risk reporting.\n\nAll GR&AS risk managers, working with assigned risk contacts in the relevant business units, identify and assess risks associated with material business operations using a uniform approach and monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures chosen to mitigate risks.\n\nFurther financial risk management activities are performed by our Global Treasury and Global Tax departments. General legal risks are managed by Global Legal. Sanction and embargo-related risks are managed by the Export Control team, harassment and other HRrelated issues by our Global Labor & Employee Relations Office, security-related risks by our SAP Global Security Office, and IP risks by our Global IP Office.\n\nDuring the merger and acquisition and post-merger integration phase, newly acquired companies are subject to risk management performed by our Corporate Development M&A function. Furthermore, for as long as the newly acquired companies are not integrated, existing risk management structures are maintained or enhanced within the acquired companies for the purposes of compliance with legal requirements.\n\nThe exposure of SAP business units to potential compliance risks is reviewed on a regular basis. Quantitative and qualitative internal data as well as external information, such as the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, are considered in our wider compliance risk analysis. Based on this information, we performed a detailed assessment for all SAPrelevant high-risk countries and derived local as well as global mitigations.\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the new GR&AS function combined corporate audit, SOX, internal controls and global governance, risk, and compliance into one function, led by the chief risk officer, also acting as chief audit executive. The chief risk officer reports to our Group CFO and is responsible for SAP's internal control and risk management programs.\n\n## Risk Management Methodology and Reporting\n\nThe illustration below describes the key elements of the risk management process under SAP's risk management policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Planning\n\nBased on SAP's risk management policy and framework, the risk planning phase serves to align on the definition and assignment of roles and responsibilities, the definition of risk-relevant business activities (such as processes, projects or other aspects affecting Company assets), the determination of objectives and value drivers, the planning of risk assessments, and the determination of adequate information flow.\n\nRisk planning and risk identification for internal and external risks are conducted jointly by GR&AS risk managers and the relevant business units or SAP entities.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nA risk assessment covers the identification and analysis of a risk, as well as the determination of a response to that risk. We use various approaches to identify risks. For example, we have identified risk indicators and have developed a comprehensive risk catalog that includes risk mitigation strategies. Risk identification takes place at various levels of our organization to ensure that common risk trends are identified and end-to-end risk management across organizational borders is enabled. We apply both qualitative and quantitative risk analyses and other risk analysis methods such as sensitivity analyses and simulation techniques.\n\nTo determine which risks pose the greatest threat to the viability of the SAP Group, we classify them as 'high,' 'medium,' or 'low' based on the likelihood that a risk will occur within the assessment",

The period for analyzing our risks correlates with that of the\n\nrespective associated business activities, considering a relevant forecast horizon of up to one year, and up to 2025 where applicable. The period for analyzing risks that could be possible threats to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern is eight rolling quarters.\n\n| Impact Level      | Impact Definition                                                                          |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Insignificant     | Negligible negative impact on business, financial  position, profit, and/or cash flows     |\n| Minor             | Limited negative impact on business, financial  position, profit, and/or cash flows        |\n| Moderate          | Some potential negative impact on business, financial  position, profit, and/or cash flows |\n| Major             | Considerable negative impact on business, financial  position, profit, and/or cash flows   |\n| Business-Critical | Detrimental negative impact on business, financial  position, profit, and/or cash flows    |\n\nThe combination of the likelihood that a risk will occur and its impact on SAP's reputation, business, financial position, profit, and/or cash flows leads to a subsequent classification of the risk as either 'high,' 'medium,' or 'low.'\n\n| y                 | Insignificant   | Minor   | Moderate   | Major   | Business-Critical   |\n|-------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|---------|---------------------|\n| b ilit 80% to 99% | L               | M       | H          | H       | H                   |\n| ro b a 60% to 79% | L               | M       | M          | H       | H                   |\n| P 40% to 59%      | L               | L       | M          | M       | H                   |\n| 20% to 39%        | L               | L       | L          | M       | M                   |\n| 1% to 19%         | L               | L       | L          | L       | M                   |\n\nImpact\n\nL = Low Risk\n\nM = Medium Risk\n\nH = High Risk\n\nIn the final stage of the risk assessment, after identifying and analyzing the risk, we determine a response for each identified risk. We have different response categories such as mitigating, retaining for research, transferring, delegating, accepting, or avoiding, for example, by deciding not to start or not to continue the activity that may lead to a risk.\n\n## Risk Validation and Monitoring\n\nRisk assessment is followed by risk validation and risk monitoring. The risk exposure and the risk description, as well as the appropriateness of agreed responses, are validated by the accountable management. Our GR&AS risk managers work in close cooperation with the relevant business owners, ensuring that strategies are implemented to address identified risks. Business owners are responsible for continuously monitoring the risks and associated mitigation strategies, with support from the respective GR&AS risk managers. To ensure greater risk transparency and enable appropriate decision-making for business owners, we have established a risk delegation of authority (RDOA) for relevant parts of the organization as deemed appropriate. RDOA is a risk management decision-making hierarchy that helps business owners gain timely insight into business transactions that pose the greatest risk, so that they are better able to review the relevant information, understand the risk profile and associated mitigation strategies, and determine whether their approval is warranted.\n\nDepending on the exposure, approval is required at different levels of the Company, up to and including the Executive Board .\n\n## Risk Reporting\n\nAll identified and relevant risks are reported at local, regional and global levels in accordance with our risk management policy and the global risk reporting standard. At these levels, we have established executive risk councils that regularly discuss risks and responses and that monitor the success of risk mitigation. In addition, the Executive Board is informed regularly and quarterly about individual risks based on clearly defined qualitative reporting criteria. Newly identified or existing significant risks that are above a defined threshold, meet a qualitative criterion, or have a potential significant impact are also reported to the Audit Committee and the chairperson of the Supervisory Board on a quarterly basis. This includes risks along our strategic portfolio for services and solutions as well as any risks to our ability to continue as a going concern, the latter supported by a process that analyzes those risks with respect to potential effects on liquidity, excessive indebtedness and insolvency.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Closure\n\nRisks are closed once a reassessment concludes that a risk is no longer existent or does not require continued monitoring. Risk closure criteria include the risk event occurring, the risk no longer being considered a risk, or the risk having been successfully mitigated.\n\n## Internal Control and Risk Management System for Financial Reporting\n\nThe purpose of our system of internal control over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance that our financial reporting is reliable and compliant with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, it might not prevent or bring to light all potential misstatements in our financial statements.\n\nOur internal control system consists of the internal control and risk management system for financial reporting (ICRMSFR), which also covers the broader business environment. In 2020, we adjusted existing control designs to adequately address evolving risks and we continued to automate our internal control landscape. Using the current COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework of 2013, we have defined and implemented internal controls along the value chain on a process and subprocess level to ensure that sound business objectives are set in line with the organization's strategic, operational, financial, and compliance goals.\n\nSAP's ICRMSFR is based on our Group-wide risk management methodology. It includes organizational, control, and monitoring structures designed to ensure that data and information concerning our business is collected, compiled, and analyzed in accordance with applicable laws and properly reflected in our IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur ICRMSFR also includes policies, procedures and measures designed to ensure compliance of SAP's financial reports with applicable laws and standards. We analyze new statutes, standards, and other pronouncements concerning IFRS accounting and its impact on our financial statements and the ICRMSFR. Failure to adhere to these would present a substantial risk to the compliance of our financial reporting. Finally, the ICRMSFR has both preventive and detective controls, including, for example, automated and nonautomated reconciliations, segregated duties with two-person responsibility, authorization concepts in our software systems, and corresponding monitoring measures.\n\nOur Corporate Financial Reporting (CFR) department codifies all accounting policies in our Group accounting and global revenue recognition guidelines. These policies and the corporate closing schedule, together with our process descriptions, define the closing process. Under this closing process, we prepare, predominately through centralized or external services, the financial statements of all SAP entities for consolidation by CFR. CFR and other corporate departments are responsible for ensuring compliance with Group accounting policies and monitor the accounting work. CFR also conducts reviews of our accounting processes and books. The employees who work on SAP's financial reporting receive training in the respective policies and processes.\n\nWe have outsourced some tasks, such as valuing projected benefit obligations and share-based payouts, quarterly tax calculations for most entities, and purchase price allocations in the context of asset acquisitions and business combinations. We have\n\nalso outsourced the preparation of the local statutory financial statements for a few of our subsidiaries.\n\nBased on an analysis of the design and operating effectiveness of our respective internal controls over financial reporting, a committee presents the results of the assessment on the ICRMSFR effectiveness with respect to our IFRS consolidated financial statements as at December 31 each year to our Group CFO. The committee meets regularly to set the annual scope for the test of effectiveness, to assess and evaluate any possible weaknesses in the controls, and to determine measures to address them timely and adequately. During its own meetings, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly scrutinizes the resulting assessments of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting with respect to the IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe assessment, conducted by SAP and external audit, of the effectiveness of the ICRMSFR related to our IFRS consolidated financial statements concluded that, on December 31, 2020, the Group had an effective internal control system over financial reporting in place.\n\nAdditionally, and in compliance with German commercial law requirements, SAP maintains an internal control system beyond financial reporting. This is supported through automated controls (continuous control monitoring) as part of our business processes.\n\n## Supporting Software Solution\n\nWe use our own risk management software, SAP governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions powered by SAP HANA, to support the governance process. GR&AS risk managers record and track identified risks using our risk management software online and in real time to help create transparency across all known risks that exist in the Group, as well as to facilitate risk management and the associated risk reporting. This GRC solution also supports the risk-based approach of the ICRMSFR. Our continuous control monitoring activities are performed utilizing our GRC software as well. This information is available to managers through direct access to our SAP Fiori application for enterprise risk reporting, and in regularly issued reports, and is consolidated and aggregated for the quarterly risk report to the Executive Board.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nThe following sections outline our risk categories and risk factors that we have identified and continuously track. To further streamline our integrated report, we have decided to disclose only material/relevant risks henceforth and focus on 'medium' and 'high' risk factors as per our assessment. Thus, the following risk factors are not included in the Integrated Report 2020: Environment and Sustainability; Sales and Revenue Conditions; Liquidity; Use of Accounting Policies and Judgment; Currency, Interest Rate, and Share Price Fluctuation; Insurance; and Venture Capital.\n\nAn overview of the risk categories and the corresponding risk factors is outlined in the table below. Therein, risk factors are categorized according to our framework that is detailed in the Risk Management Methodology and Reporting section .",

Any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on the global economy as well as on our business.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -General economic, political, social, environmental, public health, and market developments, and general unrest (for example,\n\nUnited States-China security-based supply chain restrictions; United States-North Korea tensions; Western sanctions pressure on Russia; a UK/Brexit 'no deal' scenario; political and social unrest in the United States)\n\n- -Prolonged deterioration of global economic conditions (impact on accurate forecast) or budgetary constraints of national governments\n- -Diplomatic confrontations, frictions, trade or tariff conflicts such as those between the United States and China, with potential global implications as indicated by a prolonged and widespread economic slowdown\n- -Financial market volatility episodes, global economic crises and chronic fiscal imbalances, slowing economic conditions, or disruptions in emerging markets\n- -Higher credit barriers for customers, reducing their ability to finance software purchases",

We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely. This could exacerbate the other risks we describe in this report or cause a negative deviation from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this risk factor as high.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic: A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and spread across the globe, subsequently being classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While surfacing in almost all regions around the world, this outbreak prompted governments and businesses to introduce preventative measures intended to contain or mitigate further spreading, negatively impacting the global economy with immediate and prolonged effect.\n\nRepercussions include supply chain interruptions and an impact on production manufacturing and the borrowing of money, and have been observed across most industries, from tourism and leisure to the luxury goods industry. In addition, uncertainty and travel restrictions have impacted businesses, jobs, and consumer confidence, which in turn has led to a reduction in consumer spending. At the same time, businesses were confronted with higher costs resulting from measures intended to mitigate the spread of infection, such as the extension of holiday periods, lengthy workforce absences due to sick leave, delays in people returning to work in the office, and additional health screenings; public sector investments, meanwhile, were redirected to health-\n\nrelated expenditures. Individual economies were the first to raise concerns related to observed recession indicators.\n\nWe cannot predict the degree to which or over which period of time this pandemic and associated measures will impact our customers, our business, and our business operations with effects that could be material, leading to the following risks, among others:\n\n- -Global recession, economic downturns, increased unemployment rates, or customers reevaluating their business plans, priorities, and IT needs, with subsequent delays, shifts, or reductions in IT investments\n- -Financially impacted customers struggling to meet contractual obligations\n- -Increasingly complex digitalization requirements that challenge uninterrupted customer interaction and subsequent customer satisfaction\n- -Limited availability of qualified implementation partners that are largely unaffected\n- -Workforce mobility limitations resulting from government- or SAP-imposed travel restrictions\n- -Workforce productivity impacts resulting from adaptation to new working models\n- -Business continuity challenges in our business-critical data centers and in our mission-critical support activities if sites or the workforce were to be contaminated or the workforce were not available due to travel limitations\n- -Interruption in the maintenance of our cloud services infrastructure or reduced reliability and adequacy of cloud service capacity\n- -Decrease in software sales with subsequent impact on growth of our maintenance and services business\n- -Delays in cash collection due to interrupted invoice processing and delayed execution of financial transactions\n- -Increased costs in effectively managing the ramp-up of onsite operations\n\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, business operations, financial position, profit, and cash flows .\n\nSAP has established a global pandemic taskforce and is closely monitoring the situation as well as developing and implementing necessary measures and actions intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such as:\n\n- -Active and collaborative dialogue with our customers to jointly evaluate options and opportunities\n- -Ongoing review of payment models to address our customers' current need for payment flexibility while ensuring our liquidity, leveraging finance partners as applicable\n- -Strict adherence to applicable governmental advisories to foster compliance and health safeguarding\n- -Alignment with governmental authorities to enable accessibility to our workforce during times of restricted citizen movement, and alignment with service providers to ensure consistent application of standards at co-location sites\n- -Information, training courses, and guidance for our workforce as elements of our comprehensive transitional approach in an already digitalized technology landscape, with the majority of our workforce accustomed to remote working models\n- -Expansion of health and well-being initiatives and offerings, including an emergency helpline",

We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely. This could exacerbate the other risks we describe in this report or cause a negative deviation from our revenue and operating profit target. We classify this risk factor as high.\n\nInternational Laws and Regulations: Laws, regulatory requirements and standards in Germany, the United States, and elsewhere continue to be very stringent. Our international business activities and processes expose us to numerous and often conflicting laws and regulations, policies, standards, or other requirements and sometimes even conflicting regulatory requirements.\n\nThe SAP Group has a global presence. As a European company domiciled in Germany with securities listed in Germany and the United States, we are subject to European, German, U.S., and other governance-related regulatory requirements.\n\nOur business is subject to numerous risks inherent to international business operations. We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -Possible tax constraints impeding business operations in certain countries\n- -Changes in external reporting standards and tax laws including, but not limited to, conflict and overlap among tax regimes as well as the introduction of new tax concepts that harm digitized business models\n- -Discriminatory, protectionist, or conflicting fiscal policies and tax laws, such as certain protectionist measures included in the U.S. Tax Reform, which was enacted at the end of 2017, with some provisions still awaiting final regulations to provide guidance on compliance\n- -Workforce restrictions and travel bans resulting from changing laws and regulations, from political decisions (such as Brexit, government elections), or through required works council involvements, labor union approvals, and immigration laws in different countries\n\n- -Protectionist trade policies, import and export regulations, and trade sanctions (such as in Russia or China), counter or even conflicting sanctions (such as in the United States and Russia), and embargoes (such as in Iran) including, but not limited to, country-specific software certification requirements\n- -Violations of country-specific sanctions (such as the UN sanction against North Korea or the United States' sanction requirements against Iran and certain other countries)\n- -Compliance with and stringent enforcement of laws, as for example the EU GDPR or China's Cyber Security Law, and regulations (including interpretations), implications of government elections, lack of reforms, data protection and privacy rules, regulatory requirements and standards (such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [PCI DSS]), other compliance requirements (such as Service Organization Controls [SOC]), or sometimes even country-specific certifications or requirements in particular for cloud service provider or data center operations (such as the Threat and Vulnerability Risk Assessment issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore)\n- -Expenses associated with the localization of our products and compliance with local regulatory requirements\n- -Difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions\n\nIn 2017, an investigation was initiated and is ongoing with regards to potential sanctions violations. For more information relating to the potential sanctions' violations noted above, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.3).\n\nAs we expand into new countries and markets or extend our business activities in these markets, including emerging and highrisk markets, these risks could intensify. The application of the respective local laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear, subject to change over time, and often conflicting among jurisdictions. Additionally, these laws and government approaches to enforcement continue to change and evolve, just as our products and services continually evolve. Compliance with these varying laws and regulations could involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices. Non-compliance could result in the imposition of penalties or cessation of orders due to alleged noncompliant activity. Governmental authorities could use considerable discretion in applying these statutes and any imposition of sanctions against us could be material.\n\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations globally or in one or more countries or regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such as:\n\n- -We continuously monitor new and increased regulatory requirements, updated or new enforcement trends, and publicly available information on compliance issues in the computer software industry, in the emerging markets where we invest our resources, and in the business environment in general to cope with an increase in regulation enforcement efforts of certain countries or state-driven protectionism.\n- -We continuously invest and strive to improve, harmonize, and standardize our global processes, procedures, and solutions to increase our efficiency and effectivity in meeting the various",

We classify this risk factor as high.\n\nLegal and IP: Claims and lawsuits against us, such as for IP infringements, or our inability to obtain or maintain adequate licenses for third-party technology, or if we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our own intellectual property, may result in adverse outcomes.\n\nWe have in the past and believe that we will continue to be subject to claims and lawsuits, including intellectual property infringement claims, as our solution portfolio grows; as we acquire companies with increased use of third-party code including open source code; as we expand into new industries with our offerings, resulting in greater overlap in the functional scope of offerings; and as non-practicing entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products assert intellectual property infringement claims.\n\nMoreover, protecting and defending our intellectual property is crucial to our success.\n\nThe outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -Claims and lawsuits might be brought against us, including claims and lawsuits involving customers or businesses we have acquired.\n- -We might be dependent in the aggregate on third-party technology, including cloud and Web services, that we embed in our products or that we resell to our customers.\n- -Third parties have claimed, and might claim in the future, that we infringe their intellectual property rights or that we are overusing or misusing licenses to these technologies.\n- -We integrate certain open source software components from third parties into our software. Open source licenses might require that the software code in those components or the software into which they are integrated be freely accessible under open source terms.\n- -Despite our efforts, we might not be able to prevent third parties from obtaining, using, or selling without authorization what we regard as our proprietary technology and information. In addition, proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, or otherwise affected. Moreover, the laws and courts of certain countries might not offer effective means to enforce our legal or intellectual property rights. Finally, SAP may not be able to collect all judgments awarded to it in legal proceedings.\n- -Some intellectual property might be vulnerable to disclosure or misappropriation by employees, partners or other third parties. Third parties might reverse-engineer or otherwise obtain and\n\nuse technology and information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we might not be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or utilization. Adverse outcomes to some or all of the claims and lawsuits pending against us might result in the award of significant damages or injunctive relief against us or brought against us in the future that could hinder our ability to conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, competitive or financial position, financial performance, profit, and cash flows. Third parties could require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on terms that are not favorable to us, cause product shipment delays, subject our products to injunctions, require a complete or partial redesign of products, result in delays to our customers' investment decisions, and damage our reputation. Third-party claims might require us to make freely accessible under open source terms one of our products or third-party (non-SAP) software upon which we depend.\n\nAny legal action we bring to enforce our proprietary rights could also involve enforcement against a partner or other third party, which might have an adverse effect on our ability, and our customers' ability, to use that partner's or other third parties' products.\n\nThe outcome of litigation and other claims or lawsuits is intrinsically uncertain.

We estimate the probability of occurrence to be likely. We classify this risk factor as high.\n\nWe are named as a defendant in various legal proceedings for alleged intellectual property infringements. For more information and a more detailed report relating to certain of these legal proceedings, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes (A.4), (C.5), and (G.3).\n\nData Protection and Privacy: Non-compliance with increasingly complex and stringent, sometimes even conflicting, applicable data protection and privacy laws or failure to adequately meet the contractual requirements of SAP's customers with respect to our products and services could lead to civil liabilities and fines, as well as loss of customers.\n\nAs a global software and service provider, SAP is required to comply with local laws wherever SAP does business. One of the relevant European data protection laws is the GDPR. International data transfers to third countries that do not provide for an adequate level of data protection require additional safeguards to justify a transfer from the EU to a third country based on the standard contractual clauses.\n\nFurthermore, evolving regulations and laws globally (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, Brazilian General Data Protection Law, and the EU's proposed e-Privacy Regulation including data localization requirements) regarding data protection and privacy or other standards increasingly aimed at the use of personal data, such as for marketing purposes and the tracking of individuals' online activities, may impose additional burdens for SAP due to increasing compliance standards that could restrict the use and adoption of SAP's products and services (in particular cloud services) and make it more challenging and complex to meet customer expectations. This refers in particular to a compliant use\n\nof new technology, such as machine learning and AI for product development and deployment of intelligent applications.\n\nThis could lead to increased risks for SAP, which could harm SAP's business and limit SAP's growth.\n\nNon-compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws by SAP or any of the subprocessors engaged by SAP within the processing of personal data could lead to risks. We are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -Mandatory disclosures of breaches to affected individuals, customers, and data protection supervisory authorities\n- -Investigations and administrative measures by data protection supervisory authorities, such as the instruction to alter or stop non-compliant data processing activities, including the instruction to stop using non-compliant subprocessors\n- -Fines of up to 4% of SAP's annual Group turnover, or unlimited fines\n- -Damage claims by customers and individuals or contract terminations\n- -Harm to SAP's reputation\n- -Increased complexity in times of digitalization with regards to legal requirements in the context of cross-border data transfer and data localization requirements\n- -Lack of digital frameworks such as in the context of machine learning or AI, which could lead to distortion of individual data or information\n\nIn addition, the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and security industry experts continue to warn of risks related to a globally growing number of cybersecurity attacks aimed at obtaining or violating company data including personal data. We anticipate cyberattack techniques to continue to evolve and increase in sophistication, which could make it difficult to anticipate, prevent, detect, and mitigate attacks and intrusions, thus leading to, for example, risks described in the Cybersecurity and Security section, including risks in the following area, among others:\n\n- -A globally increasing number of threat actor attacks aimed at obtaining or violating Company data including personal data as observed in recent prominent cases of cyberattacks where the use of ransomware was the preferred method of threat actors Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our\n\nreputation, business, financial performance, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such as :\n\n- -We have implemented internal processes and measures in an effort to enable SAP to successfully and sufficiently comply with applicable data protection requirements.\n- -Data protection and privacy is reflected in the mandatory product standards of SAP's product development lifecycle.\n- -We continuously review SAP's existing standards and policies to address changes to applicable laws and regulations.\n- -We continuously enhance our data center operations worldwide, also considering local and sector-specific market and legal requirements. For compliance with local legal requirements, we have established a network of local and regional data protection and privacy coordinators.\n- -We have a data protection management system in place in all our Board areas.

Our overarching approach is one of corporate transparency, open communication with financial markets, regulators, and authorities, as well as adherence to recognized standards of business integrity. This commitment to recognized standards of business integrity is formalized in SAP's CoBC and supporting guidelines.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -Non-compliance with our policies and violation of compliance related rules, regulations, and legal requirements including, but not limited to, anticorruption and antibribery legislation in Germany, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt conduct\n- -Unethical and fraudulent behavior by individual employees, other individuals, partners, or entities associated with SAP leading to criminal charges, fines, and claims by affected parties\n- -Collusion with external third parties, for example, by aiding in securing business\n- -Fraud and corruption, especially in countries with a low Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index score and particularly in emerging markets\n- -Public sector transactions in territories exposed to a high risk of corruption\n- -Increased exposure and impact on business activities in highly regulated industries such as public sector, healthcare, banking, or insurance\n\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand, competitive or financial position, share price, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has encountered situations that required clear messaging and strong action on non-compliance in the context of corrupt behavior that has the potential to harm our business and reputation. SAP is continuing to investigate its dealings with the public sector. For more information relating to alleged violations, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note (G.3).\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such as:\n\n- -Continuous development of our comprehensive compliance program based on the three pillars of prevention, detection, and response\n- -Expansion of the OEC's bandwidth through additional staffing",

In certain regions and specific technology and solution areas, we continue to set very high growth targets, depending on short-term and long-term skill requirements, taking infrastructure needs as well as local legal or tax regulations into consideration. Successful retention and expansion of our workforce in identified strategic areas are key success factors for our Intelligent Enterprise strategy. The availability of such personnel\n\nas well as business experts is limited and, as a result, competition in our industry is intense.\n\nWe are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -Failure to apply workforce planning processes, adequate resource allocation, and location strategy in alignment with our corporate strategy\n- -Failure to identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate, and retain well-qualified and engaged personnel to scale to targeted markets\n- -Failure to successfully maintain, upskill, and expand our highly skilled and specialized workforce\n- -Poor succession management or failure to find adequate replacements\n- -Loss of key personnel of acquired business\n- -Failure to meet short-term and long-term workforce and skill requirements including achievement of internal gender diversity objectives\n- -Lack of appropriate or inadequately executed benefit programs\n- -Lack of availability and scalability of business experts and consultants\n- -Mismatch of expenses and revenue due to changes in headcount and infrastructure needs, as well as local legal or tax regulations\n- -Challenges with effectively managing a large distribution network of third-party companies\n\nAny of these events could reduce our ability to attract, develop, retain, and effectively manage our geographically dispersed workforce, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position, profit, and cash flows.\n\nSAP has established measures intended to address and mitigate the described risks and adverse effects, such as:\n\n- -Workforce planning (aiming to achieve diversity and the right mix of talent while considering demographic changes) and legally compliant mobility planning, utilizing the integration of our SAP Concur travel and expense solutions to support the challenges of a global workforce\n- -Utilization of external advisory services to address complexity in legal requirements while ensuring adequate resource allocation\n- -Utilization of SAP solutions to support compliance and streamline processes\n\n-\n\nCareer management (including, but not limited to, opportunity\n\nofferings for short-term assignments as well as skill,\n\ncompetency, and qualification advancements)\n\n- -Building employee and leadership strengths through a range of targeted professional development, learning, mentoring, coaching, together with a diversity program to take the changes in a global workforce into consideration\n- -Recommendations around succession planning for leadership and key positions to ensure sustainable leadership and safeguard the business from impacts through staff turnover\n- -Strong focus on expanding our talent landscape and reach through our diversity and inclusion efforts, including but not limited to neurodiverse talent, which provides a vibrant channel of talent with relevant skill sets required to compete successfully\n- -Extended benefit and long-term incentive programs, which will enable us to hire and retain talents internationally\n- -Utilization of outsourcing or external short-term staffing",

Managers and employees are regularly sensitized to the issues and given mandatory security and compliance training.\n- -Adaptation of our cloud service delivery to local or specific market requirements (such as local or regional data centers) and compliance with all local legal regulations regarding data protection and privacy as well as data security\n- -Contracts that require third-party data centers to have appropriate security and data protection and privacy terms in place. We establish contracts and SLA with our public cloud partners to ensure that data security and privacy measures meet local regulatory and compliance standards and SAP's own standards for data security and privacy.\n- -Strict internal policies and controls concerning utilization of our partner's cloud infrastructure, including people, process, and technology standards required to ensure compliance and cyberresilience\n- -Close monitoring of data center utilization, capacity, and pipeline for subsequent investment planning\n- -Regular risks reviews, disclosure requests, and audits to ensure public cloud providers meet SAP's data privacy and security standards\n- -PCI validated compliance by successful PCI DSS audits\n- -Investment in training and certifications concerning hyperscalers and related next-generation technologies\n- -Implementation of best-of-breed tools for IT operations management and automation\n\nIn the course of 2020, as part of our regular cybersecurity reviews, we identified that some of our cloud products did not meet one or more contractually agreed or statutory IT security standards. These findings were not identified in response to a security incident. Furthermore, we do not believe that any customer data was compromised as a result of these issues. We refer to our May 4, 2020, ad hoc notification for further details. In an effort to ensure that the affected products meet relevant terms and conditions, we updated the corresponding security-related terms and conditions. All identified gaps were resolved at the time of issuance of our half-year report in July 2020.\n\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that if risks of this risk factor were to occur, the impact could be business-critical. In consideration of the above-mentioned ad hoc notification, we have raised our estimate of the probability of occurrence to be likely. We now classify this risk factor as high.\n\nCybersecurity and Security: A cybersecurity attack or breach, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our products, infrastructure, or services, or economic espionage could result in significant legal and financial exposure.\n\nAs we continue to grow organically and through acquisitions, deliver a full portfolio of solutions via the cloud, host or manage elements of our customers' businesses in the cloud, process large amounts of data, and offer more mobile solutions to users, in each case either directly or through partners and other third parties, we face a progressively more complex and threatening cybersecurity environment. The severity of the challenges posed by this cybersecurity environment is amplified due to the increasingly sophisticated and malicious global cybersecurity threat landscape in which we operate, including third-party data, products, and services that we incorporate into SAP products and services, and the continually evolving and increasingly advanced techniques employed by threat actors targeting IT products and businesses in general. Such threat actors include, but are not limited to, highly sophisticated parties such as nation-states and organized criminal syndicates. As a leading cloud company and service provider to some of the largest and best-known customers in the world, we are naturally a prominent target for cybersecurity attacks. We have observed increased threat activity to our products and systems, and we experience cybersecurity attacks of varying types and degrees on a regular basis. When we become aware of unauthorized access to our systems, we take steps intended to identify and remediate the source and impact of the incursions, and steps to comply with related necessary notification and disclosure obligations. To date, none of the incursions identified have had a material adverse effect on our business. However, we do not have visibility into all unauthorized incursions and our systems may be experiencing ongoing incursions of which we are not aware. In addition, while we are continually taking steps to enhance our cybersecurity defenses, increased investments, coordination, and resources are required to achieve our objective of ensuring over time that our cybersecurity infrastructure meets or exceeds evolving industry standards. Achieving this objective will require continued effort and vigilance, including sustained investment of money and management resources in order to support the ongoing development and maintenance of systems that meet these standards. As a result, we are subject to risks and associated consequences in the following areas, among others:\n\n- -Identified or undetected cybersecurity defects and vulnerabilities\n- -Increased complexity, risk of exploitation, and potential vulnerabilities due to utilization of open-source software components\n- -Exposure of our business operations and service delivery due to a number of threats, including virtual attack, disruption, damage, unauthorized access, theft, destruction, industrial or economic espionage, serious or organized crime, and other illegal activities, as well as violent extremism and terrorism\n- -Misuse of data, social engineering or trespassers in our facilities, or systems being rendered unusable\n- -State-driven economic espionage or competitor-driven industrial espionage, and criminal activities including, but not limited to, cyberattacks and breaches against cloud services and hosted on-premise software, whether managed by us or our customers, partners, or other third parties",

However, due to the revised approach to risk reporting (for details, see the Risk Factors section), the total number of reported risks has concurrently decreased, also affecting the statistics and historical comparison. Consequently, risks with the risk level 'high' accounted for 50% and risks with the risk level 'medium' accounted for the remaining 50% of all risks reported in the Risk Factors section in 2020.\n\nIn our view, considering their impact level and likelihood of occurrence, the risks described in our aggregated risk report do not individually or cumulatively threaten our ability to continue as a going concern. Management remains confident that the Group's earnings strength forms a solid basis for our future business development and provides the necessary resource to pursue the opportunities available to the Group. Based on our structured processes for early risk identification, we are confident that we can continue to counter the challenges arising from the risks in our current risk profile in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Expected Developments and Opportunities\n\n## Future Trends in the Global Economy\n\nA number of headwinds cloud the near-term outlook for the global economy, states the European Central Bank (ECB) in its December 2020 Economic Bulletin. 1 The most significant among these are the renewed containment measures in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 infections, although these measures are expected to be more targeted and less disruptive to economic activity than those implemented during earlier stages of the pandemic. Furthermore, the unwinding of government support might negatively affect economic growth in 2021, particularly in advanced economies, the ECB predicts.\n\nOn the other hand, effective medical solutions such as vaccines against the coronavirus may become increasingly available, allowing for a gradual relaxation of the containment measures and thus triggering financial market optimism in the latter half of 2021. Overall, the ECB expects global economic growth to rebound in 2021 and achieve moderate growth again in 2022 and 2023. However, the pace of recovery will likely vary across regions, with emerging market economies projected to make the largest contribution in this regard.\n\nEconomic developments in the EMEA region will most likely remain uneven across countries and sectors. In the euro area, the ECB forecasts that weaker corporate balance sheets and uncertainty about the economic outlook could weigh on business investment. Nevertheless, over the medium term, containment measures will probably come to an end. Favorable financing conditions and an expansionary fiscal stance might then support the recovery of the euro area economy. In central and eastern Europe, the ECB expects economic recovery to come to a halt until early 2021 due to the worsening pandemic situation. Thereafter, the easing of restrictions together with fiscal and monetary measures could revive growth, which might however remain below its year-end 2019 level until early 2022. In Russia, the pace of recovery in 2021 could slow further amid an ongoing high number of infections and reduced room for fiscal support, says the ECB.\n\nRegarding the Americas region, the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and fading fiscal stimulus impair the near-term outlook in the United States. In Brazil, according to the ECB, elevated infection rates and limited fiscal space might drag on investment and consumption in the short and medium term, ultimately moderating the path of economic recovery.\n\nAs for the APJ region, the ECB expects the economic recovery in Japan to continue in 2021, albeit at a moderate pace. A third supplementary budget for the fiscal year 2020 should provide some additional support in the coming months. China, on the other hand, could account for about half of the region's post-pandemic recovery, reflecting the country's role in supplying medical and technology goods worldwide, says the ECB.\n\nWith regard to growth rates, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the following economic trends for the mid-term horizon until the end of 2021:\n\n## Economic Trends GDP Growth Year Over Year\n\n| %                                          | 2019   | 2020p   | 2021p   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| World                                      | 2.8    | - 3.5   | 5.5     |\n| Advanced Economies                         | 1.6    | - 4.9   | 4.3     |\n| Emerging Markets and Developing  Economies | 3.6    | - 2.4   | 6.3     |\n| Regions (according to IMF taxonomy)        |        |         |         |\n| Euro Area                                  | 1.3    | - 7.2   | 4.2     |\n| Germany                                    | 0.6    | - 5.4   | 3.5     |\n| Emerging and Developing Europe             | 2.2    | - 2.8   | 4.0     |\n| Middle East and Central Asia               | 1.4    | - 3.2   | 3.0     |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa                         | 3.2    | - 2.6   | 3.2     |\n| United States                              | 2.2    | - 3.4   | 5.1     |\n| Canada                                     | 1.9    | - 5.5   | 3.6     |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean            | 0.2    | - 7.4   | 4.1     |\n| Japan                                      | 0.3    | - 5.1   | 3.1     |\n| Emerging and Developing Asia               | 5.4    | - 1.1   | 8.3     |\n| China                                      | 6.0    | 2.3     | 8.1     |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Economic Outlook Update January 2021, Policy Support and Vaccines Expected to Lift Activity (https://www.imf.org/-\n\n/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2021/Update/January/English/text.ashx), p. 4.\n\n## The IT Market: Outlook for 2021 and Beyond\n\nWhile the ECB's outlook for the global economy in the immediate future is not very optimistic, International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S.-based market research firm, suggests a more positive outlook for the global IT market. Shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic experience, organizations are rethinking what their future will look like and what it will take for them to thrive in a changed business landscape. In a current IDC study, 60% of organizations report that they are planning to focus on new business and operating models following the pandemic. 2\n\nWith these plans comes a strong focus on digital technologies for remote access and communications. That is because these technologies can lead enterprises safely through lockdowns,",

        "page_content": "movement restrictions, social distancing, and supply disruptions, should this become necessary again. Fueled by the pandemic, products, services, and relationships might therefore shift from face-to-face to digital permanently. According to IDC, 65% of global GDP will be digitalized by 2022, 2 with enterprises not only introducing new applications but also modernizing over half of their existing installations by then to gain business agility. 4\n\nThis transition will require IT to evolve from a service provider to an element deeply integrated into core processes. 3 To IDC, this means that organizations will use IT to effectively transform data into insight and deliver lessons learned and predictions that improve decision-making and resilience. However, IDC also identifies an ethical dimension in advancing competitiveness through artificial intelligence (AI) and the governance of data. 2\n\nFor the coming years, resulting from these pandemic-driven new realities in a digital economy, IDC describes two main long-term, sustainable trends: platform thinking and the cloud shift. By the end of 2021, therefore, most enterprises (80%) will shift to cloudcentric infrastructures and applications twice as fast as compared to their pre-pandemic strategies. By 2024, the adoption of cloudnative architectures for core business applications might multiply by five. 2\n\nOver the same period, 25% of organizations will further expand their cloud platforms to improve their business agility, 4 according to IDC, and use cloud applications not only for integrating edge data but also for industry- and ecosystem-wide data sharing, paving the way for commercializing internally developed software. 3 As a result, software co-developed and owned by an industry consortium might displace 15% of the current enterprise application market by 2025, projects IDC. 2\n\n## Sources:\n\n## Impact on SAP\n\nSAP continues to be a key technology partner in helping customers and the broader community address challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the current macroeconomic uncertainties caused by the pandemic, the majority of SAP customers are taking advantage of the digital transformation to transform their business models, increase market share, and increase efficiency.\n\nWith our new RISE with SAP offering, we took a strategic step forward to accelerate the business transformation of our customers to the cloud to help make them more successful, become more agile, and improve resiliency. Furthermore, the faster adoption of new technologies and innovations helps enable our customers to differentiate better, increase competitiveness, and develop new business models.\n\nThis offering aligns well with the observed market shift to a stronger cloud adoption and platform adoption. In addition, our strategic cooperation projects with technology leaders as well as industry alliances in dedicated verticals aims to strengthen SAP's ecosystem and to create new market opportunities in the future.\n\n## Financial Targets and Prospects\n\n## Revenue and Operating Profit Targets and Prospects (Non-IFRS)\n\n## Outlook 2021\n\nSAP provides the following full-year 2021 outlook reflecting its solid business momentum and best estimates concerning the timing and pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This outlook assumes the pandemic will begin to recede as vaccine programs roll out globally, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the second half of 2021.\n\n- -SAP expects non-IFRS cloud revenue of between \u20ac9.1 billion and \u20ac9.5 billion at constant currencies (2020: \u20ac8.09 billion), up 13% to 18% at constant currencies.\n- -SAP expects non-IFRS cloud and software revenue of between \u20ac23.3 billion and \u20ac23.8 billion at constant currencies (2020 \u20ac23.23 billion), representing a growth rate of flat to 2% at constant currencies.\n- -SAP expects non-IFRS operating profit of between \u20ac7.8 billion and \u20ac8.2 billion at constant currencies (2020: \u20ac8.28 billion), down 1% to 6% at constant currencies.\n- -The share of more predictable revenue (defined as the total of cloud revenue and software support revenue) is expected to reach approximately 75% (2020: 72%).\n\nWe expect CCB to grow at a moderately higher rate than nonIFRS cloud revenue in 2021 reflecting customers' accelerating transformation into the cloud. Non-IFRS cloud revenue is expected to reach approximately three times the amount of non-IFRS software license revenue.\n\nWhile SAP's full-year 2021 business outlook is at constant currencies, actual currency reported figures are expected to be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations as the Company progresses through the year. See the table below for the full-year 2021 expected currency impacts. These currency expectations for the full-year 2021 are based on the December 2020 level.\n\n| In percentage points (pp)       | 2021            |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Cloud subscriptions and support | - 3pp to  - 5pp |\n| Cloud and software              | - 2pp to  - 4pp |\n| Operating profit                | - 2pp to  - 4pp |\n\nThe following table shows the estimates of the items that represent the differences between our non-IFRS financial measures and our IFRS financial measures.\n\n## Non-IFRS Measures\n\n| \u20ac millions                   | Estimated  Amounts for  2021   | Actual  Amounts  for 2020   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Revenue adjustments          | 0 - 30                         | 5                           |\n| Share-based payment expenses | 2,000 - 2,500                  | 1,084                       |\n| Acquisition-related charges  | 540 - 640                      | 577                         |\n| Restructuring                | 150 - 200                      | - 3                         |",

        "page_content": "The Company expects a full-year 2021 effective tax rate (IFRS) of 27.5% to 28.5% (2020: 26.8%) and an effective tax rate (nonIFRS) of 24.5% to 25.5% (2020: 26.5%). The difference between the effective tax rate (IFRS) and the effective tax rate (non-IFRS) results from tax effects on non-deductible expenses for sharebased payments, which are only recognized under IFRS.\n\n## Proposed Dividend\n\nIn line with our dividend policy of distributing at least a dividend totaling 40% or more of the prior year's profit after tax, we intend to pay a dividend of \u20ac1.85 per share (subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Shareholders Meeting in May 2021). For more information, see the Financial Performance: Review and Analysis section.\n\n## Medium-Term Prospects\n\nIn this section, all numbers are based exclusively on non-IFRS measures.\n\nSAP expects to grow its more predictable revenue while steadily increasing operating profit. Our strategic objectives are focused primarily on our main financial and non-financial objectives: growth, profitability, customer loyalty, and employee engagement.\n\nOn October 25, 2020, we replaced our previous midterm ambition issued on April 24, 2019, with a new 2025 ambition. The midterm ambition reflects the following factors:\n\n- -Changes in currency exchange rates (as at October 2020) which translated to a negative 3% to 4% effect on revenue and operating profit since April 2019\n- -The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to impact the demand environment, particularly in hard-hit industries, through at least the first half of 2021, pushing out the achievement of key metrics such as non-IFRS cloud revenue, total revenue, and operating profit, by one to two years.\n- -The acceleration of customers' move to the cloud and subsequent business transformations\n- -The accelerated harmonization of SAP's cloud delivery infrastructure, which is expected to require an incremental investment of a mid-triple-digit million euro amount over the course of 2021 and 2022\n\nAs a consequence of SAP's accelerated cloud transition, the\n\nCompany expects software licenses revenue to continue to trend lower from 2020 levels. In addition to other margin effects, specifically the accelerated cloud transition and the subsequent business transformations are expected to negatively impact the 2023 operating margin by approximately 4pp to 5pp relative to the previous midterm ambition. Additionally, we expect to modestly increase our non-IFRS cloud gross margins in 2021 and 2022 and expect a significant step-up as of 2023 due to expected efficiency gains.\n\nAlso, we expect the RISE with SAP offering to be a material contributor to non-IFRS cloud revenue growth. Through 2025, we estimate an approximately 2pp to 3pp contribution to the non-IFRS cloud revenue growth rate, both from each the conversion of established maintenance and from the conversion of software licenses sales to cloud subscriptions. We expect a non-IFRS cloud revenue growth rate for the rest of our portfolio outside of RISE with SAP in the high teens.\n\nThe combined impact of the above factors and the mechanics of the associated business model switch are expected to lead to muted non-IFRS total revenue growth as well as flat or slightly lower\n\nnon-IFRS operating profit over the next two years, followed by accelerated non-IFRS total revenue and double-digit non-IFRS operating profit growth from 2023 onwards.\n\n- By 2025, this trajectory is expected to take SAP to:\n- -More than \u20ac22 billion in non-IFRS cloud revenue\n- -More than \u20ac36 billion in non-IFRS total revenue\n- -More than \u20ac11.5 billion in non-IFRS operating profit\n- -A non-IFRS cloud gross margin of approximately 80%\n- -A significant expansion of the Company's more predictable revenue share to approximately 85%\n\n## Investment Goals\n\nOur planned investment expenditures for 2020 and 2021, other than for business combinations, consist primarily of the purchase of IT infrastructure and the construction activities described in the Assets (IFRS) section. We expect investments in IT infrastructure of approximately \u20ac480 million and in construction activities of approximately \u20ac240 million in 2021. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately \u20ac950 million. In 2022, capital expenditures are expected to stay at a similar level as in 2021.\n\n## Goals for Liquidity and Finance\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, we had a net debt of \u20ac6,503 million. We believe that our liquid assets, combined with our undrawn credit facilities, are sufficient to meet our operating financing needs in 2021 as well, and, together with expected cash flows from operations, will support debt repayments and our currently planned capital expenditure requirements over the near and medium term.\n\nIn 2021, compared to 2020, we expect a decline of operating cash flow from \u20ac7.2 billion to around \u20ac6.0 billion due to a moderately lower profit, higher income tax payments, and adverse foreign exchange impacts. Free cash flow is expected to decrease to a level of above \u20ac4.5 billion. For 2025, we expect around \u20ac8 billion in free cash flow.\n\nWe intend to repay \u20ac500 million in Eurobonds in 2021. In addition, we plan to repay the full or portions of the currently outstanding \u20ac1.25 billion Qualtrics acquisition term loan. The ratio of net debt as at December 31, 2020, of around \u20ac6.5 billion divided by the total of operating profit (IFRS) plus depreciation and amortization was below 0.8. For the years beyond 2021, we expect to reduce gross debt in line with our current maturity profile.\n\n## Non-Financial Goals 2021 and Ambitions for 2025\n\nIn addition to our financial goals, we also focus on three nonfinancial targets: customer loyalty, employee engagement, and carbon impact.\n\nFor 2021 through 2025, we aim to maintain employee engagement, as measured by the Employee Engagement Index, at a high level between 84% and 86% (2020: 86%).\n\nWe measure customer loyalty using the Customer Net Promoter Score (Customer NPS). We are targeting to increase the Customer NPS to a score of 5 to 10 in 2021 and to steadily increase the Customer NPS through 2025 (2020: 4).\n\nWe aim to reach net greenhouse gas emissions of 145 kilotons (kt) in 2021 (2020: 135 kt) with a steady decrease further on, reaching 0 kt by 2023 and maintaining a net-zero carbon footprint from that point onward.",

        "page_content": "## Premises on Which Our Outlook and Prospects Are Based\n\nIn preparing our outlook and prospects, we have taken into account all events known to us at the time we prepared this report that could influence SAP's business going forward.\n\n## Outlook for SAP SE\n\nThe primary source of revenue for SAP SE is the license fees it charges subsidiaries for the right to market and maintain SAP software solutions. Consequently, the performance of SAP SE in operating terms is closely tied to the cloud and the software revenue of the SAP Group. In particular, the assumptions regarding the development of the COVID-19 pandemic made for the SAP Group outlook therefore apply analogously to the outlook of SAP SE.\n\nBased on the outlook for cloud and software revenue for the SAP Group at constant currency in non-IFRS in 2021, we expect product revenue for SAP SE in 2021 to remain at the level of 2020.\n\nAssuming there are no significant effects from acquisitions or other unforeseeable occurrences in 2021, we also expect the operating profit of SAP SE to be at the level of 2020.\n\nThe financial ambitions of the SAP Group for the years 2022 to 2025 provide for future growth of revenue and profit. We expect that such growth will also result in revenue and profit growth for SAP SE to the same degree.\n\nWe expect that SAP SE will continue to receive investment income in the form of profit transfers and dividends from its subsidiaries. The growth we expect for the SAP Group should have a positive effect on this investment income.\n\nThe outlook for the SAP Group in respect to liquidity, finance, investment, and dividend are equally applicable to SAP SE.\n\nAmong the assumptions underlying this outlook are those presented above concerning the economy and our expectations for the performance of the SAP Group.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nOur customers choose SAP as a trusted partner for their digital business transformations. We believe in continuous, agile innovation to exceed customer expectations and achieve continuous growth, untapping incremental opportunities for our business. We have established a framework for opportunity management by evaluating and analyzing key areas such as current markets, external scenarios, economic conditions, and technological trends. We have also delved into customer and product segmentation, growth drivers, and industry-specific factors for success. Based on these combined insights, our Executive Board defines our market strategies. Our shareholder value relies heavily upon a fine balance of risk mitigation and value-driven opportunities. Therefore, our strong governance model ensures that decisions are based on return, investment required, and risk mitigation.\n\nAs far as opportunities are likely to occur, we have incorporated them into our business plans, our outlook for 2021, and our medium-term prospects outlined in this report. Therefore, the following section focuses on future trends or events that might result in an uplift of our outlook and medium-term prospects, if they develop better than we have anticipated in our forecasts.\n\nSAP SE is the parent company of the SAP Group and earns most of its revenue from subscription fees, software license fees, and\n\ndividends paid by affiliates. Consequently, the opportunities described below also apply - directly or indirectly - to SAP SE.\n\n## Opportunities from Economic Conditions\n\nEconomic conditions have a clear influence on our business, financial position, profit, and cash flows. Should the global economy recover faster than is reflected in our plans today, our revenue and profit may exceed our current outlook and medium-term prospects. Our medium-term planning considers changes in market conditions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In consideration of the negative effects of disruption, there might also be a positive effect in that the digitalization of business processes may be accelerated faster than beyond what was originally planned. For more information about future trends in the global economy and the IT market outlook, as well as their potential influence on SAP, see the beginning of the Expected Developments and Opportunities section.\n\n## Opportunities Through Innovation\n\nOur continued growth through innovation is based on our ability to leverage research and development (R&D) resources effectively. We continue to improve our products through design thinking and lean methodologies. We are accelerating innovation cycles, especially in the area of cloud solutions, and engaging more closely with our customers to enable success.\n\nIn addition, we continue to expand open innovation initiatives to support long-term innovation in strategic opportunity areas, supporting talented innovators both inside (employees, for example) and outside (startups, for example) of SAP.\n\nBased on our innovation capability, we see opportunities in growing product and market areas, such as in the enhancement of business processes with intelligent technologies, which are key to our Intelligent Enterprise strategy. Capabilities including machine learning and artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, the Internet of Things, and distributed computing, as well as robotic process automation (RPA), are also driving digital transformation.\n\nIn addition to the speed of innovation, we also focus on ease of adoption and consumption, so our customers can receive the benefits from our software applications and technologies at reduced time to value, enabling them to adopt our innovations faster. For example, the accelerated adoption of technology, which helps enable companies to transform into sustainable businesses, could result in additional upsell opportunities for customers migrating to the SAP S/4HANA suite.\n\nFor more information about future opportunities in research and development for SAP, see the Products, Research & Development, and Services section.\n\n## Opportunities from Our Strategy for Profitable Growth\n\nSAP strives to generate profitable growth across our portfolio of products, solutions, and services to keep or improve our market position. Our aim is to continue to expand our addressable market through the adjustment of our portfolio and our new technologies and innovations. The COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened the readiness in the market to consume software in the cloud, including core business process platforms. To the extent that this could result in an even faster shift of our core ERP offering adoption in the cloud than anticipated in our medium-term ambition, this may translate",

        "page_content": "into higher cloud and total revenue growth from 2023 onwards than currently provided for in our midterm ambition. On top of this, higher efficiency in our cloud delivery may positively affect the profitability of our cloud business.\n\nWe also see additional opportunities arising through potential future strategic partnerships, such as those for product lifecycle management, supply chain management, and asset management, announced in 2020, enabling a combined customer base to adopt new innovations more rapidly. Furthermore, SAP seeks to establish new business models and leverage our expanding ecosystem of partners to achieve scale and maximize opportunities.\n\nOur strong assets in applications and analytics, as well as database and technology, continue to offer solid multiyear growth opportunities as we bring innovative technologies with simplified consumption to our installed base and continue to acquire new customers.\n\nThe focus on greater customer success through our shift to a new operating model, which aligns sales, services, and customer engagement activities, may positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows. Together these potentials may result in our stated medium-term prospects being exceeded.\n\n## Opportunities from Our Partner Ecosystem\n\nSAP's partner ecosystem is defined by the interdependent relationships of our customers, our employees, our suppliers, our partners, and our competition. SAP has made a decisive shift to the cloud to meet the needs of current and future customers. This move further enriches the value of the SAP ecosystem and will deliver financial opportunity to SAP as we innovate with partners on industry cloud solutions and SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) to create products and solutions for customers.\n\nWorking with partners allows SAP to expand our presence in existing and new markets and industries, offer a variety of solutions and applications on SAP BTP, and transform our partner ecosystem through Next-Generation Partnering initiatives. Partners are responding positively to our next-generation partnering efforts to improve our partner experience, reduce the cost of doing business with SAP, and increase innovation opportunities.\n\nOur ecosystem, which includes more than 22,000 partners with different areas of expertise, allows partners to build innovative extensions for SAP applications on SAP BTP so customers can be\n\nsuccessful as they embark upon their journeys to become intelligent enterprises. Our partners bring their expertise in specific industries to our portfolio of cloud applications, which are designed to address industry needs. By using these applications as a platform for innovation of their own, our partners help drive adoption of SAP's industry cloud solutions.\n\nWe further support partner innovation through the Partner Solution Progression framework launched at the beginning of 2020 and help partners scale their solutions with the new revenueshare model SAP Endorsed Apps and with the newly enhanced SAP App Center .\n\nEven in the challenging business environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, partners continue to generate revenue for SAP. Partners support our goals by retaining and increasing sales to existing customers, attracting new customers, and satisfying our joint customers' requirements through innovation. And this, together with the interaction of all the above-mentioned measures may positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows, and result in their exceeding our stated medium-term prospects.\n\n## Opportunities from Our Employees\n\nOur employees drive innovation, provide value to our customers, and consistently enable our growth and profitability. As described in the Employees and Social Investments section, we continuously invest in our people to retain their high level of engagement, further strengthen their skills, foster an agile and innovative organization, ensure a healthy, diverse, and inclusive workforce, and social commitment. By doing so, we anticipate improvements in our employee productivity and innovation capabilities.\n\nOur outlook and medium-term prospects are based on certain assumptions regarding employee retention and our Business Health Culture Index (as defined in the Employees and Social Investments section). Should these develop better than expected, there might be a gain in employee productivity and engagement. A strongerthan-expected increase in the Employee Engagement Index can therefore be an opportunity that could positively impact our revenue, profit, and cash flows, and result in their exceeding our stated medium-term prospects.\n\nFor more information about future opportunities relating to our employees, see the Employees and Social Investments section.",

The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2020 of SAP SE and its subsidiaries (collectively, 'we,' 'us,' 'our,' 'SAP,' 'Group,' and 'Company') have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nWe have applied all IFRS standards and interpretations that were effective on and endorsed by the European Union (EU) as at December 31, 2020. There were no standards or interpretations as at December 31, 2020, impacting our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, that were effective but not yet endorsed. Therefore, our Consolidated Financial Statements comply with both, IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as endorsed by the EU.\n\nOur Executive Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements on February 24, 2021, for submission to our Supervisory Board which approved the Consolidated Financial Statements on the same day.\n\nAll amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in millions of euros (\u20ac millions) except where otherwise stated. As figures are rounded, numbers presented throughout this document may not add up precisely to the totals we provide and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\nAmounts disclosed in the Notes that are taken directly from our Consolidated Income Statements or our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are marked with the symbols and , respectively.\n\n## Comparative Figures\n\nEffective January 1, 2019, we started to apply IFRS 16 'Leases' using the modified retrospective transition approach. We recognized the cumulative effect of the initial application of the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of initial application while the prior year figures for the financial year 2018 were not adjusted.\n\n## Accounting Policies, Management Judgments, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\n## How We Present Our Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\n\nTo ease the understanding of our financial statements, we present the accounting policies, management judgments, and sources of estimation uncertainty (hereafter: accounting policies, judgments, and estimates) on a given subject together with other disclosures related to the same subject in the Note that deals with\n\nthis subject. Accounting policies, judgments, and estimates that do not relate to a specific subject are presented in the following section.\n\nFor easier identification of our accounting policies, judgments, and estimates, the respective disclosures are marked with the symbol and highlighted with a light gray box. They focus on the accounting choices made within the framework of the prevailing IFRS and refrain from repeating the underlying promulgated IFRS guidance, unless we consider it particularly important to the understanding of a Note's content.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of where our accounting policies, management judgments, and estimates are disclosed:\n\n| Note   | Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates     |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| (IN.1) | Basis for Preparation                             |\n| (IN.2) | Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic             |\n| (A.1)  | Revenue                                           |\n| (A.2)  | Trade and Other Receivables                       |\n| (A.3)  | Capitalized Cost from Contracts with Customers    |\n| (A.4)  | Customer-Related Provisions                       |\n| (B.3)  | Share-Based Payments                              |\n| (B.4)  | Pension Plans and Similar Obligations             |\n| (B.5)  | Other Employee-Related Obligations                |\n| (B.6)  | Restructuring                                     |\n| (C.1)  | Results of Segments                               |\n| (C.5)  | Income Taxes                                      |\n| (D.1)  | Business Combinations and Divestitures            |\n| (D.2)  | Goodwill                                          |\n| (D.3)  | Intangible Assets                                 |\n| (D.4)  | Property, Plant, and Equipment                    |\n| (D.5)  | Leases                                            |\n| (D.6)  | Equity Investments                                |\n| (E.3)  | Liquidity                                         |\n| (F.1)  | Financial Risk Factors and Risk Management        |\n| (F.2)  | Fair Value Disclosures on Financial Instruments   |\n| (G.1)  | Prepaid Expenses and Other Tax Assets             |\n| (G.3)  | Other Litigation, Claims, and Legal Contingencies |\n| (G.5)  | Executive and Supervisory Board Compensation      |",

Consequently, this line item primarily includes employee expenses relating to these services, amortization of acquired intangibles, fees for third-party licenses, depreciation of our property, plant, and equipment (for example, of our data centers in which we host our cloud solutions), and costs for third-party hosting services. For more information about the capitalization of costs from contracts with customers, see Note (A.3).\n\n## Cost of Services\n\nCost of services includes the costs incurred in providing the services that generate service revenue. Consequently, this line item primarily includes employee expenses and related training, system and system administration costs, costs for third-party resources, and costs for enabling mobile information and mobile commerce services.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development includes the costs incurred by activities related to the development of software solutions (new products, updates, and enhancements) including resource and hardware costs for the development systems. For more information about the\n\nrecognition of internally generated intangible assets from development, see Note (D.3).\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing includes the costs incurred for the selling activities (such as sales commissions and amortization of capitalized sales commissions) and marketing activities related to our software and cloud solutions and our service portfolio. For more information about the capitalization of costs from contracts with customers, see Note (A.3).\n\n## General and Administration\n\nGeneral and administration includes the costs related to finance and administrative functions, human resources, and general management as long as they are not directly attributable to one of the other operating expense line items.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management Judgments and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent liabilities.\n\nWe base our judgments, estimates, and assumptions on historical and forecast information, and on regional and industry economic conditions in which we or our customers operate.

Due to the currently unforeseeable global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, these management judgments and estimates are subject to increased uncertainty. Actual amounts may differ from the management judgments and estimates; changes can have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. All available information on the expected economic developments and country-specific governmental mitigation measures was included when updating the management judgments and estimates. This information was also included in the analysis of the recoverability and collectability of assets and receivables.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to evolve, it is difficult to predict its duration and the magnitude of its impact on assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows. We based our financial-statementrelated estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available, and applied a scenario that assumes the COVID-19 situation will begin to recover as vaccine programs roll out globally, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the second half of 2021.\n\nFor more information about the impact on goodwill, see Note (D.2).\n\nWe will continue to analyze possible future effects on the measurement of individual assets and liabilities.\n\nSAP's customers, particularly those in hard-hit industries, continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to lockdowns in certain countries/regions, the level of impact and recovery is diverse and companies continue to face business uncertainty.

These include but are not limited to explanations of how we recognize revenue, revenue disaggregation, and information about our trade receivables and customer-related obligations.\n\n## (A.1)  Revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting for Revenue from Contracts with Customers Classes of Revenue\n\nWe derive our revenue from fees charged to our customers for the use of our hosted cloud offerings, for licenses to our on-premise software products, and for standardized and premium support services, consulting, customer-specific software developments, training, and other services.\n\nCloud and software revenue, as presented in our Consolidated Income Statements, is the sum of our cloud revenue, our software license revenue, and our software support revenue.\n\n- -Cloud revenue represents fees earned from providing customers with any of the following:\n- \u25aa Software as a service (SaaS), that is, a right to use software functionality (including standard functionalities and custom cloud applications and extensions) in a cloud-based infrastructure hosted by SAP or third parties engaged by SAP, where the customer does not have the right to terminate the hosting contract and take possession of the software to either run it on its own IT infrastructure or to engage a third-party provider unrelated to SAP to host and manage the software; SaaS also includes transaction and agent fees for transactions that customers of our network business execute on our cloudbased transaction platforms.\n- \u25aa Platform as a service (PaaS), that is, access to a cloud-based infrastructure to develop, run, and manage applications\n- \u25aa Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), that is, hosting and related application management services for software hosted by SAP or third parties engaged by SAP\n- \u25aa Premium cloud support beyond the regular support that is embedded in the basic cloud subscription fees\n- -Software license revenue represents fees earned from the sale or license of software to customers for use on the customer's premises, in other words, where the customer has the right to take possession of the software for installation on the customer's premises or on hardware of third-party hosting providers unrelated to SAP (on-premise software). Software license revenue includes revenue from both the sale of our standard software products and customer-specific on-premise-software development agreements.\n- -Software support revenue represents fees earned from providing customers with standardized support services that comprise unspecified future software updates, upgrades, and enhancements as well as technical product support services for on-premise software products.\n\nServices revenue primarily represents fees earned from professional consulting services, premium support services, training services, and messaging services.\n\n## Identification of Contract\n\nWe frequently enter into multiple contracts with the same customer. For accounting purposes, we treat these contracts as a single contract if they are entered into at or near the same time and are economically interrelated. We do not combine contracts with closing days more than three months apart because we do not consider them being entered into near the same time. Judgment is required in evaluating whether various contracts are interrelated, which includes considerations as to whether they were negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective, whether the amount of consideration on one contract is dependent on the performance of the other contract, or if some or all goods in the contracts are a single performance obligation.\n\nNew arrangements with existing customers can be either a new contract or the modification of prior contracts with the customer. Our judgment in making this determination considers whether there is a connection between the new arrangement and the pre-existing contracts, whether the goods and services under the new arrangement are highly interrelated with the goods and services sold under prior contracts, and how the goods and services under the new arrangement are priced. In determining whether a change in transaction price represents a contract modification or a change in variable consideration, we examine whether the change in price results from changing the contract or from applying unchanged existing contract provisions.\n\n## Identification of Performance Obligations\n\nOur customer contracts often include various products and services. Typically, the products and services outlined in the Classes of Revenue section qualify as separate performance obligations and the portion of the contractual fee allocated to them is recognized separately. Judgment is required, however, in determining whether a good or service is considered a separate performance obligation. In particular for our professional services and implementation activities, judgment is required to evaluate whether such services significantly integrate, customize, or modify the on-premise software or cloud service to which they relate. In this context, we consider the nature of the services and their volume relative to the volume of the on-premise software or cloud service to which they relate. In general, the implementation services for our cloud services go beyond pure setup activities and qualify as separate performance obligations. Similarly, our on-premise implementation services and our custom development services typically qualify as separate performance obligations. Non-distinct goods and services are combined into one distinct bundle of goods and services (combined performance obligation).",

        "page_content": "When selling goods or services, we frequently grant customers options to acquire additional goods or services (for example, renewals of renewable offerings, or additional volumes of purchased software). We apply judgment in determining whether such options provide a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into that contract (material right options). In this judgment, we consider, for example, whether the options entitle the customer to a discount that exceeds the discount granted for the respective goods or services sold together with the option.\n\n## Determination of Transaction Price\n\nWe apply judgment in determining the amount to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. This includes estimates as to whether and to what extent subsequent concessions may be granted to customers and whether the customer is expected to pay the contractual fees. In this judgment, we consider our history with the respective customer or on a portfolio basis.\n\nOur typical cloud services do not provide the customer with a software license because the customer does not have the right to terminate the hosting contract and take possession of the software. Consequently, cloud fees that are based on transaction volumes are considered in the transaction price based on estimates rather than being accounted for as sales-based license royalties.\n\nOnly very rarely do our contracts include significant financing components. We do not account for financing components if the period between when SAP transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services is one year or less.\n\n## Allocation of Transaction Price\n\nWe have established a hierarchy to identify the standalone selling prices (SSPs) that we use to allocate the transaction price of a customer contract to the performance obligations in the contract.\n\n- -Where standalone selling prices for an offering are observable and reasonably consistent across customers (that is, not highly variable), our SSP estimates are derived from our respective pricing history. Typically, our standardized support offerings and our professional service offerings follow this approach.\n- -Where sales prices for an offering are not directly observable or highly variable across customers, we use estimation techniques. For renewable offerings with highly variable pricing across customers, these techniques consider the individual contract's expected renewal price as far as this price is substantive. Typically, our cloud offerings follow this approach. For nonrenewable offerings, these estimations follow a cost-plus-margin approach.\n- -For offerings that lack renewals, have highly variable pricing, and lack substantial direct costs to estimate based on a cost-plusmargin approach, we allocate the transaction price by applying a residual approach. We use this technique in particular for our standard on-premise software offerings.\n\nJudgment is required when estimating SSPs. To judge whether the historical pricing of our goods and services is highly variable, we have established thresholds of pricing variability. For judging whether contractual renewal prices are substantive, we have\n\nestablished floor prices that we use as SSPs whenever the contractual renewal prices are below these floor prices. In judging whether contracts are expected to renew at their contractual renewal prices, we rely on our respective renewal history. The SSPs of material right options depend on the probability of option exercise. In estimating these probabilities, we apply judgment considering historical exercise patterns.\n\nWe review the SSPs periodically or whenever facts and circumstances change to ensure the most objective input parameters available are used.\n\n## Recognition of Revenue\n\nCloud revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Where our performance obligation is the grant of a right to continuously access and use a cloud offering for a certain term, revenue is recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over this term.\n\nSoftware revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time depending on whether we deliver standard software, customerspecific software, or software subscription contracts that combine the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future, unspecified software products:\n\n- -Licenses for our standard on-premise software products are typically delivered by providing the customer with access to download the software. The license period starts when such access is granted. We recognize revenue for these on-premise licenses at the point in time when the customer has access to and thus control over the software. In judging whether our onpremise software offerings grant customers a right to use, rather than a right to access, our intellectual property, we have considered the usefulness of our software without subsequent updates to it.\n- -Typically, our customer-specific on-premise software development agreements:\n- \u25aa Are for software developed for specific needs of individual customers and therefore it does not have any alternative use for us\n- \u25aa Provide us with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date\n\nFor such development agreements, we recognize revenue over time as the software development progresses. Judgment is required in identifying an appropriate method to measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of such performance obligations. We typically measure progress of our development agreements based on the direct costs incurred to date in developing the software as a percentage of the total reasonably estimated direct costs to fully complete the development work (percentage-of-completion method). This method of measuring progress faithfully depicts the transfer of the development services to the customer, as substantially all of these costs are cost of the staff or third parties performing the development work. In estimating the total cost to fully complete the development work, we consider our history with similar projects.\n\n- -For agreements that combine the delivery of software and the obligation to deliver, in the future, unspecific software products,",

        "page_content": "we recognize revenue at a point in time for licenses that are made immediately accessible to the customer. We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the software subscription contract for the unspecified software products, as our performance obligation is to stand ready to deliver such products on a when-and-ifavailable basis.\n\nSoftware support revenue is typically recognized based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the term of the support arrangement. Under our standardized support services, our performance obligation is to stand ready to provide technical product support and unspecified updates, upgrades, and enhancements on a when-andif-available basis. Our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of these support services as we perform.\n\nService revenue is typically recognized over time. Where we stand ready to provide the service (such as access to learning content), we recognize revenue based on time elapsed and thus ratably over the service period. Consumption-based services (such as separately identifiable consulting services and premium support services, messaging services, and classroom training services) are recognized over time as the services are utilized, typically following the percentage-of-completion method or ratably. When using the percentage-of-completion method, we typically measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation in the same way and with the same reasoning and judgment as we do for customer-specific on-premise software development agreements. We apply judgment in determining whether a service qualifies as a stand-ready service or as a consumption-based service.\n\nRevenue for combined performance obligations is recognized over the longest period of all promises in the combined performance obligation.\n\nJudgment is also required to determine whether revenue is to be recognized at a point in time or over time. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we need to measure progress using the method that best reflects SAP's performance. When using cost incurred as a measure of progress for recognizing revenue over time, we apply judgment in estimating the total cost to satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nAll of the judgments and estimates mentioned above can significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\nWe recognize trade receivables for performance obligations satisfied over time gradually as the performance obligation is satisfied and in full once the invoice is due. Judgment is required in determining whether a right to consideration is unconditional and thus qualifies as a receivable.\n\nContract liabilities primarily reflect invoices due or payments received in advance of revenue recognition.\n\nTypically, we invoice fees for on-premise standard software on contract closure and software delivery. Periodic fixed fees for cloud subscription services, software support services, and other multiperiod agreements are typically invoiced yearly or quarterly in advance. Such fee prepayments account for the majority of our contract liability balance. Fees based on actual transaction volumes for cloud subscriptions and fees charged for non-periodical services are invoiced as the services are delivered. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type and region, our terms typically require payment within 30 to 60 days.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nThe amounts for revenue by region in the following tables are based on the location of customers.

        "page_content": "## Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nAmounts of a customer contract's transaction price that are allocated to the remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. They include amounts recognized as contract liabilities and amounts that are contracted but not yet due.\n\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as at December 31, 2020, is \u20ac33.4 billion (December 31, 2019: \u20ac33.3 billion). This amount mostly comprises obligations to provide software support or cloud subscriptions services, as the respective contracts typically have durations of one or multiple years. The portion of remaining performance obligations related to services consists of noncancelable revenue from contracts for projects with a predefined output. 5\n\nThe majority of this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months following the respective balance sheet date. This estimate is based on our best judgment, as it needs to consider estimates of possible future contract modifications. The amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and changes in this amount over time, are impacted by, among others:\n\n- -Currency fluctuations\n- -The contract period of our cloud and software support contracts remaining at the balance sheet date and thus by the timing of contract renewals\n\n## Contract Balances\n\nContract liabilities as at December 31, 2020, were \u20ac4.2 billion (December 31, 2019: \u20ac4.4 billion).\n\nIncreases in contract liabilities mainly result from billing and invoices becoming due (\u20ac8.5 billion). Decreases in contract liabilities mainly result from satisfying performance obligations (\u20ac8.4 billion).\n\nThe amount of revenue recognized in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the reporting period was \u20ac3.5 billion (December 31, 2019: \u20ac2.6 billion).\n\n## (A.2)  Trade and Other Receivables\n\n## Accounting for Trade and Other Receivables\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe measure trade receivables and contract assets from contracts with customers at amortized cost less expected credit losses. We account for expected credit losses by recording an allowance on a portfolio basis. We apply the simplified impairment approach in that,\n\non initial measurement of the receivables, we consider all credit losses that are expected to occur during the lifetime of the receivables. We use a provision matrix to estimate these losses.\n\nAdditionally, we recognize allowances for individual receivables if there is objective evidence of credit impairment.\n\nAccount balances are written off either partially or in full if we judge that the likelihood of recovery is remote.\n\nFor information about how the default risk for trade receivables is analyzed and managed, how the loss rates for the provision matrix are determined, how credit impairment is determined and what our criteria for write-offs are, see the section on credit risk in Note (F.1).\n\nIn our Consolidated Income Statements, net gains/losses include income/expenses from expected credit loss allowances from applying the provision matrix, from credit-impaired customer balances, and from write-offs and related reversals which are included in other operating income/expense, net. Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net.\n\nDetermining our expected credit loss allowance involves significant judgment. In this judgment, we primarily consider our historical experience with credit losses in the respective provision matrix risk class and current data on overdue receivables. We expect that our historical default rates represent a reasonable approximation for future expected customer defaults. Besides historical data, our judgment used in developing the provision matrix considers reasonable and supportable forward-looking information (for example, changes in country risk ratings, and fluctuations in credit default swaps of the countries in which our customers are located).\n\nThe assessment of whether a receivable is collectible involves the use of judgment and requires us to make assumptions about customer defaults that could change significantly.\n\nIn applying this judgment, we evaluate available information about a particular customer's financial situation to determine whether it is probable that a credit loss had occurred and, if so, whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. If it is, an allowance for that specific account is then necessary. Basing the expected credit loss allowance for the remaining receivables primarily on our historical loss experience likewise requires judgment, as history may not be indicative of future development. Also, including reasonable and supportable forward-looking information in the loss rates of the expected credit loss allowance requires judgment, as they may not provide a reliable prognosis for future development.\n\n## Trade and Other Receivables\n\n| \u20ac millions             | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   |\n|------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                        | Current      | Non-Current  | Total        | Current      | Non-Current  | Total        |\n| Trade receivables, net | 6,199        | 33           | 6,232        | 7,561        | 21           | 7,582        |\n| Other receivables      | 395          | 103          | 498          | 346          | 108          | 454          |\n| Total                  | 6,593        | 137          | 6,730        | 7,908        | 129          | 8,037        |\n\nContract assets as at December 31, 2020, were \u20ac295 million (December 31, 2019: \u20ac234 million).",

We capitalize such cumulative target commissions for all customer contracts that count towards the cumulative target but only if nothing other than obtaining customer contracts can contribute to achieving the cumulative target. Commissions for contracts with multiple performance obligations or for probable renewals thereof are allocated to these performance obligations and probable renewals relative to the respective standalone selling price.\n\nTypically, we either do not pay sales commissions for customer contract renewals or such commissions are not commensurate with the commissions paid for new contracts. Thus, the commissions paid for renewable new contracts also relate to expected renewals of these contracts. Consequently, we amortize sales commissions paid for new customer contracts on a straight-line basis over the expected contract life including probable contract renewals. Judgment is required in estimating these contract lives. In exercising this judgment, we consider our respective renewal history adjusted for indications that the renewal history is not fully indicative of future renewals. The amortization periods range from 18 months to eight years depending on the type of offering and reflect our strategy as communicated in 2020 to expedite our customers' transition from the on-premise business model of perpetual license and support towards the cloud subscription model. Amortization of the capitalized costs of obtaining customer contracts is classified as sales and marketing expense.\n\nWe expense incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract as incurred if we expect an amortization period of one year or less.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Costs to Fulfill Customer Contracts\n\nCapitalized costs incurred to fulfill customer contracts mainly consist of direct costs for set-up and implementation of cloud products and custom cloud development contracts as far as these costs are not in scope of other standards than IFRS 15. These costs are amortized after completion of the setup and implementation or the development, respectively, on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the cloud subscription contract and including expected renewals. Derived from our respective renewal history, and considering indications that the renewal history is not fully indicative of future renewals, the amortization period is typically seven to eight years. In addition, the capitalized costs include third-party license fees which are amortized over the term of the third-party license\n\ncontract. Judgment is required in evaluating whether costs are direct or indirect and in estimating contract lives.\n\nAmortization of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts for custom cloud applications and extensions is included in the cost of cloud.\n\n## Capitalized Cost from Contracts with Customers\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                         | 2020    | 2020         | 2020   | 2019    | 2019         | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|\n|                                                                    | Current | Non- Current | Total  | Current | Non- Current | Total  |\n| Capitalized cost  of obtaining  customer  contracts                | 491     | 1,536        | 2,028  | 414     | 1,318        | 1,732  |\n| Capitalized cost  to fulfill customer  contracts                   | 91      | 151          | 242    | 66      | 117          | 183    |\n| Capitalized  contract cost                                         | 583     | 1,687        | 2,270  | 480     | 1,435        | 1,915  |\n| Other non- financial assets                                        | 1,321   | 1,926        | 3,247  | 1,188   | 1,701        | 2,889  |\n| Capitalized  contract cost  as % of   other  non-financial  assets | 44      | 88           | 70     | 40      | 84           | 66     |\n\n## Amortization Expense\n\n| \u20ac millions                                       |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Capitalized cost of obtaining customer contracts |    450 |    367 |\n| Capitalized cost to fulfill customer contracts   |    129 |     81 |\n\n## (A.4)  Customer-Related Provisions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expected Contract Losses\n\nCustomer-related provisions mainly include expected contract losses.

The respective expenses are recognized as employee benefits and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities that the employees perform. Where we economically hedge our exposure to cash-settled\n\nawards, changes in the fair value of the respective hedging instruments are also recognized as employee benefits expenses in profit or loss. The fair values of hedging instruments are based on market data reflecting current market expectations. For more information about the equity price risk, see Note (F.1).\n\n## Valuation, Judgment, and Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nWe use certain assumptions in estimating the fair values for our share-based payments, including expected share price volatility and expected award life (which represents our estimate of the average remaining life until the awards are exercised or expire unexercised). In addition, the final payout for plans also depends on the achievement of performance indicators and on our share price on the respective exercise dates. Changes to these assumptions and outcomes that differ from these assumptions could require material adjustments to the carrying amount of the liabilities we have recognized for these share-based payments. The fair value of the share units granted under the LTI 2016 Plan are dependent on our performance against a group of peer companies (Peer Group Index), the volatility, and the expected correlation between the price of the index and our share price. The fair value of the share units granted under the LTI 2020 are dependent on our performance against the total shareholder return (TSR) for NASDAQ-100 companies, the volatility, and the expected correlation between the TSR of the NASDAQ-100 companies and our TSR.",

        "page_content": "We believe that the expected volatility is the most sensitive assumption we use in estimating the fair values of our share options. Regarding future payout under our cash-settled plans, the SAP share price is the most relevant factor. With respect to our LTI 2016 Plan, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted not only by our share price but also by the relative performance against the Peer Group Index. With respect to our LTI 2020, we believe that future payout will be significantly impacted not only by our share price but also by the relative performance against the NASDAQ-100 companies. Future payouts under our LTI\u00b02020 will also be dependent on meeting non-market-based performance conditions based on SAP's long-term strategy. The latter, however, is not incorporated into our fair value calculation but leads to adjustments of the quantity. Changes in these factors could significantly affect the estimated fair values as calculated by the valuation model, and the future payout.\n\nUnder certain programs, we grant our employees discounts on purchases of SAP shares. Since those discounts are not dependent on future services to be provided by our employees, the discount is recognized as an expense when the discounts are granted.\n\n## Presentation in the Statements of Cash Flows\n\nWe present the payments of our share-based payment plans separately in our Statements of Cash Flows under cash flows from operating activities. As a result, the changes in other assets and in other liabilities presented in the reconciliation of operating cash flow no longer consider share-based payment-related assets or liabilities.\n\nThe operating expense line items in our income statement include the following share-based payment expenses:\n\n## Share-Based Payment Expenses by Functional Area\n\n| \u20ac millions                                   | 2020   | 2019   |   2018 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of cloud                                | 40     | 56     |     27 |\n| Cost of software                             | 55     | 82     |     51 |\n| Cost of services                             | 175    | 246    |    142 |\n| Research and development                     | 296    | 429    |    210 |\n| Sales and marketing                          | 360    | 562    |    312 |\n| General and administration                   | 157    | 461    |     88 |\n| Share-based payment  expenses                | 1,084  | 1,835  |    830 |\n| Thereof cash-settled share- based payments   | 893    | 1,664  |    674 |\n| Thereof equity-settled  share-based payments | 191    | 171    |    156 |\n\nIn 2020, we paid \u20ac46\u00b0million (2019: \u20ac79 million) in share-based payments that became fully vested because of terminations due to operational reasons in connection with our restructuring plan in 2019. These payments as well as the expense portion initially allocated to future services were classified as share-based payments and not as restructuring expenses.\n\n## a) Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments\n\nOur major share-based payment plans are described below.\n\n## SAP Long-Term Incentive Program 2020 (LTI 2020)\n\nThe LTI 2020 is a long-term, multi-year performance-based compensation element that is awarded in annual tranches. The LTI 2020 reflects SAP's long-term strategy and thus sets uniform incentives for the Executive Board members to achieve key targets from the long-term strategic plans. The LTI 2020 also serves to reward the Executive Board members for long-term SAP share price performance as compared to the market, thus ensuring that shareholders' interests are also honored. In addition, the LTI 2020 includes a component designed to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members.\n\nThe LTI 2020 is a virtual share program under which annual tranches with a term of approximately four years each are granted. When the individual tranches are awarded, a certain grant amount specified in the Executive Board member's service contract is converted into virtual shares (share units) in each case. For this purpose, the grant amount is divided by the price of the SAP share which corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole (grant price). The share units so allocated are composed of 1/3 financial performance share units (FSUs), 1/3 market performance share units (MSUs), and 1/3 retention share units (RSUs). All three types of share unit have a vesting period of approximately four years. In contrast to RSUs, FSUs and MSUs are subject to changes in quantity. In this context, the following applies:\n\nThe number of FSUs initially awarded is multiplied by a performance factor. The performance factor consists of three equally weighted individual factors relating to the three non-IFRS KPIs at constant currencies, namely: total revenue, cloud revenue, and operating income. The performance period throughout which the target achievement for these three KPIs is measured starts at the beginning of the financial year in which the FSUs are awarded and concludes upon the end of the second year following the year in which the share units were awarded. A numerical target value equaling 100% target achievement is set for each KPI. This constitutes, in each case, a cumulative value for the three years of the performance period. The KPIs are derived from SAP's long-term strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe number of MSUs initially awarded is likewise multiplied by a performance factor. The performance factor depends on the amount of the total shareholder return (TSR) on the SAP share, measured for an entire performance period of approximately three years,",

If the TSR on the SAP share over the performance period is negative, the maximum performance factor will, however, in deviation from the summary above, be 100%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performance of the share units is linked to the performance of the SAP share price, including dividend payments. Accordingly, an amount is paid out for each share unit which equals the SAP share price plus those dividends disbursed in respect of an SAP share in the period from the beginning of the year in which the share units were awarded until the end of the third year following the year in which the share units were awarded. The arithmetic mean of the SAP share price on the 20 trading days after scheduled publication of the preliminary results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole will be used as the SAP share price. The payout amount per share unit, including the dividend amounts due on the share units, is capped at 200% of the grant price. The tranche is cash-settled and paid in euros after the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the corresponding year.\n\nIf an Executive Board member's service contract is terminated before the end of the third year following the year in which the share units were granted, the RSUs and PSUs are forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or termination of the service contract.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive 2016 Plan (LTI 2016 Plan)\n\nThe purpose of the LTI 2016 Plan was to reward our Executive Board members for the annual achievement of SAP's operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) targets, to ensure long-term retention of our Executive Board members, and to reward them for the long-term SAP share price performance as compared to its main peer group (Peer Group).\n\nAn LTI tranche was granted annually and has a term of four years (2016-2019 tranches). Each grant started with determining a grant amount in euros. The grant amount was based on the Executive Board members' contractual LTI target amount and the operating profit target achievement for the previous year. The Supervisory Board set the grant amount at a level between 80% and 120% of the contractual LTI target amount, taking into account the operating profit target achievement. This grant amount was converted into virtual shares, referred to as share units, by dividing the grant amount by the grant price. The grant price was the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices of the SAP share on the 20 trading days following the publication of SAP's fourth-quarter results.\n\nAll share units granted in this way, comprising 60% Performance Share Units (PSUs) and 40% Retention Share Units (RSUs), have a vesting period of approximately four years. At the end of the vesting period, the corresponding share units are non-forfeitable. The\n\npayout price used for the settlement is the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices of the SAP share on the 20 trading days following the publication of SAP's fourth-quarter results subsequent to the end of the vesting period. The payout price is capped at 300% of the grant price. The LTI tranche is cash-settled and paid in euros after the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting of the corresponding year.\n\nThe number of PSUs ultimately paid out depends on the performance of the SAP share - absolute and relative to the Peer Group Index. In contrast, the final number of RSUs is fixed. SAP's absolute share price performance is measured by comparing the grant price against the payout price. If the SAP share price performance equals the Peer Group Index performance over the same period, the performance factor is set at 100%. If the SAP share price performs better than the Peer Group Index (measured as difference between SAP share price performance and Peer Group Index performance), the performance factor is increased by the percentage point of the outperformance of the SAP share price. The percentage point is doubled if, additionally, the payout price is higher than the grant price. The performance factor is capped at 150%. If the Peer Group Index performs better than the SAP share price, the performance factor is decreased by the percentage point of the outperformance of the Peer Group Index. All PSUs lapse if the performance factor is below 50%.\n\nIf an Executive Board member's service contract is terminated before the end of the third year following the year in which the share units were granted, both the RSUs and PSUs are forfeited in whole or in part, depending on the circumstances of the relevant resignation from office or termination of the service contract.\n\n## Restricted Stock Unit Plan Including Move SAP Plan and Grow SAP Plan (RSU Plan)\n\nTo retain and motivate executives and certain employees, we grant virtual shares representing a contingent right to receive a cash payment determined by the SAP share price and the number of share units that ultimately vest. In June 2020, we granted share units under the new Grow SAP Plan. This fixed term plan has broadly the same terms and conditions as the Move SAP Plan, recognizes all employees' commitment to SAP's success, and deepens their participation in our future company performance.\n\nGranted share units will vest in different tranches, either:\n\n- -Over a half-year service period only\n- -Over a one-to-three-year service period only, or\n- -Over a three-year service period and upon achieving certain key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nThe number of performance-based share units (PSUs) that will vest under the different tranches were contingent upon achievement of the operating profit (non-IFRS at constant currencies) KPI target in the year of grant. Depending on performance, the number of PSUs vesting ranges between 0% and 200% of the number initially granted. Performance against the KPI target was 100.4% in 2020 (2019: 118.7%, 2018: 106.7%). All share units are paid out in cash upon vesting.\n\n## Qualtrics Cash-Settled Awards Replacing PreAcquisition Qualtrics Awards (Qualtrics Rights)\n\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Qualtrics in 2019, under the terms of the acquisition agreement, SAP exchanged unvested Restricted Share Awards (RSAs), Restricted Share Units (RSUs), and Performance Share Units (PSUs), and options held by employees of",

The respective amount of options equals the number of options held as at the vesting date multiplied by US$35.00 per share less the originally agreed exercise price.\n\n-RSUs, PSUs, and options granted in 2018 and thereafter and unvested as at the closing date of the Qualtrics acquisition were converted into awards that are indexed to SAP's share price as follows: SAP's consideration per share (US$35.00) was divided by the average closing price of the SAP share over the five trading days on the closing date (\u20ac91.28), translated into US$ (US$103.75), and the result (Equity Award Exchange Ratio of 0.3373) was multiplied by\n\nthe average closing price of the SAP share over the five trading days prior to the exercise or vesting date.\n\nThere were 24.7 million unvested RSAs, RSUs, PSUs, and options as at the closing date of the Qualtrics acquisition, representing a fair value of \u20ac793 million after considering expected forfeitures dependent on grant dates and remaining vesting periods. Of the total fair value, \u20ac237 million was allocated to consideration transferred, while \u20ac556 million was allocated to future services to be provided. Post-acquisition compensation expense will be recognized as the awards vest over the remainder of the original vesting terms. The remaining vesting periods for such Qualtrics Rights are in a range of up to five years from closing date.\n\nThe unvested RSUs include grants as at the closing date of 6.1 million replacement RSUs. These RSUs have a two-year service period.\n\nThe unrecognized expense related to Qualtrics Rights was \u20ac60 million as at December 31, 2020 (2019: \u20ac225 million), and will be recognized over a remaining vesting period of up to three years (2019: four years).\n\nThe valuation of our outstanding cash-settled plans was based on the following parameters and assumptions:\n\n## Fair Value and Parameters Used at Year End 2020 for Cash-Settled Plans\n\n| \u20ac, unless otherwise stated                                                         | LTI 2016 Plan   (2017 -

The investment per each eligible employee is limited to a percentage of the respective employee's monthly base salary. SAP matches the employee investment by 40% and adds a subsidy of \u20ac20 per month for non-executives.

In Germany and some other countries, we make contributions to public pension schemes that are operated by national or local government or similar institutions. Expenses for such local state pension plans are recognized as shortterm employee benefits, that is, social security expenses.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe discount rates used in measuring our post-employment benefit assets and liabilities are derived from rates available on high-quality corporate bonds and government bonds for which the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and the amounts of our projected pension payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized as employee benefits expenses and classified in our Consolidated Income Statements according to the activities that the employees owning the awards perform. Since our domestic defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of an employee-financed postretirement plan that is fully financed with qualifying insurance policies, current service cost may become a credit as a result of adjusting the defined benefit liability's carrying amount to the fair value of the qualifying plan assets. Such adjustments are recorded in service cost. Total expenses on defined benefit pension plans comprise related current and past service costs as well as interest income and expense.\n\n## Total Expense of Pension Plans\n\n| \u20ac millions                    |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Defined contribution plans    |    326 |    314 |    280 |\n| Defined benefit pension plans |     93 |     55 |     50 |\n| Pension expenses              |    419 |    369 |    330 |",

Although our policy is to invest in a riskdiversified portfolio consisting of a mix of assets, both the defined benefit obligation and plan assets can fluctuate over time, which exposes the Group to actuarial and market (investment) risks.

In judging whether a unit qualifies as a business for restructuring purposes, we consider if the unit has its own management team, has access to all inputs and processes necessary to provide outputs, and generates or could generate revenues. The materiality of a change to a business is assessed based on both the size and the nature of the change and therefore does not necessarily involve a material quantitative impact on our financial statements.\n\nRestructuring expenses primarily include the following components:\n\n## Restructuring Expenses\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                                      | 2020   | 2019    | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Employee-related restructuring  expenses                                                        | 7      | - 1,111 | - 19   |\n| Onerous contract-related   restructuring expenses and  restructuring related impairment  losses | - 4    | - 19    | 0      |\n| Restructuring expenses                                                                          | 3      | - 1,130 | - 19   |\n\nRestructuring provisions are predominantly short-term in nature.

This includes but is not limited to segment results, income taxes, and earnings per share.\n\n## (C.1)  Results of Segments\n\n## General Information\n\nAt year end 2020, SAP had five operating segments that are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, which is responsible for assessing the performance of the Company and for making resource allocation decisions as our chief operating decision maker (CODM). The operating segments are largely organized and managed separately according to their product and service offerings, notably whether the products and services relate to our services activities, travel management offerings or experience management solutions, or cover other activities of our business.\n\nThe former Applications, Technology & Services segment was renamed at the beginning of 2020 to Applications, Technology & Support, while the services functions were bundled into the new Services segment. The Applications, Technology & Support segment derives its revenues primarily from the sale of software licenses, support offerings, and cloud subscriptions (as far as not included in one of the other segments).\n\nThe new Services segment covers most of SAP's services activities. It was established by bringing together services delivery and services sales functions to a new global services unit. Revenues are mainly generated from the sale of various professional services, premium support services, implementation services for our software products, and education services on the use of our products. However, the services segment does not reflect the full services business, as other segments provide services as well.\n\nIn 2020, the former Intelligent Spend Group segment was renamed to the Concur segment. This was the result of the integration of SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass offerings as well as major parts of the Concur engineering functions into the Applications, Technology & Support segment and the Services segment. The Concur segment derives its revenues mainly from transaction fees charged for the use of SAP's cloud-based Concur travel management offerings and related services.\n\nThe Qualtrics segment derives its revenues mainly from the sale of experience management cloud solutions (offerings of Qualtrics) that run front-office functions across the experience data and from the sale of related services. For more information about the initial public offering of Qualtrics International Inc., see Note (G.8).\n\nOn November 4, 2020, we acquired Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG ('Emarsys'), an innovative and easy-to-use cloud-based marketing platform, to complement and enhance our existing SAP Customer Experience solutions. Consequently, this acquisition led to a new operating segment called Emarsys. Due to its size, however, Emarsys is not a reportable segment. The Emarsys segment derives its revenues mainly from the sales of cloud-based customer experience offerings and from the sale of related services.\n\nFurther, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we sold our former nonreportable Digital Interconnect segment which derived its revenues from the sale of telephony, video chat, and routing offerings.\n\nThe segment information for 2020 and the comparative prior periods were restated to conform with the new segment composition.\n\n## Segment Reporting Policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur management reporting system, and hence our segment reporting system, reports our intersegment services as cost reductions and does not track them as internal revenue. Intersegment services mainly represent utilization of human resources of one segment by another segment on a project basis. Intersegment services are charged based on internal cost rates including certain indirect overhead costs but excluding a profit margin.\n\nMost of our depreciation and amortization expense affecting segment profits is allocated to the segments as part of broader infrastructure allocations and is thus not tracked separately on the operating segment level. Depreciation and amortization expense that is directly allocated to the operating segments is immaterial in all segments presented.\n\nOur management reporting system produces a variety of reports that differ by the currency exchange rates used in the accounting for foreign-currency transactions and operations, where both actual and constant currency numbers are reported to and used by our CODM. Reports based on actual currencies use the same currency rates as are used in our financial statements. Reports based on constant currencies report revenues and expenses using the average exchange rates from the previous year's corresponding period.\n\nWe use an operating profit indicator to measure the performance of our operating segments. However, the accounting policies applied in the measurement of operating segment revenue and profit differ as follows from the IFRS accounting principles used to determine the operating profit measure in our income statement:\n\n- -The measurements of segment revenue and results include the recurring revenues that would have been recorded by acquired entities had they remained stand-alone entities but which are not recorded as revenue under IFRS due to fair value accounting for customer contracts in effect at the time of an acquisition.\n- -The expense measures exclude:\n- \u25aa Acquisition-related charges such as amortization expense and impairment charges for intangibles acquired in business combinations and certain stand-alone acquisitions of intellectual property (including purchased in-process research and development) as well as sale/disposal gains and losses for these intangibles, settlements of pre-existing business relationships in connection with a business combination, and acquisition-related third-party expenses\n- \u25aa Share-based payment expenses",

Our ordinary business activities also include transactions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain due to different interpretations of tax laws, such as those involving transfer pricing and intercompany transactions between SAP Group entities. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is generally subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. In determining our worldwide income tax provisions, judgment is involved in assessing whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments and whether to reflect the respective effect of uncertainty based on the most likely amount or the expected value. In applying these judgments, we consider the nature and the individual facts and circumstances of each uncertain tax treatment as well as the specifics of the respective jurisdiction, including applicable tax laws and our interpretation thereof.\n\nThe assessment whether a deferred tax asset is impaired requires judgment, as we need to estimate future taxable profits to determine whether the utilization of the deferred tax asset is probable. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income\n\nover the periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable. Our judgment regarding future taxable income is based on assumptions about future market conditions and future profits of SAP.\n\nJudgment is also required in evaluating whether interest or penalties related to income taxes meet the definition of income taxes, and, if not, whether it is of financial nature. In this judgment, we particularly consider applicable local tax laws and interpretations on IFRS by national standard setters in the area of group financial reporting.\n\n## Tax Expense by Geographic Location\n\n| \u20ac millions                        | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax expense               |        |        |        |\n| Germany                           | 895    | 625    | 733    |\n| Foreign                           | 1,001  | 1,153  | 1,019  |\n| Total current tax expense         | 1,896  | 1,778  | 1,752  |\n| Deferred tax expense/income       |        |        |        |\n| Germany                           | - 38   | - 3    | 57     |\n| Foreign                           | 80     | - 549  | - 298  |\n| Total deferred tax expense/income | 42     | - 552  | - 241  |\n| Total income tax expense          | 1,938  | 1,226  | 1,511  |\n\n## Major Components of Tax Expense\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                        | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax expense/income                                                        |        |        |        |\n| Tax expense for current year                                                      | 1,653  | 1,818  | 1,665  |\n| Taxes for prior years                                                             | 243    | - 40   | 87     |\n| Total current tax expense                                                         | 1,896  | 1,778  | 1,752  |\n| Deferred tax expense/income                                                       |        |        |        |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary  differences                                | 47     | - 710  | - 501  |\n| Unused tax losses, research and development  tax credits, and foreign tax credits | - 5    | 158    | 260    |\n| Total deferred tax expense/income                                                 | 42     | - 552  | - 241  |\n| Total income tax expense                                                          | 1,938  | 1,226  | 1,511  |\n\n## Profit Before Tax by Geographic Location\n\n| \u20ac millions   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Germany      | 2,481  | 2,012  | 3,106  |\n| Foreign      | 4,739  | 2,584  | 2,494  |\n| Total        | 7,220  | 4,596  | 5,600  |\n\nThe following table reconciles the expected income tax expense, computed by applying our combined German tax rate of 26.3% (2019: 26.4%; 2018: 26.4%), to the actual income tax expense.

        "page_content": "We have not recognized a deferred tax liability on approximately \u20ac18.37 billion (2019: \u20ac17.41 billion) for undistributed profits of our subsidiaries, because we are in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Income Tax-Related Litigation\n\nWe are subject to ongoing tax audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Currently, we are in dispute mainly with the German and only a few foreign tax authorities. The German dispute is in respect of certain secured capital investments, while the few foreign disputes are in respect of the deductibility of intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. In all cases, we expect that a favorable outcome can only be achieved through litigation. For all of these matters, we have not recorded a provision as we believe that the tax authorities' claims have no merit and that no adjustment is warranted. If, contrary to our view, the tax authorities were to prevail in their arguments before the court, we would expect to have an additional expense of approximately \u20ac1,221 million (2019: \u20ac2,013 million) in total (including related interest expenses and penalties of \u20ac648 million (2019: \u20ac982 million)). The contingent liabilities decreased in 2020 mainly due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for our few foreign disputes and due to a German Federal Fiscal Court decision in a tax dispute involving intercompany financing matters.\n\n## (C.6)  Earnings per Share\n\n| \u20ac millions, unless otherwise  stated                                           | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Profit attributable to equity  holders of SAP SE                               | 5,145  | 3,321  | 4,083  |\n| Issued ordinary shares 1                                                       | 1,229  | 1,229  | 1,229  |\n| Effect of treasury shares 1                                                    | - 46   | - 35   | - 35   |\n| Weighted average shares  outstanding, basic 1                                  | 1,182  | 1,194  | 1,194  |\n| Dilutive effect of share-based  payments 1                                     | 0      | 0      | 0      |\n| Weighted average shares  outstanding, diluted 1                                | 1,182  | 1,194  | 1,194  |\n| Earnings per share, basic,  attributable to equity holders of  SAP SE (in \u20ac)   | 4.35   | 2.78   | 3.42   |\n| Earnings per share, diluted,  attributable to equity holders of  SAP SE (in \u20ac) | 4.35   | 2.78   | 3.42   |\n\n- 1 Number of shares in millions",

        "page_content": "## Section D -Invested Capital\n\nThis section highlights our non-current assets including investments that form the basis of our operating activities. Additions to invested capital include separate asset acquisitions or business combinations. Further, we disclose information about purchase obligations and capital contributions.\n\n## (D.1)  Business Combinations and Divestitures\n\n## Measuring Non-Controlling Interests and Allocation of Consideration Transferred\n\nWe decide for each business combination whether to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nWe classify costs related to executing business combinations as general and administration expense.\n\nIn our accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in determining whether an intangible asset is identifiable, and should be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves considerable judgment. The necessary measurements are based on information available on the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. These judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially affect our financial position and profit for several reasons, including the following:\n\n- -Fair values assigned to assets subject to depreciation and amortization affect the amounts of depreciation and amortization to be recorded in operating profit in the periods following the acquisition.\n- -Subsequent negative changes in the estimated fair values of assets may result in additional expense from impairment charges.\n- -Subsequent changes in the estimated fair values of liabilities and provisions may result in additional expense (if increasing the estimated fair value) or additional income (if decreasing the estimated fair value).\n\nWe acquire businesses in specific areas of strategic interest to us, particularly to broaden our product and service portfolio.\n\n## 2020 Acquisitions\n\nOn November 4, 2020, we concluded the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG, Vienna, Austria ('Emarsys'), following satisfaction of applicable regulatory and other approvals.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of Emarsys are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from November 4, 2020, onwards.\n\nThe initial accounting for the Emarsys business combination is incomplete because the acquisition occurred shortly before the end of the fiscal year and thus, we are still obtaining the information\n\nnecessary to identify and measure items such as tax-related assets and liabilities, as well as intangible assets of Emarsys. Accordingly, the amounts recognized in our financial statements for these items are regarded provisional as at December 31, 2020.\n\nIn general, the goodwill arising from our acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and the know-how and skills of the acquired businesses' workforces.\n\nEmarsys goodwill is attributed to expected synergies from the acquisition, particularly in the following areas:\n\n- -Cross-selling opportunities to existing SAP customers across all regions, using SAP's sales organization\n- -Emarsys offerings complementing the existing SAP Customer Experience solutions\n- -Improved profitability in Emarsys sales and operations\n\nAt the end of 2020, Emarsys was a non-reportable segment and the goodwill arising from the business combination was - on a preliminary basis - allocated to this segment. For more information, see Note (D.2).\n\nFor more information about our segments and about the changes in our segment structure, see Note (C.1).\n\n## 2020 Divestitures\n\nOn May 5, 2020, SAP and Sinch AB, Stockholm, Sweden ('Sinch'), announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement for Sinch to acquire the SAP Digital Interconnect group. The business sold (which was a non-reportable segment to SAP) consists of several SAP subsidiaries as well as assets transferred from certain SAP entities. The initial cash purchase price was \u20ac 225 million (on a cash-free, debt-free basis). The disposal gain of \u20ac194 million (IFRS) and \u20ac128 million (non-IFRS) is included in 'Other operating income/expense, net'.\n\nThe transaction closed on November 1, 2020, following satisfaction of applicable regulatory and other approvals.\n\nDue to immateriality, we have not separately presented the business as a discontinued operation.\n\n## 2019 Acquisitions\n\nOn January 23, 2019, we concluded the acquisition of Qualtrics International Inc. ('Qualtrics'), following satisfaction of applicable regulatory and other approvals.\n\nQualtrics is a leading provider of experience management solutions. By combining Qualtrics products and SAP products, we aim to deliver an end-to-end experience and operational management system to our customers.\n\nWe acquired 100% of the Qualtrics shares for approx. US$35 per share, representing consideration transferred in cash of approximately US$7.1 billion. In addition to the cash payments, SAP also incurred liabilities and post-closing expenses relating to assumed share-based payment awards amounting to approximately US$0.9 billion.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of Qualtrics are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from January 23, 2019, onward.",

('Callidus') (NDSQ: CALD), a leading provider of customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. SAP paid US$36 per share, representing consideration transferred in cash of approximately US$2.4 billion. The acquisition aimed to accelerate and strengthen SAP's position and solution offerings in the sales performance management (SPM) and configure-price-quote (CPQ) spaces.\n\n## Callidus Acquisition: Consideration Transferred\n\n| \u20ac millions                      |       |\n|---------------------------------|-------|\n| Cash paid                       | 1,957 |\n| Liabilities incurred            | 47    |\n| Total consideration transferred | 2,004 |\n\nThe liabilities incurred related to the earned portion of unvested share-based payment awards.

For more information about our segments and about the changes in our segment structure after the allocation, see Note (C.1).\n\n## Impact of the Business Combination on Our Financial Statements\n\nThe amounts of revenue and profit or loss of the Callidus business acquired in 2018 since the acquisition date are included in the 2018 consolidated income statements as follows:\n\n## Callidus Acquisition: Impact on SAP's Financials\n\n| \u20ac millions       | 2018   as Reported   | Contribution  of Callidus   |\n|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Revenue          | 24,708               | 180                         |\n| Profit after tax | 4,088                | - 60                        |\n\nHad Callidus been consolidated as at January 1, 2018, our estimated 2018 pro forma revenue would have been \u20ac24,766 million, and pro forma profit after tax would have been \u20ac4,071 million.\n\nThese amounts were calculated after applying SAP's accounting policies and after adjusting the results for Callidus to reflect significant effects from, for example:\n\n- -Additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustment to property, plant, and equipment, and to intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2018\n- -The impact of fair value adjustments on contract liabilities/deferred income on a cumulative basis\n- -The borrowing costs on the funding levels and debt/equity position of SAP after the business combination\n- -Employee benefits, such as share-based compensation\n- -Transaction expenses incurred as part of the acquisition\n- -Related income taxes\n\nThese pro forma numbers have been prepared for comparative purposes only. The pro forma revenue and profit numbers are not necessarily indicative either of the results of operations that would have actually occurred had the acquisition been in effect at the beginning of the respective period, or of future results.\n\n## (D.2)  Goodwill\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Testing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of our operating segments, since there are no lower levels in SAP at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nIn general, the test is performed at the same time (at the beginning of the fourth quarter) for all operating segments.\n\nIn making impairment assessments for our goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of these tests is highly dependent on management's assumptions regarding future cash flow projections and economic risks, which require significant judgment and assumptions about future developments. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\n- -Changes in business strategy\n- -Internal forecasts\n- -Estimation of weighted-average cost of capital\n\nChanges to the assumptions underlying our goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments could require material adjustments to the carrying amount of our recognized goodwill and intangible assets as well as the amounts of impairment charges recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe outcome of goodwill impairment tests may also depend on the allocation of goodwill to our operating segments. This allocation involves judgment as it is based on our estimates regarding which",

They are initially measured at acquisition cost and subsequently amortized based on the expected consumption of economic benefits over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to 20 years.\n\nAcquired in-process research and development project assets are typically amortized over five to seven years (starting upon completion / marketing of the respective projects).\n\nJudgment is required in determining the following:\n\n- -The useful life of an intangible asset, as this is based on our estimates regarding the period over which the intangible asset is expected to produce economic benefits to us\n- -The amortization method, as IFRS requires the straight-line method to be used unless we can reliably determine the pattern",

As a lessee, SAP recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis and interest expense is recognized on the lease liabilities. The vast majority of our leases consist of facility and data center leases. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain.\n\n## Leases in the Balance Sheet\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                 | 12/31/2020   | 12/31/2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Right-of-use assets                                                        |              |              |\n| Right-of-use assets  -  land and buildings                                 | 1,816        | 1,929        |\n| Right-of-use assets  -  other property,  plant, and equipment              | 41           | 38           |\n| Total right-of-use assets                                                  | 1,857        | 1,967        |\n| Non-current assets                                                         | 43,402       | 44,999       |\n| Right-of-use assets  as % of   non-current assets                          | 4            | 4            |\n| Lease liabilities                                                          |              |              |\n| Current lease liabilities                                                  | 380          | 389          |\n| Current financial liabilities                                              | 2,348        | 3,273        |\n| Current lease liabilities  as % of   current financial liabilities         | 16           | 12           |\n| Non-current lease liabilities                                              | 1,740        | 1,814        |\n| Non-current financial liabilities                                          | 13,605       | 12,923       |\n| Non-current lease liabilities  as % of   non-current financial liabilities | 13           | 14           |\n\nSAP is committed to future minimum lease payments in the amount of \u20ac161 million for facility leases that had not yet commenced as at December 31, 2020.

For more information about the cash flow related to lease liabilities, see the 'Reconciliation of Liabilities Arising from Financing Activities' table within Note (E.3).\n\n## (D.6)  Equity Investments\n\n## Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\n\nAs we do not designate financial assets as 'at fair value through profit or loss,' we generally classify financial assets into the following categories: at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the contractual cash flows of and our business model for holding the respective asset.\n\nFor equity securities, as the cash flow characteristics are typically other than solely principal and interest, we take an investment-byinvestment decision whether to classify as FVTPL or FVOCI. Judgment is required particularly in estimating the fair values of equity securities that are not listed publicly.\n\nGains/losses on equity securities at FVTPL include gains/losses from fair value fluctuations, from disposals as well as dividends, while gains/losses on equity securities at FVOCI only include dividends, all of which are shown in Financial Income, net. Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at the trade date.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\n| \u20ac millions                                          | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   | 2020  2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                     | Current      | Non-Current  | Total        | Current      | Non-Current  | Total        |\n| Equity securities                                   | 0            | 3,113        | 3,113        | 0            | 1,996        | 1,996        |\n| Investments in associates                           | 0            | 14           | 14           | 0            | 16           | 16           |\n| Equity investments                                  | 0            | 3,127        | 3,127        | 0            | 2,012        | 2,012        |\n| Other financial assets                              | 1,635        | 3,512        | 5,147        | 297          | 2,336        | 2,633        |\n| Equity investments as % of   other financial assets | 0            | 89           | 61           | 0            | 86           | 76           |\n\nFor a list of the names of other equity investments, see Note (G.9).",

Our capital management is based on a high equity ratio, modest financial leverage, a well-balanced maturity profile, and deep debt capacity.\n\n## (E.1)  Capital Structure Management\n\nThe primary objective of our capital structure management is to maintain a strong financial profile for investor, creditor, and\n\ncustomer confidence, and to support the growth of our business. We seek to maintain a capital structure that will allow us to cover our funding requirements through the capital markets on reasonable terms and, in so doing, ensure a high level of independence, confidence, and financial flexibility.\n\nSAP SE's long-term credit rating is 'A2' by Moody's and 'A' by Standard & Poor's, both with stable outlook.\n\n|                              | 12/31/2020   | 12/31/2020                           | 12/31/2019  \u2206 in %   | 12/31/2019  \u2206 in %                   | 12/31/2019  \u2206 in %   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|\n|                              | \u20ac millions   | % of   Total Equity and  Liabilities | \u20ac millions           | % of   Total Equity and  Liabilities |                      |\n| Equity                       | 29,928       | 51                                   | 30,822               | 51                                   | - 3                  |\n| Current liabilities          | 12,842       | 22                                   | 14,462               | 24                                   | - 11                 |\n| Non-current liabilities      | 15,702       | 27                                   | 14,929               | 25                                   | 5                    |\n| Liabilities                  | 28,544       | 49                                   | 29,390               | 49                                   | - 3                  |\n| Thereof financial debt       | 13,283       | 23                                   | 13,668               | 23                                   | - 3                  |\n| Thereof lease liabilities    | 2,120        | 4                                    | 2,203                | 4                                    | - 4                  |\n| Total equity and liabilities | 58,472       | 100                                  | 60,212               | 100                                  | - 3                  |\n\nIn 2020, we drew \u20ac2,000 million of Eurobonds.

Although treasury shares are legally considered outstanding, there are no dividend or voting rights associated with them. We may redeem or resell shares held in treasury, or we may use treasury shares for the purpose of servicing option or conversion rights under the Company's share-based payment plans. Also, we may use shares held in treasury as consideration in connection with mergers with, or acquisitions of, other companies.\n\nFor information about the share buyback in 2020, see the Distribution Policy and Dividends section.\n\n## Distribution Policy and Dividends\n\nOur general intention is to remain in a position to return liquidity to our shareholders by distributing annual dividends totaling 40% or more of our profit after tax and by potentially repurchasing treasury shares in future.\n\nIn 2020, we distributed \u20ac1,864 million (\u20ac1.58 per share) in dividends for 2019 compared to \u20ac1,790 million (\u20ac1.50 per share) paid in 2019 for 2018 and \u20ac1,671 million (\u20ac1.40 per share) paid in 2018 for 2017. Aside from the distributed dividend, in 2020, we also returned \u20ac1,492 million to our shareholders by repurchasing treasury shares.\n\nThe total dividend available for distribution to SAP SE shareholders is based on the profits of SAP SE as reported in its statutory financial statements prepared under the accounting rules in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch). For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Executive Board intends to propose that a dividend of \u20ac1.85 per share (that is, an estimated total dividend of \u20ac2,182 million), be paid from the profits of SAP SE.\n\n## (E.3)  Liquidity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting for Non-Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n## Classification and Measurement of Non-Derivative Financial Debt Investments\n\nOur non-derivative financial debt investments comprise cash at banks and cash equivalents (highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, such as time deposits and money-market funds), loans and other financial receivables, and acquired debt securities.\n\nAs we do not designate financial assets as 'at fair value through profit or loss,' we generally classify financial assets as: at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the contractual cash flows of, and our business model for, holding the respective asset. Financial assets having cash flow characteristics other than solely principal and interest such as money market and similar funds are generally classified as FVTPL. Generally, all other financial assets with cash flows consisting solely of principal and interest are classified as AC because we follow a conservative investment approach, safeguarding our liquidity by ensuring the safety of principal investment amounts.\n\nGains/losses on non-derivative financial debt investments at FVTPL are reported in Financial income, net and show interest income/expenses separately from other gains/losses which include gains/losses from fair value fluctuations and disposals. Gains/losses on non-derivative financial debt investments at AC are reported in Financial income, net and show interest income/expenses separately from other gains/losses which include gains/losses disposals and changes in expected and incurred credit losses. Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net. Regular way purchases and sales are recorded as at the trade date.\n\n## Impairment of Non-Derivative Financial Debt Investments\n\nFor these financial assets, we apply considerable judgment by employing the general impairment approach as follows:\n\n- -For cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities such as acquired bonds and commercial paper (CP), we apply the low credit risk exception, as it is our policy to invest only in highquality assets of issuers with a minimum rating of at least investment grade to minimize the risk of credit losses. Thus, these assets are always allocated to stage 1 of the three-stage credit loss model, and we record a loss allowance at an amount",

        "page_content": "equal to 12-month expected credit losses. This loss allowance is calculated based on our exposure at the respective reporting date, the loss given default for this exposure, and the credit default swap spread as a measure for the probability of default. Even though we invest only in assets of at least investment-grade, we also closely observe the development of credit default swap spreads as a measure of market participants' assessments of the creditworthiness of a debtor to evaluate probable significant increases in credit risk to timely react to changes should these manifest. Among others, we consider cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations in full, when there is information about a counterparty's financial difficulties or if there is a drastic increase in a counterparty's credit default swap spread for a prolonged time period while the overall market environment remains generally stable. Such financial assets are written off either partially or in full if the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, which might be evidenced, for example, by the bankruptcy of a counterparty of such financial assets.\n\n- -Loans and other financial receivables are monitored based on borrower-specific internal and external information to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. We consider such assets to be in default if they are significantly beyond their due date or if the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligation. A write-off occurs when the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, for example when\n\n## Group Liquidity and Net Debt\n\n| \u20ac millions                                 | 2020     | 2019     | \u2206     |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                  | 5,311    | 5,314    | - 4   |\n| Current time deposits and debt  securities | 1,470    | 67       | 1,402 |\n| Group liquidity                            | 6,781    | 5,382    | 1,399 |\n| Current financial debt                     | - 1,482  | - 2,529  | 1,046 |\n| Non-current financial debt                 | - 11,801 | - 11,139 | - 662 |\n| Financial debt                             | - 13,283 | - 13,668 | 384   |\n| Net debt ( - )                             | - 6,503  | - 8,286  | 1,783 |\n\nbankruptcy proceedings have been finalized or when all enforcement efforts have been exhausted.\n\n## Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities include bank loans, issued bonds, private placements, and other financial liabilities. Included in other financial liabilities are customer funding liabilities which are funds we draw from and make payments on behalf of our customers for customers' employee expense reimbursements, related credit card payments, and vendor payments. We present these funds in cash and cash equivalents and record our obligation to make these expense reimbursements and payments on behalf of our customers as customer funding liabilities.\n\nAs we do not designate financial liabilities as FVTPL, we generally classify non-derivative financial liabilities as AC.\n\nExpenses and gains or losses on financial liabilities at AC mainly consist of interest expense which is shown in Financial income, net. Gains/losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net.\n\n## Group Liquidity, Financial Debt, and Net Debt\n\nGroup liquidity consists of cash at banks, money market and other funds, time deposits, and debt securities (both with remaining maturities of less than one year). Financial debt is defined as the nominal volume of bank loans, CP, private placements, and bonds. Net debt is group liquidity less financial debt.\n\nWhile we continuously monitor the ratios presented in the capital structure table, we actively manage our liquidity and structure of our financial indebtedness based on the ratios group liquidity and net debt.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n| \u20ac millions                     | 2020    | 2020        | 2020   | 2019    | 2019        | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|-------------|--------|---------|-------------|--------|\n|                                | Current | Non-Current | Total  | Current | Non-Current | Total  |\n| Cash at banks                  | 2,732   | 0           | 2,732  | 2,877   | 0           | 2,877  |\n| Time deposits                  | 927     | 0           | 927    | 1,093   | 0           | 1,093  |\n| Money market and other funds   | 1,655   | 0           | 1,655  | 1,347   | 0           | 1,347  |\n| Expected credit loss allowance | - 3     | 0           | - 3    | - 3     | 0           | - 3    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents      | 5,311   | 0           | 5,311  | 5,314   | 0           | 5,314  |",

Further, it contains information about financial instruments.\n\n## (F.1)  Financial Risk Factors and Risk Management\n\n## Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe use derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk or interest rate risk and designate them as cash flow or fair value hedges if they qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9, which involves judgment.\n\n## Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\nMany transactions constitute economic hedges, and therefore contribute effectively to the securing of financial risks but do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. To hedge currency risks inherent in foreign-currency denominated and recognized monetary assets and liabilities, we do not designate our held-for-trading derivative financial instruments as accounting hedges, because the profits and losses from the underlying transactions are recognized in profit or loss in the same periods as the profits or losses from the derivatives.\n\nIn addition, we occasionally have contracts that contain foreign currency embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately.\n\nFair value fluctuations in the spot component of such derivatives at FVTPL are included in Other non-operating income/expense, net while the forward element is shown in Financial income, net.\n\n## Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\n## a) Cash Flow Hedge\n\nIn general, we apply cash flow hedge accounting to the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecasted transactions. With regard to foreign currency risk, hedge accounting relates to the spot price and the intrinsic values of the derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of these components determined on a present value basis is recorded in other comprehensive income. The forward element and time element as well as foreign currency basis spreads excluded from the hedging relationship are recorded as cost of hedging in a separate position in other comprehensive income. As the amounts are not material, they are presented together with the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity. All other components including counterparty credit risk adjustments of the derivative and the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in Financial Income, net in profit or loss.\n\nAmounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss to Other non-operating income/expense, net and Financial income, net in the same period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\n## b) Fair Value Hedge\n\nWe apply fair value hedge accounting for certain of our fixed-rate financial liabilities and show the fair value fluctuations in Financial income, net.\n\n## c) Valuation and Testing of Effectiveness\n\nAt inception of a designated hedging relationship, we document our risk management strategy and the economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is demonstrated as well as the effectiveness of the hedging relationship tested prospectively by applying the critical terms match for our foreign currency hedges, since currencies, maturities, and the amounts are closely aligned for the forecasted transactions and for the spot element of the forward exchange rate contract or intrinsic value of the currency options, respectively. For interest rate swaps, effectiveness is tested prospectively using statistical methods in the form of a regression analysis, by which the validity and extent of the relationship between the change in value of the hedged items as the independent variable and the fair value change of the derivatives as the dependent variable is determined. The main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- -The effect of the counterparty and our own credit risk on the fair value of the forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which is not reflected in the respective hedged item, and\n- -Differences in the timing of hedged item and hedged transaction in our cash flow hedges.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, and IFRS 7 on September 26, 2019, completing Phase 1 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform project. SAP holds interest rate receiver swaps which are designated in fair value hedging relationships that are directly impacted by the IBOR Reform. The interest rate swaps have floating legs which are indexed to either EONIA or USD Fed Funds Rate which will be amended to Euro Short-Term Rate and Secured Overnight Financing Rate, respectively. We are monitoring the latest developments to manage the transition to the new interest rate benchmarks. We do not expect material impacts from the change of interest rate benchmarks. As at December 31, 2020, SAP's exposure to EONIA designated in hedging relationships was \u20ac3.75 billion nominal amount, representing both the nominal amount of the hedging interest rate swap and the principal amount of the hedged Eurobonds maturing between 2027 and 2031. The exposure to USD Fed Funds Rate designated in hedging relationships was",

Risk management policies are established to identify risks, to set appropriate risk limits, and to monitor risks. Risk management policies and hedging strategies are laid out in our internal guidelines (for example, treasury guideline and other internal guidelines), and are subject to continuous internal review and analysis to reflect changes in market conditions and our business.\n\nWe only purchase derivative financial instruments to reduce risks and not for speculation, which is defined as entering into derivative instruments without a corresponding underlying transaction.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Factors\n\nAs we are active worldwide, our ordinary operations are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies. Since the Group's entities mainly conduct their operating business in their own functional currencies, our risk of exchange rate fluctuations from ongoing ordinary operations is not considered significant. However, SAP occasionally generates foreign-currency-denominated receivables, payables, and other monetary items by transacting in a currency other than the functional currency. To mitigate the extent of the associated foreign currency exchange rate risk, the majority of these transactions are hedged as described below.\n\nIn rare circumstances, transacting in a currency other than the functional currency also leads to embedded foreign currency derivatives being separated and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn addition, the intellectual property (IP) holders in the\n\nSAP Group are exposed to risks associated with forecasted intercompany cash flows in foreign currencies. These cash flows arise out of royalty payments from subsidiaries to the respective IP holder. The royalties are linked to the subsidiaries' external revenue. This arrangement leads to a concentration of the foreign currency exchange rate risk with the IP holders, as the royalties are mostly denominated in the subsidiaries' local currencies, while the functional currency of the IP holders with the highest royalty volume is the euro. The highest foreign currency exchange rate exposure of this kind relates to the currencies of subsidiaries with significant operations, for example the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the Australian dollar.\n\nGenerally, we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk with regard to our investing and financing activities, as such activities are normally conducted in the functional currency of the investing or borrowing entity.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management\n\nWe continuously monitor our exposure to currency fluctuation risks based on monetary items and forecasted transactions and pursue a Group-wide strategy to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, using derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, as appropriate, with the primary aim of reducing profit or loss volatility. Most of the hedging instruments are not designated as being in a hedge accounting relationship.\n\n## Currency Hedges Designated as Hedging Instruments (Cash Flow Hedges)\n\nWe enter into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge significant forecasted cash flows (royalties) from foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies with a hedge ratio of 1:1 and a hedge horizon of up to 12 months, which is also the maximum maturity of the foreign exchange derivatives we use.\n\nFor all years presented, no previously highly-probable transaction designated as a hedged item in a foreign currency cash flow hedge relationship ceased to be probable. Therefore, we did not discontinue any of our cash flow hedge relationships. Also, ineffectiveness was either not material or non-existent in all years reported. Generally, the cash flows of the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur and to be recognized in profit or loss monthly within a time frame of 12 months from the date of the statement of financial position.\n\nThe amounts as at December 31, 2020, relating to items designated as hedged items were as follows:\n\n## Designated Hedged Items in Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Hedges\n\n|                                                                                                 | Forecasted License Payments   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u20ac millions                                                                                      | 2020                          |\n| Change in value used for calculating                                                            | 5                             |\n| Cash flow hedge                                                                                 | 5                             |\n| Cost of hedging                                                                                 | - 1                           |\n| Balances remaining in cash flow hedge  reserve for which hedge accounting is no  longer applied | 0                             |",

In exceptional cases and limited economic environments, operating transactions are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, leading to a foreign currency exchange rate risk for the related monetary instruments. Where material, this foreign currency exchange rate risk is hedged. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a significant impact on either profit or other comprehensive income with regard to our non-derivative monetary financial instruments and related income or expenses.\n- -Our free-standing derivatives designed for hedging foreign currency exchange rate risks almost completely balance the changes in the fair values of the hedged item attributable to exchange rate movements in the Consolidated Income Statements in the same period. As a consequence, the hedged items and the hedging instruments are not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, and thereby have no effect on profit.\n\nConsequently, we are only exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with regard to the following:\n\n- -The spot component of derivatives held within a designated cash flow hedge relationship affecting other comprehensive income\n- -Foreign currency embedded derivatives affecting other nonoperating expense, net\n\nThus, our foreign currency exposure (and our average/high/low exposure) as at December 31, 2020, was as follows:\n\n## Foreign Currency Exposure\n\n| \u20ac billions                                        |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Year-end exposure toward all our major currencies |    0.9 |    1   |\n| Average exposure                                  |    0.9 |    0.7 |\n| Highest exposure                                  |    1   |    1   |\n| Lowest exposure                                   |    0.9 |    0.6 |\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Sensitivity\n\nWe calculate our sensitivity on an upward/downward shift of +/10% of the foreign currency exchange rate between the euro and all major currencies (2019: +/-10% of the foreign currency exchange rate between the euro and all other major currencies; 2018: +/-10% of the foreign currency exchange rate between the euro and all other major currencies). If, on December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the foreign currency exchange rates had been higher/lower as described above, this would have had the following effects on other nonoperating expense, net and other comprehensive income:",

2019: 80%) and most of our financing transactions are based on fixed rates and long maturities (2020: 85%; 2019: 69%).\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nThe aim of our interest rate risk management is to reduce profit or loss volatility and optimize our interest result by creating a balanced structure of fixed and variable cash flows. We therefore manage interest rate risks by adding interest-rate-related derivative instruments to a given portfolio of investments and debt financing. The desired fixed-floating mix of our net debt is set by the Treasury Committee.\n\n## Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments (Fair Value Hedges)\n\nTo match the interest rate risk from our financing transactions to our investments, we use receiver interest rate swaps to convert certain fixed-rate financial liabilities to floating, and by this means secure the fair value of the swapped financing transactions on a 1:1 ratio. Including interest rate swaps, 48% (2019: 35%) of our total interest-bearing financial liabilities outstanding as at December 31, 2020, had a fixed interest rate.\n\nThe amounts as at December 31, 2020, relating to items designated as hedged items were as follows:\n\n## Designated Hedged Items in Interest Rate Hedges\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                                                           | Fixed-Rate  Borrowing in  EUR   | 2020  Fixed-Rate  Borrowing in  USD   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Notional amount                                                                                                      | 4,550                           | 263                                   |\n| Carrying amount                                                                                                      | 4,503                           | 262                                   |\n| Accumulated fair value adjustments in                                                                                | - 90                            | - 36                                  |\n| Change in fair value used for measuring  ineffectiveness                                                             | - 90                            | - 16                                  |\n| Accumulated amount of fair value hedge  adjustments for hedged items ceased to  be adjusted for hedging gains/losses | 0                               | - 20                                  |\n\nThe amounts as at December 31, 2020, designated as hedging instruments were as follows:\n\n## Designated Hedging Instruments in Interest Rate Hedges\n\n| \u20ac millions                                               | Interest Rate  Swaps for EUR  Borrowing   | 2020  Interest Rate  Swaps for USD  Borrowing   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Notional amount                                          | 4,550                                     | 263                                             |\n| Carrying amount                                          |                                           |                                                 |\n| Other financial assets                                   | 99                                        | 15                                              |\n| Other financial liabilities                              | 0                                         | 0                                               |\n| Change in fair value used for  measuring ineffectiveness | 99                                        | 15                                              |",

Therefore, such interest rate changes do not change the carrying amounts of our non-derivative fixed-rate financial liabilities, as we account for them at amortized cost. Investments in fixed-rate financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss were not material at each year end reported. Thus, we do not consider any fixed-rate instruments in the equity-related sensitivity calculation.\n- -Income or expenses recorded in connection with non-derivative financial instruments with variable interest rates are subject to interest rate risk if they are not hedged items in an effective hedge relationship. Thus, we take into consideration interest rate changes relating to our variable-rate financing and our investments in money market instruments in the profit-related sensitivity calculation.\n- -The designation of interest rate receiver swaps in a fair value hedge relationship leads to interest rate changes affecting\n\nfinancial income, net. The fair value movements related to the interest rate swaps are not reflected in the sensitivity calculation, as they offset the fixed interest rate payments for the bonds and private placements as hedged items. However, changes in market interest rates affect the amount of interest payments from the interest rate swap. As a consequence, we include those effects of market interest rates on interest payments in the profit-related sensitivity calculation.\n\nDue to the different interest rate expectations for the U.S. dollar and the euro area, we base our sensitivity analyses on a yield curve upward shift of +50/+10 basis points (bps) for the U.S. dollar/euro area (2019: +50/+10bps for the U.S. dollar/euro area;\n\n2018: +100/+30bps for the U.S. dollar/euro area), and a yield curve downward shift of -50/-20bps for the U.S. dollar/euro area (2019: -50/-20bps for the U.S. dollar/euro area; 2018: -25/10bps for the U.S. dollar/euro area).\n\nIf, on December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, interest rates had been higher/lower than as described above, this would not have had a material effect on financial income, net, for our variable interest rate investments and would have had the following effects on financial income, net.",

Unlisted equity investments are monitored based on detailed financial information provided by the investees. The fair value of our listed equity investments depends on the equity prices, while the fair value of the unlisted equity investments is influenced by various unobservable input factors.\n\nWe also monitor the exposure with regard to our share-based payment plans. To reduce resulting profit or loss volatility, we hedge certain cash flow exposures associated with these plans by purchasing derivative instruments, but we do not establish a designated hedge relationship.\n\n## Equity Price Exposure\n\nOn December 31, 2020, our exposure from our investments in equity securities was \u20ac3,113 million (2019: \u20ac1,996 million; 2018: \u20ac1,248 million).\n\nFor information about the exposure from our share-based payments plans, see Note (B.3).\n\n## Equity Price Sensitivity\n\nIn our sensitivity analysis for our share-based payments plans, we include the hedging instruments and the underlying share-based payments even though the latter are scoped out of IFRS 7, as we believe that taking only the derivative instrument into account would not properly reflect our equity price risk exposure.\n\nOur sensitivity towards a fluctuation in equity prices is as follows:\n\n## Equity Price Sensitivity\n\n| \u20ac millions                                                                                                   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Investments in equity securities                                                                             |        |        |        |\n| Increase in equity prices and respective  unobservable inputs of 10% - increase of  financial income, net by | 259    | 156    | 65     |\n| Decrease in equity prices and respective  unobservable inputs of 10% - decrease of  financial income, net by | - 259  | - 156  | - 65   |\n| Share-based payments                                                                                         |        |        |        |\n| Increase in equity prices of 20%                                                                             |        |        |        |\n| - Increase of share-based payment  expenses by                                                               | - 272  | - 298  | - 279  |\n| - Increase of offsetting gains from  hedging instruments by                                                  | 24     | 48     | 57     |\n| Decrease in equity prices of 20%                                                                             |        |        |        |\n| - Decrease of share-based payment  expenses by                                                               | 271    | 307    | 262    |\n| - Decrease of offsetting gains from  hedging instruments by                                                  | - 23   | - 46   | - 44   |\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n## Credit Risk Factors\n\nTo reduce the credit risk in investments, we arrange to receive rights to collateral for certain investing activities in the full amount of the investment volume, which we would be allowed to make use of only in the case of default of the counterparty to the investment. In the absence of other significant agreements to reduce our credit risk exposure, the total amounts recognized as cash and cash equivalents, current investments, loans, and other financial receivables, trade receivables, and derivative financial assets represent our maximum exposure to credit risks, except for the agreements mentioned above.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\n## Cash at Banks, Time Deposits, and Debt Securities\n\nTo mitigate the credit risk from our investing activities and derivative financial assets, we conduct all our activities only with approved major financial institutions and issuers that carry high external ratings, as required by our internal treasury guideline.

As such collateral, we only accept bonds with at least investment-grade rating level.\n\nIn addition, the concentration of credit risk that exists when counterparties are involved in similar activities by instrument, sector, or geographic area is further mitigated by diversification of counterparties throughout the world and adherence to an internal limit system for each counterparty. This internal limit system stipulates that the business volume with individual counterparties is restricted to a defined limit that depends on the lowest official longterm credit rating available by at least one of the major rating agencies, the Tier 1 capital of the respective financial institution, or participation in the German Depositors' Guarantee Fund or similar protection schemes. We continuously monitor strict compliance with these counterparty limits. As the premium for credit default swaps mainly depends on market participants' assessments of the creditworthiness of a debtor, we also closely observe the development of credit default swap spreads in the market to evaluate probable risk developments and react in a timely manner to changes should these manifest.\n\nFor cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities such as acquired bonds or commercial paper, we apply the general impairment approach. As it is our policy to only invest in high-quality assets of issuers with a minimum rating of at least investment grade so as to minimize the risk of credit losses, we use the low credit risk exception. Thus, these assets are always allocated to stage 1 of the three-stage credit loss model and we record a loss allowance for an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. This loss allowance is calculated based on our exposure as at the respective reporting date, the loss given default for this exposure, and the credit default swap spread as a measure for the probability of default. To ensure that during their lifetime our investments always fulfill the requirement of being investment-grade, we monitor changes in credit risk by tracking published external credit ratings. Among other things, we consider cash at banks, time deposits, and debt securities to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations in full, when there is information about a counterparty's financial difficulties, or in case of a drastic increase in the credit default swap spread of a counterparty for a prolonged time period while the overall market environment remains rather stable. Such financial assets are written off either partially or in full if the likelihood of recovery is considered remote, which might be\n\nevidenced, for example, by the bankruptcy of a counterparty of such financial assets.\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nThe default risk of our trade receivables is managed separately, mainly based on assessing the creditworthiness of customers through external ratings and on our past experience with the customers concerned. Based on this assessment, individual credit limits are established for each customer and deviations from such credit limits need to be approved by management.\n\nWe apply the simplified impairment approach using a provision matrix for all trade receivables and contract assets to take into account any lifetime expected credit losses already at initial recognition. For the purpose of the provision matrix, customers are clustered into different risk classes, mainly based on market information such as the country risk assessment of their country of origin. Loss rates used to reflect lifetime expected credit losses are determined using a roll-rate method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through different stages of being overdue and on our actual credit loss experience over the past years. These loss rates are enhanced by forward-looking information to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions, and the expected changes in the economic conditions over the expected life of the receivables. Forward-looking information is based on changes in country risk ratings, or fluctuations in credit default swaps of countries of the customers we do business with. We continuously monitor outstanding receivables locally to assess whether there is objective evidence that our trade receivables and contract assets are credit-impaired. Evidence that trade receivables and contract assets are credit-impaired include, among the trade receivables being past due, information about significant financial difficulty of the customer or non-adherence to a payment plan. We consider receivables to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations in full, However, a delay of payments (for example, more than 90 days past due) in the normal course of business alone does not necessarily indicate a customer default. We write off account balances either partially or in full if we judge that the likelihood of recovery is remote, which might be evidenced, for example, when bankruptcy proceedings for a customer are finalized or when all enforcement efforts have been exhausted.\n\nThe impact of default on our trade receivables from individual customers is mitigated by our large customer base and its distribution across many different industries, company sizes, and countries worldwide.

Our global treasury department manages liquidity centrally for all subsidiaries. Where possible, we pool their cash surplus so that we can use liquidity centrally for our business operations, for subsidiaries' funding requirements, or to invest any net surplus in the market. With this strategy, we seek to optimize yields, while ensuring liquidity, by investing only with counterparties and issuers of high credit quality, as explained before. Hence, high\n\nlevels of liquid assets and marketable securities provide a strategic reserve, helping keep SAP flexible, sound, and independent.\n\nApart from effective working capital and cash management, we have reduced the liquidity risk inherent in managing our day-to-day operations and meeting our financing responsibilities by arranging an adequate volume of available credit facilities with various financial institutions on which we can draw if necessary.\n\nIn order to retain high financial flexibility, in 2017, SAP SE entered into a \u20ac2.5 billion syndicated credit facility agreement with a term until 2024. The use of the facility is not restricted by any financial covenants. Borrowings under the facility bear interest of EURIBOR or LIBOR for the respective currency plus a margin of 17bps. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 5.95bps per annum on the unused available credit. We have not drawn on the facility.\n\nIn September 2019, we initiated a commercial paper program (Commercial Paper, or CP). As at December 31, 2020, we had \u20ac930 million of CP outstanding with maturities generally less than six months (2019: \u20ac1,099.5 million).\n\nAdditionally, as at December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had available lines of credit totaling \u20ac372 million and \u20ac430 million, respectively. There were immaterial borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit in all years presented.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\nThe table below is an analysis of the remaining contractual maturities of all our financial liabilities held as at December 31, 2020. Financial liabilities for which repayment can be requested by the contract partner at any time are assigned to the earliest possible period. Variable interest payments were calculated using the latest relevant interest rate fixed as at December 31, 2020. As we generally settle our derivative contracts gross, we show the pay and receive legs separately for all our currency and interest rate derivatives, whether or not the fair value of the derivative is negative. The cash outflows for the currency derivatives are translated using the applicable spot rate.",

Management's view of these matters may also change in the future. Actual outcomes of litigation and claims may differ from the assessments made by management in prior periods, which could result in a material impact on our business, financial position, profit, cash flows, or reputation. Most of the lawsuits and claims are of a very individual nature and claims are\n\neither not quantified by the claimants or the claim amounts quantified are, based on historical evidence, not expected to be a good proxy for the expenditure that would be required to resolve the case concerned. The specifics of the jurisdictions where most of the claims are located further impair the predictability of the outcome of the cases. Therefore, it is typically not practicable to reliably estimate the financial effect that these lawsuits and claims would have if SAP were to incur expenditure for these cases.\n\nFurther, the expected timing of any resulting outflows of economic benefits from these lawsuits and claims is typically uncertain and not estimable, as it depends generally on the duration of the legal proceedings and settlement negotiations required to resolve them.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including proceedings and claims that relate to companies we have acquired. We will continue to vigorously defend against all claims and lawsuits against us. The provisions recorded for these claims and lawsuits as at December 31, 2020, are neither individually nor in the aggregate material to SAP.\n\nAmong the claims and lawsuits disclosed in this Note are the following classes:",

        "page_content": "## Intellectual Property-Related Litigation and Claims\n\nIntellectual property-related litigation and claims are cases in which third parties have threatened or initiated litigation claiming that SAP violates one or more intellectual property rights that they possess. Such intellectual property rights may include patents, copyrights, and other similar rights.\n\nContingent liabilities exist from intellectual property-related litigation and claims for which no provision has been recognized. Generally, it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact of these contingent liabilities due to the uncertainties around the litigation and claims, as outlined above. The total amounts claimed by plaintiffs in those intellectual property-related lawsuits or claims in which a claim has been quantified were not material to us as at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Based on our past experience, most of the intellectual property-related litigation and claims tend to be either dismissed in court or settled out of court for amounts significantly below the originally claimed amounts. We currently believe that resolving the intellectual property-related claims and lawsuits pending as at December 31, 2020, will neither individually nor in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, profit, or cash flows.\n\nIndividual cases of intellectual property-related litigation and claims include the following:\n\nIn June 2018, Teradata Corporation, Teradata US, Inc. and Teradata Operations, Inc. (collectively 'Teradata') filed a civil lawsuit against SAP SE, SAP America, Inc. and SAP Labs, LLC in U.S. federal court in California. Teradata alleges that SAP misappropriated trade secrets of Teradata, infringed Teradata's copyrights (claim now withdrawn), and violated U.S. antitrust laws. Teradata seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief. In 2019, SAP asserted patent infringement counterclaims against Teradata seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. Trial is scheduled for late 2021. In 2020, Teradata initiated a second civil lawsuit against SAP asserting patent infringement, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. Trial in the second lawsuit is scheduled for late 2022.\n\nThe legal proceedings instituted in 2010 by United States-based TecSec, Inc. against SAP (including our subsidiary Sybase) and many other defendants in the United States, in which TecSec sought unspecified monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief, were settled in 2020.\n\n## Tax-Related Litigation\n\nWe are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. In respect of non-income taxes, we are involved in various proceedings with only a few foreign tax authorities regarding assessments and litigation matters on intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. The total potential amount in dispute related to these matters for all applicable years is approximately \u20ac154 million (2019: \u20ac189 million). We have not recorded a provision for these matters, as we believe that we will prevail.\n\nFor more information about our income tax-related litigation, see Note (C.5).\n\n## Anti-Bribery and Export Control Matters\n\nSAP has received communications and whistleblower information alleging conduct that may violate anti-bribery laws in\n\nthe United States (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)), and other countries. The Office of Ethics and Compliance (OEC) of SAP is conducting investigations with the assistance of an external law firm and voluntarily advised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), as well as local authorities where potential violations are being investigated. The investigations and dialogue between SAP and the local authorities and the U.S. SEC and U.S. DOJ are ongoing.\n\nThe alleged conduct may result in monetary penalties or other sanctions under the FCPA and/or other anti-bribery laws. In addition, SAP's ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions could be negatively impacted. The comprehensive and exhaustive investigations and the corresponding remediation activities are still ongoing. In South Africa, SAP is seeking resolution of pending civil claims relating to ongoing investigations. Considering the complexity of individual factors and the large number of open questions, it is not entirely possible at this point in time to assess the risk of a financial impact.\n\nFurthermore, we continue to investigate separate allegations regarding conduct that certain SAP partners violated SAP contractual terms and sold SAP products and services in embargoed countries and to sanctioned entities. These SAP partners presumably did not adhere to SAP's strict procedures for indirect business activities. To the extent any company independent from SAP chooses not to follow SAP's licensing procedures, SAP is ultimately limited in its ability to stop their activities. SAP devotes considerable resources to prevent and mitigate such activities should they occur. We are also investigating allegations regarding direct sales from SAP to certain customers, who may have engaged in unauthorized activities in embargoed countries. The investigations are being conducted by SAP's OEC and SAP's Export Control team, with the assistance of an external law firm and forensic advisors.\n\nIn this context, SAP voluntarily self-disclosed potential export controls and economic sanctions violations to the U.S. DOJ and the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in September 2017. At the same time, SAP provided notification to the U.S. SEC and responded to an SEC comment letter on export restriction matters in October 2017. SAP has also provided disclosure to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) based on the same alleged facts. The alleged conduct may result in monetary penalties or other sanctions under U.S. sanctions and export control laws. SAP is currently engaging with U.S. authorities regarding resolution of these matters.\n\nThe comprehensive and exhaustive investigations and the corresponding remediation activities are ongoing, and considering the complexity of individual factors and the large number of open questions, it is not entirely possible at this point in time to comprehensively assess the risks.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, it is impossible at this point in time to determine whether the potential anti-bribery law violations and the potential export restriction violations represent present obligations of SAP and, if so, to reliably estimate the amount of these obligations. We recognized no material provisions for these potential violations in our consolidated financial statements 2020. It is also not practicable to estimate the financial effect of any contingent liabilities that may result from these potential violations.",

(Qualtrics) successfully issued 12% of its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ). Qualtrics placed 82 million new shares with a total placement volume of US$2.3 billion including a private placement transaction. Since SAP did not participate in the capital increase, SAP's ownership decreased to 83%. However, SAP continues to hold high-vote Class B common stock and, as a result, its current voting power exceeds 98%.\n\nIn connection with the IPO, Qualtrics conducted a voluntary exchange offer to exchange existing share-based payment awards of Qualtrics employees (Qualtrics Rights and Move SAP RSUs) for awards with underlying shares of Qualtrics at an exchange ratio based upon the IPO price of Qualtrics Class A common stock; the exchange ratio is designed to preserve the intrinsic value of the Qualtrics Rights and Move SAP RSUs that will be tendered. The exchange offer is limited to eligible employees and is subject to various terms and conditions as more fully described in the prospectus relating to such exchange offer published by Qualtrics.\n\n## Organizational Changes\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, SAP modified its organizational structure to further drive simplification and integration. The organizational changes which will also affect SAP's segment reporting. SAP has already started the process of redefining its\n\nmanagement reporting under the new organizational structure, which the segment reporting will follow.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nTo accelerate the modernization of its cloud infrastructure and to harmonize its platform structure, SAP will undertake a restructuring program in the Global Cloud Services area. The execution started in Q1 2021 and will continue until the end of 2022. Total restructuring expenses are projected to be \u20ac150 million to \u20ac200 million. The majority of these expenses will be impairments of data centers and related assets.\n\n## Acquisition of Signavio\n\nIn January 2021, SAP announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Signavio GmbH, a leader in the enterprise business process intelligence and process management space. The initial purchase price is \u20ac950 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval.\n\n## (G.9)  Scope of Consolidation, Subsidiaries and Other Equity Investments\n\n## Entities Consolidated in the Financial Statements\n\n|            | Total   |\n|------------|---------|\n| 12/31/2018 | 265     |\n| Additions  | 20      |\n| Disposals  | - 21    |\n| 12/31/2019 | 264     |\n| Additions  | 17      |\n| Disposals  | - 12    |\n| 12/31/2020 | 269     |",

        "page_content": "## Connectivity of Financial and NonFinancial Indicators\n\n## Where We Come From: Putting a Value on Non-Financial Performance Indicators\n\nAt SAP, we have put a monetary value on how selected nonfinancial indicators impact our operating profit. For example, how well we engage with our employees and inspire them to commit to our purpose and strategy, support a healthy business culture, and succeed in reducing our carbon emissions.\n\nFigure 1: Connectivity Between Social, Environmental, and Economic Performance. SAP's main KPIs are marked in orange.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo achieve this, we created cause-and-effect chains that show how specific actions we take at SAP lead to shifts in behavior. This behavior impacts on our business and has a financial consequence.\n\nBy doing so, we established more than just a correlation between non-financial and financial indicators. It also reveals why and how something such as employee engagement ultimately leads to gains or losses in business performance. We believe that such insights are a prerequisite for fully modeling the financial impact of nonfinancial performance.\n\n## Magnitude of Financial Impact\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, SAP used techniques such as linear regression analysis to document the financial impact of four nonfinancial indicators: Business Health Culture Index, Employee Engagement Index, Employee Retention, and Carbon Emissions. In the past, we assessed each indicator to see what a change of one\n\npercentage point (pp) (or 1% for carbon emissions) would mean for our operating profit. The results for 2018, for example, showed that a 1pp change in the Business Health Culture Index affected our operating profit by \u20ac90 million to \u20ac100 million (non-IFRS).\n\nHaving illustrated this impact with concrete numbers, we are now turning our focus to a broader perspective of impact (for example, see Our Contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and A New and Broader Focus). We still strongly believe in the fundamental conclusions of the analysis, but do not see a need to continuously update specific monetary values on the wellestablished connections, since the values have not been subject to any large fluctuations over the years. Instead, they have increased steadily, as expected.\n\n## Promoting Sustainability Measures as a Way to Boost Financial Performance\n\nDocumenting the financial impact of non-financial indicators has helped us move closer to achieving our sustainability goals. Rather than simply stating the business case for social or environmental change, we also have the numbers to back it up.\n\nOur findings have helped us shift the conversation for managers, investors, employees, and other key stakeholders, and firmly establish non-financial indicators as playing a crucial role in our financial success. As a result, engaging employees or reducing our emissions is no longer seen as a nice-to-have, but rather as essential to carrying out a successful business strategy.\n\nBy embedding this approach into our decision-making and quarterly business reviews, our sustainability performance steers our business alongside factors such as revenue and profit. Our goal is for all senior managers and experts at SAP to recognize - and be held accountable for - the fact that improving such measures as employee engagement also boosts financial performance.\n\n## Embedding Non-Financial Performance Indicators into Our Solutions\n\nWe will continue to share our approach and methodology with our customers to help them win in the marketplace. We believe that companies achieve higher profits - resulting from both greater cost efficiency as well as revenue growth - by addressing economic, social, and environmental considerations in a holistic and integrated manner. More importantly, these companies are better equipped to lead in the future, as they navigate the world's most pressing challenges and help to bring about long-term sustainable change.\n\nUsing the connectivity model as outlined above, we have been able to embed non-financial KPIs into our solutions, including, for example, SAP Analytics Cloud and SAP Digital Boardroom, allowing a more holistic steering of the company. This integrated approach to financial and non-financial performance is also reflected in our Climate 21 initiative and therefore not only helps SAP but also our customers.",

        "page_content": "## A New and Broader Focus\n\nWith a vision to help the world run better and improve people's lives, we have moved beyond financial measures to evaluate the consequences of our actions on society and the environment as well as the wider economy. As well as exploring cause-and-effect chains within SAP's own operations, we also measure positive and negative societal impacts across our complete value chain. For example, a 2017 research project revealed that our purchases of goods and services from suppliers generated employment for approximately 120,000 full-time equivalents, or FTEs. Furthermore, carbon emissions from our supply chain resulted in annual societal costs of approximately \u20ac160 million.\n\nBuilding on our many years of experience in connecting financial and non-financial measures, we cofounded the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA) in 2019. This alliance looks at ways that businesses can better understand their societal and environmental impacts and formulate corporate strategies to address these areas.\n\nThe VBA was founded by eight companies: BASF SE, Robert Bosch GmbH, Deutsche Bank AG, LafargeHolcim Ltd, Novartis International AG, Philip Morris International Inc, SAP SE, and SK Group. The organization is supported by the world's four largest accounting companies: Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, Ernst and Young Global Ltd, KPMG International Ltd, and\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited. It is also supported by leading universities such as Harvard Business School, together with stakeholders from governments, civil societies, and standardsetting organizations. By participating in the VBA's methodology development and piloting phases, SAP is playing an active part in shaping the future of impact measurement and valuation.\n\n## Meeting the Challenges of Non-Financial Value Measurement\n\nEnvironmental degradation, rising societal inequalities, and the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the need for corporate accountability and value creation beyond financial markets. However, most corporations are failing to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and inequality, because decisions are based on insufficient information.\n\nAccounting systems often ignore the value of environmental and societal impacts, leading to misallocation of resources. However, as is increasingly recognized by institutions such as Harvard Business School, monetary evaluation of these impacts has the potential to change accounting systems and transform capital markets. The development of impact-weighted accounting metrics is a necessary precondition for this.\n\nIncreasing regulatory pressure has also resulted in an urgent requirement for a reporting standard for environmental, social, and governance criteria. In response, organizations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative are adapting and aligning their efforts to develop reporting systems that help investors make more sustainable decisions.\n\nWe co-founded the VBA to support the development of a standardized methodology that helps companies, investors, and other stakeholders compare non-financial performance. These insights enable companies to create business value beyond revenue or profit growth while taking into consideration the long-term\n\nimpacts of their business operations on the environment and society as a whole.\n\nTo help the European Union (EU) achieve its commitment to making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal, the VBA is also advising it on the implementation of an EU classification system for sustainable activities. Furthermore, the VBA is working on green accounting principles to help drive the establishment of a globally accepted system of standards for non-financial disclosure.\n\n## Piloting the Measurement of NonFinancial Impacts\n\nEnding in November 2020, our first VBA pilot analyzed categories including GDP contribution, health and safety, training, consumptive water use, water pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG), air emissions, land use and biodiversity, and waste. We used data from our 2019 integrated report, from our internal controlling and HR systems, and from our environmental management system. The analysis focused on our complete operations and our supply chain. An analysis of the 'downstream' impacts resulting from customers' use of our software solutions and services will be piloted in the next phase.\n\nWherever possible, we used primary data for the calculations. Where primary data was not available, we used proxies, modeling techniques, and assumptions that were well-defined and documented in the VBA method papers. Key stakeholders across all relevant lines of business were engaged in the pilot, which was sponsored by our CFO.\n\nAnalysis took place across multiple impact categories, and resulted, for example, in the following findings from the GHG and training categories:\n\n- -GHG : The increasing concentration of GHG in our atmosphere has a direct effect on our environment. Shifting climate patterns, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and rising mean temperatures result in impacts on health, the built environment, economies, agriculture, and timber, as well as desertification and other factors that affect ecosystems. Our analysis enabled us to identify the GHG impact of each subsidiary and location, and we now have insights into which SAP locations have the highest carbon dioxide (CO2) footprints and which locations have the lowest. Negative impacts of GHG were monetized at \u20ac182 million and this has helped inform decision-making regarding our CO2reduction strategy. It has also helped us quantify the investment required for offsetting emissions by funding alternative energy resources to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations by 2023.\n- -Training : Money spent on offering training to employees positively impacts their employability, earnings, skills, and knowledge. However, it also results in 'softer' impacts such as enhanced confidence, self-awareness, and active listening. This can result in improved mental well-being, with benefits for our employees' immediate social environment, as well as social and civic engagement. The analysis identified that our global employee training programs have a positive impact valued at \u20ac1.3 billion.\n\nWe aim to add further indicators and share best practices and lessons learned with external stakeholders and other VBA member companies to help improve the methodology and input process. In addition, we will make results available to the public.",

Impact measurement and valuation is evolving globally, and the connection of economic, social, and environmental impacts will become a guiding principle for the way we evaluate and steer our business.\n\nBy simplifying, aligning, and optimizing enterprise sustainability reporting, we are helping our customers address global sustainability challenges. In addition, we are using insights gained during our impact valuation journey in the development of sustainability management initiatives such as the Climate 21 program. In 2018, we determined 77% of global transaction revenue touch an SAP system; with this, we can assist enterprises around the world in their transition to sustainable business practices. We see the monetary evaluation of environmental and society impacts as crucial in achieving a sustainable economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Scope\n\nThe content of this section was not subject to the independent limited assurance engagement of our external auditor KPMG.\n\n## Details: How Our Non-Financial and Financial Performance Indicators Are Interconnected\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nEmployee engagement is the level of employee commitment, pride, and loyalty, as well as the feeling of employees of being advocates for their company.\n\n## Capability Building > Employee Engagement\n\nBecause it is closely linked to how much a company develops its employees and supports their careers, internal hiring to management and expert positions positively affects employees' commitment and loyalty. This hypothesis was confirmed by a study by Bedarkar & Pandita (2014), which identified 'career opportunities' as the key driver of employee engagement. 1\n\n## Social Investment > Employee Engagement\n\nBy engaging our employees in social sabbaticals, their creating of significant social impact led to increased employee engagement.\n\nMueller et al. (2012) have found that employees' perception of a\n\ncompany's commitment to corporate social responsibility is\n\npositively linked to their own commitment to the organization.\n\n2\n\n## Employee Engagement > Profitability\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and proof the financial impact of employee engagement. We showed what a change by 1pp of employee engagement would mean for SAP's operating profit.\n\n## Profitability > Employee Engagement\n\nIn our view, a high operating profit, as great business news, can raise employee morale, encourage identification with our purpose, and thus drive employee engagement. On the other hand, we believe that a high profit can also have a negative impact on\n\nemployee engagement. For example, if cost savings and budget cuts are implemented to reach an ambitious profit target, employees might feel constrained and dissatisfied.\n\n## Business Health Culture Index (BHCI) > Employee Engagement\n\nSince 2014, we have been using real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We have been able to prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and employee engagement. The BHCI positively influences the Leadership Trust Index, which positively influences the Employee Engagement Index; all correlations are significant. This hypothesis was also confirmed by several studies, for example by Johnson, Sheena et al. (2018). 3\n\n## Employee Engagement > Employee Retention\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between employee engagement and employee retention.\n\n## Carbon Emissions > Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that lowering SAP's carbon emissions can have a positive impact on employee engagement because loyalty should rise as employees see their company act responsibly towards the environment. However, because lowering emissions also brings certain restrictions, such as on business travel, it may also have a negative impact on employee engagement.\n\n## Employee Engagement > Carbon Emissions\n\nWe believe that engaged employees are more likely to want to help SAP achieve our own target in lowering carbon emissions. Yet another possible outcome is that a higher level of employee engagement may lead to more business activity requiring travel, and therefore could lead to an increase in carbon emissions.\n\n## Employee Engagement > Growth\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between employee engagement and revenue.\n\n## Growth > Employee Engagement\n\nWe believe that higher revenue has a positive impact on a company's work environment, thereby increasing employee pride and loyalty. This is also stated in a study of Harter et al. (2010), which states that improving financial performance appears to increase general satisfaction and some specific work perceptions. 4\n\n## Business Health Culture Index (BHCI)\n\nOur Business Health Culture Index assesses the health of both our organizational culture and our employees.\n\n## Women in Management > BHCI\n\nWe believe that a balance of men and women in management roles helps create a more balanced working environment, one in which diversity is valued and people feel free to express their individual styles.

We showed what a change by 1pp of the BHCI would mean for SAP's operating profit.\n\n## Social Investment > BHCI\n\nWe believe that by supporting our employees in engaging in activities with a positive social impact, such as skills-based volunteering, we are enhancing the meaning they find in work. This sense of purpose can help create a richer and more rewarding work environment that reduces stress and promotes satisfaction and well-being. Additionally, volunteering can increase overall employee health, which is shown in a study by S. S. Johnson (2017). 6\n\n## BHCI > Employee Engagement\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and employee engagement. The BHCI positively influences the Leadership Trust Index, which positively influences the Employee Engagement Index; all correlations are significant. This hypothesis was also confirmed by several studies, for example by Johnson, Sheena et al. (2018). 7\n\n## BHCI > Growth\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and revenue.\n\n## Carbon Emissions > BHCI\n\nMany of SAP's carbon emissions are caused by business travel and commuting, which we believe can have both negative and positive impacts on employee health. Some people may experience greater stress from more travel because they have less time to spend at home, suffer from jetlag, or lose valuable working time; others may enjoy travel because it enables them to experience other places and cultures as well as meet new people. Studies show that business travel potentially increases stress and poses a threat to employees' mental and physical health: see, for example, the study by Rundle, Revenson & Friedman (2017). 8\n\n## BHCI > Customer Loyalty\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and customer loyalty. Recent studies, for example by Reed, Goolsby & Johnston (2016) also suggest this correlation. 9\n\n## Employee Retention\n\nEmployee retention is the ratio of the average headcount (expressed in full-time equivalents), minus employee-initiated terminations (turnover), divided by the average headcount, taking into account the past 12 months.\n\n## Capability Building > Employee Retention\n\nAccording to the Global Workforce Study (2012), the 'chances to advance the career' is the second-most important driver of employee retention. 10 By promoting and thus growing from within, SAP creates career opportunities for our employees. In turn, it is our expectation that this opportunity leads to an increase in employee retention.\n\n## Employee Engagement > Employee Retention\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between employee engagement and employee retention.\n\n## Employee Retention > Growth\n\nMeifert (2005) stated a clear relationship between employee retention and a company's revenue and margin. 11\n\n## Employee Retention > Customer Loyalty\n\nKoys (2001) has found evidence that employee turnover has a negative impact on customer satisfaction. 12 We believe this effect stems from the fact that experienced employees work more efficiently, have better product knowledge, and can build trusting relationships with colleagues and customers, so therefore have the ability to better serve customers' needs.\n\n## Employee Retention > Profitability\n\nWe used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of employee retention. We showed what a change by 1pp of employee retention would mean for SAP's operating profit.\n\n## Women in Management\n\n'Women in Management' means the share of women in management positions (managing teams, managing managers, board members) as compared to the total number of managers.\n\n## Capability Building > Women in Management\n\nLike many of our IT industry peers, SAP has less women than men in senior positions. Given our significant pool of talent, we assume that internal promotions will increase the percentage of women in management positions.\n\n## Women in Management > BHCI\n\nWe believe that a balance of men and women in management helps create a more balanced working environment, one in which diversity is valued and people feel free to express their individual styles. It is our expectation that such an environment will positively affect our BHCI.\n\n## BHCI > Women in Management\n\nMcKinsey (2013) found that different elements of the BHCI, such as flexible working hours, the ability to work from home, and career flexibility, can make it easier for employees to balance work and family life. 13 This leads us to conclude that the higher our BHCI, the more attractive SAP becomes to women who are also seeking management positions.\n\n## Women in Management > Growth\n\nStudies show that companies with a relatively high percentage of women in upper management or as board members achieve stronger financial performance compared to those with a relatively",

This sense of purpose helps create a richer and more rewarding work environment that reduces stress and promotes satisfaction and well-being. Additionally, volunteering can increase overall employee health, which is shown in a study by S. S. Johnson (2017). 17\n\n## Social Investment > Employee Engagement\n\nBy engaging our employees in social sabbaticals, their creating of significant social impact led to increased employee engagement.\n\nMueller et al. (2012) have found that employees' perception of a\n\ncompany's commitment to corporate social responsibility is positively linked to their own commitment to the organization. 18\n\n## Social Investment > Growth\n\nA study by Muritala (2013) suggests that corporate social responsibility (or what we characterize as social investment) is likely to have a positive impact on an organization's financial performance. 19 In our experience, social investments do, in fact, have a positive impact on our ability to acquire new customers, especially in emerging markets.\n\n## Profitability > Social Investment\n\nIt is a common practice for companies to invest a certain percentage of their annual profits in programs and activities that create a positive social impact. We believe that higher profit is therefore likely to lead SAP to make greater social investments.\n\n## Capability Building\n\nCapability building is the internal hiring rate (promotions only) into management or expert positions as compared to the external hiring rate into such positions.\n\n## Capability Building > Employee Retention\n\nAccording to the Global Workforce Study (2012), the 'chances to advance the career' is the second-most important driver of employee retention. 20 By promoting and thus growing from within,\n\nSAP creates career opportunities for our employees. In turn, it is our expectation that this opportunity leads to an increase in employee retention.\n\n## Capability Building > Employee Engagement\n\nBecause it is closely linked to how much a company develops its employees and supports their careers, internal hiring to management and expert positions positively affects employees' commitment and loyalty. This hypothesis was confirmed by a study by Bedarkar & Pandita (2014), which identified 'career opportunities' as the key driver of employee engagement. 21\n\n## Capability Building > Women in Management\n\nLike many of our IT industry peers, SAP has less women than men in senior positions. Given our significant pool of talent, we assume that internal promotions will increase the percentage of women in management positions.\n\n## Growth\n\nGrowth is one of our strategic objectives. We measure it through several KPIs, for example total revenue that SAP receives from the sale of our products and services.\n\n## Social Investment > Growth\n\nA study by Muritala (2013) suggests that corporate social responsibility (or what we characterize as social investment) is likely to have a positive impact on an organization's financial performance. 22 In our experience, social investments do, in fact, have a positive impact on our ability to acquire new customers, especially in emerging markets.\n\n## Women in Management > Growth\n\nStudies show that companies with a relatively high percentage of women in upper management ranks or as board members achieve stronger financial performance compared to those with a relatively low percentage (Catalyst, 2013). 23 We believe that having a higher share of women in management positions will increase our revenue as it helps us to better serve our diverse customer base.\n\n## BHCI > Growth\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We were able to prove a significant positive correlation between the BHCI and revenue.\n\n## Employee Retention > Growth\n\nMeifert (2005) stated a clear relationship between employee retention and the company's revenue and margin. 24\n\n## Carbon Emissions > Growth\n\nLowering SAP's carbon emissions could have a positive impact on SAP's revenue because customers increasingly ask their suppliers to act sustainably. This reasoning is supported by a study by PwC (2013) confirming the existence of a positive correlation between a company's environmental performance and financial performance. 25 On the other hand, where additional travel is conducted to generate additional business, the resulting increase in SAP's carbon emissions could have positive impact on growth.\n\n## Employee Engagement > Growth\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of employee engagement.

(2010), stating that improving financial performance appears to increase general satisfaction and some specific work perceptions. 26\n\n## Customer Loyalty > Growth\n\nReichheld (2003) found a strong correlation between companies' Customer NPS results and their revenue growth rates. 27 We support this view, as we believe that loyal SAP customers are likely to recommend SAP products to other companies, which is likely to result in increased sales and stronger revenue.\n\n## Growth > Profitability\n\nProfit (or loss) is the total of income less expenses; if revenue as the main part of total income grows at a higher rate than costs, it will lead to greater profit.\n\n## Profitability\n\nProfitability is one of our strategic objectives. We measure it through operating profit. Profit (or loss) is the total of income less expenses.\n\n## BHCI > Profitability\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of the BHCI. We showed what a change by 1pp of the BHCI would mean for SAP's operating profit.\n\n## Employee Engagement > Profitability\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, we used real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of employee engagement. We showed what a change by 1pp of employee engagement would mean for SAP's operating profit.\n\n## Profitability > Employee Engagement\n\nIn our view, high profits, as great business news, can raise employee morale, encourage identification with our purpose, and help increase employee engagement. On the other hand, we believe that a high profit expectation can also have a negative impact on employee engagement. If cost savings and budget cuts are implemented to reach an ambitious profit target, employees might feel constrained and dissatisfied.\n\n## Women in Management > Profitability\n\nStudies show that companies with a high level of gender diversity outperform companies with an average level in terms of return on equity (11.4% versus an average 10.3%); operating results (EBIT 11.1% versus 5.8%); and stock price increases (64% versus 47% over the period 2005-2007) (McKinsey, 2007). 28 It is therefore likely that having a higher share of women in management positions will result in higher profit for SAP.\n\n## Profitability > Social Investment\n\nIt is a common practice for companies to invest a certain percentage of their annual profits in programs and activities that create a positive social impact.

We showed what a change by 1pp of employee retention would mean for SAP's operating profit.\n\n## Total Energy Consumed > Profitability\n\nWe have found that reduced energy consumption is strongly correlated with a reduction in costs. Therefore, any cost avoidance achieved has a positive impact on our profit.\n\n## Growth > Profitability\n\nProfit (or loss) is the total of income less expenses; if revenue as the main part of total income grows at a higher rate than costs, it will lead to greater profit.\n\n## Customer Loyalty > Profitability\n\nWe believe that positive experiences among our customers can significantly increase business with existing customers, as well as help attract new customers. Both results can lower the cost of sales, thereby increasing our profit.\n\n## Carbon Emissions > Profitability\n\nWe are using real data from SAP to analyze and prove the financial impact of our carbon emissions, as detailed in the Energy and Emissions section.\n\n## Customer Loyalty\n\nCustomer loyalty is measured with the Net Promoter Score: Percentage of customers that are likely to recommend SAP to friends or colleagues minus the percentage of customers that are unlikely to do so.\n\n## Women in Management > Customer Loyalty\n\nDiversity programs - including those focused on the promotion of women to management positions - have a direct and positive impact on customer satisfaction (Catalyst, 2013). 29\n\n## Employee Retention > Customer Loyalty\n\nKoys (2001) has found evidence that employee turnover has a negative impact on customer satisfaction. 30 We believe this effect stems from the fact that experienced employees work more efficiently, have better product knowledge, and can build trusting relationships with colleagues and customers, so therefore have the ability to better serve customers' needs.\n\n## Carbon Emissions > Customer Loyalty\n\nWe believe that lowering SAP's carbon emissions has a positive reputational effect, thereby enhancing SAP's standing with its customers.\n\n## Customer Loyalty > Growth\n\nReichheld (2003) found a strong correlation between companies' Customer NPS results and their revenue growth rates. 31 We support this view, as we believe that loyal SAP customers are likely to recommend SAP products to other companies, which is likely to result in increased sales and stronger revenue.\n\n## Customer Loyalty > Profitability\n\nWe believe that positive experiences among our customers can significantly increase business with existing customers, as well as",

However, because lowering emissions also brings certain restrictions, such as on business travel, it may also have a negative impact on employee engagement.\n\n## Employee Engagement > Carbon Emissions\n\nWe believe that engaged employees are likely to want to help SAP achieve our target in lowering carbon emissions. Yet another possible outcome is that a higher level of employee engagement may lead to more business activity requiring travel, and therefore could lead to an increase in carbon emissions.\n\n## Carbon Emissions > Growth\n\nLowering SAP's carbon emissions could have a positive impact on SAP's revenue because customers increasingly ask their suppliers to act sustainably.

For the first time, we assessed economic, social, and environmental topics in our reporting according to three criteria:\n\n- 1) Importance to stakeholders (Y-axis)\n- 2) Relevance to SAP's business success (X-axis)\n- 3) Magnitude of the impact on society, the environment, and the economy (differently colored circles)\n\nBelow, we have detailed the key stages of the process.\n\n## Identification\n\nWe compiled a list of approximately 100 potentially relevant topics based on guidance from standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), as well as our existing materiality topics. We also considered a materiality assessment for the information and communications technology industry by the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) as well as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). When identifying key topics and their boundaries, we looked at areas related to our operations and supply chain as well as at topics related to our solutions. Since we oriented ourselves on the topics provided in the Datamaran matrix, the selected topics are more detailed than in our last materiality assessment.\n\n## Prioritization\n\nWe ranked topics by their importance to stakeholders by analyzing six external sources. These sources included corporate peer reports; mandatory and voluntary regulations for the software sector; online news related to the technology equipment and services industry; tweets; and questionnaires gathering nonfinancial information from socially responsible investors and clients.\n\nNext, we evaluated the financial, operational, and strategic relevance of each topic to SAP's business success, drawing on an analysis by SAP sustainability experts from various units and regions.\n\nFinally, based on survey responses gathered from SAP sustainability experts, we considered the potential impacts on society, the environment, and the economy, ranking topics as either low, medium, or high.\n\n## Validation\n\nAs part of our materiality assessment process in 2020, selected topics and the results of the materiality analysis were reviewed and confirmed by our steering committee for integrated reporting, our sustainability council, and our sustainability advisory panel. Our chief financial officer and Board sponsor for sustainability and integrated reporting was also informed about the results.\n\n## Review\n\nFeedback on and analysis of our integrated report will be taken into account during future materiality assessments.\n\n## Results\n\nOur materiality matrix for prioritizing our reporting topics is shown in the following graphic. We have categorized topics according to whether they are sustainability challenges or sustainability management practices. The former affect SAP and are also impacted by us, whereas the latter offer guidance on how to deal with these challenges.\n\nCompared to our last materiality assessment in 2016, we saw an increase in the importance attributed to climate change and air quality as well as human rights. We have estimated our impact on today's society, environment, and economy and we expect the impact level to change as we continue to design solutions to manage areas such as climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMateriality Matrix for Prioritizing Our Reporting Topics (numbers in the matrix are explained in the table on the following page)\n\nIn our reporting, we seek to meet the materiality requirements of both the GRI Standards and the German implementation act of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (CSR-Richtlinie-\n\nUmsetzungsgesetz, CSR-RUG). Because of the diverging definitions of materiality, we see the following difference in material topics:",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nFor SAP, stakeholder engagement and collaboration are deeply embedded into our process of innovation and the development of our products and services. Before we can design a new solution, we must first understand the issue we are addressing. This is why we regularly liaise with the stakeholder groups described below, including our sustainability and AI ethics advisory panels.\n\n## Customers\n\nFor more information about our customer engagement programs, see the Customers section.\n\n## Employees\n\nWe survey our employees regularly throughout the year. For the results of our latest employee survey and action items resulting from it, see the Employees and Social Investments section.\n\nWe strive for constructive labor relations across the world, working within each country's requirements. We currently have social partners in 35 countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. These employee representative bodies consist of elected union members and/or non-union members, and are consulted by SAP management mainly on topics that define the work environment and work processes. Collective bargaining agreements with unions are only made in countries where legally required. Overall, about 51% of our employees are represented by works councils or an independent trade union, or are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Board answers employees' questions in quarterly all-hands meetings. In regular coffee corner sessions, senior executives explain our strategy to employees and answer their questions directly.\n\n## Financial Analysts and Investors\n\nFor more information about our dialog with the financial community (that is, financial analysts, institutional investors, and retail shareholders), see the Investor Relations section.\n\n## Governments\n\nFor more information about our dialog with governments, see the Public Policy section.\n\n## Industry Analysts\n\nOur Analyst Relations team, the Executive Board, and executives have strong relations with IT analysts and engage with them on strategic SAP solutions and services on a frequent basis.\n\n## Partners\n\nWith more than 22,000 partners around the world, the SAP ecosystem is vital to our success. We take a multifaceted approach to partner engagement that begins with our interactive partner portal SAPPartnerEdge.com. Additionally, partner-dedicated focus groups and events such as the SAP Global Partner Summit are held throughout the year, around the globe and virtually, to educate\n\npartners and further gauge their feedback on how SAP can continuously improve. For more information about our ecosystem, see the section Products, Research & Development, and Services.\n\n## Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) and Academia\n\nOur dialog with NPOs and academic institutions helps us understand how we can address today's most pressing issues with our solutions and what is expected from us as a corporation. For example, SAP University Alliances introduces students and faculty to SAP software by providing networking and educational activities and partnering to build technology skills. For more information about how we engage with NPOs, see the Employees and Social Investments and Our Contribution to the UN SDGs sections.\n\n## Sustainability Advisory Panel\n\nOur sustainability advisory panel consists of expert representatives from our customers, investors, partners, NPOs, and academia. In 2020, the panel discussed key initiatives such as Climate 21, the circular economy, and our engagement in the Value Balancing Alliance. The panel also provided input on our materiality assessment.\n\n## AI Ethics Advisory Panel\n\nOur AI ethics advisory panel consists of academic, policy, and industry experts who advise us on the development and operationalization of the guiding principles for artificial intelligence.",

For more information about our renewed corporate strategy, see the Strategy and Business Model section.\n\nWe aim to create positive economic, environmental, and social impact within the planetary boundaries using two key levers:\n\n- -1) Providing products and services that meet the sustainability challenges and opportunities of our customers (enabler)\n- -2) Leading by example in our own sustainable business operations and practices (exemplar)\n\nOur chief sustainability officer (CSO) reports directly to the chief financial officer (CFO) who is the sponsor for sustainability on the Executive Board. The CSO chairs the Sustainability Council which consists of dedicated senior executives in charge of sustainability in each Board area. Together with the CSO's team, the Council is accountable for driving SAP's holistic, cross-company sustainability agenda and setting annual objectives and priorities.\n\n## Changing Our Behavior and Culture\n\nEmployee engagement is essential for driving change throughout SAP. We set up a number of programs to help employees understand how sustainability is engrained in our purpose and strategy, and how they can contribute.\n\nWe ran most of our campaigns in 2020 in a virtual mode to reach our employees in their home offices. An increased number of talks with our CSO , a newly introduced monthly 'Sustainability Open House, ' a 'Sustainability in Practice' series on SAP's Purpose Network Live platform, a virtual Month of Service, and a\n\nbroad range of global and local Web seminars and online workshops helped to maintain the dialogue with employees on sustainability.\n\nThe SAP One Billion Lives initiative gives employees the permission, time, technology, and mentorship to generate positive social impact through innovation. In 2020, many teams worked on ideas of how to respond to various challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic by using technology for the common good.\n\nWe also launched Values to Value , an interactive Web experience to simulate holistic, responsible business decisions, and ran two gamification-oriented online challenges with hands-on tasks that employees could complete from home to contribute to selected Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nSAP continues to include sustainability in its onboarding training for new hires and various line-of-business-specific learning offerings. Furthermore, employees can take openSAP online courses on sustainability, which are also available to the general public for free.\n\nTo help drive progress in our sustainability initiatives, we need the support of employees in every part of SAP. We have a global internal network of more than 250 sustainability champions who represent different regions and areas of the business at SAP. Not only do they act as role models and multipliers, these champions also tailor sustainability engagement activities to local and lines-ofbusiness needs and interests and share best practices.\n\nWe measure the success of our initiatives through our employee engagement surveys. The latest results from 2019 showed that 94% of our employees agreed with the statement 'It is important for SAP to pursue sustainability.' (2009: 77%). Furthermore, 87% of our employees stated 'I actively contribute to sustainability goals at SAP.' This is up from 47% in 2009 when we introduced the question.",

From eliminating single-use plastics, decreasing carbon emissions, and reducing oversized packages, close collaboration with our supplier network are factors that contribute to a sustainable supply chain.\n\nWe aim to transform our Global Procurement Organization (GPO) into a purpose-driven organization, which is why we established the overarching Procurement with Purpose strategy promoting purpose-driven topics such as diversity and responsible resource usage.\n\n## Governance\n\nSAP's GPO is led by our chief procurement officer (CPO). Reporting to our CPO are the heads of our procurement categories (1) Car Fleet, (2) IT Infrastructure, (3) Marketing & Travel, (4) Professional Services, and (5) Workplace Infrastructure and their teams.\n\nAlso reporting to the CPO, the chief operating officer (COO) is responsible to enable processes and governance within the GPO.\n\nOur CPO and chief sustainability officer meet each quarter to discuss the progress and challenges related to embedding sustainability in our procurement practices. 1\n\n## Upholding High Standards Across Our Supply Chain\n\nSAP's supplier code of conduct (SCoC) is included in our standard supplier contracts and is an essential part of our supplier registration. This supplier registration ensures that potential suppliers of SAP are aware of SAP's SCoC. We review and update our SCoC regularly to maintain high standards within our supplier network. This strengthens the code's enforceability and sends a clear message about its importance for SAP.\n\nIn 2020, we updated our SCoC to include requirements for sustainable packaging (such as plastic-free, appropriately sized boxes) and it contains provisions on the Modern Slavery Act, diversity and inclusion, and a labor standards chapter that expressly refers to human rights.\n\nFurthermore, we recommend to SAP suppliers that they deliver goods and services that are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.\n\n## What We Buy and Where We Buy It From\n\nWe consider our suppliers to be key partners in our business success. In 2020, we spent approximately \u20ac5.1 billion in purchases from more than 14,700 suppliers worldwide (2019: approximately \u20ac5.3 billion from more than 18,500 suppliers worldwide). Within our five categories and our Sourcing Excellence Champions unit, we approach sustainability from different angles: Workplace Infrastructure (example: reduced plastics and packaging),\n\nProfessional Services (example: CO2-reduced mobility concepts, electronic contracts), Marketing & Travel (example: sustainable merchandise and events), IT Infrastructure (example: sustainable cooling of data centers), and Car Fleet (example: sustainable mobility concepts).\n\n## Suppliers by Category (Tier 1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supplier Locations\n\nPercent of suppliers per region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 Car Fleet includes procurement relating to the global company car fleet. IT Infrastructure procures products and services for SAP's cloud business such as network services and data center and co-location goods and services. Marketing & Travel supports topi cs related to SAP's marketing, events, merchandise, and business travel areas. Professional Services includes application and development services as well as financial and legal services. Sourcing Excellence Champions are responsible for the seamless execution of procurement and sourcing activities and are drivers for customer satisfaction and end user success. Workplace Infrastructure includes procurement for areas such as facility services, client services, and equipment, communication, and collaboration services.",

        "page_content": "## Social Procurement\n\nWe believe that diverse and sustainable businesses bring significant added value to SAP.\n\nEstablishing an inclusive supplier network - that is, minority enterprises defined by gender, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and other characteristics, as well as certified social enterprises that focus their company's mission on making social impact - have become a key priority for SAP. We believe that our commitment to an inclusive, bias-free culture in our workplace must be mirrored in our approach to our supplier base.\n\nDriven by our GPO, SAP's supplier diversity and social enterprise programs are an integral part of our transformation into a purposedriven organization. These programs aim to build the capacity of diverse and social businesses to provide a fair chance at competing for contracts and are treated equally with other SAP suppliers. Utilizing the procurement skills and expertise within the organization, our GPO engages in skills-based volunteering to build the capacity of social enterprises in the Sustainable Growth of Revenues for International Development (S-GRID) program by the social purpose organization MovingWorlds.\n\nAs part of its Procurement with Purpose program, SAP is currently a corporate member of the following supplier and social enterprise certification organizations in 2020:\n\n## Supplier Diversity:\n\n- -National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)\n- -WEConnect International\n- -Disability:IN\n- -US Business Leadership Network (USBLN)\n\n## Social Enterprise:\n\n- -Social Enterprise UK\n- -Buy Social Canada\n- -Social Traders (Australia)\n\nThese organizations allow the GPO to identify opportunities to engage with diverse suppliers and social enterprises, to support the 5 & 5 by '25 social procurement spend targets. This target is defined as 5% addressable spend with diverse suppliers and 5% addressable spend with Social Enterprises by year end 2025. The previous spend target of 5% spend by 2020 only focused on diverse suppliers where reporting is available. At the end of 2020, we achieved \u20ac325 million (6.4%) diverse spend in the United States.\n\nTo ensure all diverse and social spend is captured, our GPO evaluates its supplier network to identify and register all existing certified diverse suppliers and social enterprises. Activities such as this and expanding our efforts with the Buy Social Corporate Challenge aim to enable SAP to fulfill our pledge and shift our addressable spend to diverse suppliers and social enterprises.\n\n## Improving Sustainability Through Practice\n\nThe SAP Ariba Supplier Risk solution enables our GPO to identify, manage, mitigate, and avoid sustainability risks within our supply chain. These risks include, for example, workplace discrimination, workplace safety neglect, the use of child labor,\n\nhuman trafficking, and environmental disasters such as oil spills and radioactive contamination.\n\nAs outlined in the Waste and Water section, the GPO is one of the focus areas of the interdisciplinary Beyond Single-Use Plastics initiative. From addressing plastic packaging materials, to the items in our SAP Ariba catalog, our GPO is engaging with all relevant suppliers to remove single-use plastics from their packaging material and their offered product portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Waste and Water\n\n## Taking a Global Approach\n\nOur waste and water strategy aims to continuously reduce SAP's impact on the environment. By promoting Company-wide initiatives, we strive to generate less waste and reduce the amount of water we use in locations worldwide. A global approach combined with local targets and initiatives allow for optimizing our environmental performance.\n\nTaking steps to recycle our waste and save water also contributes to our business performance. Through ongoing initiatives at SAP sites, we reduce our operational costs while engaging our employees in our efforts.\n\n## Managing Our E-Waste\n\nOur e-waste comes from data center servers and from IT equipment including PCs, peripherals, and mobile devices. In multiple SAP locations, we cooperate with international and local ewaste disposal partners to refurbish, recycle, and dispose our ewaste.\n\nThe amount of e-waste has remained at a relatively stable level since 2016, with the exception of a significant rise in 2019. This increase was due to multiple factors, such as internal restructuring measures (that is, large relocations) and reconstruction projects and enhancements to the decommissioning process of our servers and data center machinery. Our transition towards the cloud also contributed to this increase, through the continuous removal of obsolete on-premise devices and machines.\n\n## E-Waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cutting Down on Waste\n\nIn 2020, our continuous effort to improve waste segregation and evolve our processes at offices across the globe came to a slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic as many sites were closed for months. Nonetheless, as part of our ISO 14001 program,\n\nSAP Finland implemented two centralized waste segregation stations and single-use plastics were eliminated in many SAP locations such as Bangalore, Newtown Square, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Tokyo.\n\nWe reduced our paper usage by 80% (over 66 million pages) since 2009, despite a 115.3% increase in employee headcount over the same period. Initiatives such as the continuous global rollout of a secure pull-printing system (used by about 86,000 employees) or the implementation of double-sided black-and-white printouts by default supported this decrease. In 2020, we also continued our approach of paperless contracting. By using the SAP Signature Management application by DocuSign, which enables electronic signatures, we were able to cut down the printing of paper-based contracts by more than 224,000 pages in 2020 (2019: about 205,000 pages - considering the same procurement contract types as in 2020).\n\nAs most employees worked from home in 2020 due to the pandemic, the printing volume went down by 35% (31.1 million pages) compared to 2019.\n\n## Finding Alternatives to Single-Use Plastic\n\nSAP has committed itself to address plastic pollution, both as enabler and exemplar. We made a commitment with our customers to strive for a dramatically cleaner ocean by 2030 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, alongside the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, World Wildlife Fund, and Global Plastic Action Partnership. To make the circular economy the de facto approach to material use and waste management, we are working with our customers and partners around solutions which allow, for example:\n\n- -Responsible sourcing and secondary marketplaces, including sustainably connecting brands with waste-picker communities by using SAP's Plastics Cloud enabled by the Ariba Network\n- -Resource recovery and reuse, including insights from downstream materials\n- -Enabling citizens to find their role and best-fit solutions to help solve ocean plastic pollution through the SHiFT platform developed in close collaboration with Emily Penn and eXXpedition\n\nTo lead by example, SAP has continued to execute on its commitment to phase out single-use plastics by the end of 2020 as part of its global environmental policy's goals. The interdisciplinary 'Beyond Single-Use Plastics' initiative is based on identifying and eliminating single-use plastics and introducing sustainable alternatives based on three principles: reduce waste, reuse items, and recycle materials.\n\nWorldwide, SAP locations collaborate with their cafeteria suppliers and service providers to eliminate single-use plastic products such as bottles, cups, stirrers, straws, and cutlery. We also continue to reduce single-use plastics in our internal procurement processes as outlined in the Sustainable Procurement section. The established 'Choose to Reuse' campaign aims to increase visibility",

To get back on track, we plan to pilot the first two plastic-free cafeteria kiosks at SAP's headquarters in Walldorf once COVID-19 lockdown restrictions are lifted. The lessons learned and experiences will be used to refine the concept and make it suitable for a global rollout. In addition, a digital reusable system for takeout, delivery, and convenience food is expected to be rolled out for all SAP locations in Germany in 2021.\n\n## Using Water Efficiently\n\nWhile our operations are not water-intensive, we continue to use water as efficiently as possible in our data centers and offices. For example, in the data centers of our headquarters, we use adiabatic cooling as well as a closed water circuit to minimize water consumption for cooling our server racks. At our headquarters and other office locations, we use rain and run-off water for irrigation and toilets.\n\nA number of our offices are located in areas with significant water scarcity. In 2020, we addressed this issue with dedicated\n\nwater management efforts in SAP South Africa. For instance, in Cape Town, two water tanks were installed to harvest rain and condensation water for irrigation.\n\nIn 2020, our global water usage dropped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the strong reduction in the usage of our offices coupled with our implemented water reduction measures.\n\n## Global Water Usage\n\n<!-- image -->",

These boundaries are listed in detail in the GRI Standard Content Index.\n\n## Social Indicators\n\nData for our social indicators is collected and reported on a quarterly or annual basis and is audited at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Employee Retention\n\nWe define employee retention as the ratio of the average number of employees minus the employees who voluntarily departed, to the average number of employees, taking into account the past 12 months (in full-time equivalents, or FTEs). This ratio puts emphasis on employee-initiated turnover - in other words, we seek to measure how many employees choose to stay with SAP. As opposed to keeping a low turnover rate, we aim to keep our retention rate high. The number of voluntarily departed employees excludes the voluntary part of restructuring-related departures for more transparency and precise headcount management purposes.\n\n## Women in Management\n\nWe define 'women in management' as the share of women in management positions as compared to the total number of managers, expressed by the number of individuals and not FTEs.\n\n- -Managers managing teams: Refers to managing teams of at least one employee or vacant positions\n- -Managers managing managers: Refers to managing managers who manage teams\n- -Board members\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nWe define employee engagement as a score for the level of employee commitment, pride, and loyalty, as well as our employees' feeling of advocacy for SAP.\n\nIt is calculated based on the results of our engagement survey program '#Unfiltered' powered by Qualtrics. In 2020, we switched from an annual engagement measurement to gauging engagement multiple times throughout the year. The overall program focuses on measuring key people outcome indices, Employee Engagement and Leadership Trust, as well as the organizational and team factors derived from the strategy that impacts engagement, such as Business Health Culture, Innovation, or Process Simplification. In the #Unfiltered survey in May, 62,490 employees participated (response rate: 62%), and in the #Unfiltered survey in September, 69,602 participated (response rate: 69%). All employees were invited to take part in the 2020 #Unfiltered survey cycle.\n\n## Business Health Culture Index\n\nThe Business Health Culture Index (BHCI) is an indicator of the extent to which SAP successfully offers employees a working environment that promotes health supporting their long-term employability and their active engagement in reaching our corporate goals. The index covers questions concerning how employees rate their personal well-being and the working conditions at SAP, including our leadership culture.\n\nThe BHCI is calculated based on the results of our '#Unfiltered' program.",

        "page_content": "## Non-Financial Notes: Environmental Performance\n\nWe understand environmental performance as the measurable outcome of SAP's ability to meet environmental objectives and targets set forth in our environmental policy. In this context, we determine SAP's greenhouse gas footprint (in the following called carbon emissions), total energy consumed, and data center electricity as the three key environmental performance indicators. Furthermore, we realize external reductions by purchasing offsets and renewable energy which is partly self-generated in SAP locations but primarily purchased in the form of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Plus, we identify SAP's waste and water consumption as additional environmental aspects.\n\nBy looking at the energy usage and emissions throughout our entire value chain, we gain insights to help us manage our environmental performance and, in turn, help our customers to do the same.\n\nOur gross carbon emissions for 2020 were 410 kilotons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) (2019: 794 kilotons CO2e), including all carbon emission categories in Scope 1 and 2, as well as selected categories of Scope 3 as outlined in the figure below. Our net carbon emissions (135 kilotons in 2020) are calculated by deducting purchased renewable energy certificates, self-generated renewable energy, and carbon offsets from our gross carbon emissions in the respective reporting period.\n\n## General Information\n\nWe consider the principle of Sustainability Context (the performance of the organization in the context of the limits and demands placed on environmental or social resources at the sectoral, local, regional, or global level) in a number of ways, such as by looking at global issues or trends including climate change and demographic shifts. For example, we assess our carbon emissions in the context of the emissions of the entire information and communications technology landscape, with particular focus on the abatement potential of the industry. When it comes to completeness, we recognize that while we comply with this principle in reporting on our own operations, we are still developing methodologies to reliably quantify our impact through our solutions.\n\n## Boundaries\n\nOur reporting takes two different perspectives into account: SAP as a company, which includes all our legal entities and operations and supply chain, and SAP as a solution provider enabling our customers. These boundaries are listed in detail in the Content Index of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).\n\n## Reporting Approach\n\nData for our environmental indicators is collected and reported on a quarterly basis and is subject to external assurance for annual reporting.\n\nReporting on total energy consumed and data center electricity is based on the data collected for the calculation of our carbon emissions. All numbers are based on the metric system. Whenever we state 'tons,' we mean metric tons.\n\n## Carbon Emissions\n\n## Definition\n\nWe define the carbon emissions as the sum of all greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e) measured and reported for SAP, including the compensation with renewable energy or offsets.\n\n## Reporting Principles\n\nSAP's preparation of the carbon emissions is based on the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol Scope 2 Guidance and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard of the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. This approach conforms to the requirements of GRI Standard indicators 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3.\n\nIn alignment with the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, we report our net carbon emissions based on the two different calculation approaches: the classic location-based method and the market-based method.\n\n## Organizational Boundaries\n\nSAP defines its organizational boundaries by applying the operational control approach as set out in the GHG Protocol.\n\nOperational control is established when SAP has the full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies. The emissions of all operations over which the company has operational control and all owned, leased facilities, co-location data centers, and vehicles that the company occupies or operates are accounted for in the carbon emissions. They are based either on measurements or, where no measured data is available, on estimations and extrapolations.\n\nA portion of SAP's leased facilities operates under full-service or multitenant leases, where SAP does not have access to actual energy consumption information. SAP includes these facilities in our definition of operational control and accounts for them by estimating related energy consumption.\n\nTo support the growing demand for SAP's cloud offerings, we subcontract computation power in local third-party data centers. Carbon emissions are approximated and included based on the consumed or extrapolated computation power.\n\nIn most instances, however, SAP has 100% ownership of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, the difference between applying the control versus the equity approach is about 0.8% based on SAP revenue. If investments in associates were included, the difference would be even smaller, about 0.7%.",

        "page_content": "## Data Consistency\n\n## Comparability\n\nSAP uses a significance threshold of 5% for structural or organizational changes of total current-year emissions. A structural or organizational change that increases or decreases the total carbon inventory by 5% or more will trigger an adjustment of past years. A structural or organizational change that increases or decreases the total inventory by less than 5% will be considered insignificant and thus no adjustment will be made.\n\nAdditionally, we annually measure the cumulative cost avoidance of our carbon emissions, compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Since 2015, we apply a cumulative cost avoidance calculation approach using a triennial rolling method. This leads to additional comparability.\n\n## Error Correction and Methodology Change\n\nIf a significant methodological change occurs or a significant error is found in the base year inventory, it will be corrected. If a significant methodological change occurs or a significant error is found that does not affect the base year but has an impact on the current or preceding year's emissions, it will be corrected. A methodology change or an error is significant if it affects SAP's gross carbon footprint by more than 1%. No restatement due to a methodology change or an error correction of historical data was necessary in 2020.\n\n## Conversion Factors\n\nThe calculation of the carbon emissions is based on factors for conversion and extrapolation provided, among others, by IEA, US EPA, UK DEFRA, Environmental Paper Network, Environment Canada, GHG Protocol, and SAP's own measurements.\n\nWhere relevant, our conversion factors consider CO2 equivalents (CO2e) for greenhouse gases. Global Warming Potential factors are based on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We report all our carbon emissions in CO2 equivalents (CO2e) including the impact from CH4 and N2O in our target-relevant Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. The emission impact of refrigerants includes hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) only. As SF6 and PFCs mainly occur in chemical processes, they are not relevant for us. Since 2016, we annually review all our emissions and extrapolation factors and update them if required. Before 2016, the factors were stable each year as they were based on calculations from 2009.\n\nDue to office closures and travel restrictions during the COVID19 pandemic, the 2020 extrapolation factors for the following emission categories were reduced in alignment with the global facility team and/or global controlling team: stationary combustion in facilities, refrigerants in facilities and corporate cars, mobile combustion in corporate cars, electricity in office buildings, purchased chilled and hot water, steam, and employee commuting.\n\n## Methodology and Further Details\n\nBelow you will find the different parameters contributing to our carbon emissions. We use 'carbon emissions' as the common term for greenhouse gas emissions or CO2e. Data coverage refers to the share of measured data (compared to extrapolated data) that are\n\nthe basis for emissions calculation, such as kWh for electricity emissions or liters of fuel for corporate car emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scope 1\n\nRefers to direct carbon emissions and is defined as emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization. At SAP, the following areas are covered by Scope 1:\n\n- -Stationary Combustion in Facilities : Emissions caused by oil or gas combustion of heating systems and generators in SAP office buildings and data centers. Emission calculation is based on gas and oil consumption in kWh. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m 2 ) based on the previous year's stationary combustion consumption data are used for extrapolation (75% data coverage). In cases where no specific information is available, natural gas reported by local sites is assumed to be reported in Lower Heating Value. Besides gas and oil, we also began using wood pellets to produce thermal heat for our buildings. The Scope 1 emissions of wood pellets can be set to net '0', since the wood itself absorbs an equivalent amount of carbon emissions during the growth phase as the amount of emissions released through combustion. Still, to ensure complete accounting for all emissions caused, we document the direct carbon dioxide impact of burning wood pellets as 'outside of scopes' carbon emissions. In 2020, these emissions accounted for one kiloton of carbon emissions.\n- -Refrigerants in Facilities : HFC emissions caused by the use of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. The emissions are extrapolated based on the number of server units in data centers and office space with an air conditioning (A/C) system (100% data coverage). All refrigerants are assumed to be HFC134a.\n- -Mobile Combustion in Corporate Cars : Emissions from fuel combustion of company cars. In the context of carbon reporting, the term company car refers to all cars for which SAP permanently covers the fuel costs. Emission calculation is based on fuel consumption. In 2020, 28 countries reported actual fuel data (92% data coverage); for other countries, stable values (liters/car) are used for extrapolation based on the number of",

        "page_content": "corporate cars reported. The stable values for extrapolation are based on the previous year's carbon emissions data.\n\n- -Refrigerants in Corporate Cars : HFC emissions caused by air conditioning devices in company cars. Refrigerant emissions are based on an estimate of HFC1234yf emissions per car (in Europe) and HFC134a emissions per car (for the rest of the world) and are extrapolated based on the number of corporate cars reported (100% data coverage).\n- -Mobile Combustion in Corporate Jets : Emissions caused by business trips with SAP-owned or chartered jets. Emission calculation for SAP's own jets is based on actual fuel consumption (100% data coverage).\n\n## Scope 2\n\nRefers to indirect carbon emissions and is defined as emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from the organization. To determine SAP's global net emissions, we use the location-based method to calculate the Scope 2 emissions. Additionally, we disclose our market-based Scope 2 emissions in the interactive chart generator. At SAP, the following emission categories are covered by Scope 2:\n\n- -Electricity in Office Buildings : Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity in office buildings. Calculation of emissions is based on building electricity consumption. Country-specific emission factors are updated annually. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m 2 ) based on the previous year's energy consumption data are used for extrapolation (70% data coverage).\n- -Electricity in Data Centers: Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity in SAP-owned and operated data centers. The calculation of emissions is based on data center electricity consumption (100% data coverage). CO2e conversion factors are updated annually based on countryspecific grid factors.\n- -Purchased Chilled and Hot Water, and Steam: Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased heat or steam in office buildings (district heating). Calculation of emissions is based on consumption of district heating. Emission factors are updated annually. Where no measured data is available, stable values (kWh/m 2 ) based on the previous year's energy consumption data are used for extrapolation (41% data coverage).\n\n## Scope 3\n\nRefers to other indirect carbon emissions and is defined as emissions that are a consequence of operations of an organization, but are not directly owned or controlled by the organization. Scope 3 emissions are divided into upstream and downstream emissions.\n\n## Upstream\n\nOnly selected upstream emissions are measured directly and hence included in our corporate carbon target. The following upstream Scope 3 carbon emissions are included in our target:\n\n- -Business Flights : Emissions caused by business trips by airplane. Calculation of emissions is based on actual distance travelled and actual costs spent (38% data coverage). This data is used to determine an average emission factor based on short, medium, and long-haul flight emission factors. For CO2\n\n- calculation, this factor is applied to actual controlling costs for business flights. Emission factors for business flights do not consider the radiative forcing factors.\n- -Rental Cars : Emissions caused by business trips by rental car. An average emission factor from rental cars is calculated based on actual distance traveled and actual costs spent (67% data coverage). This average emission factor is used for extrapolation based on the controlling costs.\n- -Train Travel : Emissions from business trips by train. An average emission factor from train travel is calculated based on actual distance traveled and actual costs spent (28% data coverage). This average factor is used for extrapolation based on the controlling costs. In Germany, business trips by train are considered carbon neutral as they are compensated with 100% green electricity by Deutsche Bahn.\n- -Business Trips with Private Cars : Emissions from business trips with employee-owned cars and company cars without fuel card. Carbon calculation is based on distance traveled with car (100% data coverage). Company car trips with fuel cards are excluded from this activity type.\n- -Employee Commuting : Emissions caused by commuting between home and work at an SAP office location. Considered are all modes of transport, excluding commuters with corporate cars. A system-integrated commuting survey about the distance to work and the mode of transport is regularly conducted for SAP globally. Approximately 28,000 employees responded to the last survey in 2018. These survey responses are the basis for carbon calculation of employee commuting in 2020. Commuting data for non-responding employees and quarterly updates are extrapolated based on the number of FTEs excluding those employees who own a company car (25% data coverage).\n- -Electricity in External Data Centers : Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity in data centers not operated by SAP. An external data center (co-location) is a local computing center with server units running SAP software that is operated by an external partner. CO2e conversion factors are updated annually based on country-specific grid factors. Electricity consumption for external data centers is extrapolated based on the consumed data center capacity and a power usage effectiveness (PUE) factor. Where no data is available, average factors are applied (75% data coverage).\n- -Electricity Consumed by Hyperscale Services: Emissions caused by the consumption of purchased electricity resulting from the usage of hyperscale services in providers' hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers enable massive, efficient, and robust scalability of computing, system, and server architecture in order to respond to the increasing demand for cloud computing and Big Data solutions. Electricity consumption is calculated based on the average allocated server memory size (RAM) of all hyperscale services. If RAM is not available, it is extrapolated based on prior-year data and the cost data of the current year. A power conversion factor is used to convert the allocated RAM value into a server power value. Data center utilization factor and PUE factors are used to extrapolate the total hyperscale service electricity. As these factors are not known, the average factors of external data centers are used (0% data coverage).\n- -Logistics : Emissions caused by mail and parcel shipments.

The calculation is based on printer tracker data (100% data coverage).\n\nEach year, we measure and publish additional upstream Scope 3 carbon emissions such as purchased goods and services and capital goods based on the GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. These emissions are not included in our corporate target and are meant for indicative purposes only.\n\nThe calculation of additional upstream emissions is based on an estimate. Due to the link of our upstream emissions to operating expenses, we extrapolated these upstream figures for 2020 by multiplying the four key contributors to our previous year's upstream emissions with the year-over-year change of operating expenses between 2019 and 2020.\n\nTogether, our upstream emissions including these estimates are responsible for about 12% of SAP's total carbon emissions.\n\n## Downstream\n\nThe following downstream emission category is measured directly and hence included in our corporate carbon target:\n\nData Download: Emissions caused by our customers downloading data/software from our servers. Carbon calculation is based on the data volume downloaded by our customers globally (89% data coverage).\n\nThe vast majority of our overall emissions stem from the use of our software. Even though we do not have control over our customers' IT landscapes, we do calculate related emissions for indicative purposes; the emissions are, however, not included in our corporate carbon target:\n\nUse of Sold Products : When SAP software runs on our customers' hardware and on their premises, the resulting carbon emissions are responsible for about 86% of SAP's total carbon emissions along our value chain (10.6 million tons in 2020). Resource need per year is determined using a landscape simulation. It is extrapolated globally based on the number of productive installations and power usage effectiveness (PUE). We use a PUE factor of 1.59, which is the average PUE of our external data centers. Emissions are calculated using a global electricity emission factor. Due to the special characteristics of software products, we chose an assessment of resource need per year. This deviates from the minimum boundaries as defined by the GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, which requires assessment and disclosure of 'direct use-phase emissions of sold products over their expected lifetime.' The calculation covers all of our major solutions, including on-premise software. Cloud solutions are not included, as they are part of internal and external data center electricity emissions. Mobile solutions (for example, SAP apps running on customer IT equipment) are also not included. Calculation parameters will be adapted when significant technology changes occur.\n\nTogether, our downstream emissions are responsible for about 86% of SAP's total carbon emissions.\n\n## Excluded Scope 3 Emissions\n\nThe following Scope 3 emissions sources are not applicable to SAP's business operations: Upstream Leased Assets, Processing of Sold Products, End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products, Downstream Leased Assets, Franchises, and investments.\n\n## External Reductions\n\nSAP uses external reductions, such as purchases of renewable energy and certified voluntary 'offsets,' to achieve its carbon targets. Emission reductions are subtracted from gross Scope 1 to Scope 3 emissions to achieve a net carbon inventory.\n\n## Renewable Electricity\n\nWe define renewable energy as electricity coming from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal. The amount of renewable energy used by SAP is calculated by adding the amounts of renewable energy produced onsite by our own solar cells and covered by Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).\n\nAs recommended by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and CDP, we actively look for the best available quality and standards, which support renewable energy projects that meet robust criteria in terms of environmental integrity, stakeholder inclusivity, and reporting and verification. We have developed a quality standard that defines key criteria for the procurement of RECs to drive change in the electricity market and to avoid the risk caused by lowquality products. The key characteristics of our renewable energy purchasing guidelines are as follows:\n\n- -Type of Renewable Electricity : SAP considers solar, wind, biogas, geothermal, and hydro power as renewable electricity. In 2020, we sourced only wind and solar energy.\n- -Installation : The power plant producing the renewable energy shall not be older than 10 years. In case of a renovation of an old power plant, the 10-year rule applies only to the additional electricity output due to efficiency increase. Furthermore, SAP does not consider RECs from government supported power plants.\n- -Vintage : The renewable electricity must be produced in the same year or the year preceding the reporting period to which it will be applied.\n- -Accounting : SAP uses the country-specific emissions factor to calculate the carbon reduction achieved by the RECs. RECs are considered independently to the electricity achieved through their procurement. SAP aims to consider the latest guidelines on REC market boundaries 6 .\n\nIn addition, all of our purchased renewable electricity is EKOenergycertified, a high-quality, internationally recognized not-for-profit ecolabel for renewable energy installations that fulfill additional sustainability criteria. Through the purchase of EKOenergy-certified electricity, we also contribute to EKOenergy's Climate Fund, which finances solar projects tackling energy poverty.\n\nTo calculate the carbon reductions of the RECs, the amount of purchased electricity is multiplied by the country-specific carbon factor derived from the location where the renewable energy was produced. The renewable electricity is confirmed by an official certificate or written confirmation of our respective REC suppliers (100% data coverage).",

        "page_content": "In the net carbon emissions, the purchased as well as the produced renewable electricity is already deducted from our Scope 2 and Scope 3 electricity emissions.\n\n## Carbon Offsets\n\nIn 2020, we further refined our internal carbon emissions calculation methodology and increased the requirements for dealing with carbon offsets:\n\n- -In 2020, the investments in the Livelihoods Carbon Funds (LCF) were used to compensate for a portion of our business flights as well as 100% of the following emissions categories: corporate jets, business trips with private cars, paper consumption, logistics (parcel and mail) and data download.\n- -By charging an internal carbon price for business flights and investing in the LCF, we were able to offset 80% (73 kt) of our business flights emissions in 2020.\n\nA requirement for carbon offsets is the application of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and equally high quality standards. SAP ensures that the quantified carbon emission reductions from offsets are credible and that they meet four key principles:\n\n- -Real : The carbon reductions represent actual emission reductions that have already occurred.\n- -Additional : The carbon reductions are surplus to regulation and would not have happened without the offset.\n- -Permanent : The carbon reductions are permanent or have guarantees to ensure that any losses are replaced in the future.\n- -Verifiable : The performance of the carbon reduction projects can be readily and accurately quantified, monitored, and verified. In the net carbon emissions, purchased offsets are already deducted from our gross emissions.\n\n## Total Energy Consumed\n\nWe define total energy consumed as the sum of all energy consumed through SAP-own operations (Scope 1 and 2), including energy from renewable sources. It is calculated based on the consumption data obtained through our measurements for the carbon emissions and is the sum of energy consumption from stationary combustion in facilities, mobile combustion in corporate cars, mobile combustion in corporate jets, electricity in offices, electricity in data centers, purchased chilled water, purchased hot water, and purchased steam.\n\n## Data Center Electricity\n\nWe define data center electricity as the sum of electricity consumed to provide internal and external computation power in SAP data centers, contracted third-party data centers, and hyperscale data centers. A data center is any global, regional, or local computing center (location with any number of server units) that is part of our global IT infrastructure strategy.\n\n## Additional Environmental Aspects\n\n## Water\n\nBy water, we mean the total amount of freshwater withdrawn for our office buildings and data centers. Data is based on measurements and estimations from sites. Data was provided for 60% of the total water consumption; remaining data is extrapolated based on square meter footage.\n\n## E-Waste\n\nBy e-waste, we mean any discarded electric devices used in our offices and data centers. Data is based on the weight of the devices (95% data coverage).",

In this context, the Index presents the four material topics that have been identified as sustainability challenges and material topics according to the GRI Standards, namely: 'security, privacy, and data protection', 'ethics and compliance', 'fair and inclusive workplace', and 'climate change and air quality'. The fifth material topic 'governance' is not included here as it has been determined a sustainability management practice that guides us on how to deal with the identified challenges and therefore has strong parallels to the universal GRI 103: Management Approach. Moreover, we included 'human rights' as an additional topic as it is relevant to our annual UN Global Compact Communication on Progress.\n\n| General  Standard  Disclosures   | Links and Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | External  Assurance   | UN Global  Compact  Principles   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 102-1                            | Strategy and Business Model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | \u221a                     |                                  |\n| 102-2                            | Strategy and Business Model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | \u221a                     |                                  |\n| 102-3                            | Strategy and Business Model                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | \u221a                     |                                  |\n| 102-4                            | Strategy and Business Model;

SAP's Report applies the principles and standard disclosures of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2) and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, in combination with internal guidelines, as described in the 'NonFinancial Notes: Social Performance' and the 'Non-Financial Notes:\n\nEnvironmental Performance' as Reporting Criteria (further: 'Reporting Criteria').\n\nThe responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures, which are reasonable under the circumstances. Furthermore, this responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Report in a way that is free of intended or unintended - material misstatements.\n\n## Practitioner's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed within the assurance engagement on the sustainability indicators and the sustainability disclosures described above.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information', published by IAASB.\n\nAccordingly, we have to comply with our professional duties and to plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we, respecting the principle of materiality, reach our conclusion with a reasonable level of assurance on the above-mentioned sustainability indicators. The assurance of the sustainability indicators encompasses the performance of assurance procedures to obtain evidence for the information included in the Report. The choice of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor's own judgement.\n\nThis standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the abovementioned sustainability disclosures of the entity for the business year January 1 to December 31, 2020 have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure. As the assurance procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less comprehensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower. The choice of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor's own judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst others the following procedures when conducting the limited assurance:\n\n- -An evaluation of the process for determining material aspects and respective boundaries, including results of SAP's stakeholder engagement.",
