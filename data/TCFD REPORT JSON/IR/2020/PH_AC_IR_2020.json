This IR is a testament to our long-term commitment to sustainability.\n\nThe IR's Value Creation chapter opens with our sustainability journey map, which shows how all the factors involved in our process of defining shared value work together in crafting significant impacts on our target communities.\n\nIn this report, Ayala strengthens disclosures on ESG matters as part of its commitment in ensuring it remains a responsible organization who manages its impacts on many di/fferent levels.\n\n## REPORTING SCOPE\n\nThis report provides detailed information on the consolidated financial, economic, environmental, social, and governance performance across our business units from January 1 to December 31, 2020. Notes and further explanations accompany the text and tables of our performance indicators. The report includes relevant disclosures on business expansion from our unlisted subsidiaries and a/ffiliates.\n\n## REPORTING STANDARDS\n\nThis report was guided by principles and content elements of the Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework as part of our commitment to position our non-financial information report in line with global best practices. We framed the report of our performance based on materiality topics aligned with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) 10 principles, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) Standards. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) programs for business transformation helped us highlight our initiatives in strengthening ESG disclosures while we continue to reach our targets to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nIn 2019, we further embedded sustainability in our reporting when we phased in the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations for voluntary climate-related financial disclosures, which aims to provide useful information to investors, lenders, and insurers. We continue to report on our progress on TCFD disclosures this year.\n\nAdditional references for specific stakeholders are available at www.ayala.com\n\nFor more details about the various frameworks referred to, check www.integratedreporting.org, www.globalreporting.org, www.sasb.org, www.unglobalcompact.org, www.fsb-tcfd.org and www.wbcsd.org\n\nThe TCFD disclosure of Ayala Corporation can be found on pages 71-82 and pages 100-103.",

Our in-depth analysis aims to determine whether we have e/ffected change and influenced movements in the country's economic and social landscape and have helped open opportunities for inclusive growth.\n\nThis report constitutes a company-wide, group-wide e/ffort built through cooperation and collaboration among the di/fferent departments and business units across Ayala. Our Investor Relations team, Risk Management & Sustainability team, and Management reviewed all information in this report, which was duly approved by the Board of Directors for publishing.\n\n## OUR APPROACH TO EXTERNAL ASSURANCE\n\nOur Board's Audit Committee is mandated to review and approve the audit, audit-related, and non-audit services from external auditors. It provides oversight on the performance of external and internal auditors.\n\n## ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSyCip Gorres Velayo & Co., a member firm of Ernst & Young International Ltd, is the external auditor of the company's financial statements, with Lucy Lim Chan as the partner-incharge. The audit partner principally handling the company's account is rotated every five years in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.\n\n## ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\nDNV, an independent organization and global provider of certification, assurance assessment, and training services, validated the figures and information related to our sustainability performance and <IR> Framework. The groupwide assurance process was done in two phases, which included interviews with executives and in-depth discussions with related departments from the di/fferent business units. Both phases of the assurance were done remotely in accordance to regulations and protocols on COVID-19.\n\n## FEEDBACK\n\nWe welcome feedback and inquiries to help us improve our future reporting.\n\nMore information about our audit process is found on pages 220-221.

        "page_content": "## MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN\n\nFellow Shareholders,\n\nOver a year ago, on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. We could not have imagined then-dire as it already was at that time-that the pandemic would stretch well beyond one year and keep going, that what began as a health crisis would stretch into a complex combination of four crises rolled into one: a health, social, economic, and even a geopolitical crisis.\n\nYet the pandemic's story would be incomplete if we focused only on its devastation.\n\nWhile the pandemic exposed inadequacies in our healthcare system, it also showcased the sublime courage, skill and resourcefulness of our frontliners.\n\nYes, the pandemic led to social dislocation as mobility restrictions cleared our highways of tra/ffic and our malls from meet-ups. Yet technology and digital infrastructure ramped up to power industries, to multiply connections and dialogue by cutting travel time from one meeting to the next. And, for many, working from home restored connections with families we had previously seen less often than our workmates.\n\nYes, the pandemic led to the worst economic contraction recorded in many parts of the world. In the Philippines, our economy declined by -9.5 percent. Yet the pandemic also showcased the best of our bayanihan spirit helping those who were challenged to help themselves.\n\nSuch has been the narrative for Ayala Corporation in 2020 as well. Like many companies, our bottomline has been severely impacted. But, under the extenuating circumstances, I am pleased that the Ayala group has weathered the economic challenges well, made decisive and balanced trade-o/ffs between short-term pivots and long-term sustainability, and that we have continued to be a force for growth and a force for good for our varied stakeholders. We have acted with agility, in consonance with our purpose and mission, and are positioned to capitalize on the new opportunities that the pandemic has presented.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In times of extreme adversity, we are fortunate to have been able to leverage the strength of our established principles and the distinct advantages we have as a multi-business group.\n\nWe used established cross-functional synergies and robust corporate infrastructure to quickly mobilize. More importantly, our teams across our business units demonstrated admirable commitment and engagement, and continue to respond, adjust, and recalibrate in this dynamically changing environment.\n\nLet me expand on this by touching on three broad themes, which I believe appropriately represent the past year and set the foundation for how our group is positioned for long-term growth.\n\nFirst, let me highlight how a balanced portfolio and years of risk-resilient financial discipline served as an important foundation to help us pivot our businesses. We accelerated growth in resilient industries and business units such as Globe and AC Energy, and with products such as GCash and BPI Online. On the other hand, we minimized the impact on severely disrupted business sectors such as in our malls and tourism business verticals.\n\nSecond, I will touch on how our group, as part of an immediate and continuing response to the crisis, prioritized protecting three concentric circles of stakeholders:  our employees; our broad business ecosystem, and the community-atlarge-in aid of nation-building.\n\nThird and finally, I will share my perspectives on how we are capitalizing on opportunities during this period of disruption and innovation across varied industries, while positioning ourselves for the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nPlease allow me to elaborate on each of these three themes.\n\nFirst, our balanced portfolio and years of risk-resilient financial discipline served as our strategic advantage in navigating through a severely disrupted business landscape.\n\nAs with most businesses, the mobility restrictions, loss of income, dampened consumer sentiment, and the overall slowdown in economic activity weighed heavily on Ayala's performance during the year. However, we take comfort in the fact that the diversified nature of our portfolio has positioned us well to temper the full e/ffect of the crisis.\n\nWe have, over the years, made both strategic and opportunistic adjustments to our portfolio to counteract volatility across multiple economic cycles. And, with the clarity of hindsight, that served us well in 2020.",

        "page_content": "While the crisis a/ffected three of our businesses -Ayala Land, BPI, and AC Industrials-the impact on our overall performance was o/ffset by the resilience of Globe and AC Energy.\n\nMoreover, we are reaping the fruits of the transformation initiatives we undertook a few years back as the crisis essentially catalyzed the tremendous potential of digital technologies and digital adoption. We saw unprecedented adoption of e-wallets, e-payments, e-commerce, telemedicine, and online learning, among others.\n\nTwo of the country's top three digital finance platforms are Ayala assets. GCash and BPI Online were early entrants in the space and, supported by robust and user-friendly technology platforms, were ready to meet or adapt to the rapidly changing needs of customers.\n\nSince the entry of Ant Financial as a strategic partner in 2017, Mynt, which operates GCash, continues to grow and create value. GCash is now the number one finance app in the country, serving over 33 million users or one in every three Filipinos. Last year, the value of transactions that passed through GCash crossed /peso1 trillion, which was double that of the combined totals for the three-year period of 2017 to 2019.\n\nGCash recently attracted US$175 million in fresh capital, including an investment from Bow Wave, a New York-based private equity fund. With a post-money valuation of nearly US$1 billion, this investment validates GCash as a formidable player in contributing to and transforming financial services in the country.\n\nSimilarly, BPI's foresight in embarking on a digital transformation program five years ago has paid o/ff. Enrollments and usage surged\n\nduring the pandemic across the bank's online platforms as businesses adjusted to new ways of handling transactions during a period of limited mobility. BizLink, which o/ffers digital solutions for corporate clients, as well as BPI Online and BPI Mobile, our channels for customers' everyday banking needs, now constitute an average of 70 percent of the bank's total transactions.\n\nMoving forward, BPI intends to become the undisputed leader in digital banking in the country by broadening access to online platforms for all our customers, regardless of size, and introducing value-added services for both the corporate and retail segments. We also expect the bank to work even more closely with GCash to extract further synergies between the two leading financial mobile apps in the country.\n\nIn tandem with our balanced portfolio, our years of risk-resilient discipline with respect to financial management generated su/fficient absorption capacity to protect our balance sheet. This judicious approach served us well during both the Asian crisis of 1997 and the global financial crisis of 2008. It served us well again in 2020.\n\nOur group's robust balance sheet enabled us to continue executing on our investment pipeline. We leveraged the favorable debt market conditions last year to raise capital that will enable us to preserve financial sustainability as well as create the capacity for opportunistic investments. Ayala Land, BPI, Globe, Manila Water, and AC Energy raised around US$3 billion in combined proceeds from various domestic and international capital raising exercises. The successful capital raising exercises executed across the group during this period of economic uncertainty is a testament to the strength of the Ayala brand.\n\n'This crisis has put to the test some of the institutional foundations that we at Ayala have established throughout our 187-year history. In times of extreme adversity, we are fortunate to have been able to leverage the strength of our established principles and the distinct advantages we have as a multi-business group.'",

The first circle was our Ayala group's over 60,000 employees, the second circle was the broader business ecosystem in which we operate, and the third circle was composed of the communities and the country we serve. Our support was necessarily proactive and generous. Over March to December 2020, the Ayala group disbursed a total of /peso13.2B for our pandemic response initiatives.\n\nFrom the start of this di/fficult period, our topof-mind priority was to protect our employees, ensuring their peace of mind-assuring them of financial stability and protecting their physical health and safety.\n\nThe financial assistance consisted of a mix of wages, leave conversions, loan deferments, and advance release of employee bonuses.\n\nTo help address the health and safety concerns of our employees, we set up employee-exclusive hotlines to doctors and for medicines and built a COVID-19 facility, specifically dedicated for them and their families in the event that the traditional hospitals got too full to accommodate them.\n\nTo ensure continuity of business and customer service, we implemented protocols to ensure the safety of our critical, essential frontliners who needed to physically report to the workplace. We provided tools-of-work for the majority of our employees so that they could productively work from home. Lastly, through Ayala-funded online courses, we encouraged employees to enhance or learn new skills that will help them better adapt to a digitally, technologically-wired 'future of work'.\n\nAfter protecting our employees, the second phase was to ensure that our business ecosystem stayed in place as we collectively tried to recover. The Ayala group has always believed that our success is intertwined with the success of the broader ecosystem in which we operate.\n\nAyala Land was the first to implement rent condonations to its mall merchants, while BPI was among the first financial institutions to o/ffer a grace period for loan payments. Similarly, Globe and Manila Water provided grace periods for bill payments-all consistent with the economic stimulus package put in place during the crisis.\n\nWithin this business ecosystem, we realized that certain segments would need particular focus. We have around 250,000 SMEs and around 1 million micro-enterprises that are linked to us as clients and partners across our various businesses. The pandemic's impact on them was more massive. It was imperative that we provide them with support and help alleviate some of the pain points they faced. Hence, we launched the Ayala Enterprise Circle as a support network for the group's SME partners to help them navigate the crisis by providing business solutions, expert mentorship, training, and business-matching opportunities.",

        "page_content": "After our employees and our business ecosystem, the third circle of stakeholders was the community-at-large, in aid of national recovery. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the Ayala group had been working on programs around the evolving, expanded role of private institutions in society.\n\nTo ensure that our teams felt financially secure during this period of stress, we rolled out an emergency assistance package for our employees, as well as for those who provide contractual services to the Ayala group (including personnel, maintenance sta/ff, and construction workers) who would, otherwise, have been in a 'no-work, no-pay' dilemma.\n\nI strongly believe that our expanded role is to help address the pain points of the community at large, and of the nation even-not just of our shareholders-and to be more inclusive in purpose than the singular focus on profit that the economist, Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago, espoused a little over 50 years ago. This pandemic has made it even more urgent and important for us to be inclusive in our survival and recovery e/fforts. This pandemic has been most democratic, sparing no one, but its e/ffects have been much more devastating on society's already vulnerable segments than on larger, more bu/ffered, and diversified entities like ours.\n\nI believe that our sustainable recovery as private institutions can happen only if the communities that support us and work with us also survive and thrive. They need us now, more than ever, to share in their adversity. And it cuts both ways, we also need them-the entire ecosystem-to recover and thrive so as to ensure our sustainable prosperity.\n\nWith this philosophy guiding our actions, the Ayala group spearheaded a number of community projects, including Project Ugnayan, a peer partnership among the private sector, that galvanized action to address the immediate food needs of the economically vulnerable families who were caught flat-footed when community quarantine was declared last year. Project Ugnayan was an unprecedented level of cooperation among private sector companies that are normally fierce competitors in the business landscape. Many of the biggest donors committed their support within 48 hours. In all, 270 companies contributed and raised /peso1.7 billion worth of emergency relief assistance and distributed this by enlisting the machinery of PDRF and the Catholic Church to over 14 million individuals.\n\nWe were steadfast in our mission to contribute towards rebuilding the nation. Among many other community-based initiatives, the Ayala group led in converting the World Trade Center into a massive quarantine facility and donated a number of molecular testing laboratories and significant quantities of medical supplies to local government units.\n\nThe converted World Trade Center facility houses 500 beds for COVID-19 patients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a founding member of Project T3, a private sector-led initiative, we helped raise our national capacity for testing, treating, tracing, and isolating patients and patient-suspect cases. Presently, we are among the leading private sector firms supporting the government in planning and implementing the national vaccination program.\n\nOn this second theme, perhaps among the pandemic's enduring lessons are the imperative for inclusive recovery and the power of unlocking greater cooperation among private companies and between the public and private sectors. It is encouraging to see this collaborative approach towards the creation of meaningful, scaled solutions in combatting COVID-19 and building back better towards inclusive recovery.\n\nThis brings me to the third and final point-how our group is capitalizing on opportunities amid the massive shifts taking place, and how we are positioned for a post-pandemic recovery.\n\nAlongside adversity, there is opportunity.\n\nFirst, while the pandemic exposed inadequacies and massive underinvestment in the country's healthcare system, the crisis also reinforced our thesis for entering this industry over five years ago. Healthcare is an industry that is ripe for intervention and disruption.\n\nIn 2015, when we started investing in healthcare, we saw that it was increasingly becoming an important sector in the country for several reasons. Households were beginning to spend more on health and wellness, the government was increasing its healthcare investments, and health outcomes were so poor that there was significant headroom for growth. Today, COVID-19 has exponentially expanded the value of the healthcare sector. Despite the deep -9.5 percent economic contraction that the Philippines experienced last year, the healthcare sector expanded by 13.8 percent, due to increasing investments by local players and foreign partners.\n\nAC Health is scaling up its portfolio to take advantage of the momentum in the healthcare ecosystem. Last February, AC Health completed the acquisition of a majority stake in QualiMed Health Network, which operates a chain of hospitals and clinics, expanding its service delivery network by providing healthcare at the tertiary level. The addition of QualiMed to AC Health's portfolio complements its 85 outpatient clinics and 80 corporate clinics under the Healthway brand, as well as the country's first specialty cancer hospital, which is set to open in 2023.\n\nAC Health also launched a telemedicine solution that provided an alternative medical consultation solution, alongside online purchasing of medicines and scheduling of onsite clinic appointments. We are now looking at utilizing this platform for vaccination scheduling and monitoring.",

        "page_content": "Second, this crisis has accelerated the digital transformation of both the Filipino consumer, as well as the Filipino workplace.\n\nTo this end, we have seen examples of how our investments in digital infrastructure are paying forward-most specifically, how the digital platforms of both BPI and GCash have enabled individuals to make critical transactionssending money to family far-away and making purchases and bill payments from the safety of their homes. This digital infrastructure will power many more industries-perhaps virtually all industries in the future:  health, education, banking, manufacturing, commerce, travel, entertainment, and many more.\n\nAmong these is logistics, where the pandemic highlighted massive gaps in this fragmented industry. Having seen the country's requirement for e/fficient and reliable logistics to complement the rise of the digital economy, we entered the industry three years ago through our last mile delivery platform, Entrego.\n\nEntrego, leveraging its nationwide reach, has gained a foothold serving major e-commerce players in the country. The company ramped up its operations significantly over the past year, with revenues growing 10 times since 2018 and volume of packages delivered doubling since the start of the pandemic. We are looking to further develop our logistics portfolio in a more meaningful way and are looking at opportunities\n\nto expand our presence across the broader logistics supply chain, including contract logistics and freight forwarding.\n\nA third set of opportunities-aside from healthcare and digitalization-lies in the area of sustainability and of ESG-proofing our businesses. AC Energy is a prime example in our portfolio. Global investors and pandemic realizations have triggered the demand for a/ffordable, reliable, renewable, and sustainable power.\n\nAC Energy intends to play a leading role in this energy transition process with a strategy that emphasizes building a low-carbon portfolio. It is working towards fully divesting its coal assets by 2030 as it aspires to be the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia. With 1.9GW of renewable capacity to date, AC Energy has established a meaningful presence in Vietnam, Australia, Indonesia, and India in addition to the Philippines. It is poised to exceed its goal of 5GW of renewables capacity by 2025.\n\nAC Energy's rapid transition to renewables has attracted strategic partnerships from blue chip institutions such as GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, which is acquiring a 17.5 percent stake in the company.\n\nWe are excited about these opportunities and look forward to taking part in the critical transformations happening in these industries.\n\nGlobe built 1,300 new cell sites and upgraded 11,529 sites to 4G/LTE in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since 1995, our market capitalization expanded more than sixfold and our net income similarly grew more than six times. Since 1995, we rewarded our shareholders with dependable returns that averaged at 15 percent per annum. Over that period, we cumulatively paid /peso118 billion in dividends to our common shareholders.\n\nBut, perhaps even more than the admirable financial track record over the past 26 years, we laud and thank Jaime for a five-point legacy-which is foundational and strategic-upon which Ayala will build and propel sustainable returns for generations to come.\n\nFirst, our portfolio mix is stronger, expanded, more diversified, and balanced. We cemented market leadership in our established businesses in real estate and banking. We expanded the societal segments we served and consequently, broadened our set of products and services to address more and di/fferent customer needs. We invested in transformative, deep-need or high-growth business verticals such as telecommunications, water, energy, health, education, and logistics where we created meaningful disruption and continue to build scalable and sustainable market share positions either organically or with strategic partners.\n\nSecond, we have developed a culture of relevant and relentless innovation, constantly seeking to disrupt even ourselves and spark new industries. Our inspired teams leveraged our group synergies, our rich data and investments in technology, and our strong balance sheet so as to remain relevant to the dynamically changing needs of our customers.\n\nThird, we have a rigorous financial management discipline that, time and again, has been tested and proven. This has enabled us to make decisive investments to capitalize on opportunities and provided risk-resilience in times of crisis, including the challenges of the current COVID-19 crisis.",

This five-point legacy among many others you have modelled are strategic advantages that strongly position Ayala for future sustainable growth, across varied economic cycles.\n\n2020 was a stress-test for these foundational strengths of Ayala. The crisis undeniably weighed on our financial performance, especially in areas which were severely a/ffected by the mobility restrictions, business slowdown, and unemployment. However, the pandemic also presented opportunities for agile pivots in our established businesses with Globe, BPI, and Ayala Land, for example, launching new or enhanced digital products and bolstering servicing support for their digital channels. It also unlocked opportunities for accelerated benefits from transformative investments that we made in nascent businesses a few years ago. The crisis buoyed sectors such as health and wellness, e-commerce, online banking,\n\n'In the 26 years of Jaime's tenure as CEO, Ayala delivered an outstanding track record of creating shareholder value. Since 1995, our market capitalization expanded more than sixfold and our net income similarly grew more than six times.'\n\nand logistics. It reinforced the demand for su/fficiency and dependability in the supply of essential goods such as water, food, power and-the new normal- digital connectivity.\n\nFor the full-year 2020, Ayala reported a net income of /peso17 billion, 51 percent lower than the previous year. Much of the decline is attributed to non-recurring items such as provisions booked by our various businesses, an accounting reclassification, and the nonrecurrence of divestment gains from our power and education units which were realized in the previous year. If we exclude these non-recurring drivers, the year-on-year contraction in our net profits was relatively muted at 16 percent.\n\nEncouragingly, across our businesses, we saw quarter-on-quarter recovery in the second half of 2020. Ayala's reported net income grew 69 percent to /peso5.8 billion in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Excluding nonrecurring items, our core net income improved 46 percent to /peso6.8 billion during the same\n\nAyala is a pioneer in digitalization, having three market leading digital platforms-BPI Online, GCash, and HealthNow-under its portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The better performance of Ayala Land, Manila Water, and AC Industrials all contributed to Ayala's quarter-on-quarter improvement.\n\nThe diverse and balanced nature of our Ayala portfolio and the swift and dynamic actions we took mitigated the severity of the pandemic's impact on our 2020 results. I will touch on more specific key drivers for the di/fferent business units in a later section.\n\nIn response to the rapidly and unpredictably changing conditions last year, we instituted mechanisms to shift from our traditionally longer-term planning horizons to much more compressed time frames. Our Management Committee met frequently to review our plans on a two-week, two-month, and two-quarter rolling basis. This intense executional focus allowed us to pivot our businesses, fast-track and launch enhanced products and services, support our ecosystem, and contribute meaningfully to the national response and recovery agenda.\n\nLet me now touch on the performance of our key business units in greater detail.\n\nAyala Land was one of the most a/ffected business units in the Ayala group during the crisis. Its net income fell 74 percent to /peso8.7 billion as mobility restrictions impeded mall and hotel operations, dampened residential demand, and slowed or halted construction activity.\n\n'The diverse and balanced nature of our Ayala portfolio and the swift and dynamic actions we took mitigated the severity of the pandemic's impact on our 2020 results.'\n\nOn the other hand, the o/ffice segment remained strong, supported by the resilience of the BPO industry.\n\nAyala Land launched a number of hybrid and digital channels to help meet the consumer need for contactless delivery of goods and services such as basic groceries and even the sale and turnover of real estate property. In spite of the mobility restrictions and altered purchasing priorities, residential sales of Ayala Land reached 56 percent of its 2019 or preCOVID levels.\n\nWith protracted mobility restrictions and uncertain recovery scenarios, Ayala Land focused on preserving its value by keeping its asset base intact. It ensured strong cash flow and strengthened its balance sheet. It deferred plans to acquire new land, tempered project launches, and rationalized spending. Capital expenditure was likewise significantly reduced. I am happy to report that for 2021, Ayala Land has programmed /peso88 billion in capital",

This landmark capital market transaction, which raised /peso12.3 billion in proceeds, demonstrated Ayala Land's commitment to establish a REIT sector in the Philippines and encouraged greater participation by Filipinos in the domestic capital market. This pioneering initiative has likewise led to a stronger interest from other property developers to launch their own REIT vehicles.\n\nWith the massive drop in economic activity, Bank of the Philippine Islands was likewise heavily impacted by the pandemic.\n\nTo prepare for the potential rise in nonperforming loans, BPI booked total loan loss provisions of /peso28 billion in 2020, a fivefold increase from its year ago-level. This caused net income to fall 26 percent to /peso21 billion.\n\nFor the first time in almost a decade of doubledigit growth, BPI's loan book contracted 3.2 percent following a sharp decline in loan demand and deteriorating loan quality. NPLs rose from 1.7 percent a year ago to 2.7 percent in 2020. This is substantially lower than the industry average. We believe this is a reflection of the bank's strong credit discipline.\n\n'We will place greater emphasis on our portfolio strategy with a sharper focus on optimizing returns from existing businesses, a highly disciplined approach on capital deployment, and explore opportunities for value realization initiatives to fund future investments.'\n\nOver the past three years, we intensified BPI's digital transformation, investing the equivalent of eight percent of the bank's revenues towards our ambition for BPI to be the undisputed leader in digital banking in the Philippines. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote and digital banking channels with thousands of enrollments. Fifty-two percent of the bank's customers are now digitally enabled, more than half of them are active users, and an average of 70 percent of total transactions are now done online. BPI is poised to deliver on its goal of being the leading digital bank, with its BPI Online app already the leading online banking app during the pandemic.\n\nDigital connectivity is the highway of the 'new normal' and will power most, if not virtually all industries in the future. Globe Telecom is front and center of this digital revolution.\n\nTo continue fulfilling the country's growing need for fast and reliable internet access, Globe Telecom invested /peso60 billion in capital expenditure in 2020, 18 percent higher than in 2019. Despite operating under severe mobility restrictions, Globe built nearly 1,300 new cell sites and upgraded more than 11,500 sites to 4G/LTE technology, surpassing the year ago achievements of 1,100 and 10,000, respectively. Globe also deployed 5G sites in Metro Manila and parts of Visayas and Mindanao, making it available in over 1,000 areas in the country.",

        "page_content": "However, depreciation from these aggressive network investments drove a 16 percent decline in Globe's net profit to /peso18.6 billion.\n\nWith many Filipinos confined in their homes to conduct their work, learning, shopping, and entertainment activities, Globe experienced a shift in demand from mobile data to home broadband. We expect a significant portion of these behavioral shifts to continue this year, more so because of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and the renewed mobility restrictions. This demand for home broadband is reflected in Globe's capital spending earmarked for 2021 - a record /peso70 billion to execute on its network rollout strategy.\n\nBPI and Globe's experience in 2020 demonstrated the central role of digitalization for many industries where our Ayala group is represented and well positioned:  eCommerce with Ayala Malls and Zalora, last mile logistics with Entrego, ePayments with BPI and GCash, remote or distance learning with iPeople, and telemedicine and prescription fulfillment with AC Health.\n\nAC Energy has set a bold goal to build 5GW of renewables by 2025 and become one of the largest listed renewables platforms in Southeast Asia. In 2020, AC Energy posted a net income of /peso6.2 billion, 1 a decline from its year-ago level of /peso25 billion due to the absence of significant gains from the partial divestment of its thermal assets in 2019. AC Energy's attributable output grew 38 percent to 4,847 gigawatt hours, with 41 percent of this output coming from renewable sources. AC Energy is transitioning to a low carbon portfolio and has committed to divest all its coal assets by 2030.\n\nAC Energy continued its aggressive geographical expansion, and now currently operates in five markets-the Philippines, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Australia, where we recently started construction of a wind project. Equity earnings from international assets increased 68 percent to /peso2.5 billion, supported by full-year operations of solar assets in Vietnam.\n\n'We will fully support the continued expansion of our core value drivers Ayala Land, BPI, Globe, and AC Energy and scale up our emerging businesses in healthcare and logistics. We will be more proactive in recycling capital across the group to support our growth strategy and strengthen our balance sheet further. '\n\nAC Energy's rapid expansion is producing a steady rise in earnings contribution from its various platforms. Net income contribution from its listed subsidiary, AC Energy Corporation or ACEN reached /peso2.8 billion, reversing a net loss in the previous year. This was lifted by higher contracted capacity and improved plant availability. ACEN now accounts for half of AC Energy group's net income.\n\nMeanwhile, in our other utility business, Manila Water's focus has been to provide ample and consistent water supply to its concession area throughout the pandemic. The Manila Water group continued to deliver the necessary infrastructure towards the fulfillment of its service obligations, spending /peso12.1 billion in capital expenditure. Of this amount, 81 percent was channeled to the East Zone Concession to carry out various projects on wastewater expansion, network reliability, and water supply.\n\nHowever, the shift in customer mix towards the residential segment with a lower tari/ff bracket, some softness in collection e/fficiency, and a one-time provision for probable losses in the East Zone Concession combined with lower contribution from domestic subsidiaries, weighed down Manila Water's profitability. Its net income fell 18 percent to /peso4.5 billion during the year.\n\nIn February 2021, we announced the execution of an agreement with Trident Water of the Razon group for the latter's acquisition of a significant stake in Manila Water. Once the transaction is completed, Trident Water will own a 33.2 percent economic stake and a 51 percent voting interest",

We are excited about this partnership. We believe that leveraging the complementary skills of both groups will allow us to manage this regulated business better and will give us more opportunities to expand locally and internationally.\n\nAt AC Industrials , we see a recovery following a spate of geopolitical and industry-specific challenges. From a loss of /peso2.4 billion in 2019, AC Industrials narrowed its losses to /peso1.8 billion in 2020 despite manufacturing disruptions during the year. More encouragingly, AC Industrials posted a net profit in the fourth quarter after restoring plant operations to full capacity, improving factory e/fficiency, and optimizing margins from contract negotiations. With these adjustments, AC Industrials' array of disruptive technology is poised to ride on emerging megatrends around autonomous vehicles, more electronic components in automobiles, and green energy.\n\nWe have also been looking for opportunities to unlock and monetize value. One such opportunity came by way of the listing of IMI's subsidiary, VIA Optronics, a leading supplier of enhanced display solutions, on the New York Stock Exchange. VIA's IPO resulted in proceeds of US$94 million, and a valuation that implied a 34 percent gain from our acquisition price.\n\nWe entered healthcare with AC Health five years ago, knowing that Ayala could use its resources to solve one of Philippine society's critical pain points while creating value for shareholders. Little did we know then how soon and how scaled those solutions would need to be. This pandemic has dramatically heightened government, institutional and consumer focus on healthcare, and exposed an immense need for short-term solutions as well as opportunities for long-term systemic and structural disruption and innovation.\n\nIn 2020, our AC Health completed the integration of its family, multispecialty, and corporate clinics into one Healthway brand to become the largest network of clinics in the country. This, together with the addition of the Qualimed Health Network, the development of the country's first specialty cancer hospital and the entry into telehealth with the Healthnow app\n\nin partnership with Globe significantly expands AC Health's participation in the di/fferent parts of overall patient care.\n\nInvestors are increasingly choosing to invest in corporations that adhere to world-class standards of sustainability and Environmental, Social, and Governance. At Ayala, we have embraced these global standards and over the last few years, have defined and committed to a Sustainability Blueprint. We measure every Ayala business unit against clear goals that are anchored on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAs a group of companies, the actions that we took last year would not have been possible without the fiscal prudence that Ayala has cultivated throughout the years.\n\nWe entered this pandemic with a strong balance sheet, and we navigated this unpredictably long, deep, and complicated crisis with the strength of our balance sheet intact.\n\nThis strength has allowed Ayala to sustain operations and service debt and to provide generous support to our varied stakeholders at a time of crisis. It also gives us the continued capacity and flexibility to pursue potential opportunities.\n\nFor 2020, we paid /peso6.92 per share in dividends to our common shareholders. Our parent net debt-to-equity ratio remains comfortable at 80 percent and our loan to value ratio, or the ratio of our parent net debt to the total value of our assets, at a healthy 9.2 percent.\n\nOur balance sheet, strong as it is, comes only after and because of, our strongest, most valued asset -our team of over 60,000 employees. We are incredibly proud of and grateful to them. They have been focused, dedicated, creative, and resourceful to find solutions that helped restore order to chaos, adapted to changing customer needs, and unlocked short and long-term value.\n\nThe depth of talent and synergy between our varied teams gives us confidence about the senior leadership transitions we announced last December. Aside from Jaime and I who are transitioning in our roles, three other senior leaders will take on new responsibilities.",

Bong will continue to be engaged with and invaluable to the group as a member of the Board of Directors of BPI, Ayala, and AC Energy Corporation.\n\nTG Limcaoco has been with the Ayala group for over 20 years, holding various positions at the parent and at the bank. He is intimately familiar with BPI, having spent many years in the bank with a deep experience in retail and investment banking. We are grateful to TG for how he transformed the CFO role at Ayala by bringing a holistic approach to our investment, capital allocation, and overall strategic and financial decision-making process. He has driven the Ayala group's e/fforts to ensure our alignment with the evolving global standards for ESG, resulting in the creation of measurable targets and tangible results. The thinking and discipline he instituted around financial management, portfolio strategy, and business development have positioned us well in surviving the crisis and preparing for a post-pandemic economic recovery.\n\nAlbert De Larrazabal will succeed TG as the CFO. Albert has been with the Ayala group for 15 years, having held various senior positions at Globe as its CFO and most recently, as its Chief Commercial O/fficer, overseeing all customer facing units and revenue growth across all products and services groups. Albert brings a wealth of expertise in finance, treasury, risk, and commercial operations at the holding company level. Prior to joining Globe, he was CFO at another major Philippine corporation, having performed various finance functions in his 18year stint in that company.\n\nWe have appointed Eric Francia, current President and CEO of AC Energy, to concurrently chair Ayala's Investment Committee.  Joining Eric in this committee are Albert de Larrazabal, our incoming CFO, and Paolo Borromeo, head of our Strategic Development unit. The committee's mandate is to drive our portfolio management agenda and provide recommendations for an investment portfolio that delivers sustainable value and impact.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Eric successfully led AC Energy from a standing start to become one of the fastest growing renewable energy platforms in the region and one of Ayala's core businesses. Eric's successful experience in business building, realizing value, and reinvesting for growth will be valuable for this new and expanded role.\n\nAs the incoming President and CEO, I am excited about these transitions and the opportunities ahead of us. I aim to build on the firm foundation that Jaime established, guided by our core strategy of maintaining leadership and relevance in the markets we serve. To support this, we will place greater emphasis on our portfolio strategy with a sharper focus on optimizing returns from existing businesses, a highly disciplined approach on capital deployment, and explore opportunities for value realization initiatives to fund future investments.\n\nWe will fully support the continued expansion of our core value drivers Ayala Land, BPI, Globe, and AC Energy and scale up our emerging businesses in healthcare and logistics. In addition, we will be more proactive in recycling capital across the group to support our growth strategy and strengthen our balance sheet further. We have seen recent examples of these initiatives, including the IPO of Ayala Land's REIT platform, the entry of GIC as a strategic partner at ACEN, the upcoming entry of the Razon group in Manila Water, as well as the IPO of IMI's VIA Optronics at the NYSE as I mentioned earlier.\n\nWe are cautiously optimistic about the business environment and will continue to prepare for a post-pandemic economic recovery. We are hoping for a successful implementation of the country's vaccination program that would pave the way for a revival of the economy. We expect our business operations to return to the 2019 levels by 2023. With a healthy balance sheet and a set of diversified and strong franchises in our portfolio, we are confident that we will come out of this di/fficult period stronger.\n\nI will continue to work closely with Jaime, our exceptional management team, and our Board of Directors. We thank all our stakeholders for the trust and support despite all the challenges that we have faced. Thank you for continuing to take this journey with us.",

Mantaring was elected as member of the Board on April 24, 2020\n- ** Mr. Cezar P. Consing was elected as member of the Board on December 3, 2020\n\n## Board Diversity Policy\n\nAyala's board diversity policy encourages the selection of an appropriate mix of competent and qualified directors. In determining the right composition of the Board, value is placed on diversity of business experience, expertise, skills, background, age, and gender. With respect to gender, the Board shall strive to be composed of at least 30 percent or two (2) female directors by 2025 as stated in its board diversity policy.\n\nIn 2020, Ayala elected its first female director to the Board, Ms. Rizalina G. Mantaring.\n\n## CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN\n\nThe Chairman of the Board is Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala while the Vice-Chairman is Fernando Zobel de Ayala.\n\nThe Chairman is responsible for leading and ensuring the e/ffectiveness of the Board, facilitating discussions on key issues by encouraging constructive dialogue and active participation among the individual directors. The Chairman also guides and steers the Board in performing its oversight function, fostering a culture of agility and innovation necessary for the long-term success of the Corporation. In the absence of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman.\n\nThe company's Board Charter as found in its website provides more detailed information on the responsibilities of the Chairman.",

        "page_content": "The Chairman is also concurrently the CEO. Appropriate checks and balances are e/ffectuated to avoid any potential or actual conflicts between the two positions. The company's Corporate Governance Manual provides a clear delineation of the two functions that enables the Chairman and CEO to properly perform the two separate functions.\n\n## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\n\nNon-executive directors (NEDs) and independent directors (IDs) foster the exercise of independent and objective judgement and safeguard the continuing soundness, e/ffectiveness and adequacy of the company's internal controls. NEDs and IDs make up more than 50 percent of the Board's membership.\n\nAyala prescribes a term limit of nine years for its IDs, in accordance with the rules set by the SEC. As of 2020, no independent director has served the company for more than nine years, reckoning from 2012, in compliance with SEC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 2016.\n\nThe company's NEDs and IDs have periodic meetings without executive directors present. Chaired by the lead independent director, the non-executive and independent directors met on 15 December 2020 without the presence of any executive director. The Chief Finance O/fficer was invited as a resource person. They discussed the following matters: accountability of business managers relative to the proposed budgets of their projects and investments, as presented to the Finance Committee and the AC Board; the accountability of AC executives who are serving as o/fficers of the subsidiaries to the Corporation's Board and to the Boards of the subsidiaries; more formal involvement of the Board during crisis or other special situations; succession planning; and talent management.\n\n## LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR\n\nAdopting recognized best corporate governance practice, a lead independent director is appointed since the Chairman is not an independent director. The lead independent director has a vital role in the Board by serving as an equalizer to the Chairman to assure a more open communication and objective discussion in the boardroom.\n\nAs stated in the Board's Charter, it is the lead independent director's role, among others, to act as an intermediary between the Chairman of the Board and the other directors, when the need arises; to convene and lead the periodic meetings of NEDs and IDs with the external auditor and heads of internal audit, compliance and risk management, as needed; and contribute to the performance evaluation of the Chairman of the Board.\n\nThe Board's lead independent director was Xavier P. Loinaz until his resignation on December 3, 2020. Mr. Antonio Jose U. Periquet assumed the position and is currently the Board's lead independent director.\n\n## BOARD PERFORMANCE\n\nThe challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic did little to forestall the Board in performing its functions and the directors remained dedicated in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities. Su/fficient time and attention were devoted by the directors in performing their functions and in attending meetings. The calendar of activities for the Board and Committees, including the schedule of board meetings, are determined and approved, before the start of each financial year. The Board meets at least six times for each fiscal year. As provided in the company's By-Laws, the presence of at least two-thirds of the number of directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of corporate business.\n\nThe Corporate Secretary monitors the board meeting schedule and ensures that adequate meeting materials with the necessary information are made available to the directors at least five working days before the scheduled meeting to provide the Board su/fficient time to prepare and to arrive at well-informed decisions. The meeting materials give the Board critical information on relevant issues, current trends, challenges and opportunities that would significantly impact the Ayala group of companies. In addition to matters for the approval of the Board, the Board meeting agenda typically includes summaries of the company's and group's operations and financial performance; updates on business, technological developments and the regulatory environment; and reports of the di/fferent Board Committees.",

The assessment also measures the e/ffectiveness of the company's board and governance practices and determines areas for improvement. From the results of the assessment, new methodologies are adopted to further strengthen the company's corporate governance. Every three years, an independent consultant is appointed to assist in the evaluation process of the Board. Aon plc facilitated in 2020 an independent third-party evaluation of the Board.\n\nAon plc's certification on third party evalution conducted on Ayala's Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAon plc's evaluation was conducted through an evaluation questionnaire answered by each director. The evaluation criteria include: (1) Board Composition, (2) Board Roles, Functions and Processes, (3) Information Management, (4) Representation of Shareholders and ESG Factors, (5) Managing Company's Performance, (6) Senior Executive's Talent Management and Succession Planning, (7) Dynamics and relationships, and (8) Corporate Governance Practices related to the Strategy, Policy, Risk, Oversight, and Accountability functions giving insights on the e/ffectiveness of the Board, the Committee, the Chairperson, and the Directors. The results of the assessment was reported by Aon plc to the Board in the meeting following the completion of the evaluation process.\n\n## TRAINING OF DIRECTORS\n\nAyala places emphasis on continuous director development and allots an annual budget for relevant training and professional development programs, courses and seminars. Directors\n\nare encouraged to assess their training and developmental needs, which the company supports and aims to address.\n\nThe company has a training policy that all directors should annually attend at least a four-hour training on corporate governance. In addition, all new directors are required to undergo at a minimum an eight-hour orientation program on the company's business and structure, vision and mission, business strategy, Governance Codes and Policies, Articles, By-Laws, Corporate Governance Manual, Board and Committee Charters, SEC-mandated topics on governance matters and other subjects essential for the e/ffective performance of their duties and responsibilities. It is the Chief Compliance O/fficer's responsibility to ensure that each director has underdone the necessary trainings for the year.\n\nAs a group-wide initiative, a Corporate Governance and Risk Management Summit has been held annually since 2014. The summit serves as a continuing education program for the Board, CEOs, and senior management, promotes the importance of strengthening corporate governance structures, and provides a venue for collaboration. In 2020, the first virtual and the second Integrated Corporate Governance, Risk Management and Sustainability Summit with the theme 'The Board's Agenda: The Business of Building Back Better' was held on November 10, 2020. The Summit's theme and sessions were intended to direct the participants to move towards building a better, resilient and more sustainable future in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of integrating the three disciplines.\n\nAll of the company's directors and senior management met the SEC requirement for an annual corporate governance (CG) training in 2020. The trainings attended were the Integrated Corporate Governance, Risk Management and Sustainability Summit and attendance in other CG trainings administered by either the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD) or SGV & Co.\n\nFor the past seven years, Ayala has partnered with the ICD and continuously supported its advocacy to promote professional directorship in line with global principles.",

Our long-term value creation is driven by a combination of a robust financial strategy and a holistic non-financial strategy with sustainability at the core. Over decades, this framework has enabled us to create strong franchises by identifying opportunities in nascent or disrupted sectors.\n\nOur financial strategy execution is driven by four elements. Our strategic business development agenda continues to refine our existing business strategies and identify new opportunities by leveraging our financial, intellectual, human, and social and relationship capital. Our capital allocation process utilizes quantitative and qualitative criteria and a multi-step management approach to fund new or existing businesses. We employ active portfolio management to constantly rebalance our holdings to crystalize value. Finally, our active balance sheet management is the engine that allows us to stay nimble and drives our capacity to grow. These four are done in the context of key global, regional, and local trends that we believe will impact markets, sectors, and businesses in which we choose to invest and operate.\n\nAlongside these, a defining component of Ayala is a non-financial management strategy anchored on sustainability. This includes a commitment to constant human resource development and corporate governance, and the management of our stakeholders, risk, and overall brand. Our holistic management approach allows to relevantly contribute to society through our businesses, cementing our leadership over the past 187 years. This strategy is rooted in our focus towards our vision: to be the most relevant, innovative, and enduring business group in the Philippines.\n\n## STRATEGIC BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\n\nAt Ayala, we constantly look for new investment areas, identify opportunities, and assess emerging markets and economic trends. This process\n\nincludes a thorough analysis of the performance of a business and weighing this against competition, the business landscape, and our approved budget plan. The objective is to refine capital allocation depending on performance, and if needed, suggest changes to business plans or strategies.\n\nAll investment proposals that progress beyond the Corporate Strategy and Finance groups are presented to the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee is composed of Ayala's key senior o/fficers and may invite other senior group executives to provide insight. The Investment Committee then reviews the business plan and the strategy for execution. A thorough discussion on risks is carried out and responsible persons are identified to execute the business plan. If the Investment Committee approves the proposed investment, it is then endorsed to the Finance Committee of the Board.\n\n## CAPITAL ALLOCATION\n\nIn practice, investment decisions are weighed upon whether they can deliver significant value over time. We follow a rigorous process that evaluates opportunities and tests for business and financial viability. Once capital is approved and deployed, management designates a responsible management team to carry out the implementation. Business performance is reviewed on a regular basis and our gating process involves many groups within the company, including Corporate Strategy and Development, Finance, the Investment Committee, the Board's Finance Committee, and the Board of Directors.\n\n## PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Investment Committee and the Board's Finance Committee review the performance of each business unit through a portfolio strategy cycle throughout the year. This starts with a Group CEO session to align on our outlook, followed by a portfolio review process to study our existing assets set against the current macroeconomic backdrop, regular deep dives on specific business units, and a review process",

        "page_content": "to assess performance against annual targets. This process provides management the platform to assess whether to allocate more capital to a business or rebalance our holdings to solidify value. Beyond equity capital, Ayala provides critical support to businesses where necessary, including strategy, treasury, corporate finance, audit, legal, and human resources.\n\n## BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT\n\nOver the years, we have strategically built and diversified our businesses in key industries to capitalize on the country's growth prospects, which also help mitigate the impact from economic downturns. Ayala's portfolio of core businesses serves as sources for our operating expenses, interest obligations, and dividend expectations while enabling us to raise capital to fund new enterprises.\n\nOur balance sheet is the engine that drives our capacity to grow. As such, we ensure that it remains strong with significant debt capacity and a well spread-out maturity profile that gives us the flexibility to fund future growth opportunities. In challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic, our strong balance sheet protects us from external shocks. This is augmented by an optimal foreign exchange and interest rate risk management and a diversified funding sources to manage our liquidity requirements.\n\nAyala's loan to value ratio, which compares our net debt to the market value of our investments, is a good measure of our relative indebtedness and our capacity to take on or service our obligations. Tracking this ratio daily provides management and the Board a measure as to how much of our value is funded by debt. It is also a tool to help us in decision-making whether we should recycle capital by selling assets to prune our debt levels or take on additional debt to buy undervalued assets during periods of uncertainties.\n\nAt the end of 2020, our loan to value ratio is at 9.2 percent from 6.5 percent in 2019. The increase can be attributed to the additional debt Ayala took to keep our healthy cash position during the earlier period of the COVID-19 pandemic while asset values, although higher than 2019, remained volatile.\n\nWe are comfortable with our current loan to value ratio (LTV), which remains low and indicates that for every /peso9.20 of debt we carry, we have /peso100 of assets behind it. The LTV does not include the impact of our fixedfor-life perpetual bonds as these are perpetual securities and do not have to be repaid. Gross debt is at /peso124.7 billion, while our net debt is at /peso104.7 billion, as we maintain a high cash position of /peso19.9 billion end-2020. At the parent level, net debt to equity ratio is at 0.80 to 1.\n\nWe actively manage our obligations to ensure that we mitigate market liquidity, foreign exchange, and interest rate risks. In line with this is a quarterly assessment of our potential risk exposures where we calculate the volatility impact on interest rates and foreign exchange. At year end, our blended cost of debt dropped to 4.5 percent per annum from 5.20 percent per annum ending-2019 as we refinanced some of our high interest loans to take advantage of the low interest environment. We ensure that our debt maturities are well-spread out and in compliance with our internal policy of not having maturities exceeding 20 percent of total debt annually. This ensures that an external event that might a/ffect refinancing in any given year does not cause substantial liquidity exposures.\n\nWe maintain a minimum ratio of fixed rate loans to floating rate loans to ensure that our cost of capital carries a similar characteristic with our long-term investments. Our fixed to floating rate mix of 83/17 reflects our strategy of capitalizing on lower interest rates and puts Ayala in a favorable position to lock in rates in a rising rate environment. Philippine Peso obligations are 65 percent of our total obligations and our US Dollar denominated obligations are more than o/ffset by US Dollar cash and long-term foreign currency investments. Hedging is done if nonpeso debt is used to fund peso investments. For prudence, foreign currency denominated debt is used to finance foreign-currency denominated investments.\n\nOur debt policies ensure that we can comfortably service our interest and operating expenses, meet maturing obligations, and have the confidence to face or take advantage of market downturns for new opportunities.",

The country, however, faced its first headwind in January when the Taal Volcano erupted, stifling local economy in the CALABARZON and National Capital Regions for the most part. In mid-March, the country went into lockdown due to the rising cases of COVID-19, leading to the prolonged shutdown of the economy's vital levers such as public transportation, MSMEs, and construction.\n\n## Currency Mix of Debt\n\n(Percentage of Total Parent Debt including Debt Guaranteed by Parent)",

        "page_content": "This had an immediate impact on workers as unemployment rates peaked in April at 17.6 percent. Moreover, the e/ffect of the lockdown reflected evidently in the country's -16.5 percent second quarter GDP print, its worst for the year. In September, the President signed into law a much-awaited US$3.4 billion stimulus package that was otherwise heavily criticized as one of the smallest recovery plans globally at only 6.5 percent of GDP. As the economy gradually reopened alongside improving COVID cases at the turn of November, the Philippines was hit by two super typhoons, Goni and Vamco, which left the country's agricultural sector impaired. By December, inflation rate inched to 3.5 percent, the highest throughout the year, due to the lasting supply side e/ffects of the typhoons on crop prices. On the other hand, a notable economic pillar that proved to be more resilient despite the pandemic was overseas remittances. From bottoming at -19.3 percent in May, it unexpectedly grew in the last four months of the year, bringing total year-on-year performance to a flat -0.8 percent. This, however, did little to quell the unprecedented e/ffect of COVID-19, which ultimately pushed the Philippine's GDP to contract by -9.5 percent by year end.\n\nAyala was able to outperform the PSEi and its peers despite a challenging 2020. This was not without its own set of headwinds though as it entered the year with poor investor sentiment that stemmed from the regulatory issues that surrounded the water concessionaires. However, the stock began its recovery in April, shortly after quarantine restrictions were imposed as senior leadership became proactive in engaging the investor community to keep them abreast of developments in the various business operations of the Ayala group as well as initiatives to address the pandemic both for its own stakeholders and the various communities where it operates. Moreover, its share price further accelerated in early May when the current administration acknowledged the e/fforts of the private sector, including the Ayala group, in helping government with its COVID-19 response. From being a laggard in the opening months of the year, Ayala was able to beat the index and its peers starting the quarantine in mid-March and had since grown 26 percent by the end of May.\n\nThe market, including Ayala, momentarily slipped from June to August due to rising COVID-19 cases that forced the government to reinstate strict quarantine measures it had\n\nlifted in June. However, the dip was short-lived as the PSEi began its second leg of recovery in October alongside the declining number of new cases in the country. This was accompanied by a gradual resumption of mobility that saw more public transport routes reopen and looser health protocols for malls. From mid-October to midNovember, Ayala was able to gain 26 percent while more than half of the PSEi's components were able to revert to their pre-COVID prices. The last significant drop of the local index in 2020 happened towards the latter part of the year because of an MSCI rebalancing. The weights of Philippine components in the MSCI Index were all downgraded with the exception of BPI, which saw a significant upweight. While this caused a sell-o/ff in Ayala and the market, prices across the board stabilized by December as the focus shifted to developments on the vaccine front.\n\nAyala's share price ended 2020 higher by 5.3 percent at /peso827 per share while the index finished 8.6 percent lower at 7,140.\n\n## DIVIDENDS\n\nAyala's policy is to provide a regular fixed semi-annual cash dividend to common shares. For voting preferred shares, the dividend rate is 5.77 percent per annum. For non-voting Preferred B Series 1 and Series 2 shares, the dividends are given at 5.25 percent and 4.82 percent per annum, respectively. It is the company's policy to treat all shareholders equally, ensuring payment of dividends in an equitable and timely manner-within 30 days after being declared and finally cleared.\n\nIn 2020, we declared total dividends per common share of /peso6.92, 17 percent lower compared to the previous year. We understand that our shareholders view our dividends as a regular source of both income and capital returns and strive to maintain consistent distributions from year to year. Moving forward, we will continue to revisit potential sustainable adjustments in the regular dividend rate, with the continued capacity to make new or additional investments as the primary consideration.\n\nOur financial and non-financial strategies help us to remain sustainable and resilient, ensuring that we maintain relevance in turbulent business and social climates.\n\nMore non-financial discussions can be found in the succeeding pages.",

We monitor the evolving macroeconomic environment and adapt our strategic and investment decisions. Our goal is to remain well-positioned to leverage and mitigate the impact of these factors.\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\n## HOW OUR STRATEGY ADDRESSES THIS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing The Impact Of Covid-19\n\nThe year 2020 was unlike any other, with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting nearly every aspect of businesses and of people's lives. The Philippine economy experienced the worst contraction in the region, and there remains much work to be done to ensure a strong and inclusive recovery. While the beginning of the vaccine rollout brings new optimism, we expect considerable uncertainty to remain, which we believe requires organizations to be nimble enough to adapt to changes as they occur.\n\nAyala Corporation is focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet to weather looming economic headwinds. Our strong financial position ensures we have the ability to take advantage of market opportunities. Across the group, we continue to keep a close eye on changes in customer demands and behaviors, and we are prepared with flexible scenario-based plans to continue to serve our customers, maintain the trust of investors, and ensure the health and safety of our employees and partners.\n\n## Accelerated Digital Transformation\n\nIncreasing access to technology coupled with the mobility restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated the transition to digital, with rising demand for innovative and contactless product and service solutions. To fulfill this evolving demand, new ecosystems such as e-commerce, fintech, and on-demand logistics continue to grow and mature. We expect competition to intensify as technology-enabled challengers continue to enter traditional industries, and as traditional players begin to make significant investments in upgrading their own capabilities.\n\nWe continue to empower our business units to embark on their own digital transformation journeys. Our brick and mortar establishments have accelerated their omnichannel strategies, with many digital solutions expected to remain for the long-term, as we continue to innovate and improve on our touchpoints with the customer. As we explore new ways to integrate digital tools into our businesses, we place greater emphasis on those that will allow us to serve our customers better, and those which help reduce costs and frictions within the organization. Furthermore, we continue to support our investments in new ecosystems such as GCash for financial payments, Zalora for e-commerce, and Entrego for logistics as well as build the necessary core capabilities within the organization, such as data analytics, to fuel growth.\n\nFinancial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntellectual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntellectual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## HOW OUR STRATEGY ADDRESSES THIS\n\n## CAPITALS\n\n## Resilient Consumer Class\n\nDespite the challenges faced in previous months, we expect strength in consumption spending to gradually return. Unemployment has recovered to single digit from a 15-year high at the height of the lockdown in April 2020, and we believe this will continue to shrink as mobility returns and as the economy recovers. Strength in consumer demand over the medium- to long-term is supported by a young population, resilient remittances, continuous urbanization, and a steady base of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, which help spur economic activity within their own communities.\n\nWe continue to prioritize the Philippines with our businesses positioned to both contribute to and grow alongside the country's development. Each of our businesses continue to explore ways to address the needs and demands of the broader market - such as BPI's renewed focus on its Consumer and SME segments, providing a broad array of residential options through Ayala Land, and catering to the broad base of Filipino's healthcare needs through AC Health. As a group, we recently launched the Ayala Enterprise Circle to help support the MSMEs across our network, and continue to find ways to better serve the partners in our ecosystem.\n\n## Shift Towards Sustainable Technologies and Business Models\n\nWe believe that to create sustainable and long-term value, private enterprises must continue to strive for deeper engagement with society to address the various environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues we face today. In response to these issues as well as a renewed call to action across many stakeholders, we see a trend towards more inclusive business models, investments in promising new technologies, more industries promoting the sustainable use of resources, and an increased focus on socially responsible investing strategies.\n\nWe are increasingly deliberate about our contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which we first outlined in our Sustainability Blueprint: Bridging the Filipino to 2030. Several business units within the group are immersed in emerging sustainable technologies, including AC Energy's commitment to producing 5GW of renewable energy by 2025, and AC Industrials' investments in manufacturing for smart, electric vehicles, and solar technologies. Beyond these, we as a group, are committed to measuring and improving our ESG risk and impact. Each business unit has committed to actionable and measurable sustainability initiatives, and we continue to institutionalize the SDGs as performance metrics for our leaders.\n\n## Greater Multi-Sectoral Collaboration\n\nAmid these challenging times, greater collaboration between the private, government, non-government, intermediaries and academic institutions is more crucial than ever to unlock innovative and e/ffective solutions. Furthermore, the flexibility and speed that a collaborative ecosystem can provide is critical not only to addressing the COVID-19 crisis, but ultimately to achieve our overall shared goals of a more sustainable and inclusive society.\n\nAyala Corporation, and the broader Ayala Group, is proactive in helping address the health, social, and economic needs of the country in line with our shared values of nation building. Across di/fferent industries, we actively engage existing and potential partners to jointly address emerging issues. Finally, through collaboration with policymakers, the academe, and partner organizations, our Public Policy team and Regulatory Council participate in policy discussions on key reforms, which contribute to the overall economic growth and development of the country.\n\nIntellectual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSocial and Relationship\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntellectual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSocial and Relationship\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSocial and Relationship\n\n<!-- image -->",

These five pillars previously served as the foundations of our five-year plan to 2020.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic came into full swing in the first quarter of 2020, we understood the need for a more flexible approach to strategic planning. This resulted in a shorter-term planning cycle focused on protecting our workforce, supporting our stakeholders, and safely and e/fficiently restarting our business operations. Many changes to both business operations and consumer sentiment became apparent throughout the year. We believe these changes call for a renewed way of planning for the future, and a heightened focus on execution to facilitate recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FOCUSED EXECUTION\n\nOur businesses were a/ffected in varying degrees by the pandemic, owing to the diversified nature of the group. Regardless of the magnitude of impact, recovery from the crisis requires focus in executing strategic initiatives that enable the business to not only return to pre-pandemic levels, but to thrive in this new environment.\n\nThrough recent planning sessions held within the Ayala Group, we have articulated a new set of vision pillars, anchored on a shared vision of recovery from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis. Our focus for the year 2021 will be executing on this recovery, and ensuring the gradual but continuous provision of our products and services while maintaining a strong capital position . Furthermore, as we look ahead to 2023, we commit ourselves to focused execution, strong capital investment, delivering an unparalleled customer experience, and leadership in sustainability - thus setting the stage for a bold decade of growth ahead.\n\nUnderpinning our new vision pillars is an unwavering commitment to the Filipino to doing our part to drive economic recovery from the crisis, and to ensure continued support for national development.\n\n## KEY MEDIUM-TERM INITIATIVES AND 2023 TARGETS\n\n- \u25a0 Recovery of financial performance to preCOVID levels, including our subsidiaries Ayala Land, BPI, AC Industrials, and iPeople\n- \u25a0 Continued reinvention and growth of Globe and AC Energy amid a dynamic market\n- \u25a0 Building scale in our emerging businesses AC Health and AC Infra while addressing critical needs of the country\n- \u25a0 Delivering on key value realization initiatives to sharpen the portfolio and recycle capital into high growth opportunities\n- \u25a0 Continued market leadership in our core industries and developing meaningful presence in emerging sectors\n- \u25a0 Outperform industry peers in total shareholder return (TSR)",

This would lead to a continuous improvement in the management of operational risk and build a culture of safety. To achieve this, we performed various risk studies to further understand exposures and therefore develop strategies in mitigating these exposures.\n\nWith the pandemic, we revisited our plans to ensure that underwriting information was available during renewal.\n\n- \u25a0 Risk engineering surveys were conducted virtually.\n- \u25a0 Asset valuation studies were finalized.\n- \u25a0 Group Natural Catastrophe modellings were updated to understand overall group exposure.\n\nThese activities contributed to the continuous process improvements and risk awareness.",

These were the sentiments of the insurance markets when Ayala did a stewardship meeting in Singapore last November 2019. Ayala planned to start early in 2020 by preparing a comprehensive underwriting information and reports for better appreciation of the market on the group's developments and improvements on risk management.\n\nNovel strategies and planning were tested as a response to COVID-19. We sought for smarter ways of engaging in an impactful way while considering face to face negotiations and collaboration were not feasible. To respond, Ayala's first Insurance Virtual Roadshow was conducted in May 2020, meeting both local and international insurers and reinsurers. Utilizing conferencing platforms, we presented Ayala's developments and improvements on risk management as well as our response to COVID-19 moving forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis resulted in being able to minimize the initially estimated increase to the group considering that there was an increase in insurable values for the Property Damage and Business Interruption (PD/BI) program. The team (Ayala and Aon) still managed to maintain the risk management bursary to fund future risk management studies of the business units enrolled in the program.\n\nComplimenting the PD/BI program was the Political Violence (PV) program. The PV insurance market remained flat and Ayala improved its premium while maintaining best in class bespoke coverage despite the increase in insurable values. The team as well managed to maintain the risk management bursary to fund crisis management workshop and threat assessments.\n\nThe financial insurance lines were also experiencing losses due to increasing claims in the US and Australia. Insurers also think that this COVID-19 pandemic will increase cases against company directors and o/fficers. This a/ffected our Directors and O/fficers Liability program resulting in an increase in the group premium reflecting market conditions as well as our increased exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In conducting our annual risk assessment, we have identified six (6) major risk categories with the highest likelihood of occurring and would have the most impact to our business objectives: (1) Political and Regulatory, (2) Brand and Reputation, (3) Information and Cyber Security, (4) Portfolio Management, (5) Competition and, (6) Capital Markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| RISK CATEGORY                  |   2020 RANK |   2019 RANK |   CHANGE |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|\n| Political and Regulatory       |           1 |           2 |        1 |\n| Brand and Reputation           |           2 |           1 |        1 |\n| Information Security and Cyber |           3 |           4 |        1 |\n| Portfolio Management           |           4 |           5 |        1 |\n| Competition                    |           5 |           9 |        4 |\n| Capital Markets                |           6 |           9 |        3 |\n| Business Resiliency            |           7 |           3 |        4 |\n| Innovation and Technology      |           8 |           5 |        3 |\n| Funding                        |           9 |           8 |        1 |\n| Partnerships and Alliances     |           9 |           7 |        2 |\n| Synergy                        |          11 |          13 |        2 |\n| Talent                         |          12 |           9 |        3 |\n| Governance and Controls        |          13 |          12 |        1 |",

The Mindoro Forest and Biodiversity Conservation\n\nA forester surveys the area for native flora in Oriental Mindoro.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgramme aims to harness nature-based solutions to address climate change and mitigate against its impacts. The project aims to avoid deforestation and sequester carbon by conserving and protecting the remaining high value forests in Oriental Mindoro as it enhances livelihood opportunities for its stakeholder communities under the United Nations scheme of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). By doing so, the project simultaneously fosters climate adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development.\n\nBy protecting the forests of Mindoro, we are also protecting a vital global biodiversity hotspot, which is home to many endemic species that do not exist elsewhere in the planet.\n\nWe recorded endemic species to the Philippines during the sampling period, as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 41 birds, six of which are found only in the Mindoro Endemic Bird Area\n- \u25a0 9 mammals\n- \u25a0 10 trees that are classified as critically endangered by the IUCN\n\n## AC ENERGY\n\nTurtle Conservation Program: In 2020, we assisted in the rescue, release & tagging of 13 turtles (10 in Pagudpud, 3 in Bangui). We also managed 240 turtle eggs with a 74% hatching rate. Currently, we are monitoring 398 eggs (all from Pagudpud).\n\nSocial Forestry: By implementing Analog Forestry and Agroforestry Programs, human dependency on traditional forest areas is lessened, improving natural forest conditions and increasing their biodiversity value. Through the Analog Forestry Program, we produced more than 67,000 assorted seedlings with our community partners. The Agroforestry Program on the other hand completed the 4.5 hectares Model Farm while successfully integrating goat and mushroom production to the model.

This 2020, a total of 66 IUCN Red-List Species, the gold standard for the inventory of the global conservation status of plant and animal species, were recorded from the Anvaya and El Nido estates. Only 57 were recorded in 2019. Furthermore, a total of about 104,000 hectares of native trees were recorded across all Ayala Land developments, an increase of 20 percent from previous year.\n\nThe creation of appropriate development plans and programs to conserve and protect indigenous biodiversity and the use of native trees in our developments are critical to our Site Resilience Strategy. For this reason, assessments and monitoring of native flora and fauna are regularly undertaken in estates with high conservation values. Likewise, the use of native trees not only protects local biodiversity, but also allows for quicker recovery from environmental disturbances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAyala Land maintains the eco sanctuaries in its properties in El Nido, Palawan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change has far-reaching implications beyond its influence on global weather patterns as it has profound and permanent effects on life in the biosphere.

Particularly related to the pandemic, our business unit AC Health had an increase of 360 percent in their hazardous waste due to the amount of medical materials used in line with their ramped-up e/fforts for COVID-19. They ensured that these were handled and disposed of properly, according to standards set by DENR.\n\nOn water, Manila Water was able to treat 74.1 mcm of wastewater and through their wastewater treatment and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal processes, there were able to reduce their carbon emission by approximately 74,000 tonnes carbon dioxide.

Staying true to our commitment of ensuring that we take responsibility for our waste generated, AC Energy took measures to address the incident. The oil spill has been subsequently contained using the Shoreline Cleanup Assessment Technique conducted by a thirdparty service provider.

Since 2014, over 50 companies and organizations have joined the program, resulting in more than 1.2 million kg of e-waste recycled.\n\n## AC INFRA\n\n## #WalangPlastikanMovement\n\nThe program was conceptualized  with the goal of diverting plastic items from the landfills to our upcycling partners, allowing us to obtain functional items such as plastic chairs, tables, etc. Ayala employees were trained to classify their clean and dry plastic items at our colorcoded bins representing the di/fferent types of plastics: PET, HDPE, LDPE, and Others. Despite having to halt the project after 3 months, we were able to collect a  total of 82kg of clean and dry plastics which are turned over to our partner upcyclers: Clean Our Oceans Project and Sentinel.\n\n## AYALA LAND\n\n## Arca South and Lio Ecohubs\n\nBuilding on the successful launch of the Arca South and Lio Ecohubs in 2019, Ayala Land was keen on further demonstrating a circular economy model by processing clean and dry plastic discards. With the objective of treating waste, particularly plastics, as a resource and keeping them away from landfills and oceans, clean and dry plastic wastes were converted into ecobricks, ecocasts, ecopavers that are used in construction. Out of the 29 tonnes of plastic processed in 2020, 28 tonnes were used by Ayala Land and Ayala Group developments, following acceptable quality standards. This is the equivalent of 2.8 million PET bottles diverted from the landfills and from further polluting our oceans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlastic processed in Arca South and Lio Ecohubs\n\n## 29 tonnes\n\nRecognizing the different materials we use and the waste we generate, we remain cognizant of our responsibility in ensuring proper waste management across the group.

In 2020, Ayala registered more than 68,000 direct hires which is composed of both permanent and temporary employees. Overall, there was a 6 percent decrease from the previous year which was an e/ffect of the pandemic. Permanent and temporary employees decreased by 4 percent and 25 percent, respectively.  Ayala strove to keep its workforce and when situations demanded otherwise, positions that could be transferred were reassigned to other business units. When this final e/ffort was not possible anymore, redundated employees were duly supported by ensuring that they received due compensation.\n\nIn terms of the Support Sta/ff category, the base significantly decreased by 29 percent with the majority of the business units cutting down on this aspect of the workforce. AC Energy, however, by virtue of the nature of its business and added operations, increased the engagement of support sta/ff by 517 percent.\n\n## INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE\n\nAyala implements a Recruitment, Compensation, and Retrenchment Policy to ensure inclusivity and non-discrimination. Ayala does not discriminate against any person's gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, color, religion, age, marital status, disability, economic status, and political a/ffiliation. All applicants are given fair opportunity, and are evaluated on the basis of skills, qualifications, and experience. Persons with disabilities have also been hired by some business units, recognizing their competencies and skills that are aligned with the job opening at hand.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Ayala Corporation recorded more than 60,000 direct permanent employees, composed of about 26,700 male and about 35,100 female, giving a male to female ratio of 1:1.31.  Notably, 26 percent of females are part of Senior Management, indicating that Ayala accords importance to the career development of women. Overall, women comprise 57 percent of the population in the Ayala group. The current landscape of Permanent employees of Ayala shows a young workforce with the majority of the population belonging to the rank and file bracket.",

For senior executives and key talents, Ayala o/ffers a long-term incentive program. In April 2020, the Board approved the grant under the stock ownership program to eligible executives from the 3 percent of the company's authorized capital stock allocated by the stockholders. The basis for the grant is consistent outstanding performance record over a period of three years. The grant price is based on the roundedo/ff volume weighted average prices of the stock at the Philippine Stock Exchange over the last five-day trading from March 13 to 23, 2020.\n\nAyala adheres to Philippine regulations on parental leaves, including maternity, paternity, and solo-parent leaves. Percentages of those who returned after availing parental leaves are high. Across the group, 74 percent of those who availed of maternity leave returned, whereas 96 percent who availed for paternity and 92 percent who availed for solo parent leave have also returned to the workforce.\n\n## TRAINING AND ADVANCEMENT\n\nProfessional development is a hallmark for Ayala as a preferred employer, hence, it ensures the full implementation of its Employee Development and Industrial Relations Policy.\n\nBoth internal and external opportunities in the form of academic, professional, technical, or industry-related training, career development programs, conferences, workshops, and certification courses are available to sta/ff and are o/ffered fairly and without discrimination.\n\nThe pandemic helped us to hasten the shift of our trainings into a digital format, focusing on the following objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 Increase their knowledge in their current role\n- \u25a0 Develop functional skills\n- \u25a0 Explore lessons of their interest\n- \u25a0 Improve mental health\n- \u25a0 Adjust to the new normal and work-from-home set-up\n\nIn 2020, the total training hours for the Ayala group reached more than 4.2 million hours. This gives an average of 69 training hours or about nine work days of training per employee.\n\nBusiness units trained their frontliners on how to better protect themselves from illness. This is supported by other initiatives to ensure their safety as they continue to perform their tasks in the workplace. In the case of AC Health, where Healthway acquired FamilyDOC, additional trainings were given that are related to change management to help sta/ff adjust to new structures and work arrangements.",

Across the group, business units such as ALI, BPI, GLOBE, and MWC have unions that peacefully and proactively negotiate with their respective managements. Notably, the parent company has not received any information on violations of laws pertaining to labor and employment issues.\n\n## EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\nAyala stresses the importance of employee engagement as it places a premium on holistic development covering the professional and personal growth of its employees. The company aims to nurture potentials so that employees are motivated to perform at an optimum level of e/fficiency. To this end, Ayala's HR Council strengthened e/fforts in light of the challenges presented by the pandemic. Regular COVID-19 advisories were sent out in collaboration with AC Health and various local government units (LGUs). While majority of the workforce are in a work-from-home setting, innovations in employee engagement were introduced to continue reaching out to the employees. Continuing conversations with employees is a priority and this called for initiatives such as:\n\n- 1. Virtual Townhalls\n- 2.  Informal virtual gatherings\n- 3.  Pulse surveys and focus group discussions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo further promote health and safety, Ayala designed and implemented ACE Bot. This gives employees their daily assessment and risk assessment through a series of questions about any\n\nsymptoms they feel and level of exposure to other individuals within their immediate vicinity. At the end of the survey, it informs the user of his or her level of risk (low, medium, or high) and gives advice on succeeding steps to take depending on the result.\n\nEngagement activities implemented are continuing in light of the pandemic.\n\n## Virtual Fridays\n\nThis is a regular townhall where employees receive the latest update on the situation of the organization from the senior leaders. The audience are also given the chance to ask any question related to the agenda and these are answered live by the leaders. Majority of the discussions in these sessions are on COVID-19 related e/fforts, vaccinations, and strategies explored by Ayala for the workforce to safely and gradually return to the o/ffice premises.\n\n## Online Employee Informal Activities\n\nTo give the workforce a breather, various fun activities were conducted through programs such as Fun Fridays or Break O'clock. Short virtual concerts were also held, including special celebrations that involve family members such as the virtual Halloween Party.\n\n## Service Awards\n\nThe ceremony was held virtually to continue giving credence to the e/fforts of employees who have long been part of Ayala. We ensured that despite the challenging times, their continuous e/fforts and rendering of excellent service will be rewarded accordingly.\n\n## Online wellness activities\n\nThis includes yoga sessions, mindfulness webinars, and other physical activities to encourage the employees to not remain sedentary, especially with the work-from-home arrangement.\n\n## Meet the executives\n\nAyala arranged informal sessions with executives where employees are given the opportunity to interact with them and ask any questions whether professional or personal. This helped the employees to relate better to the executives.\n\n## Ready access to RT-PCR Tests\n\nWe provided readily accessible swab testing facilities to our employees, ensuring their health and safety as we adjusted to the e/ffects of the pandemic on day-to-day life.\n\n## Mental Health Instructor-led program and pathway\n\nThe di/fficulties of 2020 were far-reaching and had a/ffected most people's mental health and well-being.

The calculation reverts to zero and starts again in cases of fatalities.\n\nAyala does not condone force labor or child labor. As a member of the UN Global Compact Network Philippines, which supports principles on Human Rights and Labor, we enforce a  Policy on Child Labor and Forced or Compulsory Labor, which acknowledges that employers have important roles to play and are responsible for ensuring that the workforce is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nThe Ayala Group lives up to its goal of being the employer of choice by providing a safe, fair, engaging, and rewarding work space.

BPI increased the frequency of accounts review to monitor their financial performance and assess those with recovery paths, and reached out to clients to see how we could assist them with their financial obligations  (i.e. loan restructuring). Moreover, loan provisions were increased to cover for non-performing loans. Moreover, BPI continued to enhance its BPI mobile app which greatly helped Filipinos with their financial transactions during the pandemic, especially at the height of the lockdowns. It has become the second most downloaded finance app in the country.\n\nOn water and wastewater services, Manila Water ensured that water quality is maintained.

Having a Water Safety Plan is a preventive approach in managing water quality risks. The East Zone Concession revised and expanded its WSP, which was also approved by the Department of Health.\n\nManila Water adheres to DENR Water Quality Guidelines and General E/ffluent Standards of 2016, thus following strict directives on proper disposal of e/ffluents to receiving bodies of water.\n\nNotably, Manila Water upgraded its wastewater facilities according to the DENR Standards which required the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and ammonia from wastewater to reduce algal growth in water bodies.\n\nOn fintech, Mynt, which operates GCash, significantly contributed in keeping the economy going during the various degrees\n\nof national lockdowns with more Filipinos using GCash, thereby increasing the volume of transactions. Mynt significantly complemented the contactless revolution, which  strengthened marketing communications to educate consumers on digital payments. Moreover, GCash partnered with di/fferent government agencies and LGUs to facilitate the contactless distribution of the Social Amelioration Program through bulk GCash disbursements.\n\nOn e-commerce, Zalora Philippines took the challenge of the pandemic as a potential catalyst to increase e-commerce adoption in the country, which has the lowest rate in Southeast Asia at two percent.

To further ensure that only acceptable shelf-life products are processed and served to customers, SAP Business One is used. Moreover, during the pandemic, they further developed a mobile app where customers can purchase medicines for delivery to their homes. On medical consultations, Healthway developed online tools to connect doctors and patients.\n\n## On local community products, Ayala\n\nFoundation has community leaders who are artisans themselves and personally ensure the quality of products. These key personnel also live in the area for regular monitoring of their initiatives. The Manila-based project teams are then constantly in communication with sta/ff who are in the community areas.\n\nOverall, to support both product quality and safety of customers, the business units maximized technology.

We continue to adhere to the Data Privacy Act, ensuring that all confidential items related to our customers are handled accordingly. Data privacy trainings are conducted for all employees annually to guarantee their awareness and implementation of our data privacy measures.\n\nAt a time when the lockdowns eased and some of our facilities opened such as our malls, Ayala continues to regard customer privacy seriously by diligently exercising contact tracing protocols. We continued to maximize technology by using QR codes, thus lessening the chances for the details of customers to be mishandled - a common concern in places where contact tracing is done traditionally with pen and paper.\n\n## SECURITY PRACTICES FOR CUSTOMER SAFETY\n\nAyala ensures the safety of its customers within its facilities by deploying well-trained security personnel in their vicinity and by training our employees on emergency drills.\n\nAdditional safety measures were employed to reduce risks from COVID-19. Ayala recognizes the risks of the pandemic to employees and customers and we intensified our e/fforts\n\nto implement the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our stakeholders. Safety protocols closely followed guidelines from the Department of Health and the Inter-Agency Task Force. Those who had to work on site were required to wear face masks, and practice social distancing and proper hygiene.\n\nAt the Ayala Malls, frontliners and service sta/ff were trained on safety measures. Those who directly interact with customers were required to wear masks and used thermometers at all entrances to screen for symptoms. They readied a list of nearby hospitals for those displaying symptoms, and were ready to extend assistance when necessary. High-touch surfaces such as escalator handles, railings, and elevator buttons are treated with the DOH-prescribed disinfecting solutions. Sanitizers are available at areas most frequently visited by customers.\n\nWe take public health and safety seriously and are working closely with the government to ensure compliance. We continue to assess our procedures to maintain a safe environment for our customers and employees.\n\nOur customers are at the heart of our businesses and we go beyond in ensuring that they have a meaningful and continuous positive experience with our brand. Our various initiatives are meant to sustainably engage them as we remain their partner of choice.\n\nOur malls ensured that proper protocols are followed as they open in the midst of the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It observes the highest standards of corporate governance and maintains a leadership culture of doing the right thing in every decision. A Code of Conduct and Ethics guides the company in all transactions and dealings with customers, suppliers, business partners, and the government. Zero-tolerance is adopted toward fraud, corruption, bribery, and all forms of unethical practices.\n\nAs part of the UN Global Compact Network Philippines, Ayala adheres to its anti-corruption principle. It remains committed in complying with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\n## EQUITABLE VALUE DISTRIBUTION\n\nAyala thrives on enabling shared value and prosperity for its stakeholders and partners. At the core of business is its commitment to national development, which drives the motivation to create long-lasting value.\n\nDespite the pandemic casting a dark cloud on the business landscape, the Ayala Group generated /peso463.51 million in economic value as it sought to fill the gaps in various aspects of society, such as in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Out of this amount, /peso161.97 million or 34.9% went to operating costs, while /peso139.81 million (30.2%) is retained by the company.",

Each business unit has supply chain policies and code of conduct that requires suppliers to go through an accreditation process to ensure their legitimacy, technical competence, financial capability, and service quality.\n\nAyala addresses the group's Scope 3 GHG emissions, also referred to as value chain emissions. Suppliers will be subjected to higher levels of environmental and social standards. Scope 3 emissions are the result of activities that an organization indirectly impacts in its value chain and often represent the majority of the organization's total GHG emissions. Although quantifying Scope 3 emissions is not required by regulations, this would provide a complete picture of the full GHG impact of Ayala's operations. It also presents opportunities for emissions reduction. Specifically, Ayala will be able to influence its suppliers to embrace sustainability, or award contracts only to vendors that adhere to sustainable practices.\n\nSome of Ayala's business units such as Ayala Land, Manila Water, and IMI have included sustainability performance in their criteria for supplier accreditation.\n\nIMI, for instance, ensures that suppliers adhere to global sustainability standards such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) code of conduct (formerly the Electronic Industry\n\nCitizenship Coalition). Part of its supplier assessment includes determining the levels of hazardous substances in their contents. The RBA code of conduct covers labor, ethics, environmental, health and safety, and overall management system. In connection to material consumption, IMI ensures responsible sourcing of minerals and metals from those not supporting rebel groups of the Democratic Republic of Congo and related countries. Moreover, suppliers are expected and required to practice sustainability measures across their own operations.\n\nMoreover, in line with our commitment to support local economic growth, some of our business units are deliberate in spending locally. Most of our business units ensure local spending of beyond 50 percent, and notably, three of which spend from 95 to 100 percent - AC Infra, AC Energy, and Manila Water, at 95, 99, and 100 percent, respectively.\n\nAyala Land practices procurement standards with preference for suppliers that practice environmental responsibility.\n\nTheir sustainability campaign began in 2018 to influence their vendors to adopt sustainable practices or create their own initiatives. ALI also requires its suppliers to acknowledge the company's Vendor Code of Ethics as one of the accreditation requirements. Their Internal Audit Division conducts vendor audits in accordance with the provisions of this code.",

It is not just a means of 'giving back' to the communities, but more importantly, sends a message that Ayala's business objectives are in alignment with solutions to address the gaps in society.\n\n## On Health and Sani ta tion\n\nIn cooperation with Smile Train, an international children's charity dedicated to help children born with a cleft, Globe Telecom raised funds through employees, customers, and partners to support cleft repair surgery and comprehensive cleft care for at least 20 children.\n\nThrough Healthway, free health education seminars were provided to corporations through the Wellness on Web (WOW) program.\n\nManila Water, through the Manila Water Foundation, its WASH in Pandemic Program and Integrated WASH Program to help spread awareness on proper sanitation, which are essential to mitigating impacts of the pandemic.\n\nMoreover, it continued its flagship programs: Lingap, Ahon Tubig, Ahon Sanitasyon, and Health in Our Hands. MWF complemented these initiatives with special programs such as Agapay Tubig and Agapay Sanitasyon. Overall, Manila Water served 69 areas, 41 of which are new locales.\n\n## On Education\n\nAyala Foundation's ProFuturo program trained 227 teachers trained in 2020 through an enrichment training series entitled \"Learning Beyond Borders.\" This helped hone their skills in keeping students engaged in the transition to virtual learning platforms. Moreover, AFI continued to support scholars in 2020, specifically 94 students in high school, 26 in college, and one taking post-graduate studies.\n\nAC Infra launched the RecoveREADS Help From Home program and mobilized Ayala citizens to raise /peso385,000, which funded learning kits for the children of Pinsao Elementary School in Baguio.\n\n## Volunteerism Programs\n\nAC Health's business units IE Medica and MedEthix o/ffer charity leaves to its employees, comprising two days where the employee can immerse in a chosen charitable institution.

The fund also provided food packs and face masks for other beneficiaries.\n\nAcross the Ayala Group, employees participated in concerted e/fforts to help and donate to victims of the Taal Volcano eruption and typhoons Rolly and Ulysses. Some programs were initiated by groups of employees themselves, a testament to the spirit of volunteerism cultivated by the organization.\n\n## COVID Response\n\n## Brigada ng Ayala\n\nThe Ayala Group of Companies launched the 2020 Brigada ng Ayala in October with the turnover of a 10-faucet handwashing facility and 200 Ayala EduCare packs at the Ramon Magsaysay High School.\n\nThe Ayala Group foundations-BPI Foundation, Manila Water Foundation, and Ayala Foundation-presented the handwashing facilities which are essential in preventing the spread of coronavirus. The hygiene facility was designed by Manila Water Foundation to match the current needs in the new normal. The 'contactless' design of the facility helps users to turn on the faucet via a foot pedal, while the one-meter distance between faucets allows proper physical distancing. Appropriate signages were also mounted on the facility to ensure that the steps to proper handwashing are followed. The facility is also connected to clean water supply and a drainage system to ensure reliability and safety.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ayala EduCare packs are hygiene kits that contain school supplies, posters that teach about COVID-19 measures and proper hygiene, face masks, a face shield, alcohol, bar soaps, and the Manila Water Foundation's children's storybook May Tubig na sina Tinay that teaches about water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices.\n\nThese and other e/fforts comprise a comprehensive COVID-19 response across the Ayala Group that exemplifies the community spirit of our leaders and employees, and a commitment to work towards sustainable recovery beyond the pandemic.\n\nThe Ayala Group subscribes to the highest standards of conduct and we expect nothing less from our employees and partners.

The project secured protection against COVID-19 for the community by ensuring that protocols to protect the displaced drivers from the virus were in place. It also fostered synergy among the Ayala group and its ecosystem as the Ayala Coop provided the financial muscle, Ayala Foundation with the framework, and the Ayala Business Circle with local infrastructure.\n\nWhile the anxiety of contracting the virus remained within the community, these endeavors yielded more positive outcomes for community partners. The wider network and new ways of delivery increased partners' organizational capacity. These activities sustained the presence of Ayala Foundation during the pandemic. With the urgency of addressing people's needs during this unprecedented crisis, the support provided by Ayala Foundation increased social inclusion and generated higher satisfaction in helping others, while also developing a greater sense of community.\n\nAs we move towards economic recovery, Ayala Foundation will continue to provide innovative solutions, improve services, and ensure that target communities maintain incomes to support their families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTuloy ang Biyahe Program for displaced drivers 1.4 M",

The consortium shows a united commitment to battling the pandemic and ensuring the country's swift recovery. It was formed to contribute an additional capacity of 5,500 confirmatory RT-PCR tests per day to support Project T3 (Test, Trace, Treat) of the Department of Health and the Inter-Agency Task Force.\n\n## COVID-19 REFERRAL HOSPITAL\n\nIn addition to o/ffering a wide range of services to address COVID-19 and other medical needs, AC Health partnered with Qualimed Health Network to convert Qualimed Sta. Rosa, Laguna into a COVID-19 Referral Hospital. The hospital already o/ffers a wide range of comprehensive outpatient and inpatient healthcare services. Conversion to a COVID-19 referral hospital would better address the needs of the increasing number of COVID-19 patients accommodated at the hospital.\n\nThe partnership came at a crucial time and sought to address the demand for COVID-19 specific facilities, bringing hope and muchneeded healthcare services to more Filipinos. The COVID-19 Referral hospital incorporated specific features that are compliant with infection control standards to ensure the safety of patients and medical professionals. A COVID-19 triage holding area was constructed adjacent to Qualimed Sta. Rosa to isolate patients prior to admission. A Biosafety Level 2 Laboratory was built to facilitate COVID-19 testing. Inpatient beds were converted and ICU beds were expanded for the exclusive use of COVID-19 patients. The hospital also generated the support of\n\nthe medical community to form a dedicated team of medical professionals, which include volunteer clinical sta/ff from the broader Qualimed and Healthway networks.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF FIRST CANCER SPECIALTY HOSPITAL\n\nTo ensure that other urgent medical issues continue to be addressed despite the pandemic, AC Health inked a strategic partnership on October 13, 2020 with Cancer Treatment Services International (CTSI), a Varian company, to develop and operate the first comprehensive cancer specialty hospital in the Philippines.\n\nCancer continues to be a leading cause of death in the Philippines, and treatment for cancer patients, who are vulnerable to COVID-19, has become increasingly complicated. A cancer specialty hospital will bring much-needed a/ffordable quality cancer care services to more Filipinos, as well provide a safe space for patients who need urgent care in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nAC Health aims to invest /peso2 billion into the facility, which will have 100 beds, diagnostic equipment, chemotherapy facilities, linear accelerators for advanced radiation therapy, and operating rooms. The cancer specialty will be centrally located at FTI Complex, Taguig City adjacent to Ayala Land's Arca South, to provide greater access to Metro Manila residents, as well as patients who will be flying in from the provinces.\n\nAC Health repurposed Healthway Medical Greenbelt 5 into a cancer specific unit to serve the needs of oncology patients. Compliant with Department of Health regulatory and safety standards, the Chemotherapy Infusion Center at Healthway Greenbelt 5 accommodates up to 15 cancer patients for chemotherapy per day.\n\nDuring the crisis, AC Health quickly expanded and transformed critical health services and showed its commitment to ensuring the health and well-being of the Filipino people.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Access to education, the quality of education they receive, and the condition of their learning environment are among the challenges highlighted in the report.\n\nAt Ayala, we view lack of access to quality education as a strategic area of work as it delivers multiple impacts in the development areas of poverty alleviation and human capital building, which are important to our businesses. We have thus been investing in educational institutions, serving thousands of students, mostly within the 15 to 24 age range. Our steadily growing portfolio covers primary, secondary, and tertiary educational formats.\n\n## LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC\n\nWith the pandemic shifting students away from the classrooms into online learning, the World Economic Forum estimates a staggering 1.2 billion children across 186 countries are currently a/ffected by school closures. In October 2020, around 24 million Filipino students returned to school, albeit online, as face-to-face lessons remained suspended due to COVID-19.\n\nMapua University (Mapua) is leading the digital charge for the iPeople Group at the tertiary level, with the university now using several online learning tools. Among these tools is Cardinal EDGE Learning Management System, which holds synchronous lectures to 2,300 students; a video platform called Panopto for higher education; and Coursera, an online learning platform. Mapua also o/ffered students with online access to the library and counselling services. The Commission on Higher Education recognized Mapua as one of the leading universities in online learning.\n\nIn 2020, APEC Schools tapped Globe Telecom (Globe) as its partner for online learning. APEC tapped Google Chrome management console provided by Globe to ease up distribution of learning applications and materials across students' Google accounts. With the web-based application and the availability of Google Chromebooks, students and parents can freely use Google Classroom and G Suite tools to participate in online classes, fulfill assignments, and seek assistance from teachers anytime, in the safety of their homes.\n\nMalayan Colleges Laguna (MCL) and the Malayan High School of Science (MHSS) Blackboard Learning Management System,\n\nconducted online classes through the while National Teachers College (NTC) ,",

More than 10,000 senior high school students were recorded enrolled in the Malayan High School of Science, and almost 9,000 junior high school students were enrolled in NTC, UNC, MHSS and in the APEC Schools.\n\nIn 2020, over 9,000 graduates from Mapua University, MCM, MCL, MHSS, NTC, UNC and APEC Schools was tallied, despite there being no physical graduation exercises due to the limitations imposed by the IATF. Virtual graduations were conducted in the last quarter of the year for Mapua University and MCL.\n\nMapua conducted short-term technical courses, seminars and capacity building, and designed buildings for public schools that contributed to the general welfare of the community.\n\n## STRENGTHENING INCLUSIVITY AND ACCESS\n\nThe COVID19 crisis surfaced the most appalling inequalities that continue to exist in society today. The education sector is no stranger to this widening disparity exacerbated by slow human development, persistent poverty, and uneven growth across regions.\n\nIn a bid to bridge this gap, the whole iPeople Group caters students from di/fferent backgrounds. It caters mostly to students\n\nfrom the C2 Segment (31.36%), or those whose monthly household income is between /peso25,000 to /peso64,999. This is followed by the students from the AB Segment (22.30%), or those whose monthly household income is at /peso135,000 and above. Coming in third and fourth are students from the D (18.94%) and C1 (18.52%) Segments, respectively.

Manila Water houses the East Zone Concession (Manila Concession) and sustained near 100 percent water availability to customers despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nThis year, Manila Water laid out approximately 8,000 kilometers of water pipes. This underscored the company's commitment to ensuring improved water infrastructure throughout the Manila Concession East Zone. Billed connections increased slightly by 1.8 percent this year due to the entry of additional business units. Non-revenue water increased to 12% in 2020 due to challenges encountered in real-time adjustments of pressure and leak detection due to limited mobility during the pandemic. Despite these challenges, however, very little change was observed in terms of water delivered from the past year, a testament Manila Water's promise of providing equitable, reliable, and safe drinking water to its communities.\n\nManila Water closed a number of deals, including water supply and sanitation facilities for the San Jose City Water District\n\nin Nueva Ecija, as well as a Management, Operations, and Maintenance Contract with Saudi Arabia's state-run water agency, the National Water Company. The joint venture agreement between Manila Water Philippine Ventures Inc., Tubig Pilipinas and the San Jose City Water District covers the design, construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, operation, financing, expansion and management of the water supply and sanitation facilities and services in San Jose City.\n\nThe seven-year agreement with Saudi Arabia's state-run water agency includes the implementation of enabling projects and the management of the water and wastewater facilities and systems of the North West Cluster which includes the cities of Madinah and Tabuk. This endeavor shall cover 300,000 square kilometers of land area, reaching more than three million people.\n\n## ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nAs a water supply and distribution company, Manila Water is cognizant of the risks posed by climate change to its operations and clients. MWC formalized a Climate Change Policy in 2007 to address operational risks from climate change. It has been reviewed and revised to align climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies with national policies and the SDG on Climate Action.",

Since the start of Manila Water's reforestation initiative, the company has planted a total of 1,188,020 trees in its critical watersheds.\n\n## COMMITMENT TO SAFE WATER SUPPLY\n\nIn January 2020, Manila Water expressed its commitment to ensuring access to a safe water supply by pledging support to the Adopt-an-Estero program of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Manila Water responded to the DENR's goal of cleaning the San Juan River by entering into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the DENR and local government units of Quezon City, San Juan City, and Mandaluyong City to fully implement the clean-up and rehabilitation of the river and its tributaries.\n\nThe event also marked the signing of the updated usufruct agreement between the DENR and Manila Water for the upgrading of the East Avenue Sewage Treatment Plant in Quezon City. Manila Water will be building more sewage treatment facilities and expand sewer networks as part of its overall wastewater roadmap for the East Zone. The company recently embarked on the\n\nsecond leg of the Adopt-an-Estero project with the construction of the Aglipay Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Barangay Old Zaniga, Mandaluyong City.\n\nThe Aglipay STP is the 42nd sewage treatment facility of Manila Water in Metro Manila's East Zone, and will have a treatment capacity of 60 million liter per day (MLD) of wastewater to be collected from 2,115 hectares of catchment area spanning across Mandaluyong, San Juan, and Quezon Cities. The facility's capacity is expandable up to 120 MLD after the complementing network of 53 kilometers of sewer lines is completed. The Mandaluyong West Sewerage System is designed to serve a population of up to 652,000.\n\nThese and other activities signify Manila Water's continued support for the government's environmental initiatives to clean Metro Manila's waterways and rehabilitate Manila Bay. It will also help achieve shared goals in urban development and environmental protection.\n\n## MANILA WATER'S COVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nManila Water adopted water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) as a core advocacy with the aim of bringing WASH to marginalized communities. This participatory intervention aims to provide access to clean and potable water and improve sanitation facilities and hygiene practices.\n\nMWC ramped up its WASH program and provided hygiene facilities, supplies and education to communities and institutions to address the threat of COVID-19 and support the government's health and safety protocols.\n\nWe will continue to provide quality services and educate the public on environmental protection, address climate change, and engage our stakeholders to maintain a safe and secure water supply.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This created huge drops in energy demand. Of the country's three main island groups, Luzon experienced the biggest load drop, with demand falling by almost 40 percent to 4,516 megawatts (MW) in March 2020 and a further drop to 4,289 MW in April. According to the Department of Energy, electricity demand fell by 30 percent in Luzon, 17 percent in the Visayas, and 25 percent in Mindanao. 1\n\nAs a result, grid operators looked for ways to adjust to the dramatic decline in power demand. This also raised questions on the future of energy, and the volume and type of power that is best suited for the future. According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the government now has an opportunity to redesign the energy market and explore low-cost technologies to drive down power costs. Revisiting green strategies provide the potential to end dependence on imported fossil fuels and reduce long-term power costs. 2\n\n## USHERING IN A LOW CARBON FUTURE\n\nThis opportunity borne out of crisis bodes well for companies such as AC Energy (ACEN), the Ayala Group's energy platform, which is moving closer towards its goal of contributing to a low carbon future by increasing renewable energy sources in local and foreign markets.\n\nIn 2020, AC Energy worked towards enhancing its renewable energy portfolio. Under ACEN, renewable energy capacity is pegged at ~490 MW, with ~1,400 MW in international markets. In terms of attributable output, 41 percent of the group's attributable generation came from renewable sources.\n\nACEN has also embarked on new local and international renewable energy projects. In the Philippines, the 120 MW Alaminos and 60 MW Palauig solar farms are expected to be operational by mid-2021. In the international front, ACEN started construction of more than 340 MW of solar and wind projects in Vietnam. It also commenced projects with ~690 MW of solar capacity in Australia and India.\n\n- 1 Bloomberg. 2020. Manila Electric Halves Spending as Lockdown Weakens Power Demand.

This pivot not only allowed IMI to resume some level of operations, but it also helps with the overall e/fforts to address the pandemic. Through STI Ltd, IMI was able to respond to the United Kingdom's call to aid in the manufacturing of life-saving medical equipment through the Ventilator Challenge program, creating the UCL Ventura Flow Generator, a non-invasive ventilatory treatment for moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. It is the first breathing aid solution manufactured in the Philippines. IMI and STI Ltd are working on a low-cost ventilator system for use in the Philippines and other developing countries.\n\nIMI's Laguna facility produced up to 2 million disposable three-ply face masks per month.

A reduction in waste through improved circularity can, in the long run, cut greenhouse gas emissions, manage risk, and reduce pollution, therefore adding more value to the organization.\n\nBy exploring the implementation of internationally recognized waste certification standards, Ayala is looking at adapting a whole-of-system approach that changes how materials are consumed by the organization, thereby reducing waste in its own operations.\n\nTo successfully implement such a program, we understand that building a waste management ecosystem that can e/ffectively integrate and enhance emerging and current programs within the group is necessary. In 2020, Ayala started to identify partner organizations in establishing this solid waste management ecosystem. We are likewise carefully studying metrices that will enable us to achieve a significant reduction in enterprise-wide waste generation by 2030.\n\nResponsible consumption and production means being accountable for reporting and dealing with the by-products of operations. Ayala keeps track of the waste it generates and thus controls the safe and responsible processing of waste with minimal impact on the environment and community.\n\nAyala Land's waste management efforts include turning plastic into eco-bricks that are used in their selected site developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Protecting and restoring forests can deliver up to 30% of the climate solution by 2030, and curb growing biodiversity and nature loss. 1 In response, Ayala embarked on a groupwide forest and biodiversity conservation program to preserve and enhance the remaining high value forests in Oriental Mindoro through Project Kasibulan.\n\n## HARNESSING NATURE-BASED CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\n\nOriental Mindoro has some of the densest, and most biologically diverse ecosystems in the country. In the past decade, increasing populations and human activity have threatened the ecological balance of the island, as many communities rely heavily on the forest for their resources. The same forest is also under threat from land conversion for plantations and roads, weak monitoring strategies, and deforestation which contribute to forest loss and degradation in the island.\n\nProject Kasibulan focuses on Oriental Mindoro because of its high biodiversity concentration. It is also considered by many as one of the key 'food baskets' for Luzon. Despite these opportunities, the island's forest cover and biodiversity continues to be\n\nthreatened by unsustainable human practices and the e/ffects of climate change. It is for this reason that Project Kasibulan is working with local communities and the indigenous people of Oriental Mindoro to ensure the long-term protection and survival of the forest and the biodiversity found therein. These include the rare, threatened, or endemic flora and fauna, threatened habitats, ecosystem services, sacred and ritual sites, as well as the natural resources utilized by the local communities and the indigenous people.\n\nWith a project area estimated to cover more than 32,000 hectares, this is slated to be the first project of its scale and impact in the Philippines. Project Kasibulan aims to ensure that the remaining high value forests within the project area continue to host and secure populations of threatened species and ensure their resilience from the increasing threats posed by development and the impacts of a changing climate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes 73 birds, 18 mammals, 12 amphibians, 12 reptiles, and 322 plants. For faunal species, 11 are classified as globally and nationally threatened. For plants, 31 are classified as threatened according to the IUCN and the DENR.\n\n## STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY SUPPORT\n\nThe Project will be working with indigenous communities in Oriental Mindoro. As such, special care and attention was placed on ensuring compliance with the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act (IPRA) in dealing with the tribal communities. Anchored on a strong anti-discrimination assurance policy, stakeholders are invited voluntarily regardless of gender, race, religion or any other basis. Independent indigenous peoples' rights lawyers consulted heavily with the team and accompanied them in community gatherings to ensure that the IPRA was followed, with full coordination of the national agencies and local government units tasked with communities' care.\n\nWhenever necessary, the project continues to conduct learning sessions with the communities to ensure that the stakeholders understand their rights and responsibilities as collaborators in the project. Great care is taken when explaining the potential costs, risks, and gains to the relevant communities and stakeholders. Regular dialogue with the project's Social Team and indigenous peoples' rights experts during the pandemic was critical in maintaining project momentum throughout 2020. This ensured sustained community support for the project despite the challenges posed by the rolling lockdowns in the country.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBirds 73\n\nMammals 18\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReptiles 12\n\nPlants 322\n\n## Virtual Kasibulan: Environmental Action Lives On\n\nAs a testament to its commitment towards reforestation and environmental action, Ayala continued its e/fforts on Project Kasibulan despite the e/ffects of the pandemic in 2020. The reforestation program was continued virtually, in partnership with locals in Pagudpud, Ilocos who planted on behalf of the volunteers. A total of 146 online sign-ups resulting in 85 on-the-day volunteers participated in the program. Virtual Kasibulan extended its impact by encouraging volunteers to make a small donation via GCash for the reforestation e/fforts of Bambuhay in the Ipo Dam Watershed in Norzagaray, Bulacan. Donations by the volunteers were matched by Ayala Corporation so that together, we can continue to protect the environment despite current circumstances.\n\nA total of 528 assorted fruit-bearing trees were planted in Pagudpud. The volunteer and Ayala Corporation donations were able to provide an additional 822 seedlings for planting within the Ipo Dam Watershed Area.\n\nAyala understands the impact of climate change has on local ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. Actions need to be taken to address the effects of carbon emissions on local and global ecosystems, hence Ayala's initiatives are design to conserve and proliferation of the country's biological riches.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndigenous community representatives have participated in information and education sessions for Project Kasibulan\n\n651\n\n<!-- image -->",

Located in the Cebu South Road Properties in Cebu City, South Coast City is a 26.3-hectare estate developed through a partnership of Ayala Land, its listed subsidiary Cebu Holdings, Inc., and SM Prime Holdings. The waterside mixed-use estate will have an entertainment and sports arena, a convention center, a one hectare park, a commercial center, and other facilities.\n\nThe Makati Central Business District launched a number initiatives as a response to the crisis. Bike lanes were installed on its main roads to allow safe mobility. A passenger queueing system was implemented at various points along Ayala Avenue to ensure social distancing. Assistance was likewise provided to Makati Medical Center in setting up a COVID-19 treatment center.\n\nIn BGC, several projects were undertaken to support mobility given the lack of public transportation. 15 kilometers of bike lanes were completed in June, resulting in a ten-fold increase in cyclists in the estate. To support business recovery, BGC implemented curbside pick-up points near malls, and extended outdoor dining.fairs in open spaces.\n\nIn NUVALI, QualiMed Sta. Rosa has been converted into a COVID-19 referral hospital.

No new projects were launched in 2020, in line with Ayala Land's financial sustainability initiatives. Limited inventory coupled with slower completion of projects led to the segment's lower contribution.\n\n## Commercial Leasing\n\nThe commercial leasing segment,composed of shopping centers, o/ffices for lease, hotels and resorts, and emerging leasing formats,  likewise faced a di/fficult year because of the health crisis. Ayala Land made enhancements to digital platforms and introduced new product o/fferings in response to this.

Since 1851, our business, products, and services have created sustainable value and played a significant role in every Filipino's daily life, as well as in the country's growing economy.\n\nA fully diversified universal bank and a recognized leader in the banking industry, BPI o/ffers a diverse range of products and services in consumer and corporate banking as well as in asset management, payments, insurance, investment banking, foreign exchange, leasing, and securities distribution. We continue to enhance our digital infrastructure\n\n## MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which compelled the Philippines to impose restrictions on mobility, resulted to a 9.5% economic contraction in 2020, the worst since the 1980s debt moratorium.\n\nWith the economy slowly reopening, local demand will most likely improve although a full recovery is not expected in 2021. The lack of foot tra/ffic in malls and other public areas continues to dampen the demand for goods and services that involve human contact, while the decline in household income amid the pandemic has forced consumers to tighten their belts. However, e-commerce and the widespread use of delivery services are expected to cushion the decline in consumer spending.\n\nThe availability of a vaccine in the second half of 2021 may accelerate the recovery of the economy. We expect a 6.8% growth rate\n\nfor a truly digital banking experience in the future, where our clients of all segments, including corporate, consumer, or small, medium and micro-entrepreneurs, can have better, more convenient, and secure access to our services.\n\nWe continue to build the bank's digital infrastructure and introduce innovations that make banking easier for an increasingly digital population: phone banking, internet banking, and mobile banking.\n\nOur network consists of 1,173 BPI, BPI Family Savings Bank, BPI Direct BanKo branches and branch-lite units nationwide. We have a client base of about 8.6 million being served by a 19,952-strong employee workforce.\n\nin 2021. However, the possibility of a second wave and government underspending may possibly pull down growth in 2021.\n\nWe see upside risks that could keep inflation above 4% in the coming months. The distribution of vaccines may lift global demand and push oil prices higher, while supply constraints in the meat sector will likely continue owing to the impact of the African Swine Fever. Inflation risk along with the steepening of the US Treasury yield curve and additional borrowing from the government may exert upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nWith the economy slowly reopening, we expect imports to recover. Risk to this outlook includes below-target public sector spending. With businesses still struggling, the lack of fiscal support and public construction may stall recovery and dampen the demand for capital goods.",

The company serves the telecommunications and technology needs of consumers and businesses across an entire suite of products and services including mobile, fixed, broadband, data connectivity, internet, and managed services. It has major interests in financial technology, digital marketing solutions, venture capital funding for startups, and virtual healthcare.\n\nSupported by over 8,300 employees and over 1.1 million retailers, distributors, and business\n\n## MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nThe Philippine telecommunications industry has seen a shift in recent years with the advent of data and the Internet of things changing customer behavior and the way telecommunications firms operate. Hastening this is the COVID-19 pandemic which has caused consumer to rely more heavily on digital channels to enable working, learning, conducting businesses, and entertaining from home. As such, telecommunication companies have had to reposition themselves to remain relevant to match the evolving consumer digital habits in the new normal.\n\nFor a highly penetrated mobile market such as the Philippines, the prevalence of a/ffordable data plans and smart devices is further driving the demand for data. Using social media, watching online videos, listening to music streaming services, and playing games are the top activities for Filipinos on the Internet.\n\nThe fixed line industry is also seeing an increasing demand for data. At home, smart\n\npartners nationwide, the company currently has 76.6 million mobile subscribers, both prepaid and postpaid, and 3.8 million home broadband customers. Globe keeps Filipinos connected through its tie-up with 780 roaming partners in 237 calling destinations worldwide.\n\nIts principals are Ayala Corporation and Singapore Telecom, both acknowledged industry leaders in the country and in the region.\n\nIn 2019, Globe became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, committing to implement universal sustainability principles.\n\ntelevisions and gaming consoles are enabling the consumption of bandwidth-intensive multimedia content. Meanwhile beyond connectivity, corporate and enterprise clients are looking to service providers including telcos, for assistance in enabling their digital transformation.\n\nOn competition, the industry may experience changing market dynamics with the entry of the third mobile player. Likewise, with the increasing demand among addressable households for high-speed broadband service, Globe and the incumbent operators will fast track the rollout of fiber-to-the-home service.\n\nLastly, on the regulatory front, the government continues to review existing laws and policies, aligning them with international norms. This has led to zero interconnection fees for mobile calls and texts and new rules governing prepaid load expiry and mobile number implementation, which is set for 2021.",

The company also strengthened its development and operational capabilities through the acquisition of Bronzeoak Clean Energy, a leading renewable energy developer in the country, and PHINMA Energy, one of the pioneers in the Philippine power industry. Afterwards, the Ayala group restructured and announced that it will be\n\n## MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was an unexpected disruption, undermining the ASEAN regional target to achieve 23% renewables share in total energy supply by 2025. In the Philippines, the pandemic brought one of the longest and strictest lockdowns, causing power demand to drop by around 20% year-on-year, though it recovered fully by the second half of the year.\n\nCritical government support brought a positive outlook for the renewables sector. In September, the DOE announced its plan to launch the Renewable Portfolio Standards, which brought in more than 13,000 MW of solar project applications. Demand is also expected to be driven up by the Total Electrification Program which targets a 100% electrification rate by 2022. A green energy auction initially set at 2,000 MW has also been scheduled for June 2021, which would facilitate supply contracting by qualified suppliers with eligible customers in a competitive process.\n\nconsolidating its energy, water, infrastructure, and logistics businesses into the company which was renamed to AC Energy and Infrastructure Corporation. Meanwhile, PHINMA Energy was reconstituted as AC Energy Corporation.\n\nIn 2019, ACEIC infused its Philippine energy assets into ACEN through an asset for share swap. With this infusion, ACEN's portfolio will grow to approximately 2,400 MW of attributable capacity, of which 77% will be from renewable sources. ACEN is in an excellent position to realize its aspiration to become the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia with the goal of 5 GW of renewables capacity by 2025.\n\nThe country is expected to grow power consumption annually by 4.6% within the next decade while power capacity will increase by a net capacity of approximately 8 GW according to Fitch Solutions.\n\nMeanwhile in Vietnam the growth of energy demand slowed to 2% at the height of the pandemic from around 10%. However, mid to long-term growth is expected rebound to 8% to 10% on the back of strong government support on economic trade and investment. At the same time, the country aims to double its use of renewable energy and slash carbon emissions by 15% by 2030.\n\nAgainst COVID-19, Vietnam is forging ahead on its renewable energy goals. In April, the Vietnam government released the second Feed-in-Tari/ff scheme for solar projects, sustaining the solar energy revolution in the country.",

The Philippines remains to be the company's core market.\n\nACEN has more than 1,304 MW of attributable capacity in the Philippines, a 2.6x growth from its 400 MW capacity upon acquisition, with around almost half coming from renewable energy. AC Energy continues to scale up its renewable energy portfolio o/ffshore and currently owns approximately 1,400 MW of attributable capacity in the region.\n\nIn Vietnam, the government has been making a serious push for renewables with a compelling Feed-In Tari/ff program that resulted in over 4 GW of solar in just two years. AC Energy is well-positioned to address the attractive growth opportunities in the country and has made significant solar and wind investments totaling to more than 600 MW in capacity.\n\nAnother key market is Australia. AC Energy formed a joint venture with UPC Renewables in 2018 and established an extensive renewable energy pipeline amounting to over 2,400 MW. The joint venture also established UPC-AC Energy Solar in India and currently holds over 450 MW of solar projects under construction and in the pipeline. India's clean energy expansion program has set an ambitious target of 175 GW renewables capacity by 2022.\n\nIn Indonesia, AC Energy's wind and geothermal assets with an attributable capacity of over 180 MW continue to contribute to its net income.\n\nTo realize its 2025 vision, ACEN will grow its balance sheet through its latest set of capital raising initiatives. In January 2021, ACEN completed its stock rights o/ffering, raising /peso5.4 billion. By March, the private placement of Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC Private Limited, completed a /peso12 billion investment into ACEN. The company also announced plans to conduct a follow-on o/ffering in 2021.\n\n## Leading the Region's Sustainable Transformation\n\nThe Asia Pacific is at the early stage of the energy transition as solar and wind account for less than 10% of output. The upside is massive\n\nAside from the Philippines, AC Energy is now present in Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, and India.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nas demand continues to grow and coal plants are shut down over time.\n\nAC Energy is in an excellent position to capture these opportunities. Through its strong network of partners and banking relationships and its highly motivated, dynamic, and agile team that has consistently surpassed expectations, AC Energy is well on track to realize its aspiration to become the largest listed renewables platform in Southeast Asia.\n\n## AC Energy and Sustainability\n\nThe Philippines was cited as a regional leader in sustainable finance with the third most investments in the region in the green bond market according to the Climate Bonds Initiative. AC Energy was cited as the largest issuer in the Philippines in 2020 with four tranches of green bonds outstanding, ranging from US$75 million to US$400 million.\n\nThe green bonds further strengthen AC Energy's liquidity and enable it to continue scaling up its renewable investments despite the challenging environment. In July, AC Energy successfully launched a US$60 million tap on its senior Green Bonds due 2024 via private placement. By November, AC Energy issued US$300 million in perpetual green bonds on the Singapore Exchange. Its sustainability frame is built on three areas: Low carbon portfolio by 2030, environment protection, and community investment.\n\nAC Energy has started to develop targets and measures to help drive its sustainability agenda across the organization and business partners.",

This expertise is leveraged to provide access to water and sanitation services in an environmentally sustainable manner by advocating responsible practices at every stage of its operations.\n\nManila Water's portfolio includes the East Zone Concession housed under the Parent Company,\n\n## MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenge for water providers was to maintain a high level of service despite prevailing limitations. As such, Manila Water took immediate action to safeguard the welfare of its employees, customers, and stakeholders. At the same time, the company focused on business sustainability, prudently managing its financial resources to maintain service continuity, operational resiliency, and timely project implementation.\n\nLearning from the 2019 water crisis, the East Zone Concession's focus in ensuring water supply stability  resulted in 97% water supply availability in 2020. To maintain this standard, Manila Water will continue to pursue more water security and sustainability projects moving forward. Equally important are Manila Water's sewer and sanitation services. Over the next two years, Manila Water will further ramp up water and wastewater infrastructure projects\n\nwhich provides water and wastewater services to over seven million people in the eastern part of Metro Manila. Manila Water's vehicle for domestic businesses outside the East Zone is Manila Water Philippine Ventures, which has operations in key cities across the country. Internationally, Manila Water Asia Pacific was established to take advantage of new opportunities and partnerships in the ASEAN region. Lastly, Manila Water Total Solutions serves as an incubator of new business opportunities across the water value chain driven by business and technological innovation.\n\nin accordance with the Service Improvement Plan approved during the 2018 Rate Rebasing. The company is likewise preparing for the upcoming 2023 Rate Rebasing - an important exercise that will bridge the concession's accomplishments and objectives with its service obligation targets in 2037.\n\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Manila Water recognizes the need to fast track its digitization initiatives to increase e/fficiency, facilitate added convenience for customers, and minimize operational disruptions. As such, the company maximized its existing digital platforms, increasing usage and integration while maintaining information security. Furthermore, Manila Water introduced new digital platforms to increase ease of use, accessibility, and operational e/fficiency. To date, Manila Water continues to develop and strengthen its digital infrastructure to adapt to the new realities.",

This is due to the shift in customer mix brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, revenue mix shifted 8 percentage points in favor of the residential segment as businesses ceased operations and more people were confined to their homes during the quarantine period.\n\nDespite the impact of the quarantine restrictions, the East Zone Concession continued to provide reliable water distribution services. Manila Water worked with various stakeholders to ensure optimal raw water allocation and dam levels, sustained the 24/7 operation of supply and distribution facilities, and carefully monitored water availability levels to ensure su/fficient water supply.\n\nTo alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic to the East Zone customers, Manila Water extended its due dates for water bills, resulting in a /peso259 million increase in Expected Credit Losses. Despite these challenges, the company registered an 18% decrease in costs and expenses, driven by prudent cost management measures.\n\nNet income of Manila Water's Parent Company declined 7 percent in 2020 to /peso4.7 billion.\n\nManila Water continued to improve its facilities despite the pandemic, investing \u20b112.1 billion in capital expenditures in the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Manila Water Philippine Ventures\n\nManila Water Philippine Ventures supports the improvement of local communities' quality of life with its 23 operating subsidiaries implementing water and environmental projects across the country. MWPV focuses on developing strong partnerships with local governments and key players in the property sector with its core domestic operating subsidiaries namely, Boracay Water, Clark Water, Laguna Water, and Estate Water.\n\nOn a consolidated MWPV level, revenues declined by 10% to /peso4.2 billion. The 4% growth in water and wastewater revenues was o/ffset by the 70% decline in Estate Water's supervision fees due partly to a change accounting treatment, while further weighed down by project delays brought about by COVID-19.

Meanwhile, with the tourism and manufacturing sectors severely a/ffected by the pandemic, Boracay Water and Clark Water's billed volume declined by 33% and 7% respectively. Lastly, Estate Water's billed volume was flat versus the previous year at 10.5 mcm in 2020.\n\nMWPV posted a net loss in 2020 amounting to /peso480 million.\n\n## Manila Water Asia Pacific\n\nManila Water's presence in the ASEAN region is spearheaded by Manila Water Asia Pacific. With market presence in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, MWAP leverages the experience gained from the East Zone to explore opportunities in the region.\n\nOn a consolidated MWAP level, equity share in net income of associates decreased by 67% to /peso214 million. This was mainly due to the finalization of the purchase price allocation of the investment in East Water which was acquired in 2018.\n\nManila Water inked a Management, Operations and Maintenance Contract with Saudi Arabia's state-run water agency, the National Water Company in partnership with French water distributor Saur Group and Saudi's Miahona Company.

Despite initiatives to push for cost e/fficiency, Healthy Family ended the year with a net loss of /peso63 million.\n\nOn August 26, 2020, the Company announced the closure of its Healthy Family Business Division due to said division's recurring losses and inability to financially sustain business operations.\n\nFor the Environmental Services segment, the slowdown in projects caused a significant drag on profitability, resulting to a net loss of /peso16 million. This is likewise the case for the Pipelaying segment, wherein delays in the implementation of its remaining projects have driven down performance to a net loss of around /peso11 million.\n\nThese developments led to MWTS posting a net loss of /peso109 million for the year.",

The company is founded on its dual core of Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc., a Philippine electronics manufacturing services pioneer and now a globally leading manufacturing and technology solutions partner, and AC Motors, one of the country's largest multi-brand vehicle distribution\n\n## MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nNavigating a business landscape upended by the COVID-19 pandemic was the most significant challenge for AC Industrials since the group's inception in 2016. Around the globe and in AC Industrials' key markets, national lockdowns imposed to halt the spread of the disease disrupted supply chains, hindered manufacturing operations, and cratered demand.\n\nThe worldwide automotive industry, already challenged in 2019, faced further di/fficulties across its value chain. International travel, a lifeblood of the global economy, ground to a halt, dragging the wider aerospace industry. As a global business that operates in openly competitive markets, AC Industrials was disproportionately a/ffected by these external factors vis-\u00e0-vis other Ayala subsidiaries.\n\nOn the domestic front, the Philippine automotive industry was similarly tested, with lockdowns impacting dealership operations across the country for extended periods of time. These restrictions, complicated further by weak\n\nand dealership groups. AC Industrials operates in eleven countries around the world with its primary markets in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThrough AC Industrials, Ayala envisions growing its presence in the global industrial technologies space by capitalizing on opportunities opened by disruptive technological shifts, changing industry landscapes, and evolving end-user demand.\n\nconsumer sentiment and reduced financing appetite from the banking community, resulted in 248,050 units sold in 2020 nationwide, a 40% drop from 2019. Prior to the pandemic, the automotive sector had grown by a compounded annual growth rate of 12% from 2009 to 2019.\n\nIn 2021, AC Industrials expects COVID-19 to continue to impact operations, especially in the first half of the year. Key markets such as the Philippines, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States remain under varying degrees of restriction until vaccines are substantially rolled out. Nevertheless, the global EMS sector, for example, is still expected to grow by a post-pandemic CAGR of five percent from 2020 to 2026. Meanwhile, the global automotive sector is projected to grow seven to nine percent up to 2022 while we see the Philippine auto market expanding by 12% through 2025, as it recovers from the steep downturn in 2020.",

Its plants in other operating regions soon followed as forced closures or workforce restrictions were imposed in the remainder of the first half of the year. However, IMI was also quick to recover once health and safety measures were put in place to prevent transmission of the virus. Alongside healthy recovery in manufacturing demand, its facilities were able to return to full capacity by the third quarter of the year. On the back of a strong second half of the year, IMI was able to close 2020 with revenues of US$1.1 billion, declining only nine percent from 2019. By streamlining the group's operating structure and focusing on manufacturing e/fficiency, net losses were minimized to US$3.5 million, an improvement from 2019's net loss of US$7.8 million.\n\nIMI's core subsidiaries, Via Optronics and STI, Ltd., posted combined revenues of US$269 million, an increase of nine percent from the previous year. Slowdowns in VIA's and STI's traditional automotive and aerospace and defense markets were o/ffset by increased participation in the medical sector which saw significant growth in 2020.\n\nAC Motors, AC Industrials' Philippine vehicle distribution and retail arm, recorded a net loss of /peso886 million\n\non lower sales volumes across four of its five automobile brands Honda, Isuzu, Kia, and Volkswagen. An already soft local automotive industry at the start of 2020 was worsened by lockdowns which shuttered dealerships for several months. By the fourth quarter, signs of a recovery were in place with volumes already averaging 70% of pre-pandemic levels. The group also took the opportunity to sizably rationalize its resources and assets, and re-focus its transformation initiatives to put AC Motors in the best position to accelerate and take advantage of the industry's global transition.\n\nAC Motors' motorcycle business also saw a decline in 2020, though an increase in exports of KTM units to China meant that manufacturing sales dropped by only nine percent from 2019. Domestic sales had also normalized by the fourth quarter of the year, with average sales already exceeding pre-pandemic volumes. Another bright spot in 2020 and beyond was the addition of the Swedish Husqvarna brand, another member of the KTM family, with several models already being assembled on the KTM production line in Laguna for delivery in 2021.\n\nAC Industrials' startup investments continued to develop and mature in 2020. MT-C-CON mitigated the impact of the pandemic on auto industry demand by resource rationalization and improving gross margins. Merlin Solar, on the other hand, doubled its revenues from the previous year. The San Jose, California-based firm continues to strengthen its pipeline through developing relationships with channel partners. Merlin has also rationalized its manufacturing operations in both the United States and the Philippines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIMI designs and manufactures power modules, a key component for electric vehicles, as well as power generation and storage applications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevenue of IMI $1.1 B\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCombined revenues of Via Optronics and STI\n\n$269 M",

We are very excited to continue to support this industry and find ways to improve and redefine practices with the use of new technology and best practices.\"\n\nJose Rene Gregory D.

Online shopping behavior is expected to continue growing even when quarantine restrictions are relaxed. Expansion of warehousing facilities and transportation network capacities are needed to support the anticipated volume growth in the next few years.\n\nAlongside the shift to online purchasing is a growing need and preference for contactless, convenient, and secure payment modes. Current financial infrastructure systems require an upgrade and new platforms must be developed to enable secure transactions across multiple financial channels.\n\nThe evolving infrastructure needs of these industries and the opportunities emerging\n\nservice for hundreds of thousands of commuters and motorists daily. AC Infra entered logistics and fulfilment services in 2018 with the launch of Entrego and intends to expand its portfolio in this sector in the coming years.\n\nOur ability to steward and lead projects from its development, implementation, operations, and maintenance is our key advantage. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Ayala, we build on Ayala's reputation and track record of excellence in developing and sustainably managing large scale projects.\n\nin logistics and financial solutions has become increasingly intertwined - both areas are what AC Infrastructure is well-suited to address.

The company provides last-mile delivery, contract logistics, warehousing, and domestic freight forwarding services for a range of B2B and B2C clients.\n\nThe growth of e-commerce spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic benefited Entrego significantly in 2020. Despite limited operations for the months of March to May due to the nationwide Enhanced Community Quarantine, Entrego's courier and express parcel deliveries quickly grew from June to December as more consumers purchased products online and more businesses introduced online retail channels.\n\nFull year 2020 CEP volume increased by 70.3% from 2019. Entrego ended 2020 with revenues of /peso1.9 billion, 62% higher from 2019 and 10x greater since starting in 2018.\n\nThe company is focused on sustaining its growth trajectory in 2021 by further improving on operational e/fficiencies and strengthening its service o/fferings to broaden its client base.\n\n## Light Rail Manila Corporation\n\nSince assuming operations and maintenance functions in 2015, Light Rail Manila Corporation has invested /peso11.6 billion for the rehabilitation, restoration, and upgrade of LRT line 1, resulting in a more comfortable, safer, and reliable commute for its 450,000 average daily passengers before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWith 116 working light rail vehicles at present (from 77 in 2015), LRMC provided the public with more trips per day, expanded operating hours, and shortened headway from a 5-minute average interval in 2015 to the current 3.5-minute average. Various renovation, re-layout, and accessibility improvement works have likewise been implemented to improve passenger safety and operational e/fficiency. In 2020, LRT-1 operations were suspended for three months when Metro Manila was placed under ECQ. During this period, preventive and corrective maintenance works for the line were undertaken to ensure improved service when operations resume.\n\nLRT-1 resumed operations on June 1, 2020 under the General Community Quarantine period at 12% allowed passenger capacity. This was increased to 30% in October 2020 in support of the gradual reopening of the country's economy. LRMC strictly observes and implements above-minimum health and safety measures to ensure passenger and employee safety on a continuing basis.\n\nThe pandemic also accelerated the company's plans on digitalization and innovation. LRMC's Automated Train Operations Management Systems enabled the company to e/fficiently manage its resources. This led to more scheduled trips, shorter queuing time, and faster rides.\n\nLRMC also introduced two new features for its ikotMNL mobile app to address the pressing needs of the commuters: 1) contact tracing via Bluetooth LE technology, and 2) integration with Sakay.ph app for better planning and commute directions\n\nProject completion for LRMC's Cavite Extension project reached 48% by end of 2020. With an investment of /peso13.2 billion , the project will add eight new stations to the existing line. LRMC welcome the arrival of the new Generation 4 train sets in January 2021 and is preparing to utilize it on the existing line.\n\n## Muntinlupa Cavite Expressway\n\nAverage annual daily tra/ffic at the MuntinlupaCavite Expressway for 2020 was at 26,387 vehicles. While the pandemic caused a decrease in vehicular tra/ffic, the number is expected to grow steadily as the economy reopens and more establishments and lifestyle centers rise in the vicinity of the four-kilometer toll road.\n\nLight Rail Manila Corp. has shortened the average train interval to 3.5 minutes from 5 minutes in 2015.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It aims to address the unmet need for accessible, a/ffordable, and quality healthcare for all Filipinos by building, investing, and connecting various businesses into an integrated and seamless ecosystem of services across the continuum of care. AC Health proactively invests across three pillars of healthcare: Pharma, Clinics and Hospitals, and Digital Health.\n\nAC Health's investments in pharma aim to establish a supply chain and drug retail network that deliver a wider range of quality, a/ffordable medicine to more Filipinos. This includes Generika Drugstore, a pioneer in generic retail pharmacies established in 2003 which has grown into a chain of over 700 branches nationwide. Meanwhile, its importer and distributor arm, IE Medica and MedEthix, have become key industry players and have established their presence across various therapeutic areas.\n\n## MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nWhile the healthcare industry will continue to be challenged in the short run, recovery will be slow and steady, hinged largely on the ability to regain patient confidence to continue looking after non-COVID healthcare issues. The disruption in healthcare has impacted industries di/fferently.\n\nPharma showed strong growth in the beginning of the pandemic due to customer's stockpiling behavior for daily essentials. However, this growth slowed towards the latter part of the year, and the pharma industry ended up contracting. Digital health also showed promising growth due to the increase in demand, favorable regulatory policies, and greater acceptance from both patients and providers. Clinics and hospitals, however,\n\nAC Health o/ffers patients an integrated care delivery network across primary, specialty, and multi-specialty platforms through its clinics and hospitals pillar. This includes the recently expanded Healthway network, now the country's largest chain of retail clinics. Towards the end of 2020, AC Health also announced its partnership with Cancer Treatment Services International, a Varian company, for its specialty cancer hospital to be built in Taguig by 2023. AC Health also acquired a controlling stake of the QualiMed Health Network, expanding its network with four general hospitals, more than 85 outpatient clinics, and about 80 corporate clinics.\n\nAC Health also continues to build and invest in health technology solutions through Vigos. Launched in 2018, Vigos' portfolio of in-house solutions includes healthcare superapp  HealthNow, a joint project with Globe's 917Ventures that acts as a comprehensive digital platform for online consultations, medicine order and delivery, and diagnostics-booking.\n\nwere challenged due to the manpower shortages and  60-70% decrease in patient foot tra/ffic at the start of the pandemic. However, as quarantine restrictions loosened by the end of 2020, patient volume picked up and is expected to slowly recover in 2021.\n\nThese trends present potential areas of growth moving forward. These include: increased demand for preventive healthcare, acceleration of health technology initiatives, emergence of new outpatient models, and  strengthened private-public partnerships.\n\nAmidst all of this, AC Health, remains in a unique position to ride on these key trends with its expanded ecosystem of end-to-end services and platforms for all patients and customers.",

More concretely, AC Health leveraged its own ecosystem of services by extending frontline care by maintaining operations at its drugstores, clinics, and online platforms. In the pharma space, AC Health's priority was to ensure a continuous supply of medicine and personal protective equipment for its medical professionals and customers. Medicine pick-up and delivery services were also launched to improve accessibility. Operations also continued across the Healthway clinic network to help decongest overburdened hospitals, see non-COVID-19 patients, and triage suspected cases. In the digital health space, AC Health launched an integrated digital health platform connecting patients with various providers through HealthNow.\n\nIn addition to these, AC Health supported the government's\n\noverall priority to ramp up testing and treatment capabilities for the country. The Ayala group, led by AC Health, worked in partnership with several of the Philippines' biggest conglomerates to build BSL-2 laboratories in all four QualiMed hospitals. This consortium was formed as part of the Ayala Group's initiative to augment the country's testing capacity by 5,500 RT-PCR tests per day, in support of the DOH's and the IATF's Project T3. On treatment, AC Health also worked with QualiMed to expand and upgrade its Laguna and Bulacan facilities into COVID-19 referral hospitals. To date, the QualiMed network has triaged nearly 40,000 suspected COVID-19 cases and admitted over 500 confirmed cases. Moving towards vaccines in the latter part of the year, AC Health also supported the DOH and the IATF in the development of the country's vaccine strategy and secured an initial batch of doses for the Ayala group through a tripartite agreement.\n\nOverall, AC Health remains committed in executing in its vision of providing a/ffordable, accessible, quality healthcare for all Filipinos, and will continue to work alongside partners from both public and private sectors, and the academe, who share in this vision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAC Health's clinics and branches adhere to strict health and safety measures to ensure the well-being of clients, customers, and employees alike.\n\nPatients triaged by QualiMed Hospitals and Healthway clinics Nearly 500,000\n\nNearly 150,000\n\nTests conducted by the RT-PCR Lab Network\n\napp installs on Over 86,000\n\nHealthNow\n\nHealthway has the Philippines' largest network of clinics with over 100 cities across its various formats.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Educational institutions have implemented full distance learning through multiple modes: synchronous, asynchronous, and modular learning. As a result of the shift, spending in training, tech infrastructure and digital tools increased. As of April 2021, there is still no indication when face-to-face classes will resume.\n\nThe government continues to develop policies and programs to aid the sector and its primary stakeholders such as the students and employees.

COVID-19 has ushered in an era of 'massive digital adoption' with eight out of 10 Southeast Asians viewing the Internet and technology as very helpful amidst the pandemic. The study also forecasts that the Internet sector will remain resilient and is poised to grow to over US$300 billion in gross market value by 2025.\n\nThe same study cites that the internet economy in the Philippines has a lot of upside among the six largest ASEAN economies. It is expected to grow to US$25 billion by 2025.

Some of the group's operations such as Wave Money were disrupted intermittently due to the outages in the infrastructure but remains in operation today. Its restaurants such as KFC and YKKO continue to be open on limited capacity albeit due to COVID-19 restrictions. Construction activities for its real estate projects likewise continued save for Yoma Central, which is located in the city center, to avoid congregation of large masses of people during this time.",

The external auditors are directly accountable to the Audit Committee in helping ensure the integrity of the company's financial statements and financial reporting process. Their responsibility is to assess and provide an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards and the overall quality of the financial reporting process. The Audit Committee oversees the work of the external auditors and ensures that they have unrestricted access to records, properties, and personnel to enable performance of the required audit.\n\nDuring the Annual Stockholders' Meeting last April 24, 2020, the shareholders re-appointed Sycip Gorres Velayo & Co. (SGV & Co.) as the company's external auditor for the year 2020, with Lucy L. Chan as the lead engagement partner.\n\nThe Committee met with the external auditors without the presence of the management team to discuss any issues or concern. To ensure that the external auditor maintains the highest level of independence from the company, both in fact and appearance, the Audit Committee approved all audit, audit-related, and permitted non-audit services rendered by the external auditor. Non-audit services expressly prohibited by regulations of the SEC were awarded to other audit firms to ensure that the company's external auditor carries out its work in an objective manner.\n\nTotal fees billed by SGV & Co. for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to /peso14.02 million and /peso13.17 million, respectively, inclusive of VAT. The Audit Committee reviewed the nature of non-audit services rendered by SGV & Co. and the corresponding fees and concluded that these are not in conflict with their function as the company's external auditor. The breakdown of the fees for 2020 and 2019 are shown below:\n\n| EXTERNAL  AUDITOR FEES        | AMOUNT IN  MILLIONS OF PESOS   | AMOUNT IN  MILLIONS OF PESOS   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                               | 2020                           | 2019                           |\n| Audit and  Audit-Related Fees | \u20b111.77                         | \u20b113.05                         |\n| Non-Audit Fees                | 2.25                           | .12                            |\n| GRAND TOTAL                   | 14.02                          | 13.17                          |\n\nAudit and Audit-Related Fees include the audit of Ayala's annual financial statements and the mid-year review of financial statements in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for the years ended 2020 and 2019. These also include assurance services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Ayala's financial statements pursuant to the regulatory requirements. Non-Audit Fees include special projects / consulting services. There were no disagreements with the company's external auditor on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures.\n\n## Internal Auditors\n\nInternal Audit supports the Audit Committee in the e/ffective discharge of its oversight role and responsibility.

The activities of Internal Audit are governed by a separate Internal Audit Charter approved by the Audit Committee and the Board.\n\nInternal Audit adopts a risk-based audit approach in developing its annual work plan, which is reassessed quarterly to consider emerging risks. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the annual work plan and all deviations therefrom and ensures that internal audit examinations cover the evaluation of adequacy and e/ffectiveness of controls encompassing the company's governance, operations, and information systems; reliability and integrity of financial and operational information; safeguarding of assets; and compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. The Committee also ensures that audit resources are adequate and reasonably allocated to the areas of highest risk, including the e/ffectiveness of the internal audit function. During the year, the Committee regularly met with the Chief Audit Executive without the presence of management to discuss any issues or concern.\n\nTo strengthen corporate governance, Ayala's Internal Audit adopted portfolio-based subsidiary oversight to standardize the implementation of good practices and ensure that critical issues are monitored and addressed across the Ayala group.\n\nAs of 2020, the audit team has an average of 14.4 years audit experience and an average of 5.3 years tenure in the Ayala group. The audit team has the following certifications and professional a/ffiliations: certified public accountants, certified internal auditors, certified fraud examiner, certified information systems auditor, certified foreign exchange professional, crisis communication planner; certified in ISO 9001, ISO 22301, ISO 27001, IT Infrastructure Library, COBIT 5 (F), Internal Control (CICA), and Global Innovation Management Institute Level 1; a member of the Financial Executives of the Philippines; and a Fellow of the Institute of Corporate Directors. All the internal auditors are also members of The Institute of Internal Auditors Philippines and adopt the International Professional Practices Framework promulgated by The Institute of Internal Auditors, Inc.\n\nThe internal audit activities conform with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and are continuously evaluated through an independent Quality Assessment Review\n\nAyala's Internal Audit also collaborates with the internal audit functions of the subsidiaries and a/ffiliates to promote sharing of resources, knowledge, tools, and best practices through the Ayala Group Internal Auditors' Network (AGIAN). Established in 1999, the AGIAN continues to perform activities that strengthen synergy within the group resulting to an e/ffective teamwork environment, exchanges of good practices and ideas, and improved skills of internal auditors.\n\nDespite the work-from-home set-up, the group successfully conducted in November 26 and 27, 2020 the first virtual AGIAN Conference, with the theme 'Evolving in the New Normal' focusing on learning sessions about remote auditing, cybersecurity, fraud in the digital landscape, personal resilience and Audit Committee expectations in response to COVID-19 crisis and the evolving ways to doing business.\n\nTechnical sessions were also held to provide the members with the knowledge, tools and required auditing skills to enable them to perform their responsibilities. Since 2018, AGIAN has partnered with The Institute of Internal Auditors Philippines to accredit the quarterly AGIAN trainings for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for renewal of licenses and certifications. In 2020, two AGIAN trainings were provided to the group internal auditors which were accredited by the Board of Accountancy (BOA) for CPD credits. This is in addition to the continuing training and development programs, from specific job skills to long-term professional development provided by the respective companies of the group to their employees.\n\n## Disclosure and Transparency\n\n## Accurate and Timely Disclosures\n\nFull disclosure and transparency are tenets highly valued by Ayala.

Non-financial information was prepared in line with the guiding principles and content elements of the Integrated Reporting framework and referred to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards to report the sustainability performance.\n\nThe Integrated Report provides a more thorough and comprehensive disclosure on both financial and non-financial performance indicators to help shareholders understand the company's various businesses and their impact on the company's overall value creation. Refer to pages 241 to 246 and 99 to 150 for the financial and non-financial performance indicators, respectively.\n\n## Related Party Transactions\n\nAyala has put in place a policy for dealing with related party transactions (RPTs) that is aligned with regulatory requirements, ensuring that all RPTs are at arm's length, fair, and will inure to the best interest of the company and all its shareholders. RPTs are transactions involving a transfer of resources, services or obligations between the company and a related party as defined in the policy, regardless of whether a price is charged. The Risk Management and Related Party Transactions Committee reviews and the Board approves all RPTs recognized as material under the policy. The RPT policy can be found in the company's website.\n\nRPTs are discussed and quantified in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Related Party Transactions. The Consolidated Financial Statements are also made available on the company's website.\n\nNo RPTs classified as financial assistance to entities other than wholly-owned subsidiaries were entered into in 2020. There were also no cases of noncompliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to significant or material RPTs in the past three years.\n\n## Code of Conduct and Ethics\n\nThe Code of Conduct and Ethics serves as a guide to all directors, o/fficers, and employees on the right conduct and set standards expected of them in executing their roles and responsibilities. The Board acts as the overall governing body and ensures the adherence of all directors, o/fficers, and employees of the company to the Code.\n\nIt is expected that all of the company's directors, o/fficers and employees avoid conflicts of interest situations or impropriety. Full disclosure of all relevant facts are required from those who have personal or pecuniary interest on any related party transaction to ensure that actual or potential conflicts of interest are reported and brought to the attention of management. Enforcement and monitoring of compliance with the Code as well as imposition of sanctions for violations thereof fall under the responsibility of management.\n\nIt is the policy of Ayala that all directors, o/fficers, and employees shall conduct business in accordance with Philippine Laws and regulations, including Anti-Money Laundering Law. In case of doubt concerning the legality of any matter, employees shall consult with the Corporate Governance O/fficer and Chief Legal O/fficer. Any suspected criminal violations will be reported to the appropriate authorities and non-criminal violations will be investigated and addressed as appropriate.\n\n## Anti-Corruption Policy\n\nAyala is steadfast in abiding by the highest ethical standards in doing its business. A zerotolerance policy is adopted towards fraud, corruption, bribery in any form, and all unethical practices, coupled with a firm commitment to full compliance with all relevant laws and standards. The anti-corruption policy contained in the Code of Conduct and Ethics guides all directors, o/fficers, and employees on how to conduct business in a fair, ethical, and legal manner. Strict observance of the policy is mandated in all their transactions and dealings with customers, suppliers and business partners of the company as well as with the government.",

Seeking undue financial and material advantage from any transaction is strictly prohibited. Any o/ffer or gift of value given to directors, o/fficers, and employees, or their immediate family, with a view to get favors or to influence business recommendations are immediately reported to the appropriate reporting level. Likewise, directors, o/fficers, and employees are prohibited from accepting gifts or invitations of any form, except when it meets the criteria set by the company. The policy also applies for an indirect o/ffer or bribe that is made through another person.\n\n## Insider Trading Policy\n\nAyala has a well-defined policy against insider trading of company securities and non-disclosure of material non-public information to any person until the information is disseminated to the public and two full trading days had lapsed from the disclosure thereof to give the market time to absorb the information. The policy encompasses compliance with disclosure rules and prevention of the unlawful practice of using confidential information to one's own benefit.\n\n## Trading Blackout\n\nAll company directors, o/fficers, consultants, and employees, including their immediate family members living in the same household, who may have knowledge of material non-public information about the company are strictly prohibited from trading in Ayala's shares during the trading blackout period. A certification on compliance with the prohibition against trading is required to be submitted annually.\n\nThe blackout period commences from five trading days before and two trading days after the disclosure of quarterly and annual financial results for structured disclosures. While for non-structured disclosures, the blackout period is two trading days after the disclosure of any material information other than quarterly and financial results.\n\nNotices of trading blackouts were regularly disseminated and issued to all personnel via e-mail. Compliance was strictly enforced during these trading blackout periods.\n\nThere have been no violations of the company's insider trading and trading blackout policies in the past three years.\n\n## Reporting of Transactions\n\nIn accordance with Ayala's established and implemented guidelines on reporting trades, all directors and o/fficers from Managing Directors and above, Comptroller, Chief Audit Executive, Chief Risk O/fficer, Treasurer, Chief Compliance O/fficer, Corporate Secretary, and Assistant Corporate Secretary must report to the company all acquisitions or disposals, or any changes in their shareholdings in the company within three business days from the transaction date.

Directors, o/fficers, employees, and all suppliers, business partners, contractors and subcontractors, and other third parties are encouraged to report any perceived wrongdoing or malpractice involving the company or its personnel. The reporting must be in good faith and in return, the whistleblower will have utmost confidence on fair treatment and protection from reprisal, harassment, disciplinary action, or victimization for whistleblowing.\n\nIn the interest of safeguarding the whistleblower and guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of the report, Ayala has implemented an outsourced receipt and processing of whistleblower reports to Punongbayan and Araullo through the reporting channel https://proactivehotline. grantthorntonsolutions.ph/report/ayalacorporation. The website allows anonymous reporting and is accessible anytime and anywhere via internet. Status of all reports are trackable with available monthly reports.\n\nOther reporting channels available to the whistleblower are by submitting a written report directly to the O/ffice of the Chief Compliance O/fficer, or by e-mail to whistleblower@ayala. com, or through a face-to-face meeting with any member of the established Disclosure Committee composed of one representative each from the O/ffice of the Chief Legal O/fficer, Strategic Human Resources, Internal Audit, and Group Risk Management.\n\nThere is a set investigation process for reported violations of company policies, rules and regulations and all reports are given confidential treatment and discussed with the Audit Committee, which monitors the resolution and closure of all reports.\n\nIn 2020, Ayala did not receive any whistleblower report through its reporting channels.\n\n## Data Privacy Policy\n\nAs part of its continuing commitment to uphold the data privacy of all stakeholders, Ayala's Data Privacy O/ffice headed by the Data Protection\n\nO/fficer, Atty. Solomon M. Hermosura, works closely with all the business units to regularly review the physical, technical and organizational measures adopted by the company for the protection of personal data. This is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the personal data that the company collects and processes, and protect these against natural and human dangers, such as accidental loss or destruction, unauthorized access, fraudulent misuse, and unlawful alteration.\n\nIn 2020, the company: (1) adopted its Data Privacy Manual to establish policies and guidelines to ensure the proper processing of personal data, (2) executed data protection agreements with relevant third parties, (3) crafted the appropriate privacy terms and conditions for various initiatives and programs of the company and the Ayala Group involving processing of personal data, (4) completed self-assessment of compliance with APEC Cross-border Privacy Rules, (5) conducted capacity building activities for employees, and (6) initiated new projects to increase the organization's awareness of and improve compliance with the requirements of the Data Privacy Act of 2012, its Implementing Rules and Regulations, and other relevant issuances of the National Privacy Commission.\n\nAyala had one data breach during the year which involved contact details provided by employees, and was duly reported to the National Privacy Commission. Due process was followed in notifying a/ffected data subjects and in implementing remedial measures.\n\nInquiries or concerns regarding data privacy and/or data subjects' rights may be submitted to the Data Protection O/ffice through acdataprivacy@ayala.com.\n\n## Stakeholder Relations\n\n## Stockholder Meeting and Voting Procedures\n\nIn spite of the unprecedent circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company was able to distribute the notice of meeting at least 28 days before the Annual Stockholders' Meeting (ASM) by adopting SECallowed alternative modes of distributing the notice and other meeting materials. The notice contains the agenda and a detailed explanation on the same, the allowed means of participation",

Non-controlling or minority stockholders were given the right to nominate candidates for the board of directors and to propose items for inclusion in the meeting agenda.\n\nRising to the challenge of the pandemic, the company held its first virtual ASM. The company endeavored to make the shareholder experience as similar as possible to an in-person meeting, encouraging active shareholder participation through attendance by remote communication, voting in absentia using the enhanced electronic Voting in Absentia & Shareholder (VIASH) System, voting though proxy forms assigning the Chairman as proxy, and sending their questions and comments through the company's established communication channels. Shareholders who notified the corporation of their participation in the meeting by remote communication were included in the determination of quorum as well as those who voted in absentia, either electronically or through proxy.\n\n## Website\n\nInformation on the company's corporate governance initiatives, this Integrated Report, and all other relevant information are available on the company's website at www.ayala.com. As part of our stakeholder engagement, Ayala also maintains social media accounts at Facebook.com/AyalaCorporation and https:// ph.linkedin.com/company/ayala-corporation.",

This accounting standard requires applying\n\na fair market value accounting for Ayala's investment in Manila Water, if the completion of the divestment and or subsequent loss of voting control is expected to occur within one year from the date of the financial statement. It also requires the assets and liabilities of MWC to be presented as one line item in the consolidated balance sheet and P&L in 2019 as opposed to line by line consolidation in prior years.\n\nPlease see as summary table on the next page showing the e/ffect of accounting for MWC investment under PFRS 5.\n\nIts reported net income decreased 51 percent to /peso17.1 billion.\n\nAyala's businesses recorded lower net profits due to the e/ffects of the pandemic on business operations.\n\n- \u25a0 Ayala Land endured the severe impact of COVID-19 to it business operations in 2020 recording a 74 percent drop in net income to /peso8.7 billion.\n- \u25a0 BPI's net income declined 26 percent to /peso21.4 billion on the back of /peso28 billion in loan loss provisions it booked in anticipation of an increase in NPL levels. The provision was 5x higher than the /peso5.6 billion allocated in the same period the previous year.\n- \u25a0 Globe's net income contracted 16 percent to /peso18.6 billion driven by a moderate decline in gross service revenues, higher depreciation expenses from its continued network investments, and higher non-operating expenses.\n- \u25a0 AC Energy recorded a net income of /peso6.2 billion, 1 a decline from its year-ago level of /peso25 billion, which included gains from the partial divestment of its thermal assets.\n- \u25a0 AC Industrials narrowed its net loss to /peso1.8 billion in 2020 from /peso2.4 billion the previous year mainly due to improved results of IMI and MT Group as well as lower parent impairment provisions.",

Excluding one-o/ffs, core net income declined 22 percent to /peso5.8 billion.\n\n- \u25a0 The parent company, which houses the East Zone Concession, saw net profits decline seven percent to /peso4.7 billion driven by the recognition of impairment loss in Manila Water Total Solutions, lower costs and expenses despite higher provisioning for estimated credit losses, and higher depreciation expenses.\n\nRevenues slightly decreased two percent to /peso21.1 billion as improved billed volume in the East Zone was dragged by lower supervision fees from Estate Water.\n\nEBITDA decreased six percent to /peso11.9 billion despite OPEX improvement as the recognition of net foreign exchange losses and provisions for probable losses weighed down on profitability.\n\nEBITDA margin stood at 57 percent.\n\nIn December 2020, Manila Water's consortium with French water distributor Saur Group and Saudi's Miahona Company inked a seven-year agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's state-run water agency National Water Company to manage the delivery of water and wastewater services, billing and collection, customer service, and the integration and transformation of its human capital in the North West Cluster served by NWC. This initiative is among the first of the country's plan to privatize its water infrastructure sector.\n\nLast February 2021, Ayala, through its wholly owned subsidiary Philwater and the Razon group through Trident Water executed a share purchase agreement equivalent to the latter's acquisition of a 39.1 percent voting stake and 8.2 percent economic stake in Manila Water.\n\n## POWER\n\nThe AC Energy group generated a net income attributable to equity holders of AC Energy's Parent of /peso6.2 billion 1 in 2020, reflecting the group's strong performance despite the pandemic. This was a decline from /peso25 billion in the prior year, which included gains from its partial divestment in AA Thermal.\n\n- \u25a0 Net income contribution from its listed subsidiary, AC Energy Corporation or ACEN, reversed to /peso2.8 billion from a net loss in the previous year on the back of higher contracted capacity and improved plant availability. ACEN now accounts for half of the group's net income.\n- \u25a0 Equity earnings from international assets increased 68 percent to /peso2.5 billion, supported by full-year operations of the company's solar assets in Vietnam.\n- \u25a0 Other income declined to /peso448 million because of the absence of significant divestment gains booked in the prior year. Other income in 2020 includes earnings from the legacy coal assets o/ffset by bond interest expense and parent overhead.\n\nThe AC Energy group has expanded its geographical reach and currently operates in five markets, with the recent start of construction of its first project in Australia.",

Its Philippine automotive business remained challenged due to the negative e/ffects of the health crisis.\n\nIMI registered a net loss of US$3.5 million in 2020 compared to the US$7.8 million net loss it incurred in the same period the previous year. The improvement was mainly on the back of sound cost management including materials cost, factory overhead, and non-operating expenses.\n\n- \u25a0 Revenues decreased nine percent to US$1.1 billion in 2020 but was trended up since\n\nthe height of quarantine restrictions and surpassed pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter.

This was likewise driven by Globe's lower mobile revenues and higher depreciation and receivable provisions partially o/ffset by an increase in home broadband demand and remeasurement gain in Mynt. As a percentage of total revenues, this account\n\nis at eight percent in December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## BANKING\n\nBPI's net income decreased 26 percent to /peso21.4 billion in 2020 due to the /peso28 billion in loan loss provisions it booked in anticipation of an increase in non-performing loans. The provision is 5x larger than the /peso5.6 billion allocated in the previous year.\n\nTotal revenues increased 10 percent to /peso101.9 billion because of net interest income and non-interest income growth.\n\n- \u25a0 Net interest income was up 10 percent to /peso72.3 billion due to a 5.8 percent expansion in average asset base supported by a 14-basis point improvement in net interest margin, which stood at 3.49 percent.\n- \u25a0 Non-interest income rose 11 percent to /peso29.7 billion on the back of higher securities trading gains albeit tempered by fee-based income.",

It has reached record highs amidst the pandemic, with 33 million registered users or one in every three Filipinos. Additionally, it has seen a 3.7x increase in active users as gross transaction value exceeded the /peso1 trillion mark in December. Owing to its success, Mynt has attracted US$175 million in fresh investment capital from existing shareholders and Bow Wave in multiple tranches, with post-money valuation of the final tranches at close to US$1 billion.\n\nGlobe's CAPEX spend grew 18 percent to /peso60.3 billion, representing 41 percent of gross service revenues and 82 percent of EBITDA. The company has allocated /peso70 billion for 2021 capital expenditures.\n\nDespite the impact of COVID-19, Globe accelerated its cell site buildout and upgrades, fiber-to-the-home deployments, and 5G coverage.

Assets under PFRS 5 increased 14 percent due to MWC's higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments coming from proceeds of loan availments, higher receivables resulting from credit extension of customer payment amid\n\nthe pandemic and to the increase of property, plant and equipment, and service concession assets due to construction of additional facilities and concession fees. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased 16 percent due to lower collections of subsidiaries,\n\nAC's and ALI's share buy-back programs, infusions to business units, new and additional investments such as the Yoma group and assets under AC Energy, and debt payments and dividend payout. These were partially o/ffset by dividends to AC as well as loan availments of AC and proceeds of ALI on AREIT's IPO and IMI on VIA's IPO. These accounts comprise six percent and eight percent of total assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nTotal debt increased nine percent to /peso441.8 billion due to borrowings of Ayala Land for capital expenditures, buy-back of shares, and dividend payments, borrowings of AC Energy and AC Infra for operational expansion, and borrowings of parent for its investment in the Yoma group and FLL bond issuance.

The intended users of this Assurance Statement are the management of the Company.\n\nWe performed this assurance engagement using DNV's assurance methodology VeriSustain TM1 , which is based on our professional experience, international assurance best practice including International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised*, along with the Global Reporting Initiative's ('GRI's') Principles for Defining Report Content and Report Quality and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board's ('SASB's') industry-specific Standards.

We did not review financial disclosures and data as they are not within the scope of our assurance engagement.\n\nWe planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion related to assurance of non-financial sustainability disclosures in this Report. We are providing a 'limited level' of assurance based on DNV's VeriSustain and no external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this assurance engagement.\n\nThe engagement excludes the sustainability management, performance, and reporting practices of Ayala Corporation's suppliers, contractors, and any third-party mentioned in the Report. The Company's position statements, the statements for the management approach, and case studies and examples are excluded from the scope of our work.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF AYALA CORPORATION AND OF THE ASSURANCE PROVIDER\n\nThe Board of Ayala Corporation has sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report and is responsible for all information provided in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting the information presented in the Report.

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions, we carried out remote assessments as one-to-one discussions and onsite location assessments were not feasible. We undertook the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the non-financial sustainability disclosures in this Report;\n- \u00b7 Review of approaches to materiality determination and review of outcomes of stakeholder engagement; DNV did not have any direct engagement with external stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Review of information provided to us by the Company on its reporting and management processes related to sustainability performance for the reporting year based on the framework adopted by Ayala Corporation\n- \u00b7 Interviews with selected members of leadership team, and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability issues and review of selected evidence to support generic disclosures. We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with overall responsibility for the programmes to deliver the targets for medium- and long-term vision, mission and milestones;\n- \u00b7 Performed desk review of selected sustainability parameters for sampled entities, and discussed findings and resolved with the Corporate Sustainability Team;\n- \u00b7 Carried out remote assessments with teams at AC Health, AC Ventures, AC Industrials, AC Infrastructure, iPeople, to review the processes and systems for preparing site level sustainability data and implementation of sustainability strategy. We were free to choose the sites for remote assessment or verification;\n- \u00b7 Review of supporting evidence for key claims and data disclosed in the Report. Our verification processes were prioritized based on risk-based approach, i.e. relevance of identified material topics and sustainability context of the business;\n- \u00b7 Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating the performance data and, for a sample, checking the data consolidation at site and corporate levels.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and are shorter in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. During the assurance process, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement.\n\n## OPINION AND OBSERVATIONS\n\nOn the basis of the assurance engagement undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that Ayala Corporation's 2020 Integrated Report does not properly describe the non-financial performance of identified material topics based on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework ('<IR> Framework'). Without a/ffecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations against the principles of VeriSustain:\n\n## Stakeholder Inclusiveness\n\nThe participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to Sustainability.\n\nThe Report has brought out key stakeholders (e.g. investors and shareholders, employees, government agencies and regulators, business partners and a/ffiliates, bank counterparties and creditors, suppliers, customers, communities, media) to engage with, to build trust based on significant influence on Ayala Corporation's sustainability performance. The Process considers the influence that each stakeholder has in the range of businesses and overall decision-making processes. The Report also describes the engagement modes such as consulting, involving, or collaborating with each stakeholder considering based on the extent of influence and articulates the value Ayala Corporation seeks to deliver through various engagement platforms including Ayala's responses to the key concerns through various disclosures on strategies and value creation in the Report.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness.",

Further the Report states materiality is aligned to GRI Standards, SASB industry-specific topics and disclosures, the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, WBCSD programs and Ayala Sustainability Blueprint for business transformation and integrated Material topics to relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's).\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Materiality.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nThe extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues.\n\nThe Report brings out the Company's responses to identified material topics, key challenges faced and significant issues including risks which have arisen during the reporting period through disclosures on Governance, Business Review, Business model, strategic responses to key stakeholders' concerns, to deliver shared values. Further the Report also brings out its non-financial performance related to its material topics through selected GRI Topic Specific Standards and SASB industry-specific Standards as Performance Indices and its linkages to Six Capitals of <IR> framework.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Responsiveness.\n\n## Reliability\n\nThe accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying data management systems.\n\nThe majority of the performance disclosures verified through o/ffsite verification, i.e. at the Head O/ffice and sampled sites, and through desk reviews, were found to be fairly accurate, reliable, identifiable and traceable to the source. Considering the limited sampling, we did not detect any major errors related to data collection or aggregation. We also reviewed the calculations and related assumptions used for its suitability, taking into account the principle of Reliability. Some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to interpretation and aggregation errors. These identified errors were communicated, and the responses and corrections made to the reported data and information were reviewed.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Reliability.\n\n## Completeness\n\nHow much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organization and its stakeholders is reported.\n\nThe Report discloses the Company's non-financial disclosures based on the <IR> Framework and performance during the reporting period 2020 related to its material issues using appropriate GRI\n\nTopic Specific Standards and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) disclosures, for the identified boundary of operations in the sections Geographic Presence and Performance Indices of the Report and covers the Company's approaches to value creation during the reporting period. Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Completeness.\n\n## Neutrality\n\nThe extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organization's performance, delivered in a neutral tone.\n\nThe Report presents disclosures related to the Company's performance, challenges and concerns of stakeholders during the reporting period in a neutral, consistent and balanced manner, applying adequate consideration to not unduly influence stakeholders' opinion made based on the reported data and information.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Neutrality.",

This also covers the electricity consumption of tenants of Ayala Land properties.\n\nStandards used for the computations are based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Accouting and Reporting Standard. The gases reported include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.\n\n- *2018 Emissions of AC Health is from the diesel consumption from outsourced fleet of MedGrocer. In 2020, MedGrocer is no longer included in the 2020 data.\n\n**In July 2018, the contract for armored vehicles changed from leased to outsourced, resulting to the shift of fuel management from BPI to the armored vehicles agency, taking it out of the Bank's reporting scope. Hence, Scope 3 of BPI is no longer calculated starting 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Yes, the pandemic led to social dislocation as mobility restrictions cleared our highways of tra/ffic and our malls from meet-ups.  Yet technology and digital infrastructure ramped up to power industries, to multiply connections and dialogue by cutting travel time from one meeting to the next. And, for many, working from home restored connections with families we had previously seen less often than our workmates. Yes, the pandemic led to the worst economic contraction recorded in many parts of the world. In the Philippines, our economy declined by -9.5 percent.
