We moved quickly to help our customers, employees, and communities adapt to the pandemic.\n\nWe also looked inward. As a global company, we have teams and customers around the world who have been sharing their experiences, helping us identify strengths and weaknesses in our operations and develop truly impactful solutions that will transform Wipro into a more supportive, inclusive, and successful organization.\n\nThe result is a bold new Wipro, driven by a powerful strategy that balances ambitious business goals with a renewed commitment to empowering people. We are setting a high bar, committing ourselves to driving meaningful change and sustained growth in everything we do going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Simplicity over perfection\n\nDuring one of the most difficult years in recent history, we embarked on a radical transformation of the Wipro organization. We shifted to the new operating model, and have been receiving great feedback from internal teams, clients, investors, and analysts. We are also moving away from traditional delivery models, encouraging delivery leaders to adopt more flexible, powerful methods of working.\n\nWe appointed new leaders in many roles and significantly simplified the structure at the top. This is an impressive group of people, with fresh perspectives and a lot of experience to share with our teams and our clients. We are confident that their expertise will help us advance our strategy and provide the support and leadership that is essential for long-term growth.\n\nOver the years, our mergers and acquisitions have created a vibrant community of diverse talent around the world. We are happy to continue that growth with our recent acquisitions of IVIA, 4C, Encore Theme, Eximius, CAPCO and Ampion. Acquiring CAPCO significantly strengthens our position in the global financial services market, and Ampion will help us expand our footprint in Australia, accelerating our growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn April 2021, we fully integrated seven of our previously acquired companies and subsets of those individual brands. We now have almost everyone united under one Wipro brand - one identity, one mindset, one shared ambition. This move allows all of us to go to market as One Wipro .\n\nIn April 2021, we fully integrated seven of our previously acquired companies. We now have almost everyone united under one Wipro brand\n\n## #OneWipro\n\nWe now have all our colleagues from 4C, Appirio, Encore Theme, Eximius, Healthplan Services, IVIA and Opus united under #OneWipro brand.\n\n## Transforming our workforce\n\nTalent is essential to our new growth strategy. We are investing heavily in our teams and nurturing top talent. We have updated our competency development programs to keep our project, delivery, and program managers equipped with the latest skills.\n\nWe are leveraging TopGear and Topcoder to enable us and our clients to tap a global talent pool of Wipro employees, as well as a highly skilled external crowd, to execute even the most challenging projects. With remote work on the rise, crowdsourcing has potential to become a key delivery model. Wipro is a frontrunner in the crowdsourcing space, and we intend to use our advantage to push more innovative solutions in with this delivery model.\n\nRespect and inclusivity are fundamental to Wipro, but last year was a reminder that we can all do more. Our new approach to talent management focuses on increasing diversity throughout our organization and providing greater support across the board to empower our employees and their growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis renewed focus on acquiring, developing, and maintaining talent will increase performance across our global teams, translating to greater innovation, efficiency, and quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Empowering our clients\n\nTechnology adoption increased significantly in 2020. As businesses responded to the pandemic, many began exploring new technologies or doubling down on earlier investments, accelerating digital transformations worldwide and driving demand in areas like IT services. Across industries, companies are likely to continue investing in operational efficiency programs to reduce costs of operations, then reinvest the savings in transforming business models and leveraging new technologies.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, consumers and businesses will increasingly make choices based on trust. Systems and data need to be secure,\n\nreliable, and resilient. Similarly, customers will do business with people they trust.\n\nWipro is a global leader in IT services, and we intend to build on that reputation, establishing our brand and our clients as some of the most forward-thinking organizations in business today.\n\nGuided by our new strategy, empowered leadership, and global talent, we will deliver more comprehensive digital solutions, push the envelope with better business practices and talent management, and make real progress in building a bold tomorrow.",

Energized by what we call The Spirit of Wipro, we commit ourselves to be a catalyst for building a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.  We believe the 'power to do good' stems from building deliberately designed, sustainable and locally relevant programs in the communities in which we operate. We are committed to using the same level of rigor, strategic thinking and critical evaluation in our development and implementation of these programs as we would in our business initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEconomic value is sustainable only if created on a foundation of ethics and responsibility.\n\nAzim Premji, Founder Chairman\n\n## Transforming our culture\n\nThe Five Habits is our culture transformation initiative. These habits - Being Respectful, Being Responsive, Always Communicating, Demonstrating Stewardship and Building Trust - are our values in action, and represent how we experience Wipro every day.\n\nIn a world defined by change and complexity, the Five Habits instill our commitment to each other and to the communities which we belong. They drive us towards building a growth mindset, a continued culture transformation that sets the foundation of who we are, how we behave and who we aspire to be.\n\nAt Wipro, we believe that our leaders are the most visible examples of our culture. And with this initiative, we encourage every leader to exemplify the fundamental behaviors aligned to each of the Five Habits, demonstrate them to their teams, and to embody these behaviors every day, in every aspect of their roles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeing Respectful\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeing Responsive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlways Communicating\n\nDemonstrating Stewardship\n\nBuilding Trust\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Five Habits are our values in action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meeting the moment\n\nWipro is dedicated to being a responsive and good corporate citizen in times of crisis.  The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a tremendous toll on our society, devastating lives and our global economy.  Wipro and the Azim Premji Foundation moved swiftly to help lead the response to the pandemic around  the world.\n\nAfter Wipro converted its Pune campus to a COVID-19 hospital, it found that vital information from various medical stakeholders was disorganized and hard to access. This led Wipro to build the Global Coalition for COVID-19 Medical Care (GCCMC), a knowledge-sharing platform created for doctors, dedicated to education, efficiency, and improved outcomes.  Wipro also reached out to 13 million beneficiaries throughout India with supply of dry rations and hygiene kits.",

        "page_content": "## Message from the Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Stakeholders,\n\nThis has been an unimaginable year. And despite all the pain and suffering, the unbreakable human spirit shines through - in the large and small acts of kindness, empathy and compassion.\n\nIn many ways, humanity has come together to fight this global pandemic. Global cooperation has never been more important than it is now. The vaccines for COVID-19 are one of the greatest examples of collaboration and pioneering science. We must now work to scale the supply chain, build mechanisms for equitable distribution and drive an efficient administration for these life-saving vaccines.\n\n## Building a Bold Tomorrow\n\n## for customers\n\nMany of us have lived through an economic crisis before. Without fail, the world has adapted and bounced back. In the last fifteen months, we have unlearnt old habits, adopted technology rapidly and challenged ourselves to adapt to new ways of working. I am so glad, and proud, that Wipro has been a trusted partner for our customers right through this journey, and together, we have emerged stronger.\n\nTechnology is often at the forefront of economic recovery, but especially so now, as the pandemic precipitated structural changes across industries and challenged established ways of working. So, whether it is digital commerce, online education, or telemedicine, technology-enabled business models have emerged across the board, with Cloud technology as the cornerstone of this transformation.\n\nAs vaccination efforts ramp up globally, and economies start seeing a rebound, our customers are ever so keen to invest in and accelerate their digital transformation. For companies such as ours, the key to success is to respond to this opportunity with speed and agility.\n\nWith the rapid shift to digital, the demand for talent will outpace supply, and become a key dependency for growth. Already we see new delivery models, such as 'work from anywhere' and 'Crowdsourcing', become the mainstay. We expect virtual, remote, communitybased, and distributed work models to be the future of work.\n\n## Building a Bold Tomorrow for Wipro\n\nI believe Wipro is well-positioned to leverage, as well as enable such transformations. In the last six months, we have effected bold changes to help serve our customers better.\n\nEarly last year, we set out to make the first bold change, embracing the direction set by our new CEO & Managing Director, Thierry Delaporte. The Board and I cannot be more confident of Thierry, and his leadership. As a result, I feel more optimistic about our future than ever before.\n\nThe difficult but necessary changes we have made, has made us a stronger and better organization.\n\nProximity to customers is key, as is reflected in our new business model.\n\nDeep and prioritized focus on countries, industry sectors, offerings, and partnership, along with an operating structure that makes us agile and nimble in a post-crisis world, that will be all about impact at speed. Overall, I see a much stronger external market\n\norientation at Wipro. Several new leaders have joined us to take forward this transformation.\n\nThe acquisition of CAPCO, a leading strategy and consulting firm in the Banking and Financial Services Industry, was our largest ever and another bold move for us. With a purchase consideration of $1.45 billion, CAPCO brings to us over $700 million in annual revenues and over 5,000 consultant colleagues around the world. With this acquisition, we are now in a select league of service providers, who provide integrated end-to-end consulting, digital, cloud and IT transformation services for the BFSI sector at scale. It also expands our presence into a large set of strategic clients uniquely complementary to our existing customer base. Most importantly, CAPCO and Wipro share similar culture and values.\n\n## Building a Bold Tomorrow for our employees\n\nAs I write this letter, India, where over 160,000 of our employees are based, is emerging out of a ravaging second wave of COVID-19. The last couple of months have been incredibly hard, mentally and emotionally, on us all. In this time of deep stress and grief, we are doing everything we can to help our employees. These include providing COVID-19 Isolation Care centers for our staff and their families, partnering with major hospitals to provide medical support to critically ill employees, additional medical reimbursement and leaves related to COVID-19, as well as vaccination at our campuses. We have also partnered with leading global EAP providers to help employees seek counselling 24x7.\n\nEarlier last year, when the pandemic broke out, we triggered our business continuity plans to quickly enable remote working. Even today, less than 3% of our global workforce work from our offices. We have settled well into this new way of working and have continued to make our customers successful. We enjoy their confidence, and I have no doubt that a hybrid model may well be how we work in the future. But for the inspirational, inclusive and seamless teamwork, this massive change wouldn't have been possible. We must take a moment to recognize and celebrate the tremendous commitment and ownership our teams have demonstrated.",

        "page_content": "## Building a Bold Tomorrow\n\nfor our communities\n\nWhile we have emerged stronger and bolder from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are acutely aware that the pandemic has widened socioeconomic inequities. Our responsibility towards our communities has increased manifold.\n\nIn April 2020, Wipro Ltd, Wipro Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. and Azim Premji Foundation, together committed C 1,125 crore (~$150M) towards tackling the unprecedented health and humanitarian crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we have supported more than 1,500 projects covering humanitarian aid, integrated healthcare support, and livelihood regeneration. Cumulatively, we have reached out directly to more than 18 million people\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the past 12 months, we have supported more than 1,500 projects covering humanitarian aid, integrated healthcare support, and livelihood regeneration.\n\nthrough our coordinated and comprehensive COVID-19 response, to provide humanitarian aid and help with livelihoods regeneration.\n\nTo deal with the unprecedented second wave, we have ramped up our response on multiple fronts - our approach has been to address short-term emergency response as well as contribute towards strengthening our public health infrastructure. The hospital we had set up in Pune, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, by converting our tech-campus into a 450-bed Covid-care hospital, continues to save lives.\n\nOur overall healthcare efforts have built capacity and run programs, closely collaborating with the public health system, to serve geographies that have a population of over 150 million people.\n\nThe other major challenge facing humanity today is the climate crisis. Wipro has always believed that businesses must be at the forefront to address this challenge. Wipro's climate change program goes back nearly two decades, and this year we announced our commitment to achieving Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. Our approach emphasizes the importance of not just reaching that goal but doing so in a way that aligns with Wipro's core values of integrity and business responsibility.\n\n## Our Performance & Return to Shareholders\n\nEven as we focused on our employees' safety and customers' success, we drove focused action on our costs to respond to a deceleration in revenues in the first quarter of the year as the pandemic took hold globally. Just as effectively, we quickly pivoted to meet the rising demand, through an efficient supply chain in the second half of the financial year. For the year ending 31st March 2021, our IT Services Revenues was at $8.1 billion , a decline of 1.4% YoY in reported currency. Our Net Income at D 107.9 billion grew by 11% YoY aided by improved operating margins. We also ended the year with strong order booking, including two mega billion-dollar deal wins. For the full year, the EPS was at D 19.11 per share, up 14.6% YoY, and the Operating Cash Flows at D 147.6 billion was at\n\n136.7% of our Net Income . Our Gross Cash was at $4.7 billion and Net Cash was at $3.6 billion . Our pay-out for FY21 was at D 122.1 billion through buyback and dividends (including dividend distribution tax) to our shareholders, which is 113.1% of our Net Income . Our market cap and share price increased by over 108% in the last 12 months.\n\n## Our Values & Growth mindset\n\nThis year is special. We complete 75 years since incorporation! This fabulous journey would not have been possible but for the tireless efforts of our employees, their dedication and inventiveness. They embody the true spirit of Wipro! As a result, Wipro is recognized the world over as an exemplar of corporate citizenship with the highest standards of governance, ethics, and values.\n\nI personally champion this culture, mindset and ways of working, something we call the Five Habits: Being Respectful, Being Responsive, Always Communicating, Demonstrating Stewardship, and Building Trust. Embarking on and sparking a cultural movement was a strategic imperative for us, allowing Wipro to focus on driving a growth mindset across the firm.\n\nI am thankful to our clients, partners, employees, and other stakeholders who have placed their trust and confidence in us. I am very excited about the path we are on, and confident you will see a bolder and more ambitious Wipro as we move forward, that is unafraid to shake up the status quo, make tough calls, invest deep, and think big.\n\nVery Sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRishad A Premji\n\n<!-- image -->",

We announced a new strategy, completed the biggest organizational restructuring in our history, delivered strong performances for\n\nconsecutive quarters, and sealed our largest-ever acquisition, all in the middle of a global pandemic. We finished FY21 with healthy revenue growth, prestigious deal wins, strong margins and robust cash flows.\n\nChange takes time, but I am pleased to share that we are now well-settled into these new ways of working and remain resolutely focused on fulfilling our customers' needs.\n\nTechnology is at the core of business transformation, but talent remains the driving force. In the new world of work, Wipro's commitment is to our clients' success, and to that of our employees, and the larger community.\n\nThierry Delaporte, CEO\n\n## Building a Bold Tomorrow - Our Strategy\n\nIn the pre-COVID-19 business landscape, companies were embarking on transformation programs to enhance agility, improve operational efficiency and optimize costs. The pandemic has served to accelerate this need. The time to change is now, and if your business does not, it will be left behind. This sentiment forms the precursor to our value proposition to the market: Wipro is a transformation partner you can trust.\n\nOur ability to deliver change is underpinned by three core components. The first is Technology , which is at the heart of all transformation. Next is Talent , which drives our technological engine. The third is Trust , without it a partnership cannot be expected to thrive.\n\nPartners who can challenge the status quo, ideate together, provide insight, innovate, and lead with flawless execution, will always deliver value over the longer term. This has led to both business, and providers, revaluating what is important from a service. Once it used to be about cost and efficiencies. Now, Speed and Agility matter more. The ability to disrupt oneself at speed will allow a company to separate itself from its competition and take a unique position in its market.\n\nWe know that industry growth will largely be led by next-generation technologies and services. We can therefore expect to see huge incremental growth in areas such as Digital, Cloud, Data, Engineering, Cybersecurity.\n\nCloud definitely is at the center of customer conversations, and is becoming not just the operating platform of choice but a fundamental part of Digital Transformation. The emergence of new work models such as work-from-anywhere or crowdsourcing, has meant that cybersecurity has become a top priority for businesses.\n\nFor long, Wipro has been helping customers navigate the full spectrum of IT transformation.\n\nOur customers appreciate our passion for innovation, our commitment to excellence in delivery, and that we are invested - and invest in - our customer's success.\n\nThat said, our ambition is to constantly raise the bar and be a true global leader of our industry. In order to realize this, we have made bold changes ourselves, challenge our existing areas of focus, our approach to growth, and our ability to deliver excellence across all markets, in all sectors, for all customers.\n\nWe are Building a Bolder Tomorrow for Wipro through our five-point strategy:\n\n- 1.   Accelerating  growth by prioritizing the sectors and markets we operate in. We are channeling our efforts and investments for maximum results, going deeper in areas we believe we have strengths in, while doubling down and scaling in those areas we are winning in, to secure a leadership position.\n- 2.  Strengthening clients and partnerships with strategic clients by investing in good talent and a focused structure that can shape and win larger transformational deals. We are also leveraging relationships with our strategic partners and using M&A as a key strategic enabler to accelerate growth.\n- 3.  Leading with business solutions that enhance our portfolio, resonate with our clients, and align with business and functional spend pools. We are developing and scaling these solutions by leveraging industry expertise, technology capability and ecosystem partnerships.\n- 4.  Building talent at scale. This will be the most critical factor for success. An ambitious program to scale talent across front-end, domain and technology areas are playing out at Wipro as we speak. I am also committed to building leadership diversity throughout our business, including most importantly, our leadership ranks. Industry-leading growth will only come from industry-leading plurality.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Simplifying our operating model will drive better customer-centricity, agility and empower our teams who are closest to the clients to make decisions without excessive oversight or controls. This is what we have done in the past year. Our new model fosters accountability and an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n## Business Performance in FY 2020-21\n\nA high-performance organization is a great asset. It builds and strengthens the foundation for sustained growth. Our IT Services revenues for the full year was $8.1 billion . Our revenue growth during the last two quarters of the year was 3.3% and 3.0% respectively, which on constant currency terms means they were the best quarters in terms of growth in the last decade! Despite a steep decline in the first quarter of the fiscal year, as the result of the pandemic, we bounced back to finish the year with only a marginal decline of 1.4% YoY.\n\nOur renewed focus on the market, and on customers, ensured that the total contract value of our order book in H2'21 grew by 33% YoY . This was a result of increased activity in the market, which I must say we have leveraged very well. A second factor in that trajectory were the closure of large deals. We closed 24 large deals in second half of the year, resulting in a Total Contract Value of $2.6 billion . This includes two mega deals, one in Europe, and one in the Americas market, each of which can lead to revenues of more than $ 1 billion over the deal duration.\n\nAs you can tell from our approach, mergers and acquisitions have been an integral part of our business strategy. In the second half of the financial year, we closed several acquisitions across several key markets, including the US, Europe, LATAM, Australia and India. These acquisitions have strengthened our local presence, and service offerings. Our largestever acquisition, CAPCO, for $1.45 billion is one that significantly strengthens our position in the global financial services market. This acquisition also allows us to onboard some exceptional domain experts and talent in that space.\n\nOur strategic M&As over the years have contributed towards the creation of a vibrant, new-age, and diverse community of talent around the world. Such talent, along with the new cadre of leadership that has joined the existing executive team, brings to Wipro the kind of leadership that is not typical for our industry historically. We will continue to build on this by recruiting local talent that is diverse in every way.\n\nWe are pleased with our rigor in execution, which has resulted in Operating Margins of 20.3% for the full year, and an expansion of 220 basis points in the financial year. Our operating metrics have shown consistent improvement, with utilization and offshoring being at its highest ever. I am pleased to share that we released salary increments and promotions, covering approximately 80% of our employee base, effective of January 1, 2021. We also had a robust operating cash flow generation\n\nof D 147.6 billion , which was at 136.7% of Net Income for the year. In addition, we ended the year with $3.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur pursuit of excellence will not be possible without the commitment, endeavor and spirit of each of our 200,000+ colleagues, especially so during a global pandemic.\n\n## Our commitment to our employees and communities\n\nOur pursuit of excellence will not be possible without the commitment, endeavor and spirit of each of our 200,000+ colleagues, and especially so during a global pandemic.\n\nNaturally, the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees has been, and always will be, of paramount importance to us. Right at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, we enabled our employees globally to work from home. Over the last few quarters, less than 3% of our employees have worked from Wipro offices. This was possible because of the understanding, empathy and generosity of our customer. We actively worked with our customers to reduce employee footprint in offices.\n\nIn many countries, but in India especially, the pandemic has caused immeasurable loss and suffering. It was our moral obligation to do everything we could possibly for our colleagues and their loved ones. We ramped up efforts on multiple fronts, but especially focused on oxygen provisioning, Covidtesting, providing end-to-end provisions such as ambulances, treatments and managing hospital admissions. We created Wipro-sponsored Covidisolation centers in various cities for our employees and their immediate family members. We also partnered with top-tier hospitals and a tech-enabled online-to-offline delivery platform specializing in primary care and urgent response services to provide COVID-19 vaccination support to our India-based employees. These may seem small gestures, but we must provide relief wherever possible. It has been a year of great hardship.\n\nI like to think there are positives to be drawn from the terrible situation we have found ourselves in. The displays of kindness, empathy, generosity, and perseverance that our entire Wipro family has demonstrated has made us stronger, more resilient, more caring and more agile than ever before.\n\nOf course, the responsibility we show for ourselves must extend to the world we live in. We have always taken pride in being a responsible global citizen one that engages with its key stakeholders to find solutions to the most pressing ecological and social issues of our time. Our business should not be detached from the evolving climate crisis. Wipro has long since built ecological sustainability practices into its operations and ways of working, often ahead of what has been considered necessary within our industry. We are running a program of deep decarbonization across our entire value chain, with the goal of reaching Net Zero emissions by 2040, with an intermediate target of reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions from our operations by 55%, by 2030.\n\nFor me personally, it has been a wonderful start to an exciting journey. I am thankful to our colleagues, clients, partners, board of directors, and other stakeholders who have provided incredible support, and trust. I am filled with optimism and energy for this new financial year, and I am confident of truly building a bolder tomorrow for our business, our customers and for the world around us.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThierry Delaporte",

During the pandemic, companies across the world accelerated their digital transformation initiatives to address these disruptions and secure their businesses. While some companies have now set up advanced business continuity measures, others have embarked on new innovative services and products. As companies focused on protecting employees from the pandemic, technology enabled a seamless transition to remote working by shifting to digital channels and digital customer engagement models. Various stay at home orders resulted in large scale adoption of models such as buy-online-pickupin-store in retail, tele-medicine and virtual care in healthcare, touchless experiences in finance and virtual solutions for online learning.\n\nAccording to the Strategic Review 2021 published by NASSCOM (the 'NASSCOM Report'), India's technology industry is forecasted to grow at 2.3% to reach approximately $194 billion in fiscal year 2021 (excluding e-commerce). According to the NASSCOM Report, exports are estimated to grow at 1.9% to reach approximately $150 billion in fiscal year 2021 and the domestic sector is forecasted to reach approximately $45 billion in fiscal year 2021, growing at 3.4%. According to the NASSCOM Report, the growth is driven by increased demand for digital transformation and infrastructure modernization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs per the NASSCOM Report, digital revenues account for 28-30% of total industry revenues for fiscal year 2021, growing at five times the overall services growth. Share of digital services in new contracts is up by 90% from fiscal year 2020, driven by cloud, collaboration and cybersecurity. The growth of cloud, artificial intelligence ('AI'), machine learning ('ML'), internet of things ('IoT'), analytics, automation and collaboration software were accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, led by remote working and transformation engagements for contactless activities and customer experience. It is expected that the IT services industry will move to hybrid work models, with implications on hiring, team structures, compliance and cybersecurity.\n\nGlobal IT service providers offer a range of end-to-end software development, digital services, IT business solutions, research and development services, technology infrastructure services, business process services, consulting and related support functions.\n\nThe conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve as new variants of the virus are emerging in some of our markets, leaving the recovery outlook varied and uncertain. Despite demand stability being high and ongoing largescale vaccination drives, economic outlook remains uncertain. However, companies will continue to invest in digital transformation to address new pandemicdriven consumer behaviors with the support of technology.",

We are focusing our efforts and our investments on maximum results, going deeper in areas that we believe we have strength and defocusing on others, and scaling up to secure leadership positions. Our new strategy will bring us closer to clients, drive greater agility and responsiveness and help us become the employer of choice.\n\n## Our vision is to:\n\n- \u2192 be a trusted partner to our clients in their transformation journey and enable them in achieving leadership in their respective industries\n- \u2192 deliver value to our clients as part of their transformation journey through sector focused 'Business Solutions', 'Digital' and 'Technology' capabilities, cutting edge innovation, leveraging our strategic partnerships and our world class talent\n\nWe aim to realize our vision through five key strategic priorities:\n\n## 1. Accelerate growth - focus and scale\n\nOur first priority is growth through focus on identified markets and sectors within markets, bringing the best of Wipro to our clients.\n\nOur choice of sectors in a market is being driven by both market attractiveness and by Wipro's competitive positioning and strengths. We have therefore prioritized specific sectors in certain markets, and we will build or sustain, as the case may be, our leadership position in those intersections.\n\nOur priority markets include the Americas, certain countries in Europe and APMEA. The Americas continues to be a large market and continues to be our key focus. We are also building a strong growth plan for Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n## 2. Strengthen clients and partnerships\n\nOur second strategic priority is to strengthen clients and partnerships through four levers:\n\n- \u2192 Global account executive model: We have global account executives, senior leaders representing Wipro for our key clients, who are enabled by a team of industry and technology specialists and delivery leaders and with strong decision-making capabilities including committing on investments, to grow these client accounts.\n- \u2192 Large deals expertise: The second lever where we are significantly boosting our capabilities is in large deal origination and signing. We have invested in a large deal expertise team consisting of deal principals, financial and commercial modelers, experienced consultants and program directors, to bring expertise in large deal creation, solutioning, structuring and supporting our SMUs in signing large deals.\n- \u2192 Strategic partnerships: We are committed to scale partnerships with our key alliances such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google Cloud Platform, ServiceNow, Salesforce, SAP and IBM. We have intensified our efforts to build dedicated 'Cloud Studios' and 'Centers of Excellence', talent, and our capability to take joint business solutions to our clients.\n- \u2192 Market and capability leadership through M&A and Wipro Ventures: We are focused on M&A as a key area to fast-track solutions and capability building in emerging areas and accelerating our access and presence in identified markets. With a strong post-merger integration focus, we are committed to driving synergies and effectively integrating acquisitions. In the last six months, we have doubled down our investments both organic and inorganic in order to deepen our presence in key markets and sectors. We closed acquisitions across several key markets, including the US, Europe,",

We closed two mega deals; one in Europe and one in the Americas market, each of which can lead to revenues of $1 billion+ over the deal duration.\n\n## 3. Lead with business solutions\n\nWe are focusing on multiplying our business solutions, and building a catalog of industry-specific solutions, relevant to our clients in their industries by leveraging industry expertise, technology capability and ecosystem partnerships. A few examples of solutions we have built for our clients include digital banking solutions, core modernization for a telecom company for faster 5G deployment, the Open Subsurface Data Universe platform (data and analytics platform in the upstream oil and gas sector) and warehouse management solution for consumer companies.\n\n## 4. Building talent at Scale\n\nClients need partners who will challenge old ways of working, bring forth new ideas and proactively drive change. We are investing in deep domain and technology expertise and market makers.  Our priorities include:\n\n- \u2192 Hiring talent in the front end, domain and technology areas. We are investing in consulting, transformation architects, and domain and in cutting-edge areas of technology such as AI, data sciences and engineering.\n\n- \u2192 Reskilling and building onsite and local scale in digital and next-generation capabilities. Our learning and talent transformation programs conform to the new ways of working, and are modelled on 'Anytime, Anywhere' learning, social learning, community learning and through mentoring networks and talent champions.\n- \u2192 Building leadership diversity to significantly improve gender and ethnic diversity in our leadership ranks.\n- \u2192 Driving a 'high-performance' culture.\n\nThere is now a new cadre of leadership that has joined the existing executive team, we have hired numerous regional leadership across markets and all key positions have been filled\n\n## 5. Simplified operating model\n\nAll of our strategic priorities will be executed through our simplified operating model. It is a two-axis model of SMUs and GBLs, supported by our business functions.\n\nFrom a client standpoint, our model ensures adequate sector- and domain-focus in our go-to-market and execution. This enables focused growth, combines global expertise with local geography-focus in building capabilities, and ensures dedicated sales presence led by proximity to clients.

        "page_content": "## Materiality Determination & Stakeholder Engagement\n\nAt Wipro, stakeholder engagement is an ongoing process. Stakeholders identification is based on attributes such as Impact, Influence, Interest, Legitimacy, Urgency and Diverse Perspective. These attributes help identify stakeholders across value chain that are important to business and necessitates meaningful engagement. Based on these attributes, we identified eight stakeholder groups - Employees, Customers, Investors, Suppliers, Education System, Communities & civil societies, Government and Policy Networks and The Young Citizen and Future Generation. We believe stakeholder inclusiveness is central to the materiality determination process and it is important to consider reasonable expectations and interests of stakeholders so as to provide a balanced view of the issues that emerge.\n\nMateriality determination for the organization is based on a comprehensive process that include an internal materiality determination and external benchmarking with peers and sustainability standards. A significant part of materiality determination stems from the organization's overall mission, values, commitments and competitive strategy as well as the impact of or on its economic performance. An internal perspective on risks as identified through organizational processes like risk assessment studies and audits or self-assessments using disclosure frameworks\n\nlike financial/sustainability reports, DJSI, CDP, etc. is considered. For external benchmarking, we conduct an extensive review of literature to identify issues considered as material and identified as risks by our business peers and also to understand expectations expressed in international standards and agreements like Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB). The issues are then prioritized based on multiple dimensions of risk, returns and relevance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 Refer to Summary of Stakeholder Engagement 2 Materiality Determination Exercise at https: //www.wipro.com/ content/dam/nexus/en/sustainability/sustainability\\_reports/wiprosustainability-report-2019-20.pdf",

        "page_content": "## Financial Capital\n\n## Results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020\n\n## Revenue\n\nOur revenue increased by 1.5%. Our IT Services segment revenue increased by 2.0%. The revenue of all SMUs, except for Americas 2, grew during the year, with growth led by Europe and APMEA. The growth in these SMUs was led by a surge in demand for IT services by our customers, a ramp up of our new deal wins and depreciation of the Indian Rupee against foreign currencies, including the Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar. The decline in revenues from Americas 2 was primarily due to reduction in revenue from the banking, financial services and insurance sector and manufacturing sector.\n\nRevenue of the IT Products segment declined by 34.1%, which was primarily due to our focus on providing IT products as a complement to our IT services offerings, rather than selling standalone IT products, as well as our change in strategy to focus on consulting and digital engagements with ISRE clients rather than SI engagements.\n\nRevenue of the ISRE segment increased by 12.1%, which was primarily due to improved execution of SI deals during the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n## Profitability\n\nIn absolute terms, cost of revenues decreased by 3.0%, primarily because of decrease in travel costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower subcontracting costs due to the Company's cost efficiency efforts. Improvement in key operational parameters and higher offshoring also contributed to this increase. This was partially offset by an increase in employee compensation due to the impact of salary increases and increase in headcount, and depreciation of the Indian Rupee against foreign currencies, including the Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar. As a result of the foregoing factors, our gross profit as a percentage of our total revenue increased by 316 basis points ('bps').\n\n## Selling and Marketing expenses\n\nOur selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 7.0% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 6.7% for the year ended March 31, 2021. In absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 3.5% primarily because of decrease in travel costs and marketing and brand building costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by an increase in depreciation, amortization and impairment, due to an impairment charge of H 2,418 million on certain intangibles assets recognized on acquisitions.\n\n## General and Administrative expenses\n\nOur general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 4.9% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 5.6% for the year ended March 31, 2021. In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses increased by 16.3%, primarily due to increase in communication cost, rates, taxes and insurance costs and contributions towards COVID-19, included under 'Others' in the year ended March 31, 2021. These increases have been partially offset by the decrease in travel costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020.\n\n## Finance expenses\n\nOur finance expenses decreased from H 7,328 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H 5,088 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. Reduction in exchange fluctuation expense due to repayment of foreign currency loans and reduction in interest rates during the year ended March 31, 2021, primarily resulted in lower finance expense.\n\n## Other Operating income\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, we recorded H (81) million towards change in fair value of the callable units upon partial achievement of cumulative business targets pertaining to the sale of our hosted data center services business.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, we recorded (a) H 992 million toward change in fair value of the",

As a result of the above, our results from operating activities as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) increased by 257 bps from 17.2% to 19.8%.\n\n## Finance and Other income\n\nOur finance and other income decreased from H 24,081 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H 20,912 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to decrease in interest income by H 3,322 million during the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020.\n\n## IT Services Financials\n\n| IT Services                         | FY2020   | FY2021   | ( '  in millions) YoY Change   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------|\n| Revenues 1                          | 593,798  | 605,815  | 2.0%                           |\n| Gross Profit                        | 178,794  | 197,404  | 10.4%                          |\n| Selling and Marketing expenses      | (42,418) | (40,985) | (3.4)%                         |\n| General and administrative expenses | (29,847) | (33,488) | 12.2%                          |\n| Other Operating Income              | 1,144    | (81)     | (107.1)%                       |\n| Operating Income 2                  | 107,673  | 122,850  | 14.1%                          |\n| As a Percentage of Revenue          |          |          |                                |\n| Gross Margin 3                      | 30.1%    | 32.6%    | 2.5%                           |\n| Selling and marketing expenses      | 7.1%     | 6.8%     | (0.4)%                         |\n| General and administrative expenses | 5.0%     | 5.5%     | 0.5%                           |\n| Operating Margin 3                  | 18.1%    | 20.3%    | 2.2%                           |\n\n## Income taxes\n\nOur income taxes increased by H 5,546 million from H 24,799 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H 30,345 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. Our effective tax rate has increased from 20.2% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 21.8% for the year ended March 31, 2021. This increase is primarily due to reduction in special economic zone tax benefits in India.\n\n## Profit attributable to non-controlling interest\n\nOur profit attributable to non-controlling interest has increased from H 495 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H 716 million for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our profit attributable to equity holders increased by H 10,728 million or 11.0%, from H 97,218 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H 107,946 million for the year ended March 31, 2021.",

In absolute terms, the segment results of our IT Services segment increased by 14.1%.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, we are focusing on various cost optimization initiatives, including:\n\n- 1. Re-skilling and re-deployment of our workforce from our existing pool of talent, and new hiring will be done only for business-critical reasons; and\n- 2. Optimization of costs relating to travel, facilities and other discretionary spends like marketing events\n\n## Performance against guidance\n\nHistorically, we have followed a practice of providing constant currency revenue guidance for our largest business segment, namely, IT Services in dollar terms. The guidance is provided at the release of every quarterly earnings when revenue outlook for the succeeding quarter is shared. The following table presents the performance of IT Services Revenue against outlook previously communicated for the eight quarters of FY 2021 and FY 2020.

        "page_content": "generated by operating activities is primarily due to decreased working capital requirements. This was partially offset by an increase in income tax payments during the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nCash generated from investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was H 7,739 million. The cash generated from sale of investments (net of purchases) amounted to H 16,808 million. Cash utilized for the payment for business acquisitions amounted to H 9,873 million. We purchased property, plant and equipment amounting to H 19,577 million which was primarily driven by the growth strategy of the Company.\n\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was H 128,840 million as against H 150,998 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This is primarily on account of outflow for an equity share buyback (including tax on buyback) amounting to H 116,644 million. Payment toward the dividend for the year ended March 31, 2021 amounted to H 5,459 million. This was partially offset by increased net inflow from loans and borrowings amounting to H 6,212 million. Dividends paid in the year ended March 31, 2021 represents interim (and final) dividend declared for the year ended March 31, 2021 amounting to H 1 per share.\n\nWe maintain a debt/borrowing level that we have established through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations, cash required for operations and investment plans. We continually monitor our funding requirements, and strategies are executed to maintain sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources, as needed.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, we have deferred certain indirect tax liabilities and payroll related tax liabilities in certain countries, which are payable over a period of twelve months pursuant to COVID-19 relief measures enacted by the governments of the respective countries. We do not anticipate any liquidity challenges in paying these liabilities, even if such COVID-19 relief measures are withdrawn.\n\nAs discussed above, cash generated from operations is our primary source of liquidity. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents along with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements as well as repayment obligations with respect to debt and borrowings. Our choices of sources of funding will be driven with the objective of maintaining an optimal capital structure.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had contractual commitments of H 7,490 million ($102.4 million) related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of software development facilities and H 15,411 million ($210.7 million) related to other purchase obligations. Plans to construct or expand our software development facilities are determined by our business requirements.\n\nWe will rely on funds generated from operations and external debt to fund potential acquisitions and shareholder returns. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, investments in liquid and shortterm mutual funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from our operations in the future will generally be sufficient to fund the growth aspirations, as applicable.\n\nWe completed our acquisition of CAPCO on April 29, 2021, and the payment of upfront cash consideration of H 108,760 million was funded through bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we transfer certain accounts receivables and net investment in finance lease (financial assets) to banks on a non-recourse basis. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 is not material.\n\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from uncertainties related to global economies and the markets that we target for our services, as well as uncertainties around COVID-19. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in Indian Rupees, U.S. Dollars, Pound Sterling, Euros, Saudi Riyal, Omani Riyal, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.\n\n## Shareholders Return\n\nWe have always strived to enhance shareholder value for our investors. The Company's policy has been to provide regular, stable and consistent distribution of return. There is no change in our philosophy on shareholder return.",

The cash dividend paid per equity share during the year ended March 31, 2021 was an interim dividend of H 1, and the Board recommended the adoption of the interim dividend of H 1 per equity share as the final dividend.\n\n## Buyback of equity shares\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, we concluded the buyback of 237,500,000 equity shares at a price of H 400 ($5.47) per equity share, as approved by the Board of Directors on October 13, 2020 and by our shareholders by resolution dated November 16, 2020 passed through postal ballot by electronic voting. This resulted in a total cash outflow of H 116,445 million ($1,592.1 million) including tax on buyback of H 21,445 ($293.2 million). As a result of the buyback, our share capital has reduced by H 475 million ($6.5 million).\n\n## Assessment of key risks Global economic and Geo\n\n## political risks\n\nWe derive approximately 59% of our IT Services segment revenue from the Americas (including the United States) and 27% of our IT Services segment revenue from Europe. Our business and financial performance is and will continue to be affected by economic conditions globally. Increased protectionism and the risk of global trade war, resulting in weaker global trade and economic activity could adversely affect our business. If the economy in the Americas or Europe continues to be volatile or uncertain or conditions in the global financial market deteriorate, pricing for our services may become less attractive and our clients located in these geographies may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly. Reduction in spending on IT services may lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability.\n\n## Taxation risks\n\nOur profits for the period earned from providing services at client premises outside India are subject to tax in the country where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the extent that the same income is subject to taxation in India. Currently, we benefit from certain tax incentives under Indian tax laws. These tax incentives include a tax holiday from payment of Indian corporate income taxes for our businesses operating from specially designated Special Economic Zones ('SEZs'). Changes to these incentives and other exemptions we receive due to government policies can impact our financial performance.\n\n## Wage pressure\n\nOur wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the U.S. and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive advantages. However, wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage and may negatively affect our profit margins. We have historically experienced significant competition for employees from large multinational companies that have established and continue to establish offshore operations in India, as well as from companies within India. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Once the effective date is notified by the GoI, we may also experience increased costs in future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as a result of the issuance of The Code on Social Security, 2020. Unless we are able to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees over the long term, wage increases may reduce our profit margins. Furthermore, any inability to increase the proportion of employees with less experience, or source talent from other low-cost locations, like Eastern Europe, China or Southeast Asia could also negatively affect our profits.",

Robust internal controls and scalable processes are imperative to manage the global scale of operations.

Individual risk limits are set accordingly.\n- \u2192   No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of March 31, 2021 or for revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n- \u2192   As per the policy, the total hedges shall be 45% to 100% of the next four quarters of inflows in addition to select long term contracts which are beyond one year in tenor. Our Hedge Book as on March 31, 2021 stood at $3.2 billion dollars.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\n- \u2192   Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities in India which are at least AA rated by Indian rating agencies.",

The increase in the Net income from C 97,218 million in FY 2020 to C 107,946 million in FY 2021 has resulted in improvement of Return on Networth.\n- 3 Our Free Cash flow is computed as operating cash flow less net capital expenditure. Our operating cash flow was higher due to improved collection and higher profit during the year ended 31 st March, 2021.\n- 4 Interest coverage ratio is computed as Operating profit by Interest expense. The increase in Operating profit from C 105,730 in FY2020 to C 123,053 in FY2021 and lower interest expense in FY2021 has resulted in improvement of the ratio.",

Adhering to the safety and government norms, where possible, mohalla classes were started with the help of community volunteers and the partner organizations; worksheets and books were distributed through schools when parents came to collect mid-day-meal supplies; WhatsApp groups/ community radio/ online classes etc. were explored.\n\nIn another program Sustainability Education , we introduced a new section to encourage students to take this opportunity to investigate the kind of stresses that are present in their respective village/town/city and understand how or what role the individuals and communities play in building a more resilient society. They were also encouraged to reflect on how this pandemic has changed for the better or for worse, the lives of people around them. Similarly, college students had to explore the three areas of Water, Waste, and Food through the lens of the pandemic and analyze the stresses created by it.\n\n## Wipro Science Education Fellowship Program in USA\n\nStarted in 2012, the Wipro Science Education Fellowship (SEF) is a two-year program designed to improve individual teacher practice, foster teacher leadership opportunities and create a district corps of teacher leaders supporting sustainable positive changes in science education.\n\n## Wipro Science Education Fellowship Program in UK\n\nStarted in 2019, we work with Kings College London (KCL) to offer UK's first Master's program in STEM education.

Through our projects we address the issues related to maternal and child health, adolescent health, nutrition, community hygiene and sanitation, preventive and curative care, health education & counselling. With the onslaught of COVID-19 pandemic, we recalibrated the work of our existing healthcare projects by integrating COVID-19 care along with the key primary healthcare interventions.\n\n## Disaster Rehabilitation\n\nStarting with the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, we have responded to several natural calamities wherein Wipro's employees have also risen to the occasion and played a sterling role. In past two years, we initiated disaster response projects for Cyclonic Storm Fani in 2019 and Amphan cyclone in 2020.

Providing them a platform to engage develops a sense of citizenship and larger responsibility towards society. Wipro employees are currently engaged with Wipro Cares either through volunteering or by way of monetary contributions or both. In FY 2021, 25,000 Wipro employees contributed monetarily.\n\n## Stories from our Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'It's been two months since I joined the ProjectOne initiative. I have had to speak to all sorts of people including family members of those who succumbed to the virus. It has been emotionally challenging for us as volunteers and those on the other side of the phone. Yet, personally I felt good to provide that moral support to patients and their family members. In my earlier organization too, I used to donate, be it money or clothes. But actually working 'on the field', even if remotely now, gives me another level of satisfaction. Going forward, I would like to do more. After being in IT for 15 years, I want to do something different and give back to society.'\n\n## Prasad Tanksali\n\n## International Chapters\n\nOur employees across the world participate in local community initiatives. Thousands of employees across six continents and 36 countries came together virtually to participate in the Spirit of Wipro (SoW) Run and contributed towards their local charities in FY21. In the US and Canada, through our various initiatives with First Book, over 60,000 books were donated, impacting more than 28,000 children from underserved communities. Other initiatives included tree plantation drive in UKI and Romania, coastal clean-up drive in Philippines, education for disadvantaged particularly children with disabilities\n\n\"I started volunteering when we were at the peak of the second wave. My most touching experience was with a senior citizen in Delhi, isolating in a room and we ended up chatting for almost half an hour. He was happy to have finally spoken to someone after days of being in quarantine. I have volunteered during the last lockdown to distribute food, but e-volunteering is new to me. Two takeaways from this experience are: 1) It might be just a phone call, but it makes a difference to people's lives. 2) There might not have been a face to the names, but nevertheless, there was a personal connect for those few minutes.\"\n\n## Sony Shetty\n\nin Singapore, South Africa and UKI and humanitarian and healthcare support against COVID-19 to the disadvantaged communities across the globe.\n\nIn addition, a global donation program was conducted for Wipro employees to support communities that are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. For each donation made by the employee, Wipro matched the contribution with 2:1. The program supported six organizations - First Book, Project HOPE, Save The Children, Food Banks Canada, Oxfam, Hunger Free America, across the globe.\n\nAround 500 employees contributed about 1,500 hours in helping Wipro Cares partners, distributing dry ration and hygiene kits, and organizing awareness and health camps. With introducing the concept of e-volunteering and other virtual volunteering initiatives, around 700 employees spent about 2,000 hours in helping Wipro. In the Wipro Cares-Project StepOne, Wiproites have been volunteering to support the Indian government's efforts in tele-screening COVID-19 patients using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).",

The scientific consensus is now very clear that the global temperature rise has to be kept below 1.5 degree Celsius from pre-industrial levels to avoid disastrous impacts of climate change driven events. Action on climate cannot be seen in isolation, but are closely intertwined with water scarcity, biodiversity loss and land use change, chemical and industrial pollution - and its impacts on humanity, especially the most vulnerable among us. Natural capital is a framework that attempts to take into account on how human activities impact the planet's ecosystem.\n\n## Wipro's approach to Natural Capital embraces the continuum of\n\nInitiatives 'within the organization' that focus on reducing the energy, water, waste and biodiversity footprint of our business operations; and\n\nEngaging on key external programs through a diverse set of partners on the issue of ecology\n\n## Governance\n\nOur sustainability governance is informed by our strategic choice to work across both dimensions business operations and with the larger community.

The goals and objectives\n\nare jointly set with inputs from across functions. The quarterly reviews are attended by the Chairman, CEO and Chief HR Officer apart from the Chief Sustainability Officer and Global Head of Operations. We benchmark our performance with our global peers through extensive disclosures as well as a system of rigorous internal and external audits.\n\n## Management Approach\n\nAt Wipro, we have identified Energy efficiency and Green House Gases (GHG) mitigation, Water efficiency and Responsible Water management, Pollution and Waste management, and Campus Biodiversity as our most material issues and have developed programs around them.\n\nOur Ecological Sustainability Policy, available at https://www.wipro.com/investors/corporategovernance/ forms the structural framework for our environmental programs and management systems. We have been following the guidelines of the ISO 14001 framework for nearly two decades now as one of the cornerstones of our Environmental Management System (EMS). 20 of our campus sites in India and 8 in Australia are certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) standard. Other campuses are benchmarked against the same standard as a part of our internal review/audit process. We were one of the early adopters of Green Building Design with 22 of our current buildings across campuses certified to the international LEED standard\n\n(Silver, Gold, and Platinum) during commissioning. We strive to maintain the same standards in the maintenance of our facilities.\n\nWe have been responding to Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Climate Change Investor and Supply Chain for over 10 years. In addition we apply the Natural Capital Protocol guidelines arrive at the valuation of our natural capital (NCV) which we publish in our annual Environmental Profit and Loss account. In 2020, we also signed up as one of the 9 founding members of the 'Transform to Net Zero' coalition. We are part of the advisory group of CII's Climate Change Council and the India Climate Collaborative. We also chair the Bengaluru chapter of the CII-GBC Greenco chapter.\n\nStrategic Partnerships are key to achieving our goals across the value chain. We work with renewable energy suppliers, energy efficient hardware manufacturers and service providers and other partners who help to reduce our overall GHG footprint including employee commute and business travel footprint.\n\n## Environmental Risks\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management and Sustainability functions at Wipro jointly oversee environmental and climate change related risk identification and mitigation. Impacts of extreme weather events, urban water stress, air pollution, waste management and their impacts on employee health and wellbeing are the most material issues we engaged with.\n\nIn 2020, we completed a comprehensive climate change risk assessment program, encompassing both physical and transitional risks, for our major operational locations across the globe, covering India (12 cities), China, Philippines, Germany, Romania, the UK and the US. This has been carried out for two scenarios (based on the IPCC defined RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) covering medium to long term (2030-2050) time frames. In both scenarios, we see increased probability of higher incidence of water stress, and heat waves across cities. Below are the list of cities and regions where we see an increase in frequency of climate change risks under RCP 4.5 scenario (increase of global temperatures between 1.1 to 2.6 degree Celsius relative to 1986-2005).",

We have committed to Net Zero goals by 2040, with absolute emissions reduction of 55% by 2030 with respect to the 2017 base year. These are aligned with the objectives of the Paris agreement to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius.\n\n## Climate change related impacts\n\nOur risk assessment exercise is undertaken at both the company level and at the asset level. A well-defined Business Continuity Policy prescribes principles to plan for climatic disruptions which could disrupt business objectives. The Corporate Business Continuity Team (CBCMT) governs and guides the standard risk assessment methodology at every location to identify risks which could potentially impact continuity of business and associated financial parameters like revenues and profitability as well as reputational and legal parameters. This group collaborates with various support groups in the organization to assess risks for human resources, facilities and IT infrastructure with identified impacts and their probability/ likelihood as well as the corresponding controls in place. A severity matrix of Low, Medium and High impacts is defined and an identified crisis management group is vested with the responsibility to respond, recover, resume, return and restore from these situations. The detailed climate modelling and impact assessment exercise will help in further calibrating our risk management program.\n\nThe following are our interim subsidiary goals till 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAchieve Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions level of 80,000 tons by 2030 from 2017 baseline\n\nEnergy Intensity in terms of EPI (Energy Performance Index)\n\nAchieve EPI of 125 KwH per sq. mt by 2025 from baseline of 181 in 2017 and maintain EPI thereafter\n\nGHG Emission Intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2) on Floor Area (FAR) basis\n\nAnnual reduction of 5 % in GHG intensity from 117 KgCo2 eq./ Sq.

As a first principle, we will defer carbon removal projects (offsets) to the net zero target year (2040). This is in line with the science based targets approach of not using offsets for value chain emissions. Over the next few months, we will evolve a detailed plan for the same.\n\n## Performance Against Goals\n\n## Absolute Emissions\n\nThe absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions (India) for FY 2021 has decreased by 29% from 137,930 tons to 97,348 tons. This is due to low occupancy and resultant lesser conditioned area (50% reduction) at our offices. The dashboard below provides a summary of our Global and India GHG emissions, including data centers. The figures are net emissions for all years, after considering zero emissions for renewable energy procured.\n\n|              | FY2018-19   | FY2019-20   | FY2020-21   |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Offices      | 113,082     | 135,537     | 84,140      |\n| Data centers | 4,208       | 2,458       | 13,207      |\n\n## Emissions Intensity\n\nOur India office space emissions intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2) is at 108 KgCo2 eq. per Sq. Mt. per annum, up by 24% from FY 2020 - for reasons mentioned in under 'Notes on FY21 emissions'. We are not publishing people based emissions intensity for this year due to the low occupancy of office space.\n\n## Energy Consumption\n\nThe overall energy consumption from Scope 1 and 2 boundaries (operational and financial control) is 661.5 million Mjoules, compared to 915.3 million Mjoules in the previous year, a decrease of 27.7%. The total energy consumption - electricity and diesel based backup power - for office spaces in India is 151.3 million units; after including the electricity consumption for leased spaces, our global electricity consumption is 174 million units. Data centers in India contribute another 22.9 million units.\n\nFor India operations, about 64.85 million units constitute renewable energy procured through independent PPAs (Power Purchase agreements) with private producers. Of this 60.7 million units is with green attributes (zero emissions). Another 13 million units is attributable to renewable resources for our downstream leased spaces. In total, the renewable energy footprint in our portfolio is 73.7 million units.\n\n## Office emissions\n\nThough the occupancy is low (average of 5%), the building air conditioning, lighting and allied electrical systems load use would not be proportional. From an assessment of three large campuses representing 35% of total campus area, we see that the conditioned area average was around 50%. Around 70% of the energy consumption for offices is from air conditioning system. Hence, the absolute energy consumption and emissions for buildings is not commensurate with low occupancy. We have also considered 50% of building area for calculating the area intensities.",

This is because while the conditioned area has reduced by half on an average, the energy consumption has reduced by 32% compared to the previous year for reasons mentioned earlier.\n\n## Scope 3 Emissions\n\nOur total scope 3 emissions for FY 2020-21 is 350,336 tons of Co2 eq, which accounts for 78% of our total footprint. Out of the 15 categories of scope 3 reporting as per the new GHG corporate value chain standard, we are currently reporting on all of the 8 categories applicable to us.\n\n## 18,055\n\nEmployee Commute\n\n13,538\n\nBusiness Travel\n\n140\n\nWaste\n\n53,937\n\nUpstream Fuel+Energy emissions\n\n## 215,830\n\nPurchased goods / services (including capital goods)\n\n## 12,606\n\nUpstream and Downstream Leased Assets\n\n## 36,230\n\nWork From Home emissions\n\n## 350,336\n\nTotal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTons (CO 2 eq.)\n\n*Purchased goods and services are based on material group and category spend for Tier 1 suppliers.

We aim to engage with top suppliers (contributing to 80% of impact) to arrive at the next level of detail in understanding emissions breakdown and planning mitigating actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Work From Home Emissions - Calculation Methodology\n\nDuring the reporting year, most of the employees in India and overseas worked from their places of residence. We have estimated the emissions due to WFH scenario for FY21, and have included in our Scope 3 emissions portfolio.\n\nThe methodology* is based on incremental energy consumption (electricity and natural gas) in a household in which members have transitioned to working from home, causing an increase in residential energy use. These are averages of select countries covered by various studies on remote work. The baseline energy consumption per household was derived based on IEA data of residential energy consumption by population of the country. We have considered the number of employees working from home across the following geographies - ANZ and APAC, EMEA; and LATAM & North America to calculate WFH emissions.\n\nThe total emissions due to WFH globally is estimated at 36,230 tons of Co2 eq, with the US contributing to 36% and India contributing to 23%. Though 80% of the employees are based in India, its contribution to emissions is less due to significant lower energy intensity per capita compared to other countries.",

The Global Energy command center aggregates Building Management System inputs on a common platform to optimize operational control and improve energy efficiency.\n\nSince 2007, we have been working on a server rationalization and virtualization program, through which we have decommissioned old physical servers and replaced the processing capacity with virtualization technology on fewer numbers of servers. As of March 2021, we have 13,133 virtual servers (10,155 in March 2020) running on 758 physical servers which contributes to an energy savings of approximately 57.9 million units in the reporting year. The savings showed an increase of 21% over the previous year.\n\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) provide highcapacity scalable infrastructure with On Demand\n\nprovisioning, High Availability and High Performance Computing environment. We have enabled 9,333 VDI's to end users across locations. Thin clients being used in one of our location, which consumes less energy (80% less) compared to Desktop, resulting in savings of 1.2 million units.\n\n## Procurement\n\nFor the reporting period of FY 2021, RE purchase contributed to approximately 73.7 million units or 42.6% of our total India energy consumption of which 12.9 million units are for downstream leased spaces. For details on green procurement in IT hardware and other categories, please see 'supplier section'.\n\n## Business Travel and Employee Commute\n\nDue to the pandemic, the business travel footprint was 11% and employee commute was 21% of the previous years footprint. This includes (i) travel by air, bus, train, local conveyance and hotel stays for the category of business travel and (ii) personal cars two wheelers, public transport and Wipro arranged transport for employee commute. As things return back to normalcy, we are looking to transition to low emission travel choices and policies.\n\nOver the past few years, we have taken steps to facilitate a shift towards improved access to public transport for employees (buses, commuter trains) and carpooling. Our carpooling initiative till the previous year had over 1 Lakh registered users across locations. In the reporting year, we had negligible car pooling trips due to majority of employees working from home as well as the requirements of COVID-19 appropriate behavior.\n\nWe are the first major Indian business to join EV100, a global initiative by The Climate Group , in our commitment to transition our global fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030.",

We are also collaborating on building capacity and advocacy platforms at the city level for integrated urban water management.\n\n## Freshwater recycling and efficiency\n\nFreshwater consumption has seen a drop of 47.5% from last year to 850 million litres. The recycled water generation was 407.5 million liters, with a recycling ratio of 32%. Due to the low average occupancy (6.5%) of our offices due to the pandemic, the per capita consumption of water is not comparable. The fresh water consumption has not seen a commensurate reduction for the same reasons as mentioned in energy consumption - use of higher amount of fresh water for HVAC systems of the conditioned spaces as well as lower efficiency and loading of recycling plants. Consequently, the freshwater area intensity at 1.094 KL per square meter has shown a marginal increase of 4.8% compared to the earlier year. We have achieved 12.5% reduction in absolute freshwater consumption from FY16 till the previous year FY20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Contribute to deeper understanding\n\nof systemic challenges of urban water in the major cities in India we operate from\n\n## Freshwater use-India Offices\n\n## Freshwater (KL)\n\n| FY2020-21        | 850,151          |    |\n|------------------|------------------|----|\n| FY2019-20        | 1,621,501        |    |\n| FY 2018-19       | 1,518,934        |    |\n| Area Intensity   | Area Intensity   |    |\n| FY2020-21        | 1.094            |    |\n| FY2019-20        | 1.044            |    |\n| FY 2018-19       | 0.957            |    |\n| People Intensity | People Intensity |    |\n| FY2020-21        | 6.854            |    |\n| FY2019-20        | 0.930            |    |\n| FY 2018-19       | 0.951            |    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Water purchased from private sources is primarily extracted from ground water. Ground water contributes to nearly 46% of our total freshwater consumption across cities in India. Our urban/ peri-urban facilities located in three states Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, are located in water stressed basins. The water supplied by the municipal bodies is sourced primarily from river or lake systems.

We bring together hydrogeologists, academia, government, citizen groups for a nuanced understanding of issues Catalyzing citizen action on the ground.\n\nWe are continuing our work in Bengaluru by catalyzing more on-the-ground engagements across city on rain-water harvesting. This is backed up by targeted advocacy work through case studies, engagement with the city utility administrators and development of national guidelines. The program will also monitor and estimate the groundwater (shallow aquifer) potential for city, and recommend suggested practices for better management and integration with utility supply. In Pune , we are building a first of its kind city level data, interpretation and decision support platform for ground water management. This will closely work with citizen groups as well as the municipal authority to build appropriate capacities and catalyze on-ground interventions.\n\nIn Chennai , through the small grants program we are supporting three community based interventions on water. In Hyderabad, we are putting together a knowledge repository of water in the city - consumption, sources, water bodies, built infrastructure and impacts on water flows. It will also aim to create a network of communities, water practitioners , curate workshops/exhibits and support on ground interventions.\n\n## Collaborative advocacy on sustainability\n\nWe are actively engaged in several forums that advance advocacy on climate change and other related environmental impacts. Examples include the 'Transform to Net Zero Coalition', the World Economic Forum's Climate Change working group, 'Business for Nature' coalition, 'CII Greenco' and 'India Climate Collaborative'.\n\nA specific city-level initiative we convened is the 'Bengaluru Sustainability Forum'.",

Managing these 'commons' in an urban context requires business organizations to look beyond its own boundaries and adopt an integrated approach.\n\nOur waste management goals are: 1: 100% of organic waste generated from business operations is recycled for effective reuse. 2: To ensure by 2025 more than 98% of other categories of waste is recycled as per appropriate national standards with less than 2% reaching landfill (excluding construction and demolition waste).\n\nOur waste management strategy includes:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegular monitoring of air, water and noise pollution to ensure they are well within regulatory and industry norms\n\nReducing materials impact on the environment through recycling and reuse\n\nArranging for safe disposal of waste that goes outside our organizational boundaries. To operationalize our strategy, we segregate and monitor waste processing across 13 broad categories and nearly 40 sub categories\n\nThe summary of our performance on solid waste management (SWM) is as follows:\n\n- \u2192 90% of organic waste is recycled in house and the balance sent as animal feed outside the campus.\n- \u2192 Close to 100% of the inorganic waste is recycled through approved partners.\n\n- \u2192 52% of the total mixed solid waste and scrap is currently recycled and the rest sent to landfills. Our target is to improve this to 80% by 2023.\n- \u2192 Biomedical and hazardous waste is incinerated as per approved methods.\n- \u2192 All our E-waste is currently recycled by approved vendors.\n\nOther elements: We monitor diesel generator stack emissions (NOX, SOX and SPM), indoor air quality (CO,Co2, VOC's, RSPM), treated water quality and ambient noise levels across 25 key locations every month. All of these meet the specified regulatory norms.\n\nTotal waste disposed during FY 2021 was 2,087 tons - a reduction of 58% compared to the previous year. This is primarily due to lower occupancy in our campuses due to the pandemic. For the reporting year our effective safe disposal percentage was 96%.\n\n## Urban Biodiversity\n\nThe twin primary aims of our campus urban biodiversity program have been to convert our existing campuses to biodiversity zones and to develop them as platforms for wider education and advocacy, both within our organization and outside.\n\nOur biodiversity projects integrate multiple benefits of water conservation, ambient temperature reduction, air pollution mitigation and employee engagement. In this regard, we have drafted a set of biodiversity management guidelines for adoption across our campuses.",

This year due to the pandemic, all the outreach activities were online. In the year, we hosted a reading and discussion series on the UN sustainable goals, called 'Reading for change'. It curated conversations with authors of six leading books related to health (pandemic), gender equality, quality education, sustainable cities, clean energy and reduced inequalities.\n\nWe also hosted a 'Climate Conversations' series in partnership with the Bangalore International Center and a workshop on the food economy of Bengaluru in association with Science Gallery, Bengaluru. We are also working on a series of podcasts on various urban sustainability dimensions.\n\n## Wipro's Natural Capital Valuation Program\n\nNatural capital valuation is a rigorous framework that assesses and quantified impacts - positive and negative - on nature or natural capital on account of a company's operations and value chain. Natural Capital Impacts are calculated across six key performance indicators (KPIs) namely, GHG emissions, air pollution, water consumption, water and land pollution, waste generation and land use change. The methodology\n\nuses a value for the social cost of carbon that varies by country and geography - typically, it uses a higher discount rate for developing countries as compared to developed countries.\n\nFor calculating impacts due to air pollution only human health Impacts were considered as they contribute to 95% of total impact from air pollution. Land use valuation was based on net change in economic value due to loss of ecosystem service and was calculated only for the electricity procured from the grid mix, since for the direct operations, land use change is not considered to be material. For calculating impact due to water consumption, the following factors were taken into consideration - impact on human health, incidence of infectious disease and impact of energy consumption.\n\nIn FY2021, the total environmental costs related to Wipro's operations and supply chain were quantified at $0.20 billion ($0.23 billion in FY20), of which operational and supply chain impacts contribute 8% ($16.3 million) and 92% ($187 million) respectively. Of the operational impacts, the highest contribution is from electricity consumption at 80% ($12.8 million). Within Wipro's upstream supply chain, purchased goods and services across all tiers of suppliers (88%; $161 million) and fuel and energy related activities (12%; $22 million) are the top two impact categories. In terms of the sources of impact, air pollution (57%; $117.6 million), greenhouse gas emissions (30%; $60 million) are the top two contributors.\n\nPune Biodiversity Project 10 thematic gardens\n\n250+ species of native plants",

Our focus now is to create hybrid ways of working to ensure employee wellbeing as well as business continuity.\n\n## Culture Transformation and Inclusion & Diversity\n\n## Culture / Values\n\nSince our founding in 1945, Wipro has been driven by the belief that purpose fuels business and vice versa. Our Founder Chairman Azim Premji led the way for Wipro being an organization known for its moral compass and an unflinching commitment to values. This has helped us foster a more inclusive workplace for employees, vendors and clients alike. While our company has transformed many times over the years, the Spirit of Wipro, our core values, has remained constant. Chairman Rishad Premji, introduced the Five Habits essential to drive a Growth Mindset in early 2020, which are our values in action. The Five Habits are more relevant than ever before in light of the\n\nongoing pandemic as it asks each of us to be reflective, supportive, and collaborative. So far, over 21,000 leaders globally have been part of 75 immersive and interactive sessions on the Five Habits. The Five Habits can transform how we all experience Wipro as each Wiproite is a visible example of the organization culture.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity (I&D)\n\nInclusion and Diversity remains at the core of Wipro. We are committed to creating and nurturing a sense of belonging through equitable practices and by embracing all forms of differences. We renewed our I&D strategy and rearticulated our I&D policy. While we continue to have a structured approach for Gender, Disability, LGBTQ+, Race and Ethnicity inclusion, our journey involves embracing other forms of diversities including generational/ nationality/ supplier diversity, among others. We remain focused on encouraging plurality of ideas and elimination of unconscious bias. The I&D council was constituted in 2018 continues to provide direction and strategic guidance to the charter. The council is sponsored by the CEO and chaired by the Global I&D Head and consists of diverse leaders across businesses. Further, Business Unit and geography specific I&D councils drive the organizational and unit charter, led by a senior business leader from the unit or geography. They are supported by a network of Inclusion Champs.\n\n## People Processes: Key Highlights FY 2020-21\n\n## Hiring and Onboarding\n\nAs part of our Digitalization initiatives, we had invested in transforming our hiring and on-boarding processes for a more seamless and automated experience. These initiatives helped us navigate the pandemic effectively. Our entire hiring process was touchless and remote. We organized virtual walk-ins and leveraged digital technologies to connect and engage with candidates. Post selection, the offer roll-out process, document\n\ncollection and verification as well as onboarding were done remotely. New employees were onboarded via virtual sessions. They were enabled to be productive from the first day as we provided them with the necessary infrastructure in a work from home situation. Our strategy of localization continued to gain momentum with an increased number of local candidates in all the geographies that we operate in.",

Our talent differentiation is sharp and is based on outcomes. Rewards are closely linked to performance outcomes. Career growth is based on sustained high performance. We believe values and performance must go hand in hand. Our quarterly review process continues to be a strong platform to encourage candid, constructive and meaningful feedforward discussions between employees and managers. Our performance management system leverages Artificial Intelligence to aid employees and managers in writing effective reviews thereby nudging and training them while they submit reviews quarter on quarter. There is an annual 360-degree feedback survey where employees in middle and senior level roles receive feedback from their teams, peers, internal customers, managers, external customers. At Wipro, succession planning is an annual exercise. Talent is classified in terms of performance and potential; successors are identified for critical roles and development actions are framed. Executive coaching is provided to senior leadership to facilitate their all-round development. Career building is an important pillar of our employee value proposition and in line with that the promotion and rotation policies have been strengthened to ensure more employees can take up internal roles and build a career that they aspire for.\n\n## Learning and Development\n\nWe continue to make significant investments in our learning & development function towards building a resilient organization, focused on business imperatives in the new normal. Our comprehensive efforts in digitalizing offerings and completely moving our curriculum online, have enabled employees to effectively manage the transition to a virtual work environment. We have been able to engage employees, ensure their wellbeing and cater to diverse learner needs through Virtual Instructor Led Trainings (VILTs), self-paced modules, virtual learning journeys, social learning, virtual mentoring, gamified interventions and e-summits. With the change in the ways of working due to COVID-19, we created six e-learning modules on Work From Home (WFH) readiness, work etiquette, managing stress in times of crisis, staying positive in trying times, leading in a crisis situation and empathy in difficult times.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our key focus areas to enhance the physical wellbeing of our employees are Health and Safety Risk Assessment, all round safety and security measures, including training and sensitization to meet the standard competence required by law in performing one's duties. All campuses maintain a conducive work environment in line with Indian/International standards. A Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license is mandatory for vendors operating within Wipro owned locations in India. All our facilities have safety committees, which meet quarterly and participate in risk assessments, safety inspections, incident investigations and hygiene audits. During 202021, more than 8,400 permanent and contract employees, were part of awareness camps and programmes. Awareness sessions were also conducted regarding off-the-job safety and road safety. More than 8,000 permanent and contract employees participated in committees on safety, food, transport, etc. across India, to represent the interests of the workforce.\n\n## COVID-19- Business Continuity Process\n\nThe exceptional circumstances around COVID-19 have brought to light emerging risks and have made previously identified risks more critical. We identified business critical functions, equipment and employees, and also determined how, where and by whom critical services would be provided. We suspended non-essential work to reduce risk of exposure to the virus and maintained social distancing norms. We carefully monitored employee availability, health and safety. Business continuity plans were put in place to maintain seamless operations. We analyzed and assessed supply chains to identify risks which exist in our operations. Wipro also mobilized infrastructure to support remote working, to ensure employees have the necessary hardware, software, equipment and internet connectivity to work safely and efficiently from home. A real time communication plan was put in place to keep employees updated at all times.\n\n## Emotional Wellbeing\n\nIn the new normal, to ensure the emotional and mental wellbeing of our employees, we have partnered with leading global EAP providers across the globe. It enables employees to reach out to counsellors 24x7 in-person and/or on phone to seek assistance for issues pertaining to personal or professional life. We conducted multiple sessions across geographies on topics including COVID-19, Work from Home and Emotional Wellbeing to enable employees cope with the new ways of working and remain emotionally strong.

Our employees are represented by formal employee representative groups in certain geographies including Continental Europe and Latin America which constitute 2.3% of our workforce with a further 1.6% under collective bargaining agreements. Our HR representatives ensure legislative awareness and compliance and meet these groups periodically to inform and consult on any change that can impact their terms and conditions / work environment.\n\n## Risk Identification Process\n\nWe have established committees and processes like the Ombuds, Prevention of Sexual Harassment Committee, Employee Experience Survey, Audit/ Risk & Compliance committees, EHS, an Inclusion & Diversity Council and Culture council to review progress and formulate strategies to address issues pertaining to compliance, safety and a harassmentfree workplace. These processes are periodically reviewed by the top management. We keep our employees informed about these processes regularly through trainings, mailers and internal social media platforms. We have identified the need for a continuing Human Rights due diligence program, which we plan to carry out when the pandemic situation stabilizes. Also, a detailed due diligence is done before each merger or acquisition which outlines compliance and governance risks.\n\n## Identified Risks\n\nThrough various projects, audits and feedback we have identified the following as potential risks to Human Rights:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Returning mothers\n- Benefits and engagement of extended/ contract workforce\n- Unconscious bias at the workplace",

The key elements include building manager awareness of unconscious bias and effective handling of women employees post return from Maternity Leave. A governance committee to oversee the program deployment and settling in of returning mothers and an ecosystem enablement through policy, process and system interventions have been also suggested.\n\n## Contract Employee Engagement\n\nWe engage contract employees for supporting our projects in India for short-term assignments. The duration of such engagements varies depending upon the project and the role. We ensured insurance coverage for these employees during the COVID-19 pandemic along with complete compliance on processes like internal mandatory trainings (i.e. Information Security, Data Privacy, and Prevention of Sexual Harassment, among others) as well as background verification. The resignation portal for contract employees has been modified to include asset declaration. Processes like reimbursement and invoicing have been digitalized to provide contract employees with a faster and more seamless experience.\n\n## Sensitization on Unconscious Bias\n\nUnder the umbrella of our #BreaktheBias campaign, we have monthly leadership blogs, mailers and a mandatory e-learning module to raise awareness among employees on how they can eliminate biases at the workplace. At present, over 164,000 employees have undertaken the Unconscious Bias E-module and received certification.\n\n## Initiatives to support our employees\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic in mid-March last year, we enabled Wiproites globally to Work From Home. Currently, less than 2% of our employees are working from Wipro offices. We are taking additional actions to protect and provide support to our employees and their immediate family members. Some of our key initiatives to support our employees are:\n\n## COVID-19 Isolation Care Centers\n\nCreated COVID-19 Isolation Care Centers for our employees and their immediate family members across locations\n\n## Medical Support\n\nPartnered with major hospitals across India to ensure critically ill employees can access the best medical facilities facilitated through a 24/7 helpline\n\n## Wellness platform\n\nPartnered with a tech-enabled online-to-offline delivery platform specializing in primary care and urgent response services\n\n## Vaccination Support\n\nProviding free vaccines to employees and their immediate family members\n\n## COVID-19 safety webinar series\n\nOrganized a series of webinars on COVID-19 safety, vaccination, recovery, and more\n\n## COVID-19 Support Communication\n\nContinued to share critical updates with employees regularly through multiple channels. COVID-19 support emergency helpdesk numbers were shared with employees via mailers and SMS for further reinforcement",

Your  Company  has  been  involved  with  social initiatives for more than a decade and half and engages in various activities in the field of education, healthcare and communities, ecology and environment, etc.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, a company meeting the specified criteria shall spend at least 2% of its average net profits for three immediately preceding financial years  towards  CSR  activities.  Accordingly,  your  Company spent ' 2,512  million  towards  CSR  activities  during  the financial year 2020-21.\n\nIn  April  2020,  your  Company  committed ' 1,000  million towards tackling the unprecedented health and humanitarian crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and out of that an amount of ' 868 million was spent. Your Company's Covid  response  involved  working  closely  with  around  100 non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  who  were  engaged directly on the ground in supporting affected communities. In  the  early  stages  of  the  pandemic  (March-June),  your Company's response was focused on humanitarian relief in cities that were severely affected and where it has significant operational  presence-Bengaluru,  Chennai,  NCR,  Mumbai, Kolkata  and  Hyderabad.  In  parallel,  your  Company  along with Azim Premji Foundation developed and implemented a strategic response to the COVID-19 healthcare challenge that extended for most of the year. The response addressed in-depth  the  entire  spectrum  of  issues  from  awareness creation to testing, isolation and hospital care.\n\nThere  were  three  innovative  projects  your  Company conceptualized  and  executed  directly.  These  were:  (i)  the preparation  and  distribution  of  nearly  3  million  cooked meals to more than 2.5 lakh people from the Wipro canteens in  Bengaluru,  Pune  and  Kolkata,  (ii)  Converting  its  Pune IT  facility  to  a  fully  equipped  and  staffed  450  bed  Covid hospital. The hospital has established a solid reputation with the  surrounding  communities  and  has  seen  nearly  5,500 admissions till date and (iii) Designing and running a digital platform for doctors and healthcare experts to exchange and\n\ncollaborate on emerging good practices in Covid care- the Global  Coalition  for  COVID-19  Medical  Care  (GCCMC).  The platform has been very active with a number of webinars and interactive sessions organized on COVID-19 control and vaccination.\n\nAlong  with  the  integrated  Covid  response,  your  Company also continued to focus and support its regular programs in Education, Urban Ecology, Primary Health Care and Disaster Response.  Your  Company's  partner  network  comprising nearly 200 committed organizations from across the country adapted very well to the changing dynamics on the ground and ensured continuity of work through a hybrid model that combined online intervention with some field work.\n\nThe  contents  of  the  CSR  policy  and  revised  format  of CSR  Report  notified  in  the  Companies  (Corporate  Social Responsibility Policy) Amendment  Rules,  2021  dated January 22, 2021, is attached as Annexure V to this report.

The aggregate increase in salary for WTDs and other KMPs was 95.78% in fiscal 2021 over fiscal 2020, on account of the following:\n- a. For the fiscal 2021, Mr. Rishad A. Premji was paid commission as per the terms approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in July 2019. The profit linked commission payable to him for fiscal 2020 was foregone by him to show solidarity with the team in facing the situation caused by COVID-19.\n- b. The compensation disclosed for Mr. Thierry Delaporte is for the period from July 6, 2020 to March 31, 2021. It includes components such as an one-time cash award, annual stock grant (1,200,000 ADS restricted stock units, comprising of 300,000 ADS restricted stock units and 900,000 ADS performance stock units and one-time grant of 300,000 ADS restricted stock units), which will vest over a period of time, among other things, as per the terms approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in July 2020.\n- c. Computation of remuneration to Mr. Jatin Pravinchandra Dalal is on an accrual basis and it includes the amortization of Restricted Stock Units (RSU), granted to him, which will vest over a period of time. This also includes RSUs that will vest based on performance parameters of the Company.\n- 5. The Company affirms that the remuneration is paid as per the remuneration policy of the Company.\n\n## Variable Pay Compensation\n\nThe variable pay of executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, is based on clearly laid out criteria and measures, which are linked to the desired performance and business objectives of the organization. The criteria for variable pay, which is paid out quarterly/annually, includes financial parameters like revenue, profit achievement, operating margin achievement and other strategic goals as decided by the Board from time to time.\n\nApart from the variable pay component, long term (typically greater than one year) incentives granted to executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, includes both time-based stock units (RSUs) and performancebased stock units (PSUs).\n\nThe vesting of PSU's is based on performance parameters of the Company over a defined performance period and is linked to pre-defined financial goals. Time-based stock units typically vest over a defined period. The vesting pattern and schedule for both these types of stock units are as determined by the Board Governance, Nomination and Compensation Committee.",

As  a  first  principle,  we  constantly  strengthen  the alignment  of  our  core  business  purpose  with  salient ESG  goals  in  the  areas  of  Energy,  Climate  Change, Water,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  at  the  workplace  and Health and Well-Being of employees. All of this is based on  the  bedrock  foundation  of  good  governance  and ethical conduct. During the year, we made a significant commitment  to  transforming  to  a  Net  Zero  Company by  2040.  Our  targets  of  net  zero  greenhouse  gas emissions are based on the globally accepted Science Based Targets Initiative.  Our  approach  prioritizes  deep decarbonization of our own operations and value chain while deferring offsets till 2040. This is in line with our core values and we believe we are well positioned to meet our commitments.\n- ii. In  the  larger  social  sphere,  our  primary  areas  of  work are in Education, Urban Ecology, Primary Health Care, Disaster  Response  and  Public  Spaces  in  cities.  A common  strand  running  across  our  social  initiatives is a deliberative focus on inclusion and empowerment of  disadvantaged  communities.  Our  emphasis  is  on deep, meaningful, long-term work implemented by our carefully  identified  network  of  nearly  200  partners  in India  and  all  the  major  overseas  geographies  we  are present in US, Europe, LATAM and APAC.\n\nThe  year  2020  threw  up  the  biggest  challenge  humanity has faced for a long time, the Covid-19 pandemic. From the very beginning, it was clear to us that our response had to be commensurate with the severity and scale of the crisis. Together with Azim Premji Foundation and Wipro Enterprises Private  Limited,  we  committed ' 11,250  Mn  of  which  our contribution was ' 1,000 Mn. For more than 12 months now, we have been engaged deeply in crafting and executing an integrated response that addresses the deeply intertwined humanitarian  and  healthcare  aspects  of  the  problem.  We recognize  that  the  pandemic  and  its  after-effects  is  going to be with us for some time. Keeping this in mind, we have ensured  that  a  significant  part  of  our  support  is  towards strengthening  and  augmenting  the  capacity  of  the  public health  system  in  India,  especially  in  some  of  the  most underserved areas. Of the several initiatives we supported, there were two outstanding projects that represent our ability to respond with agility and innovatively: (a) the first involved leveraging the canteen infrastructure in our Bengaluru, Pune and Kolkata facilities to deliver nearly 3 Mn cooked meals to vulnerable communities in distress and (b) the second project conceptualised and executed the converting of our Pune campus to a full-fledged 450 bed Covid hospital that has seen nearly 5,500 patients treated till now.\n\nWe would like to highlight the fact that our Covid response and investments were in addition to the regular CSR work, which we continued to support to the fullest extent. Our partners adopted  a  hybrid  model  of  online  and  field  work  over  the course of the year adapting dynamically to the situation on the ground. For example, our healthcare partners combined primary healthcare with essential frontline Covid work.\n\nYou  will  find  a  comprehensive  articulation  of  our  work  in the  Annual  Report,  which  is  based  on  the  International Integrated Reporting framework of how value is created on both, financial and non-financial capitals and how they feed and reinforce each other.",

WIPRO'S PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nWipro's governance framework is driven by the objective of  enhancing  long  term  stakeholder  value  without compromising  on  ethical  standards  and  corporate social  responsibilities.  Efficient  corporate  governance requires  a  clear  understanding  of  the  respective roles of the Board of Directors (' Board ') and of senior management and their relationships with others in the\n\ncorporate structure. Sincerity, fairness, good citizenship and commitment to compliance are key characteristics that  drive  relationships  of  the  Board  and  senior management with other stakeholders.\n\nCorporate governance philosophy of Wipro flows from the 'Spirit of Wipro' which represents core values by which  policies  and  practices  of  the  organization  are guided. The values encapsulated in the 'Spirit of Wipro' are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile our Company has transformed many times over the years, the Spirit of Wipro and our core values, have remained constant.\n\nOur Chairman introduced the Five Habits essential to drive  a  Growth  Mindset  in  early  2020,  which  are  our values in action:\n\n- \u00b7 Being respectful\n- \u00b7 Being responsive\n- \u00b7 Always communicating\n- \u00b7 Demonstrating stewardship\n- \u00b7 Building trust\n\nSo far, over 21,000 employees globally have been part of 75 immersive and interactive sessions hosted by our senior leadership team on the Five Habits.\n\nCorporate governance at Wipro is implemented through robust  board  governance  processes,  internal  control systems and processes, and strong audit mechanisms. These are articulated through the Company's Code of Business  Conduct,  Corporate  Governance  Guidelines and charters of various sub-committees of the Board and the Company's Disclosure Policy. Wipro's corporate governance  practices  can  be  described  through  the following four layers:\n\n- a) Governance by Shareholders\n- b) Governance by Board of Directors\n- c) Governance by Sub-committees of Board, and\n- d) Governance through management process\n\nIn  this  report,  we  have  provided  details  on  how  the corporate governance principles are put in to practice within Wipro.\n\n## II. SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe  Companies  Act,  2013,  Securities  and  Exchange Board  of  India  (Listing  Obligations  and  Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ( 'Listing Regulations' ) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Listed Company Manual  prescribe  the  governance  mechanism  by shareholders in terms of passing of ordinary and special resolutions, voting rights, participation in the corporate actions  such  as  bonus  issue,  buyback  of  shares, declaration  of  dividend,  etc.  Your  Company  follows  a robust process to ensure that the shareholders of the Company are well informed of Board decisions both on financial and non-financial matters and adequate notice with a detailed explanation is sent to the shareholders well in advance to obtain necessary approvals.\n\n## III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n## 1. Composition of Board\n\nAs  at  March  31,  2021,  our  Board  had  two  Executive Directors,  six  non-executive  Independent  Directors and one non-executive non-independent Director.

The  Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  and Managing  Director  is  a  professional  CEO  who  is responsible  for  the  day  to  day  operations  of  the Company.  Of  the  seven  Non-Executive  Directors,  six are Independent Directors, free from any business or other relationship that could materially influence their judgment. In the opinion of the Board, all the Independent Directors  are  independent  of  the  management  and satisfy  the  criteria  of  independence  as  defined  under the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations and the NYSE Listed Company manual.",

Code of Business Conduct\n\nIn the year 1983, we articulated 'Wipro Beliefs' consisting of six statements. At the core of beliefs was integrity, articulated  as  'individual  and  company  relationship should be governed by the highest standard of conduct and integrity'.\n\nOver  years,  this  articulation  has  evolved  in  form  but remained constant in substance. Today, we articulate it as Code of Business Conduct.\n\nIn  our  Company,  the  Board  and  all  employees  have a  responsibility  to  understand  and  follow  the  Code of  Business  Conduct.  All  employees  are  expected  to perform their  work  with  honesty  and  integrity.  Wipro's Code of Business Conduct reflects general principles to guide employees in making ethical decisions. This Code is  also  applicable  to  our  representatives.  This  Code outlines  fundamental  ethical  considerations  as  well as specific considerations that need to be maintained for professional conduct. This Code has been displayed on the Company's website at https://www.wipro.com/ investors/corporate-governance/.\n\n## 2. Internal Audit\n\nThe Company has a robust internal audit function which has been in place for last 4 decades with the stated vision of 'To be the best in class Internal Audit function globally'. In pursuit of this vision, the function provides an independent, objective assurance services to valueadd  and  improve  Operations  of  Business  Units  and processes by:\n\n- a)  Financial, Business Process and Compliance Audit\n- b)  Cyber Defense and Technology Audit\n- c) Operations Reviews\n- d)  Best Practices and Benchmarking\n- e) Leadership Development\n\nThe function taking cognizance of changes in business climate and technology risks has taken upon itself to infuse and adopt Technology in its operations.\n\nThe  Chief  of  Internal  Audit  reports  to  the  Chairman of  the  Audit,  Risk  and  Compliance  Committee  and administratively to the Chief Financial Officer. Chief of Internal Audit has regular and exclusive meetings with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe internal audit function is guided by its charter, as approved by the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee. The internal audit function formulates an annual risk based  audit  plan  based  on  consultations  and  inputs from  the  Board  and  business  leaders  and  presents it  to  the  Audit,  Risk  and  Compliance  Committee  for approval. Findings of various audits carried out during the financial year are also periodically presented to the Audit,  Risk  and  Compliance  Committee.  The  internal audit function adopts a risk based audit approach and covers core areas such as compliance audits, financial audits, technology audits, third party risk audits, M&A audits, etc.\n\nThe internal audit team comprises of personnel with professional  qualifications  and  certifications  in  audit and is rich on diversity. The audit team hones its skills through a robust knowledge management program to continuously  assimilate  the  latest  trends  and  skills in the domain and to retain the knowledge gained for future reference and dissemination. The internal audit team re-asserts its independence across all its staff.\n\nA key strategic vision of Internal Audit is auditing in the new digital environment 'Auditing Digital and Auditing with Digital'- in line with this, the Internal Audit function has actively adopted Technology and Innovation to be better equipped to carry out audits.\n\nThe function, which was the first Indian Internal audit unit to get ISO certified in 1998 and win International award from Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) in 2002, was  also  an  early  adopter  of  the  new  ISO  9001:2015 Version.  During  the  year  Internal  Audit  function  is assessed  to  have  'Met  International  Standards' prescribed  by  the  Professional  Practice  of  Internal Auditing  issued  by  'International  Institute  of  Internal Auditors  (IIA)'  by  external  firm  (KPMG).

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements  section  of  our  report.  We  are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India  (ICAI)  together  with  the  ethical  requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made  thereunder,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained  by  us  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a basis  for  our  audit  opinion  on  the  Standalone  Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  of  the  current  period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements  as  a  whole,  and in  forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a\n\nseparate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\n\n## Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiii)B and 22 to the financial statements.\n\nKey Audit Matter Description\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts,  including  software development, and integration contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\n\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company  to  determine  the  project  costs  incurred  to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The estimation of total project costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated  losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts  are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated project costs.\n\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts where the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key audit matter because of the significant judgment involved in estimating the efforts to complete such contracts.\n\nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred to-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the lives of the contracts.\n\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence supporting the application of the input method used to recognize revenue and a higher extent of audit  effort  to  evaluate  the  reasonableness  of  the  total estimated  amount  of  revenue  recognized  on  fixed-price contracts.\n\nHow the Key Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  estimates  of  efforts  to complete  for  fixed-price  contracts  accounted  using  the percentage-of-completion  method  included  the  following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to (1)  recording  of  efforts  incurred  and  estimation  of efforts  required  to  complete  the  remaining  contract performance obligations, and (2) access and application controls  pertaining  to  time  recording  and  allocation systems,  which  prevents  unauthorised  changes  to recording of efforts incurred.",

The Company  considered  current  and  anticipated future economic conditions on the basis of the credit reports and other related credit information for its customers to estimate the probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19.\n\nWe identified allowance for credit losses as a key audit matter because of the significant judgement involved in calculating the expected credit losses. This required a high degree of auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  extent  of  effort  when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimate of the expected credit losses.\n\nHow the Key Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit losses  for  trade  receivables,  unbilled  receivables  and contract assets included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the (1) development of the methodology for the allowance for credit losses, including consideration of the current and estimated future economic conditions, (2) completeness and  accuracy  of  information  used  in  the  estimation of  probability  of  default,  and  (3)  computation  of  the allowance for credit losses.\n- \u00b7 For a sample of customers we tested the input data such as credit reports and other credit related information used in estimating the probability of default by comparing them to external and internal sources of information.\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  the  incorporation  of  the  applicable assumptions into the estimate of expected credit losses and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation of the allowances by using the same input data used by the Company.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss  rates,  including  assessing  the  basis  for  the adjustments and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions.\n\n## Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon\n\n- \u00b7 The  Company's  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for the other information. The other information comprises the  information  included  in  the  Board's  Report  and Corporate  Governance  Report,  but  does  not  include the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n- \u00b7 Our  opinion  on  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements does  not  cover  the  other  information  and  we  do  not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n- \u00b7 In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information  and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether  the other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  or  our  knowledge obtained  during  the  course  of  our  audit  or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n- \u00b7 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that  there  is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.",

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  design,  implementation and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls, that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due\n\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under section  143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  Company  has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as  a  going  concern.  If  we  conclude  that  a  material uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and  whether  the  Standalone  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nMateriality  is  the  magnitude  of  misstatements  in  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  that,  individually  or  in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements  may  be  influenced.  We  consider  quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  that  we identify during our audit.",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to  company's  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  of  the Company  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in accordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  on  Audit  of  Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note')  issued  by  the  ICAI  and  the  Standards  on  Auditing prescribed  under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Companies  Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting  was  established  and  maintained  and  if  such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of\n\ninternal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained,  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nBecause  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial controls  over  financial  reporting,  including  the  possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud  may  occur and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation of  the  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  control  over  financial  reporting  may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to  the  explanations  given  to  us,  the  Company  has,  in",

The Company Overview\n\nWipro  Limited  (' Wipro '  or  the  ' Company '  or  ' we '  or ' our ' or ' us '), is a global information technology (' IT '), consulting  and  business  process  services  (' BPS ') company.\n\nWipro  is  a  public  limited  company  incorporated  and domiciled in India. The address of its registered office is Wipro  Limited, Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road, Bengaluru  -  560  035,  Karnataka,  India.  Wipro  has its  primary  listing  with  BSE  Ltd.  and  National  Stock Exchange  of  India  Ltd.  The  Company's  American Depository Shares (' ADS ') representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThese standalone financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on June 9, 2021.\n\n## 2. Basis  of  Preparation  of  Standalone  Financial Statements\n\n## (i) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\n\nThe standalone  financial  statements  have  been prepared in accordance  with  Indian Accounting Standards (' Ind AS '), the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013  (' the  Companies  Act '),  as  applicable  and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (' SEBI '). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and amendments issued thereafter.\n\nAccounting  policies  have  been  applied  consistently to all periods presented in these standalone financial statements,  except  for  new  accounting  standards adopted by the Company.\n\nThe  standalone  financial  statements  correspond  to the  classification  provisions  contained  in  Ind  AS  1, 'Presentation  of  Financial  Statements'.  For  clarity, various  items  are  aggregated  in  the  statement  of profit  and  loss  and  balance  sheet.  These  items  are disaggregated separately in the notes to the standalone financial statements, where applicable.\n\nAll amounts  included  in  the  standalone  financial statements  are  reported  in  millions  of  Indian  rupees ( ' in millions) except share and per share data, unless otherwise  stated.  Due  to  rounding  off,  the  numbers presented  throughout  the  document  may  not  add up  precisely  to  the  totals  and  percentages  may  not precisely  reflect  the  absolute  figures.  Previous  year figures  have  been  regrouped/re-arranged,  wherever necessary.\n\n## (ii) Basis of measurement\n\nThe standalone  financial  statements  have  been prepared  on  a  historical  cost  convention  and  on  an accrual basis, except for the following material items, which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:\n\n- a) Derivative financial instruments,\n- b) Financial  instruments  classified  as  fair  value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss,\n- c) The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised as the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets, and\n- d) Contingent consideration\n\n## (iii)   Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe preparation of the standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application  of  accounting  policies  and  the  reported amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nEstimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information  about  significant  areas  of  estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the standalone financial statements are included in the following notes:\n\n- a) Revenue recognition: The Company  applies judgement  to  determine  whether  each  product or service promised to a customer is capable of being  distinct,  and  is  distinct  in  the  context  of the  contract,  if  not,  the  promised  products  or services are combined and accounted as a single performance  obligation.  The  Company  allocates the arrangement  consideration  to  separately identifiable  performance  obligation  deliverables based on their relative stand-alone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price. The Company uses the  percentage  of  completion  method  using the  input  (cost  expended)  method  to  measure progress  towards  completion  in  respect  of  fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\naccounting relies on estimates of total expected contract  revenue  and  costs.  This  method  is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of  the  revenues  and  costs  applicable  to  various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs to  complete  include  estimates  of  future  labor costs  and  productivity  efficiencies.  Because  the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit and timing of revenue for remaining performance obligations are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is recorded based  on  estimate  of  future  revenue  from  the customer.\n\n- b) Impairment  testing: Investments  in  subsidiaries, goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite useful life recognised on business combination are tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset pertains, is less than  the  carrying  value.  The  Company  assesses acquired  intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  life for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is higher of value in use and fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation of value in use of an asset or a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which include turnover, growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future  cash  flows,  risk-adjusted  discount  rate, future economic and market conditions.\n- c) Income  taxes: The  major  tax  jurisdictions  for the  Company  are  India  and  the  United  States of  America.  Significant  judgments  are  involved in  determining  the  provision  for  income  taxes including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.\n- d) Deferred  taxes: Deferred  tax  is  recorded  on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at\n\nthe rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  at  the  reporting  date.  The  ultimate realisation  of  deferred  tax  assets  is  dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and  tax  loss  carry-forwards  become  deductible. The  Company  considers  expected  reversal  of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realisable, however, could reduce in the near term if estimates of future taxable  income  during  the  carry-forward  period are reduced.\n\n- e) Business combinations: In accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded  separately  from  goodwill.  Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful life estimates) and liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration  assumed  involves  management judgment.  These  measurements  are  based  on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have  been  deemed  reasonable  by  management. Changes  in  these  judgments,  estimates,  and assumptions can materially affect the results of operations.\n- f) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences: The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences  and  the  present  value  of  the  defined benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation  involves  making  various  assumptions that  may  differ  from  actual  developments  in the  future.  These  include  the  determination  of the  discount  rate,  future  salary  increases  and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n- g) Expected  credit  losses  on  financial  assets: The impairment  provisions  of  financial  assets  are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment  in  making  these  assumptions  and selecting  the  inputs  to  the  expected  credit  loss calculation  based  on  the  Company's  history  of collections, customer's creditworthiness, existing market  conditions  as  well  as  forward  looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\n- h) Measurement  of  fair  value  of  non-marketable equity investments: These instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently measured at fair value. Fair value of investments is determined using  the  market  and  income  approaches.  The market  approach  includes  the  use  of  financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as  revenue,  earnings,  comparable  performance multiples,  recent  financial  rounds  and  the  level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment  and  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors, including comparable company sizes, growth rates and  development  stages.  The  income  approach includes the use of discounted cash flow model, which  requires  significant  estimates  regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates  of  revenue  and  costs  are  developed using available historical and forecast data.\n- i) Useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and  equipment: The  Company  depreciates  property,  plant  and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets. The charge in respect of  periodic  depreciation  is  derived  based  on  an estimate  of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The lives are based on historical experience with similar  assets  as  well  as  anticipation  of  future events,  which  may  impact  their  life,  such  as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- j) Useful  lives  of  intangible  assets :  The  Company amortises  intangible  assets  on  a  straight-line basis  over  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets. The  useful  life  is  estimated  based  on  a  number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry and known  technological  advances  and  the  level  of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- k) Leases: Ind AS 116 defines a lease term as the non-cancellable period for which the lessee has the  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  including optional  periods,  when  an  entity  is  reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend (or not to terminate)  a  lease.  The  Company  considers  all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise the option when determining the lease term. The option\n\nto extend the lease is included in the lease term, if  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  the  lessee  would exercise the option. The Company reassesses the option  upon  occurrence  of  either  a  significant event or change in circumstances that are within the control of the lessee.\n\n- l) Provisions and contingent liabilities: The Company estimates  the  provisions  that  have  present obligations  as  a  result  of  past  events  and  it  is probable that outflow of resources will be required to  settle  the  obligations.  These  provisions  are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n- The  Company  uses  significant  judgement  to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present  obligation  that  arises  from  past  events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent  assets  are  neither  recognised  nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.\n- m) Other estimates: The share-based compensation expense  is  determined  based  on  the  Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. Fair valuation of derivative hedging instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges involves  significant  estimates  relating  to  the occurrence of forecasted transactions.\n- n) Uncertainty relating to the global health pandemic on  COVID-19: In  assessing  the  recoverability of receivables  including  unbilled  receivables, contract  assets  and  contract  costs,  goodwill, intangible  assets,  and  certain  investments,  the Company  has  considered  internal  and  external information  up  to  the  date  of  approval  of  these standalone financial statements including credit reports and economic forecasts. The Company has performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used  herein.  Based  on  the  current  indicators  of future economic conditions, the Company expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets.\n\nThe Company bases its assessment on the belief that  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  forecasted transactions  is  not  impacted  by  COVID-19.  The Company has considered the effect of changes, if any, in both counterparty credit risk and its own",

Gains/(losses), net, relating to translation or settlement of  borrowings  denominated  in  foreign  currency  are reported  within  finance  costs.  Non-monetary  assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currency  and measured  at  historical  cost  are  translated  at  the exchange  rate  prevalent  at  the  date  of  transaction. Translation  differences  on  non-monetary  financial assets  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  reporting  date, such  as  equities  classified  as  financial  instruments measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## (iii)   Financial instruments\n\n## a) Non-derivative financial instruments:\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets,  which  include  cash  and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee  and  other  advances,  investments in  equity  and  debt  securities  and  eligible\n\ncurrent  and  non-current  assets;  Financial assets  are  derecognised  when  substantial risks and  rewards  of  ownership  of  the financial  asset  have  been  transferred.  In cases where substantial risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are neither transferred nor retained, financial assets are derecognised only when the Company has not retained control over the financial asset.\n\n- \u00b7 financial  liabilities,  which  include  long  and short-term loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade payables, lease liabilities,and eligible current and non-current liabilities.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised  initially  at  fair  value.  Subsequent to initial recognition,  non-derivative  financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## A. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe  Company's  cash  and  cash  equivalents consist  of  cash  on  hand  and  in  banks  and demand deposits with banks, which can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty on the principal.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and are considered part  of  the  Company's  cash  management system. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current liabilities.\n\n## B. Investments\n\nFinancial instruments measured at amortised cost:\n\nDebt  instruments  that  meet  the  following criteria  are  measured  at  amortised  cost (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) on initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that  are  solely  payment  of  principal and  interest  on  the  principal  amount outstanding.",

Other financial assets:\n\nOther  financial  assets  are  non-derivative financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active market.  They  are  presented  as  current assets, except for those maturing later than 12  months  after  the  reporting  date  which are presented as non-current assets. These are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  and subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment  losses.  These  comprise  trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances and other eligible current and noncurrent assets.\n\n## D. Trade payables and other liabilities\n\nTrade  payables  and  other  liabilities  are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently  carried  at  amortised  cost using the effective interest method. For these financial instruments, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity  of  these  instruments.

Attributable  transaction  costs  are recognised in statement of profit and loss as cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## A. Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative hedging instruments designated as a cash  flow  hedge  are  recognised  in  other comprehensive income and held in cash flow hedging reserve, net of taxes, a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective. To  the  extent  that  the  hedge  is  ineffective, changes  in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  the statement  of  profit  and  loss  and  reported within  foreign  exchange  gains/(losses),  net, within  results  from  operating  activities.

Leasehold  improvements  are amortised  over  the  shorter  of  estimated  useful life of the asset or the related lease term. Term licenses  are  amortised  over  their  respective contract  term.  Freehold  land  is  not  depreciated. The  estimated  useful  life  of  assets  is  reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted, annually. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                          | Useful life    |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                         | 28 to 40 years |\n| Plant and equipment               | 5 to 21 years  |\n| Computer equipment and software   | 2 to 7 years   |\n| Furniture, fixtures and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Vehicles                          | 4 to 5 years   |",

Any subsequent changes to  the  fair  value  of  contingent  consideration classified as liabilities, other than measurement period adjustments, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## Common Control business combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations involving  entities  or  businesses  under  common control using the pooling of interests method. The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts. The identity of the reserves shall be preserved and shall appear in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form in which they appeared in the financial statements of the transferor. The difference, if any, between  the  amount  recorded  as  share  capital issued  plus  any  additional  consideration  in  the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor shall be transferred to capital  reserve  and  should  be  presented separately as Common  Control  Transactions Capital reserve.\n\n## b) Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company's share in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is  recognised as  goodwill.  If  the  excess  is  negative,  a  bargain purchase gain is recognised in equity as capital reserve. Goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less accumulated impairment (if any).\n\nGoodwill associated with disposal of an operation that is part of cash-generating unit is measured based  on  the  relative  values  of  the  operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit  retained,  unless  some  other  method  better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial  recognition,  intangible  assets  are  carried at cost less accumulated  amortisation  and impairment losses, if any.\n\nThe  amortisation  of  an  intangible  asset  with  a finite useful life reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is expected to be generated.\n\nThe estimated useful life of amortisable intangibles is reviewed and where appropriate is adjusted, annually. The estimated useful lives of the amortisable intangible assets for the current and comparative periods are as follows:\n\n| Category                      | Useful life   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Customer-related intangibles  | 5 to 10 years |\n| Marketing-related intangibles | 7 years       |\n\n## (vii)  Leases\n\nOn  April  1,  2019,  the  Company  adopted  Ind  AS  116, Leases, which applied to all lease contracts outstanding as at April 1, 2019, using modified retrospective method by recording the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to opening retained earnings.\n\nThe Company has made use of the following practical expedients available in its transition to Ind AS 116 -\n\n- (a) The Company will not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of lease in accordance with Ind AS 17 will continue to  be  applied  to  lease  contracts  entered  by  the",

Consequently, the Company  has  recorded  its  lease  liability  using the  present  value  of  remaining  lease  payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at  the  date  of  initial  application  and  the  Rightof-Use  (' RoU ') asset  at  its  carrying  amount as  if  the  standard  had  been  applied  since  the commencement date of the lease but discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application.\n- (c) The Company excluded the initial direct costs from measurement of the RoU asset;\n- (d) The Company does not recognise RoU assets and lease  liabilities  for  leases  with  less  than  twelve months of lease term and low-value assets on the date of initial application.\n\nThe weighted average rate of discount applied to lease liabilities as at April 1, 2019 is 5.6%.\n\nOn adoption of Ind AS 116,\n\n- a) the  Company  had  recognised  right-of-use assets ' 6,835  and  corresponding  lease liabilities ' 7,618.\n- b) the  net  carrying  value  of  assets  procured under the finance lease ' 143 (gross carrying and accumulated depreciation value of ' 263 and ' 120, respectively) have been reclassified from  property,  plant  and  equipment  to  RoU assets.\n- c) the obligations under finance leases of ' 596 (non-current  and  current  obligation  under finance leases ' 152 and ' 444 respectively) have been reclassified to lease liabilities.\n- d) prepaid  rent  on  leasehold  land  and  other assets,  which  were  earlier  classified  under 'Other Assets' have been reclassified to RoU assets by ' 2,202.\n\nThe adoption of the new standard has resulted in a reduction of ' 414 in retained earnings, net of deferred tax asset of ' 115.\n\nThe Company evaluates each contract or arrangement,  whether  it  qualifies  as  lease  as defined under Ind AS 116.\n\n## The Company as a lessee\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  an  arrangement  for lease  of  land,  buildings,  plant  and  equipment including computer equipment and vehicles. Such arrangements are generally for a fixed period but may  have  extension  or  termination  options.  The Company  assesses,  whether  the  contract  is,  or contains,  a  lease,  at  its  inception.  A  contract  is, or  contains,  a  lease  if  the  contract  conveys  the right to:\n\n- a) control use of an identified asset,\n- b) obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and\n- c) direct the use of the identified asset\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  lease  term  as  the non-cancellable  period  of  a  lease,  together  with periods covered by an option to extend the lease, where  the  Company  is  reasonably  certain  to exercise that option.\n\nThe  Company  at  the  commencement  of  the lease  contract  recognises  an  RoU  asset  at  cost and  corresponding  lease  liability,  except  for leases  with  term  of  less  than  twelve  months (short-term  leases)  and  low-value  assets.  For these  short-term  and  low  value  leases,  the Company  recognises  the  lease  payments  as  an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe cost of the RoU asset comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the inception date of the lease, plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, the RoU assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The RoU assets are depreciated using the straight-line  method  from  the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe  Company  applies  Ind  AS  36  to  determine whether an RoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of non-financial assets below.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nFor lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease,  the  Company  measures  the  lease  liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that  the  Company  would  have  to  pay  to  borrow funds, including the consideration of factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment.\n\nAfter  the  commencement  date,  the  amount  of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of  interest  and  reduced  for  the  lease  payments made.\n\nThe  Company  recognises  the  amount  of  the  remeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the RoU assets. Where the carrying amount of the RoU asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the  Company  recognises  any  remaining  amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.\n\nLease  liability  payments  are  classified  as  cash used  in  financing  activities  in  the  statement  of cash flows.\n\n## The Company as a lessor\n\nLeases  under  which  the  Company  is  a  lessor are  classified  as  a  finance  or  operating  lease. Lease contracts where all the risks and rewards are  substantially  transferred  to  the  lessee  are classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\nFor  leases  under  which  the  Company  is  an intermediate  lessor,  the  Company  accounts  for the head-lease and the sub-lease as two separate contracts.  The  sub-lease  is  further  classified either as a finance lease or an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the headlease.\n\n## (viii) Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value, including necessary provision for obsolescence. Cost  is determined  using  the  weighted  average method.\n\n## (ix) Impairment\n\n## A) Financial assets\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  expected  credit  loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost, debt  instruments  classified  as  FVTOCI,  trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, finance  lease  receivables  and  other  financial assets.  Expected  credit  loss  is  the  difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive discounted using the effective interest rate.\n\nLoss  allowances  for  trade  receivables,  unbilled receivables,  contract  assets  and  finance  lease receivables are measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit loss are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life  of  a  financial  instrument.  Lifetime  expected credit  loss  is  computed  based  on  a  provision matrix which takes in to account,risk profiling of customers  and  historical  credit  loss  experience adjusted for forward looking information. For other financial assets, expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal to twelve months expected credit  loss  unless  there  has  been  a  significant increase  in  credit  risk  from  initial  recognition, in  which  case  those  are  measured  at  lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## B) Impairment of Investment in subsidiaries\n\nThe Company assesses investments in subsidiaries for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary. The  recoverable  amount  of  such  investment  is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (' FVLCD ')  and  its  value-in-use  (' VIU ').  The  VIU of  the  investment  is  calculated  using  projected future  cash  flows.  If  the  recoverable  amount  of the investment is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## C) Non-financial assets\n\nThe  Company  assesses  long-lived  assets  such as  property,  plant  and  equipment,  RoU  assets",

If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of assets.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same time and when events occur or changes in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  or  cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost  of  disposal  (' FVLCD ')  and  its  value-in-use (' VIU '). The VIU of long-lived assets is calculated using  projected  future  cash  flows.  FVLCD  of  a cash generating unit is computed using turnover and earnings multiples. If the recoverable amount of  the  asset  or  the  recoverable  amount  of  the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment losses previously recognised are reversed such that the asset is recognised at its recoverable  amount  but  not  exceeding  written down  value  which  would  have  been  reported  if the  impairment  losses  had  not  been  recognised initially. An impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n\n## (x) Employee benefits\n\n## a) Post-employment and pension plans\n\nThe  Company  participates  in  various  employee benefit plans. Pensions and other postemployment  benefits  are  classified  as  either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the Company's only obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits.  The  related  actuarial  and  investment risks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for  defined  contribution  plans  is  recognised  as\n\nan expense during the period when the employee provides  service.  Under  a  defined  benefit  plan, it  is  the  Company's  obligation  to  provide  agreed benefits  to  the  employees.  The  related  actuarial and investment risks are borne by the Company. The present value of the defined benefit obligations is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nRemeasurements  of  the  defined  benefit  plans, comprising actuarial gains or losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest)are immediately recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income,  net of  taxes  and  not  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in subsequent period.\n\nNet  interest  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or below the discount rate  is  recognised  as  part  of  remeasurements of the defined  benefit  plans  through  other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\nThe Company has the following employee benefit plans:\n\n## A . Provident fund\n\nEmployees receive benefits from a provident fund,  which  is  a  defined  benefit  plan.  The employer and employees each make periodic contributions  to  the  plan.  A  portion  of  the contribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to the government administered pension fund. The contributions  to  the  trust  managed  by  the Company is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return.\n\n## B . Superannuation\n\nSuperannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is administered by third party fund managers.  The  Company  makes  annual contributions based on a specified percentage of each eligible employee's salary.\n\n## C. Gratuity and Pension\n\nIn accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act,  1972,  applicable  for  Indian  companies, the  Company  provides  for  a  lump  sum payment to eligible employees, at retirement",

The  gratuity  fund  is managed by the third-party fund managers.\n\nThe  Company  also  maintains  pension  and similar  plans  for  employees  outside  India, based on country specific regulations. These plans  are  partially  funded,  and  the  funds are managed by third party fund managers. The  plans  provide  for  monthly  payout  after retirement  as  per  salary  drawn  and  service period or for a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund.\n\nThe Company's obligations in respect of the above plans, which are defined benefit plans, are provided for based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. The Company  recognises  remeasurement  gains and losses of the net defined benefit liability /(asset) in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## b) Termination benefits\n\nTermination  benefits  are  expensed  when  the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\n## c) Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are measured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are recorded  as  expense  as  the  related  service  is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or  profit-sharing  plans,  if  the  Company  has  a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee  and  the  obligation  can  be  estimated reliably.\n\n## d) Compensated absences\n\nThe  employees  of  the  Company  are  entitled  to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised accumulating compensated  absences  and  utilise  it  in  future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this  entitlement.  The  Company  measures  the expected  cost  of  compensated  absences  as  the additional  amount  that  the  Company  expects  to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The\n\nCompany  recognises  accumulated  compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the projected  unit  credit  method.  Non-accumulating compensated  absences  are  recognised  in  the period in which the absences occur.\n\n## (xi)   Share-based payment transactions\n\nSelected employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments or cash settled instruments, for rendering services over a defined vesting period and for Company's performancebased  stock  options  over  the  defined  period.  Equity instruments granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant. In cases, where  equity  instruments  are  granted  at  a  nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to the share options outstanding account, a component of equity.\n\nThe  equity  instruments  or  cash  settled  instruments generally  vest  in  a  graded  manner  over  the  vesting period.  The  fair  value  determined  at  the  grant  date is expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such grants (accelerated amortisation). The stock compensation expense is determined based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will eventually vest.\n\nCash Settled instruments granted are re-measured by reference to the fair value at the end of each reporting period  and  at  the  time  of  vesting.  The  expense  is recognised in the statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to the financial liability.\n\n## (xii)  Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Company  has  a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe  amount  recognised  as  a  provision  is  the  best estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and  the  amount  of  the  receivable  can  be  measured reliably.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions  for  onerous  contracts  are  measured  at the  present  value  of  lower  of  the  expected  net  cost of  fulfilling  the  contract  and  the  expected  cost  of terminating the contract.\n\n## (xiii) Revenue\n\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from software development, maintenance of software/hardware and related services, business process services, sale of IT and other products.\n\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations  under  the  contract,  and  the  contract is  legally  enforceable.  Revenue  is  recognised  upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products  or  services.  To  recognise  revenues,  the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognise revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAt  contract  inception,  the  Company  assesses  its promise to transfer products or services to a customer to  identify  separate  performance  obligations.  The Company  applies  judgement  to  determine  whether each  product  or  service  promised  to  a  customer  is capable of being distinct, and are distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised products or services are combined and accounted as a single performance obligation.  The  Company  allocates  the  arrangement consideration  to  separately  identifiable  performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling price or residual method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses third-party prices for similar deliverables or the Company uses expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price.\n\nFor performance obligations where control is transferred over  time,  revenues  are  recognised  by  measuring progress  towards  completion  of  the  performance obligation.  The  selection  of  the  method  to  measure progress  towards  completion  requires  judgment  and is  based  on  the  nature  of  the  promised  products  or services to be provided.\n\nThe method for recognising revenues and costs depends on the nature of the services rendered:\n\n## A. Time and materials contracts\n\nRevenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are recognised as the related services are rendered.\n\n## B. Fixed-price contracts\n\n## i) Fixed-price development contracts\n\nRevenues from fixed-price development contracts,  including  software  development, and integration contracts, where the performance  obligations  are  satisfied  over time, are recognised using the 'percentageof-completion'  method.  The  performance obligations  are  satisfied  as  and  when  the services  are  rendered  since  the  customer generally  obtains  control  of  the  work  as  it progresses.  Percentage  of  completion  is determined based on project costs incurred to  date  as  a  percentage  of  total  estimated project costs required  to  complete  the project. The cost expended (or input) method has been used to measure progress towards  completion  as  there  is  a  direct relationship between input and productivity. If  the  Company  is  not  able  to  reasonably measure the progress of completion, revenue is  recognised  only  to  the  extent  of  costs incurred for which recoverability is probable. When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in  the  period  in  which  such  losses  become probable  based  on  the  current  contract estimates as an onerous contract provision.\n\nA  contract  asset  is  a  right  to  consideration that  is  conditional  upon  factors  other  than the passage of time. Contract assets primarily relate  to  unbilled  amounts  on  fixed-price development contracts and are classified as non-financial asset as the contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.",

If our invoicing is not consistent with value delivered,  revenues  are  recognised  as  the service is performed using the percentage of completion method.\n\nIn certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is agreed at a fixed price for a  fixed  term.  In  such  contracts,  revenue  is recognised with respect to the actual output achieved  till  date  as  a  percentage  of  total contractual  output.

The Company accounts for  modifications  to  existing  contracts  by assessing  whether  the  services  added  are\n\ndistinct  and  whether  the  pricing  is  at  the stand-alone  selling  price.  Services  added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the stand-alone selling price,  or  as  a  termination  of  the  existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the stand-alone selling price.\n\n- \uf0d8 The Company accounts for variable considerations like, volume discounts, rebates,pricing incentives to customers and penalties as reduction of revenue on a systematic and rational basis over the period of  the  contract.  The  Company  estimates an  amount  of  such  variable  consideration using  expected  value  method  or  the  single most  likely  amount  in  a  range  of  possible consideration  depending  on  which  method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company may be entitled and when it is probable that a significant reversal of  cumulative  revenue  recognised  will  not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\n- \uf0d8 Revenues  are  shown  net  of  allowances/ returns, sales tax, value added tax, goods and services  tax  and  applicable  discounts  and allowances.\n- \uf0d8 The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties at the time when the revenue is recognised.  The  accruals  are  based  on  the Company's  historical  experience  of  material usage and service delivery costs.\n- \uf0d8 Incremental  costs  that  relate  directly  to  a contract and incurred in securing a contract with a customer are recognised as an asset when the Company expects to recover these costs and amortised over the contract term.\n- \uf0d8 The Company recognises contract fulfilment cost  as  an  asset  if  those  costs  specifically relate  to  a  contract  or  to  an  anticipated contract,  the  costs  generate  or  enhance resources  that  will  be  used  in  satisfying performance  obligations  in  future;  and  the costs are expected to be recovered.

As a practical expedient, the Company does not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in  timing  arises  for  reasons  other  than  the provision  of  finance  to  either  the  customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist.\n- \uf0d8 The  Company  may  enter  into  arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or  services.  In  such  cases,  the  Company evaluates  whether  the  Company  is  the principal (i.e. report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e. report revenues on a net basis). In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether the  Company  controls  the  good  or  service before  it  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  If Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, Company is the principal; if not, the Company is the agent.\n- \uf0d8 Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term  of  the  contract  and  are  recognised  in net profit in the period when these estimates change  or  when  the  estimates  are  revised. Revenues  and  the  estimated  total  costs  or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses.\n\n## (xiv) Finance costs\n\nFinance  costs  comprise  interest  cost  on  borrowings, lease liabilities and net defined benefit liability,gains or losses arising on re-measurement of financial assets measured at FVTPL, gains/ (losses), net, on translation or  settlement  of  foreign  currency  borrowings  and changes in fair value and gains/ (losses) on settlement of related derivative instruments. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to a qualifying asset are recognised in the statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method.\n\n## (xv)  Finance and other income\n\nFinance and other income comprises interest income on deposits, dividend income and gains / (losses) on disposal of investments. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is  recognised  when  the  right  to  receive  payment  is established.\n\n## (xvi)  Income tax\n\nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax  expense  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit and loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## a) Current income tax\n\nCurrent  income  tax  for  the  current  and  prior periods  are  measured  at  the  amount  expected to  be  recovered  from  or  paid  to  the  taxation authorities based on the taxable income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period. While determining the tax provisions, the Company assesses whether each  uncertain  tax  position  is  to  be  considered separately or together with one or more uncertain tax  positions  depending  upon  the  nature  and circumstances of each uncertain tax position. The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax  liabilities,  where  it  has  a  legally  enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and liability simultaneously.\n\n## b) Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred  income  tax  is  recognised  using  the balance  sheet  approach.  Deferred  income  tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the  tax  base  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their carrying  amount  in  these  standalone  financial statements,  except  when  the  deferred  income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or  an  asset  or  liability  in  a  transaction  that  is not  a  business  combination  and  affects  neither accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  recognised for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  except  in respect of taxable temporary differences that is expected to reverse within the tax holiday period, taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with investments in subsidiaries, associates and foreign branches where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and",

Diluted earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weightedaverage number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for options, except where the results would be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe  number  of  equity  shares  and  potentially  dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented  for  any  splits  and  bonus  shares  issues including for change effected prior to the approval of the  standalone  financial  statements  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n## (xviii)  Statement of Cashflows\n\nCash  flows  are  reported  using  the  indirect  method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash from operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  of  the Company are segregated.\n\n## (xix) Assets held for sale\n\nSale of business is classified as held for sale, if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered principally\n\nthrough sale rather than through continuing use. The condition for classification as held for sale is met when disposal business is available for immediate sale and the same is highly probable of being completed within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\n## (xx)  Discontinued operations\n\nA  discontinued  operation  is  a  component  of  the Company's business that represents a separate line of business that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\n## (xxi)  Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  of  disposal  groups  that  are available  for  immediate  sale  and  where  the  sale is  highly  probable  of  being  completed  within  one year  from  the  date  of  classification  are  considered and  classified  as  assets  held  for  sale  and  liabilities associated  with  assets  held  for  sale.  Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (xxii)  Disposal of assets\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  arising  on  disposal  or  retirement  of assets  is  recognised  in  the  standalone  statement  of profit and loss.\n\nNew Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Company e/ffective from April 1, 2020:\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 103- Business combinations\n\nThe Ministry of Corporate Affairs ( 'MCA' ) has issued amendments to Ind AS 103, 'Business Combinations', in connection with clarification of business definition, which help in determining whether an acquisition made is of a business or a group of assets. The amendment added  a  test  that  makes  it  easier  to  conclude  that a  Company  has  acquired  a  group  of  assets,  rather than a business, if the value of the assets acquired is substantially all concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets. The adoption of amendment to Ind AS 103 is applicable to new acquisition on a prospective basis and did not have any impact on the standalone financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe MCA amended some of its requirements for hedge accounting.  The  amendments  provide  relief  from",

In addition, the amendments require companies to  provide  additional  information  to  investors  about their  hedging  relationships  that  are  directly  affected by these uncertainties. The adoption of amendment to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107 did not have any significant material impact on the standalone financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8 - Definition of Material\n\nThe MCA issued Amendment to Ind AS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' and Ind AS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' to update a new definition of material in Ind AS 1. The amendments clarify the definition of 'material' and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance that until now has featured elsewhere in Ind AS Standards. The new definition clarifies that, information is considered material  if  omitting,  misstating,  or  obscuring  such information, could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial  statements  make  based  on  those  financial statements.  The  definition  of  material  in  Ind  AS  8 has been replaced by a reference to the definition of material in Ind AS 1. In addition, the MCA amended other Standards that contain a definition of material or refer to the term 'material' to ensure consistency. The adoption of the amendment to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8 did not have any material impact on its evaluation of materiality in relation to the standalone financial statements.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 116 - Leases\n\nThe MCA issued amendments to Ind AS 116, 'Leases', provide  lessees  with  an  exemption  from  assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. The amendments allowed the expedient to  be  applied  to  COVID-19-related  rent  concessions to payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021 and also require disclosure of the amount recognised in profit or loss to reflect changes in lease payments that  arise  from  COVID-19-related  rent  concessions. The  reporting  period  in  which  a  lessee  first  applies the amendment, it is not required to disclose certain quantitative  information  required  under  Ind  AS  8. Accordingly, the Company recognised ' 44 as reversal of lease liability in the statement of profit and loss for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n## New  Accounting  Standards  not  yet  adopted  by  the Company\n\nMCA  notifies  new  standard  or  amendments  to  the existing standards. There is no such notification which would have been applicable from April 1, 2021.\n\n## New Amendments not yet adopted by the Company\n\nOn  March  24,  2021,  the  MCA  through  a  notification, amended  Schedule  III  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013. Key amendments relating to Division II which relate to companies whose financial statements are required to comply with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 are:\n\n- \u00b7 Lease liabilities should be separately disclosed under the head 'financial liabilities', duly distinguished as current or non-current.\n- \u00b7 Current maturities of long-term borrowings should be disclosed separately within borrowings instead of earlier disclosure requirement under Other Financial Liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Certain additional disclosures in the statement of changes  in  equity  due  to  prior  period  errors  and restated  balances  at  the  beginning  of  the  current reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Specified  format  for  disclosure  of  shareholding  of promoters.\n- \u00b7 Specified  format  for  ageing  schedule  of  trade receivables, trade payables, capital work-inprogress and intangible asset under development.\n- \u00b7 Additional disclosures relating to Corporate Social Responsibility,  undisclosed  income  and  crypto  or virtual currency.\n- \u00b7 Disclosure of specified ratios along with explanation for  items  included  in  numerator  and  denominator and explanation for change in any ratio is excess of 25% compared to preceding year.\n- \u00b7 If  a  company  has  not  used  funds  for  the  specific purpose for which it was borrowed from banks and financial institutions, then disclosure of details of where it has been used.\n- \u00b7 Specific  disclosure  under  'additional  regulatory requirement'  such  as  compliance  with  approved schemes of arrangements, compliance with number of  layers  of  companies,  title  deeds  of  immovable property  not  held  in  name  of  company,  loans  and advances  to  promoters,  directors,  key  managerial personnel and related parties and details of benami property held.\n\nThese amendments are applicable from April 1, 2021. The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact of  these  amendment  on  the  standalone  financial statements.",

Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nThe movement in goodwill balance is given below:\n\n|                                                            | Year ended  March 31, 2021   | Year ended  March 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the year                       | '  4,571                     | '  3,882                     |\n| Acquisition through business combination (Refer to Note 7) | -                            | 689                          |\n| Balance at the end of the year                             | ' 4,571                      | ' 4,571                      |\n\nThe Company is organised by three operating segments: IT Services, IT Products and India State Run Enterprises services. Goodwill as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 has been allocated to the IT Services operating segment. Goodwill recognised on business combinations is allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs), within the IT Services operating segment, which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisitions.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company re-organised its IT Services segment from seven industry verticals to four Strategic Market Units. Accordingly, goodwill has been re-allocated to the CGUs, using a relative value approach as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 as follows:\n\n|                                 | As at  March 31, 2021   | As at  March 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| CGUs                            |                         |                         |\n| Americas 2                      | '  3,782                | '  3,782                |\n| Asia Pacific Middle East Africa | 789                     | 789                     |\n| Total                           | ' 4,571                 | ' 4,571                 |\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is  monitored  for  internal  management  purposes,  and  which  is  not  higher  than  the  Company's  operating  segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company's procedure for determining the recoverable value of each CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the market capitalisation approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nBased on the above testing, no impairment was identified as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the calculation's sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings multiples), did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU's recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.\n\nMovement in other intangible assets is given below:\n\n|                                       | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                       | Customer-related          | Marketing-related         | Total                     |\n| Gross carrying value:                 |                           |                           |                           |\n| As at April 1, 2020                   | '  5,207                  | '  517                    | '  5,724                  |\n| Deductions/Adjustments                | (208)                     | (485)                     | (693)                     |\n| As at March 31, 2021                  | '  4,999                  | '  32                     | '  5,031                  |\n| Accumulated amortisation/ impairment: |                           |                           |                           |\n| As at April 1, 2020                   | '  2,047                  | '  487                    | '  2,534                  |\n| Amortisation                          | 663                       | 4                         | 667                       |\n| Deductions/Adjustments                | (208)                     | (485)                     | (693)                     |",

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis and hence are not offset.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances, eligible current and non-current assets,borrowings, trade payables,and eligible current liabilities and non-current liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, borrowings,trade payables,other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company's long-term debt has been contracted at market rates of interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair value.Further, finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2021, and 2020 the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances approximates the fair value.\n\nInvestments in liquid and short-term mutual funds, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset values at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in certificate of deposits, commercial papers and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date. Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified as FVTOCI is determined using market and income approaches.",

Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying. As at March 31, 2021, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.\n\nInvestment in commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds: Fair value of these instruments is derived based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market as at reporting date.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\n## Sale of financial assets\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company transfers accounts receivables, unbilled receivables, net investment in finance lease receivables (financial assets) to banks. Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 is not material.\n\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected as part of borrowings in the balance sheet.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.\n\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company's earnings and equity to losses.\n\n## Risk Management Procedures\n\nThe Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe  Company  operates  internationally,  and  a  major  portion  of  its  business  is  transacted  in  several  currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, a ' 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in approximately ' 3,095 (statement of profit and loss ' 1,395 and other comprehensive income ' 1,700) decrease in the fair value, and a ' 1 decrease would result in approximately ' 2,844 (statement of profit and loss ' 1,395 and other",

The Company's investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. The Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2021, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ' 579.",

To manage this, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Company's corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. As at March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements, if any.\n\n|                             | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Contractual cash flows      | Carrying value         | Less than   1 year     | 1-2 years              | 2-4 years              | 4-7 years              | Total                  |\n| Borrowings (1)(2)           | '  58,152              | '  59,627              | '  84                  | '  57                  | '  -                   | '  59,768              |\n| Lease Liabilities (2)       | 11,094                 | 4,400                  | 3,554                  | 3,119                  | 849                    | 11,922                 |\n| Trade payables              | 43,485                 | 43,485                 | -                      | -                      | -                      | 43,485                 |\n| Other financial liabilities | 22,179                 | 22,172                 | 6                      | 1                      | -                      | 22,179                 |\n| Derivative liabilities      | 1,021                  | 1,021                  | -                      | -                      | -                      | 1,021                  |\n\n|                             | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Contractual cash flows      | Carrying value         | Less than   1 year     | 1-2 years              | 2-4 years              | 4-7 years              | Total                  |\n| Borrowings (1)(2)           | '  50,459              | '  51,156              | '  136                 | '  115                 | '  -                   | '  51,407              |\n| Lease Liabilities (2)       | '  9,121               | '  3,490               | '  2,959               | '  2,652               | '  842                 | 9,943                  |\n| Trade payables              | '  45,426              | '  45,426              |                        |                        |                        | 45,426                 |\n| Other financial liabilities | 18,614                 | 18,468                 | 83                     | 63                     | -                      | 18,614                 |\n| Derivative liabilities      | 7,369                  | 7,369                  | -                      | -                      | -                      | 7,369                  |",

Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n\nThe Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ' 548 and ' 201 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily in respect of capital loss incurred on account of liquidation of an investment. Management's projections of future taxable capital gain support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise this deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company calculates its tax liability for domestic taxes after considering MAT. The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions. The Company is carrying deferred tax asset of ' Nil as at March 31, 2021 relating to MAT.\n\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company's India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to export operations and profits from units established under Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. Units in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. Certain tax benefits are also available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35.The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ' 11,458 and ' 11,963 for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate we would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was ' 2.03 and ' 2.05, respectively.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  except  in  respect  of  taxable temporary differences associated with US branch profit tax where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, deferred income tax liabilities on branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profits have not been recognised. Further, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.",

Contract Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset.\n\nA receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognises a receivable for revenues related to time and materials contracts or volume-based contracts. The Company presents such  receivables  as  part  of  unbilled  receivables  at  their  net  estimated  realisable  value.  The  same  is  tested  for impairment as per the guidance in Ind AS 109 using expected credit loss method.\n\nContract assets: During the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, ' 11,451 and ' 9,654 of contract assets pertaining to fixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n\nContract liabilities: During the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognised revenue of ' 11,978 and ' 12,964 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nContract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## B.  Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRevenue  allocated  to  remaining  performance  obligations  represents  contracted  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been recognised, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n\nAs at March 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ' 224,746 and ' 221,618, respectively of which approximately 71% and 74%, respectively is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts, with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception.

Dividends and Buyback of equity shares\n\nThe Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. According to the Companies Act, 2013 any dividend should be declared out of accumulated distributable profits. A Company may, before the declaration of any dividend, transfer a percentage of its profits for that financial year as it may consider appropriate to the reserves.\n\nThe cash dividends paid per equity share were ' 1 and ' 1, during the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, including an interim dividend of ' 1 and ' 1 for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company concluded the buyback of 237,500,000 equity shares as approved by the Board of Directors on October 13, 2020. This has resulted in a total cash outflow of ' 116,445 (including tax on buyback of ' 21,445). In line with the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013, an amount of ' 1,427 and ' 115,018 has been utilised from securities premium and retained earnings respectively. Further, capital redemption reserve of ' 475 (representing the nominal value of the shares bought back) has been created as an apportionment from retained earnings. Consequent to such buyback, the paid-up equity share capital has reduced by ' 475.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company concluded the buyback of 323,076,923 equity shares as approved by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  April  16,  2019.

Additional Capital Disclosures\n\nThe key objective of the Company's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its business. The Company's focus is on keeping a strong total equity base to ensure independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Company.\n\nThe Company's goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in future periods.\n\nThe amount of future dividends/ buyback of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.\n\nThe capital structure as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\n|                                            | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2020   | % Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Total equity (A)                           | ' 452,416              | '  464,537             | (2.61%)    |\n| As percentage of total capital             | 86.73%                 | 88.63%                 |            |\n| Current borrowings *                       | '  58,011              | '  50,208              |            |\n| Non-current borrowings                     | 141                    | 251                    |            |\n| Lease Liabilities                          | 11,094                 | 9,121                  |            |\n| Total borrowings and lease liabilities (B) | '  69,246              | '  59,580              | 16.22%     |\n| As percentage of total capital             | 13.27%                 | 11.37%                 |            |\n| Total capital (A) + (B)                    | '   521,662            | '  524,117             | (0.47%)    |",

There are no materially significant related party transactions made by the Company with Promoters, Directors or Key Managerial Personnel, which may have a potential conflict with the interests of the Company at large.\n\n## 33.  Commitments and contingencies\n\nCapital commitments: As at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 the Company had committed to spend approximately ' 6,949 and ' 13,365, respectively, under agreements to purchase/construct property and equipment. These amounts are net of capital advances paid in respect of these purchases.\n\n## Contingent liabilities to the extent not provided for:\n\n|                                                           | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Guarantees given by the banks on behalf of the Company    | '  13,032              | '  13,511              |\n| Guarantees given by the Company on behalf of subsidiaries | 9                      | 59                     |\n\n## Contingencies and lawsuits:\n\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims (including tax assessment orders/ penalty notices) which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business. Some of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Company's assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2016 in India. The Company has received demands on multiple tax issues in India. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profits earned by the Company's undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the appeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by the Income tax authorities before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits on profits earned from Software Technology Park and Special Economic Zone units, capitalisation of research & development expenses, transfer pricing adjustments on intercompany / inter unit transactions and other issues.\n\nIncome tax claims against the Company amounting to ' 80,032 and ' 77,873 are not acknowledged as debt as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These matters are pending before various Appellate Authorities and the management expects  its  position  will  likely  be  upheld  on  ultimate  resolution  and  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the Company's financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe  contingent  liability  in  respect  of  disputed  demands  for  excise  duty,  custom  duty,  sales  tax  and  other  matters amounting to ' 11,413 and ' 8,033 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. However, the resolution of these disputed demands is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, through a ruling in February 2019, provided interpretation on the components of  Salary on which the Company and its employees are to contribute towards Provident Fund under the Employee's Provident Fund Act. Based on the current evaluation, the Company believes it is not probable that certain components of Salary paid by the Company will be subject to contribution towards Provident Fund due to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India order. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments.",

Segment information\n\nThe  Company  publishes  these  standalone  financial  statements  along  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements. In  accordance  with  Ind  AS  108,  Operating  Segments,  the  Company  has  disclosed  the  segment  information  in  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n- 36. The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020 which would impact the contributions by the Company towards Provident Fund and Gratuity. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has released draft rules for the Code on Social Security, 2020 on November 13, 2020, and has invited suggestions from stake holders which are under active consideration by the Ministry. Based on an initial assessment by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries, the additional impact on Provident Fund contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is not expected to be material, whereas, the likely additional impact on Gratuity liability / contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries could be material. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries will complete their evaluation once the subject rules are notified and will give appropriate impact in the standalone financial statements in the period in which, the Code becomes effective and the related rules to determine the financial impact are published.\n\n## 37. Events after the reporting period\n\n- a)  In  April  2021,  the  Company  completed  its  acquisition  of  Capco  Technologies  Private  Limited  for  an  upfront  cash consideration of ' 2,713.\n- b)  In June 2021, the Company's Board has approved to provide unconditional and irrevocable financial guarantee of up to US$750 million, towards proposed issuance of U.S. dollar denominated Notes by a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nAs per our report of even date attached\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\n## for Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP\n\nChartered\tAccountants\n\nFirm's\tRegistration\tNo.:\t117366W/W\t-\t100018\n\n## Vikas Bagaria\n\nJatin Pravinchandra Dalal\n\nM.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are  relevant  to  our  audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made  thereunder,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained  by  us  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a basis  for  our  audit  opinion  on  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the\n\nConsolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the  current  period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in  forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\n\n## Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiv)B and 21 to the financial statements .\n\n## Key Audit Matter Description\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts,  including  software development, and integration contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\n\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company  to  determine  the  project  costs  incurred  to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The estimation of total project costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated  losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts  are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated project costs.\n\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts where the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key audit matter because of the significant judgement involved in estimating the efforts to complete such contracts.\n\nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred to-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the lives of the contracts.\n\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence supporting the application of the input method used to recognize revenue and a higher extent of audit  effort  to  evaluate  the  reasonableness  of  the  total estimated  amount  of  revenue  recognized  on  fixed-price contracts.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  estimates  of  efforts  to complete  for  fixed-price  contracts  accounted  using  the percentage-of-completion  method  included  the  following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  (1) recording of efforts incurred and estimation of efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance",

The Company  considered  current  and  anticipated future economic conditions on the basis of the credit reports and other related credit information for its customers to estimate the probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19.\n\nWe identified allowance for credit losses as a key audit matter because of the significant judgement involved in calculating the expected credit losses. This required a high degree of auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  extent  of  effort  when\n\nperforming audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimate of the expected credit losses.\n\nHow the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit losses  for  trade  receivables,  unbilled  receivables  and contract assets included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  (1) development of the methodology for the allowance for credit losses, including consideration of the current and estimated future economic conditions, (2) completeness and  accuracy  of  information  used  in  the  estimation of  probability  of  default,  and  (3)  computation  of  the allowance for credit losses.\n- \u00b7 For a sample of customers we tested the input data such as  credit  reports  and  other  credit  related  information used in estimating the probability of default by comparing them to external and internal sources of information.\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  the  incorporation  of  the  applicable assumptions into the estimate of expected credit losses and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation of the allowances by using the same input data used by the Company.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss  rates,  including  assessing  the  basis  for  the adjustments and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions.\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon\n\n- \u00b7 The  Company's  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for the  preparation  of  the  other  information.  The  other information comprises the information included in the Management  Discussion  and  Analysis,  Board's  report and Corporate Governance Report, but does not include the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n- \u00b7 Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does  not  cover  the  other  information  and  we  do  not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n- \u00b7 In connection  with  our  audit  of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information  and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or  our  knowledge obtained  during  the  course  of  our  audit  or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n- \u00b7 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that  there  is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.",

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  design,  implementation and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls, that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn  preparing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic\n\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or,  if  such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and  whether  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  and  business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nMateriality  is  the  magnitude  of  misstatements  in  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  that,  individually  or  in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions",

These  responsibilities  include  the  design,  implementation and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient  conduct  of  its  business,  including  adherence  to the  respective  company's  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company, and  its  subsidiary  companies,  which  are  companies incorporated  in  India,  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those  Standards  and  the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and  perform\n\nthe  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was  established  and  maintained  and  if  such  controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment  of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained,  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion  on  the  internal  financial  controls  system  over financial  reporting  of  the  Company,  and  its  subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nBecause  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial controls  over  financial  reporting,  including  the  possibility",

Derivative financial instruments;\n- b. Financial  instruments  classified  as  fair  value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss;\n- c. The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised as the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets; and\n- d. Contingent consideration.\n\n## (iii)  Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements  in  conformity  with  Ind  AS  requires  the management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nEstimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information  about  significant  areas  of  estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting  policies  that  have  the  most  significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are included in the following notes:\n\n- a) Revenue recognition: The Company  applies judgement  to  determine  whether  each  product or service promised to a customer is capable of being  distinct,  and  is  distinct  in  the  context  of the  contract,  if  not,  the  promised  products  or services are combined and accounted as a single performance  obligation.  The  Company  allocates the arrangement  consideration  to  separately identifiable  performance  obligation  deliverables based on their relative stand-alone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price. The Company uses the  percentage  of  completion  method  using the  input  (cost  expended)  method  to  measure",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nprogress  towards  completion  in  respect  of  fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract  revenue  and  costs.  This  method  is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of  the  revenues  and  costs  applicable  to  various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs to  complete  include  estimates  of  future  labor costs  and  productivity  efficiencies.  Because  the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit and timing of revenue for remaining performance obligations are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is recorded based  on  estimate  of  future  revenue  from  the customer.\n\n- b) Impairment testing: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life recognised on business combination  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually  and  when  events  occur  or  changes  in circumstances  indicate  that the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset pertains, is less than the carrying value. The Company assesses acquired intangible assets  with  finite  useful  life  for  impairment whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be recoverable. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation of value-in-use of an asset or a cash generating unit  involves  use  of  significant  estimates  and assumptions which include turnover, growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future cash  flows,  risk-adjusted  discount  rate,  future economic and market conditions.\n- c) Income  taxes: The  major  tax  jurisdictions  for the  Company  are  India  and  the  United  States of  America.  Significant  judgments  are  involved in  determining  the  provision  for  income  taxes including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.\n- d) Deferred  taxes: Deferred  tax  is  recorded  on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  at  the  reporting  date.  The  ultimate realisation  of  deferred  tax  assets  is  dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and  tax  loss  carry-forwards  become  deductible. The  Company  considers  expected  reversal  of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realisable, however, could reduce in the near term if estimates of future taxable  income  during  the  carry-forward  period are reduced.\n- e) Business combinations: In accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded  separately  from  goodwill.  Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful life estimates),  liabilities  assumed,  and  contingent consideration  assumed  involves  management judgment.  These  measurements  are  based  on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have  been  deemed  reasonable  by  management. Changes  in  these  judgments,  estimates,  and assumptions can materially affect the results of operations.\n- f) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences: The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences  and  the  present  value  of  the  defined benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation  involves  making  various  assumptions that  may  differ  from  actual  developments  in the  future.  These  include  the  determination  of the  discount  rate,  future  salary  increases  and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n- g) Expected  credit  losses  on  financial  assets: The impairment  provisions  of  financial  assets  are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment  in  making  these  assumptions  and",

Fair value of investments is determined using  the  market  and  income  approaches.  The market  approach  includes  the  use  of  financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as  revenue,  earnings,  comparable  performance multiples,  recent  financial  rounds  and  the  level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment  and  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors, including comparable company sizes, growth rates, and  development  stages.  The  income  approach includes the use of discounted cash flow model, which  requires  significant  estimates  regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates  of  revenue  and  costs  are  developed using available historical and forecast data.\n- i) Useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and  equipment: The  Company  depreciates  property,  plant  and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets. The charge in respect of  periodic  depreciation  is  derived  based  on  an estimate  of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The lives are based on historical experience with similar  assets  as  well  as  anticipation  of  future events,  which  may  impact  their  life,  such  as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- j) Useful  lives  of  intangible  assets: The  Company amortises  intangible  assets  on  a  straight-line basis  over  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets. The  useful  life  is  estimated  based  on  a  number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry and known  technological  advances  and  the  level  of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- k) Leases: Ind  AS  116  defines  a  lease  term  as  the non-cancellable period for which the lessee has the  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  including optional  periods,  when  an  entity  is  reasonably\n\ncertain to exercise an option to extend (or not to terminate)  a  lease.  The  Company  considers  all relevant  facts  and  circumstances  that  create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise the option when determining the lease term. The option to extend lease is included in the lease term, if  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  the  lessee  would exercise the option. The Company reassesses the option  upon  occurrence  of  either  a  significant event or change in circumstances that are within the control of the lessee.\n\n- l) Provisions and contingent liabilities : The Company estimates  the  provisions  that  have  present obligations  as  a  result  of  past  events,  and  it  is probable that outflow of resources will be required to  settle  the  obligations.  These  provisions  are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n- The  Company  uses  significant  judgement  to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present  obligation  that  arises  from  past  events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or  a  reliable  estimate  of  the  amount  cannot  be made.  Contingent  assets  are  neither  recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n- m)  Other estimates: The share-based compensation expense  is  determined  based  on  the  Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. Fair valuation of derivative hedging instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges involves  significant  estimates  relating  to  the occurrence of forecasted transactions.\n- n) Uncertainty relating to the global health pandemic on  COVID-19: In  assessing  the  recoverability of receivables  including  unbilled  receivables, contract  assets  and  contract  costs,  goodwill, intangible  assets,  and  certain  investments,  the Company  has  considered  internal  and  external information  up  to  the  date  of  approval  of  these consolidated financial statements including credit reports and economic forecasts. The Company has performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used  herein.  Based  on  the  current  indicators of future  economic  conditions,  the  Company expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets.",

The Company has considered the effect of changes, if any, in both counterparty credit risk and its own credit  risk  while  assessing  hedge  effectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness and continues to believe that COVID-19 has no impact on effectiveness of its hedges.\n\nThe  impact  of  COVID-19  remains  uncertain  and may  be  different  from  what  we  have  estimated as of the date of approval of these consolidated financial  statements  and  the  Company  will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.\n\n## 3. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## (i) Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries and controlled trusts\n\nThe Company determines the basis of control in line with  the  requirements  of Ind  AS  110,  Consolidated Financial  Statements . Subsidiaries  and  controlled trusts are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the parent has power over the entity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled trusts  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\nAll  intra-Group  balances,  transactions,  income  and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill)  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  are  identified separately from the Company's equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable  net  assets.  The  choice  of  measurement basis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis. Subsequent  to  acquisition,  the  carrying  amount of  non-controlling  interest  is  the  amount  of  those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest's share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nInvestments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method are  entities  in  respect  of  which,  the  Company  has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and  operating  policies.  Generally,  a  Company  has a  significant  influence  if  it  holds  between  20  and 50  percent  of  the  voting  power  of  another  entity. Investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of investment is increased/ decreased to  recognise  investors  share  of  profit  or  loss  of  the investee after the acquisition date.\n\n## Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  of  disposal  groups  that  are available  for  immediate  sale  and  where  the  sale  is highly probable of being completed within one year from the date of classification are considered and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. Non-current assets and disposal groups  held  for  sale  are  measured  at  the  lower  of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (ii) Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each of  the  Company's  entities  are  measured  using  the currency of the primary economic environment in which these  entities  operate  (i.e.  the  'functional  currency'). These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company.\n\n## (iii)   Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\n## a) Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions  in  foreign  currency  are  translated into  the  respective  functional  currencies  using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and  from  translation  at  the  exchange  rates prevailing at the reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are  recognised  in  the  consolidated  statement of  profit  and  loss  and  reported  within  foreign exchange  gains/(losses),  net,  within  results  of operating activities except when deferred in other comprehensive  income  as  qualifying  cash  flow hedges  and  qualifying  net  investment  hedges. Gains/(losses),  net,  relating  to  translation  or settlement of borrowings denominated in foreign currency are reported within finance costs.

Translation  differences on  non-monetary  financial  assets  measured  at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified  as  financial  instruments  measured  at fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income are included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## b) Foreign operations\n\nFor the purpose  of  presenting  consolidated financial  statements,  the  assets  and  liabilities of the Company's foreign operations that have a functional currency other than Indian rupees are translated into Indian rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income and  held  in  foreign  currency  translation  reserve (FCTR), a component of equity, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to noncontrolling  interest.  When  a  foreign  operation  is disposed  of,  the  relevant  amount  recognised  in FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal.  Goodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments arising  on  the  acquisition  of  a  foreign  operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation  and  translated  at  the  exchange  rate prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## c) Others\n\nForeign currency differences arising on the translation  or  settlement  of  a  financial  liability designated  as  a  hedge  of  a  net  investment  in a foreign  operation  are  recognised  in  other comprehensive  income  and  presented  within equity  in  the  FCTR  to  the  extent  the  hedge  is effective. To the extent the hedge is ineffective, such differences  are  recognised  in  the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nWhen  the  hedged  part  of  a  net  investment  is disposed  of,  the  relevant  amount  recognised  in FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal.  Foreign  currency  differences  arising from  translation  of  intercompany  receivables or  payables  relating  to  foreign  operations,  the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of net investment in foreign operation and are recognised in FCTR.\n\n## (iv)   Financial instruments\n\n## A) Non-derivative financial instruments:\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets,  which  include  cash  and cash  equivalents,  trade  receivables,  unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances, investments in equity and debt securities and eligible current and  non-current  assets;  Financial  assets  are derecognised  when  substantial  risks  and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been  transferred.  In  cases  where  substantial risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets  are  neither  transferred  nor  retained, financial  assets  are  derecognised  only  when the Company has not retained control over the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 financial  liabilities,  which  include  long  and short-term loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade payables, lease liabilities and eligible current and non-current liabilities.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised  initially  at  fair  value.  Subsequent to initial recognition,  non-derivative  financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## a. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe  Company's  cash  and  cash  equivalents consist  of  cash  on  hand  and  in  banks  and demand deposits with banks, which can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty on the principal.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits with banks,  net  of  outstanding  bank  overdrafts that  are  repayable  on  demand  and  are considered  part  of  the  Company's  cash management  system.  In  the  consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current liabilities.\n\n## b. Investments\n\n## Financial instruments measured at amortised cost:\n\nDebt  instruments  that  meet  the  following criteria  are  measured  at  amortised  cost (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) on initial recognition):",

Other changes in fair value  of  FVTOCI  financial  assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.  When  the  investment  is  disposed of,  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  previously accumulated in reserves is transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL):\n\nInstruments that do not meet the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria are measured at FVTPL. Financial  assets  at  FVTPL  are  measured at  fair  value  at  the  end  of  each  reporting period,  with  any  gains  or  losses  arising  on re-measurement recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss. The gain or loss on disposal is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nInterest income is recognised in the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss for  FVTPL  debt  instruments.  Dividend  on\n\nfinancial  assets  at  FVTPL  is  recognised when the Group's right to receive dividend is established.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments:\n\nThe Company carries certain equity instruments  which  are  not  held  for  trading. At initial recognition, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument in other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or through statement of profit and loss (FVTPL). For investments designated to  be  classified  as  FVTOCI,  movements  in fair  value  of  investments  are  recognised  in other  comprehensive  income  and  the  gain or  loss  is  not  transferred  to  consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  on  disposal  of investments. For investments designated to be  classified  as  FVTPL,  both  movements  in fair value of investments and gain or loss on disposal of investments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nDividends from these investments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company's right to receive dividends is established.\n\n## c. Other financial assets:\n\nOther  financial  assets  are  non-derivative financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active market.  They  are  presented  as  current assets, except for those maturing later than 12  months  after  the  reporting  date  which are presented as non-current assets. These are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  and subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment  losses.  These  comprise  trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances  and  eligible  current  and  noncurrent assets.\n\n## d.

The  Company  enters  into  derivative financial  instruments  where  the  counterparty  is primarily a bank.\n\nDerivatives  are  recognised  and  measured  at fair value.  Attributable  transaction  costs  are recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss as cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## a. Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative hedging instruments designated as a cash  flow  hedge  are  recognised  in  other comprehensive income and held in cash flow hedging reserve, net of taxes, a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective. To  the  extent  that  the  hedge  is  ineffective, changes  in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss and reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses),  net  within  results  from  operating activities. If the hedging instrument no longer meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging  instrument expires  or  is  sold,  terminated  or  exercised, the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow  hedging  reserve  is  transferred  to  the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, such cumulative\n\nbalance  is  immediately  recognised  in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\n## b. Hedges of net investment in foreign operations\n\nThe Company designates derivative financial instruments as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Company designates foreign currency denominated borrowing as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations. Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative hedging  instruments  and  gains/losses  on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated  borrowings  designated  as  a hedge of net investment in foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income  and  presented  within  equity  in  the FCTR to the extent that the hedge is effective. To  the  extent  that  the  hedge  is  ineffective, changes  in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss and reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses),  net  within  results  from  operating activities.\n\n## c. Others\n\nChanges  in  fair  value  of  foreign  currency derivative instruments neither designated as cash flow hedges nor hedges of net investment in  foreign  operations  are  recognised  in  the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss and reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses),  net  within  results  from  operating activities.  Changes  in  fair  value  and  gains/ (losses), net, on settlement of foreign currency derivative instruments relating to borrowings, which have not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance costs.\n\n## C)   Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nThe  Company  derecognises  a  financial  asset when  the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows from  the  financial  asset  expire  or  it  transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. If the Company retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards of  a  transferred  financial  asset,  the  Company continues  to  recognise  the  financial  asset  and recognises a borrowing for the proceeds received. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is  derecognised  from  the  group's  balance  sheet when  the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is discharged or cancelled or expires.",

Cost includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to  the  construction  of  a  qualifying  asset  are capitalised as part of the cost.\n\nCapital  work-in-progress  are  measured  at  cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## b) Depreciation\n\nThe  Company  depreciates  property,  plant  and equipment  over  the  estimated  useful  life  on  a straight-line  basis  from  the  date  the  assets  are available  for  use.  Leasehold  improvements  are amortised  over  the  shorter  of  estimated  useful life of the asset or the related lease term. Term licenses  are  amortised  over  their  respective contract  term.  Freehold  land  is  not  depreciated. The  estimated  useful  life  of  assets  is  reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted, annually. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                          | Useful life    |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                         | 28 to 40 years |\n| Plant and equipment               | 5 to 21 years  |\n| Computer equipment and software   | 2 to 7 years   |\n| Furniture, fixtures and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Vehicles                          | 4 to 5 years   |\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.  Subsequent  expenditure  relating  to\n\nproperty, plant and equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress.\n\n## (vii)  Business combinations, Goodwill and Intangible assets\n\n## a) Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  using the purchase (acquisition) method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and  equity  instruments  issued  at  the  date  of exchange  by  the  Company.  Identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition. Transaction  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration measured as at the date of acquisition. Any subsequent changes to  the  fair  value  of  contingent  consideration classified as liabilities, other than measurement period adjustments, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\n## b) Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company's share in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is  recognised as  goodwill.  If  the  excess  is  negative,  a  bargain purchase gain is recognised in equity as capital reserve. Goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less accumulated impairment (if any).\n\nGoodwill associated with disposal of an operation that is part of cash-generating unit is measured based  on  the  relative  values  of  the  operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit  retained,  unless  some  other  method  better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following",

Accordingly, the definition of lease in accordance with Ind AS 17 will continue to  be  applied  to  lease  contracts  entered  by  the Company or modified by the Company before April 1, 2019,\n- b) The  Company  has  applied  a  single  discount rate  to  a  portfolio  of  leases  of  similar  assets  in similar economic environment. Consequently, the Company  has  recorded  its  lease  liability  using the  present  value  of  remaining  lease  payments, discounted  using  the  incremental  borrowing rate  at  the  date  of  initial  application  and  the Right-of-Use(' RoU ') asset at its carrying amount as  if  the  standard  had  been  applied  since  the commencement date of the lease, but discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application,\n- c) The Company excluded the initial direct costs from measurement of the RoU asset,\n- d) The Company does not recognize RoU assets and lease  liabilities  for  leases  with  less  than  twelve months of lease term and low-value assets on the date of initial application.\n\nThe weighted average of discount rates applied to lease liabilities as at April 1, 2019 is 5.7%.\n\nOn adoption of Ind AS 116,\n\n- a) the  Company  has  recognised  RoU  assets  of ' 13,630  and  corresponding  lease  liability  of ' 15,379,\n- b) the net carrying value of assets procured under the finance lease of ' 1,243 (gross carrying value and accumulated depreciation of ' 3,420 and ' 2,177, respectively) have been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to RoU assets ,\n- c) the  obligations  under  finance  leases  of ' 2,002 (non-current and current obligation under finance leases ' 496 and ' 1,506, respectively) have been reclassified to lease liabilities,\n- d) prepaid rent on leasehold land and other assets, which were earlier classified under 'Other Assets' have been reclassified to RoU assets by ' 2,222.\n\nThe  adoption  of  the  new  standard  has  resulted  in  a reduction of ' 872 in retained earnings, net of deferred tax asset of ' 138.\n\nThe Company evaluates each contract or arrangement, whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116.\n\n## The Company as a lessee\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  an  arrangement  for  lease of  land,  buildings,  plant  and  equipment  including computer equipment and vehicles. Such arrangements are generally for a fixed period but may have extension or termination options. The Company assesses, whether the contract is, or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to -\n\n- (a) control use of an identified asset,\n- (b) obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and\n- (c) direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  lease  term  as  the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with periods covered  by  an  option  to  extend  the  lease,  where  the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nThe Company at the commencement of the lease contract recognises a RoU asset at cost and corresponding lease liability, except for leases with term of less than twelve months (short-term leases) and low-value assets. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Company",

Subsequently, the RoU assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The RoU assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Company applies Ind AS 36 to determine whether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of nonfinancial assets below.\n\nFor lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease, the Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.  The  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow  funds,  including  the  consideration  of  factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment.\n\nAfter  the  commencement  date,  the  amount  of  lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe  Company  recognises  the  amount  of  the  remeasurement  of  lease  liability  as  an  adjustment  to the  RoU  assets.  Where  the  carrying  amount  of  the RoU  asset  is  reduced  to  zero  and  there  is  a  further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement in consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nLease liability payments are classified as cash used in financing  activities  in  the  consolidated  statement  of cash flows.\n\n## The Company as a lessor\n\nLeases under which the Company is a lessor are classified as a finance or operating lease. Lease contracts where all the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the lessee, are classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating lease.\n\nFor leases under which the Company is an intermediate lessor, the Company accounts for the head-lease and the  sub-lease  as  two  separate  contracts.  The  sublease is further classified either as a finance lease or an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the head-lease.\n\n## (ix)   Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value, including necessary provision for obsolescence. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.\n\n## (x) Impairment\n\n## a) Financial assets\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  expected  credit  loss model for recognizing impairment loss on financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost, debt  instruments  classified  as  FVTOCI,  trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, finance  lease  receivables,  and  other  financial assets.  Expected  credit  loss  is  the  difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive, discounted using the effective interest rate.\n\nLoss  allowances  for  trade  receivables,  unbilled receivables,  contract  assets  and  finance  lease receivables are measured at an amount equal to lifetime  expected  credit  loss.  Lifetime  expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result  from  all  possible  default  events  over  the expected  life  of  a  financial  instrument.  Lifetime expected  credit  loss  is  computed  based  on  a provision  matrix  which  takes  in  to  account, risk  profiling  of  customers  and  historical  credit loss  experience  adjusted  for  forward  looking information. For other financial assets, expected credit  loss  is  measured  at  the  amount  equal  to twelve months expected credit loss unless there has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk from  initial  recognition,  in  which  case  those  are measured at lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## b) Non-financial assets\n\nThe  Company  assesses  long-lived  assets  such as  property,  plant  and  equipment,  RoU  assets and  acquired  intangible  assets  for  impairment whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. If any such  indication  exists,  the  Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of assets.",

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash -generating units which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  or  cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost  of  disposal  (' FVLCD ')  and  its  value-in-use (' VIU '). The VIU of long-lived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of a cash generating  unit  is  computed  using  turnover  and earnings multiples. If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously  assessed  impairment  loss  no  longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment losses previously recognised are reversed such that the asset is recognised at its recoverable  amount  but  not  exceeding  written down  value  which  would  have  been  reported  if the  impairment  losses  had  not  been  recognised initially. An impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n\n## (xi)   Employee benefits\n\n## Post-employment and pension plans\n\nThe  Group  participates  in  various  employee  benefit plans. Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined  benefit  plans.  Under  a  defined  contribution plan,  the  Company's  only  obligation  is  to  pay  a  fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognised as an expense during the period when the employee provides service. Under  a  defined  benefit  plan,  it  is  the  Company's obligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the Company. The present value of the defined benefit obligations  is  calculated  by  an  independent  actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nRemeasurements  of the defined benefit plans, comprising  actuarial  gains  or  losses,and  the  return on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  are  immediately recognised in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and  not  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in  subsequent period.\n\nNet interest recognised in profit or loss is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit  obligation  to  the  net  defined  benefit  liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or  below  the  discount  rate,  is  recognised  as  part  of remeasurements of the defined benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\nThe Company has the following employee benefit plans:\n\n## a. Provident fund\n\nEmployees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. The employer and employees  each  make  periodic  contributions  to the plan. A portion of the contribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to the government administered pension fund. The contributions to the trust managed by the Company is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return.\n\n## b. Superannuation\n\nSuperannuation  plan,  a  defined  contribution scheme  is  administered  by  third  party  fund managers. The Company makes annual contributions based on a specified percentage of each eligible employee's salary.\n\n## c. Gratuity and Pension\n\nIn accordance  with  the  Payment  of  Gratuity Act,  1972,  applicable  for  Indian  companies,  the Company  provides  for  a  lump  sum  payment  to eligible  employees,  at  retirement  or  termination of  employment  based  on  the  last  drawn  salary and  years  of  employment  with  the  Company. The gratuity fund is managed by third party fund managers.\n\nThe Company also maintains pension and similar plans for employees outside India, based on country specific  regulations.  These  plans  are  partially funded, and the funds are managed by third party fund  managers.  The  plans  provide  for  monthly payout after retirement as per salary drawn and service period or for a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund.",

The  Company recognises  remeasurement  gains  and  losses  of the  net  defined  benefit  liability/(asset)  in  other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## d. Termination benefits\n\nTermination  benefits  are  expensed  when  the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\n## e. Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are measured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are recorded  as  expense  as  the  related  service  is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or  profit-sharing  plans,  if  the  Company  has  a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee  and  the  obligation  can  be  estimated reliably.\n\n## f. Compensated absences\n\nThe  employees  of  the  Company  are  entitled  to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised accumulating compensated  absences  and  utilise  it  in  future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this  entitlement.  The  Company  measures  the expected  cost  of  compensated  absences  as  the additional  amount  that  the  Company  expects  to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company  recognises  accumulated  compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the projected  unit  credit  method.  Non-accumulating compensated  absences  are  recognised  in  the period in which the absences occur.\n\n## (xii)  Share-based payment transactions\n\nSelected employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments or  cash  settled  instruments,  for  rendering  services over  a  defined  vesting  period  and  for  Company's performance-based  stock  options  over  the  defined period.  Equity  instruments  granted  are  measured  by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant. In cases, where equity instruments are granted\n\nat a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to the share options outstanding account, a component of equity.\n\nThe  equity  instruments  or  cash  settled  instruments generally  vest  in  a  graded  manner  over  the  vesting period.  The  fair  value  determined  at  the  grant  date is expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such grants (accelerated amortisation). The stock compensation expense is determined based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will eventually vest.\n\nCash Settled instruments granted are re-measured by reference to the fair value at the end of each reporting period  and  at  the  time  of  vesting.  The  expense  is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to financial liability.\n\n## (xiii) Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Company  has  a present obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe  amount  recognised  as  a  provision  is  the  best estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and  the  amount  of  the  receivable  can  be  measured reliably.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions  for  onerous  contracts  are  measured  at the  present  value  of  lower  of  the  expected  net  cost of  fulfilling  the  contract  and  the  expected  cost  of terminating the contract.\n\n## (xiv)   Revenue\n\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from software development, maintenance of software/hardware and related services, business process services, sale of IT and other products.",

Revenue  is  recognised  upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products  or  services.  To  recognise  revenues,  the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognise revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAt  contract  inception,  the  Company  assesses  its promise to transfer products or services to a customer to  identify  separate  performance  obligations.  The Company  applies  judgement  to  determine  whether each  product  or  service  promised  to  a  customer  is capable of being distinct, and is distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised product or service is combined and accounted as a single performance obligation.  The  Company  allocates  the  arrangement consideration  to  separately  identifiable  performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling price or residual method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses third-party prices for similar deliverables  or  the  Company  uses  expected  costplus  margin  approach  in  estimating  the  stand-alone selling price.\n\nFor performance obligations where control is transferred over  time,  revenues  are  recognised  by  measuring progress  towards  completion  of  the  performance obligation.  The  selection  of  the  method  to  measure progress  towards  completion  requires  judgment  and is  based  on  the  nature  of  the  promised  products  or services to be provided.\n\nThe method for recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the services rendered:\n\n## A. Time and materials contracts\n\nRevenues and costs relating to time and material contractsare  recognised  as  the  related  services are rendered.\n\n## B. Fixed-price contracts\n\n## i. Fixed-price development contracts\n\nRevenues from fixed-price development contracts,  including  software  development, and integration contracts, where the performance  obligations  are  satisfied  over time, are recognised using the 'percentageof-completion'  method.  The  performance obligations  are  satisfied  as  and  when  the services  are  rendered  since  the  customer generally  obtains  control  of  the  work  as  it progresses.  Percentage  of  completion  is determined based on project costs incurred to  date  as  a  percentage  of  total  estimated project costs required  to  complete  the project. The cost expended (or input) method has been used to measure progress towards  completion  as  there  is  a  direct relationship between input and productivity. If  the  Company  is  not  able  to  reasonably measure the progress of completion, revenue is  recognised  only  to  the  extent  of  costs incurred for which recoverability is probable. When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognised  in  the  consolidated  statement of profit and loss in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract  estimates  as  an  onerous  contract provision.\n\nA  contract  asset  is  a  right  to  consideration that  is  conditional  upon  factors  other  than the passage of time. Contract assets primarily relate  to  unbilled  amounts  on  fixed-price development contracts and are classified as non-financial asset as the contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.\n\nA contract liability is an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.\n\nUnbilled  receivables  on  other  than  fixedprice  development  contracts  are  classified as  a  financial  asset  where  the  right  to consideration is unconditional and  only the  passage  of  time  is  required  before  the payment is due.",

Maintenance contracts\n\nRevenues related to fixed-price maintenance contracts  are  recognised  on  a  straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using percentage of  completion  method  when  the  pattern  of benefits  from  the  services  rendered  to  the customers and the cost to fulfil the contract is  not  even  through  the  period  of  contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive.\n\nRevenue for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered is recognised based on our right to invoice. If our invoicing is not consistent with value delivered,  revenues  are  recognised  as  the service is performed using the percentage of completion method.\n\nIn certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is agreed at a fixed price for a  fixed  term.  In  such  contracts,  revenue  is recognised with respect to the actual output achieved  till  date  as  a  percentage  of  total contractual  output.  Any  residual  service unutilised by the customer is recognised as revenue on completion of the term.\n\n## iii. Element or Volume based contracts\n\nRevenues  and  costs  are  recognised  as  the related services are rendered.\n\n## C. Products\n\nRevenue  on  product  sales  are  recognised  when the  customer  obtains  control  of  the  specified product.\n\n## D. Others\n\n- \u00b7 Any change in scope or price is considered as a contract modification. The Company accounts for modifications  to  existing  contracts  by assessing  whether  the  services  added  are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct  are  accounted  for  on  a  cumulative catch  up  basis,  while  those  that  are  distinct are  accounted  for  prospectively,  either  as  a separate  contract  if  the  additional  services are priced at the stand-alone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the stand-alone selling price.\n- \u00b7 The Company accounts for variable considerations like, volume discounts, rebates  and  pricing  incentives  to  customers and  penalties  as  reduction  of  revenue  on  a systematic and rational basis over the period of  the  contract.  The  Company  estimates  an amount  of  such  variable  consideration  using expected value method or the single most likely amount  in  a  range  of  possible  consideration depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company may be entitled and when it is probable that a  significant  reversal  of  cumulative  revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\n- \u00b7 Revenues  are  shown  net  of  allowances/ returns, sales tax, value added tax, goods and services  tax  and  applicable  discounts  and allowances.\n- \u00b7 The  Company  accrues  the  estimated  cost  of warranties  at  the  time  when  the  revenue  is recognised.  The  accruals  are  based  on  the Company's  historical  experience  of  material usage and service delivery costs.\n- \u00b7 Incremental  costs  that  relate  directly  to  a contract  and  incurred  in  securing  a  contract with  a  customer  are  recognised  as  an  asset when  the  Company  expects  to  recover  these costs and amortised over the contract term.\n- \u00b7 The  Company  recognises  contract  fulfilment cost as an asset if those costs specifically relate to a contract or to an anticipated contract, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in  future;  and  the  costs  are  expected  to  be recovered. The asset so recognised is amortised on  a  systematic  basis  consistent  with  the transfer  of  goods  or  services  to  customer  to which the asset relates.\n- \u00b7 The  Company  assesses  the  timing  of  the transfer of goods or services to the customer as  compared  to  the  timing  of  payments  to determine  whether  a  significant  financing component  exists.  As  a  practical  expedient, the  Company  does  not  assess  the  existence of a significant financing component when the difference  between  payment  and  transfer  of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in  timing  arises  for  reasons  other  than  the provision  of  finance  to  either  the  customer",

In such cases, the Company evaluates whether  the  Company  is  the  principal  (i.e. report  revenues  on  a  gross  basis)  or  agent (i.e. report revenues on a net basis). In doing so,  the  Company  first  evaluates  whether  the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If Company controls  the  good  or  service  before  it  is transferred  to  the  customer,  Company  is  the principal; if not, the Company is the agent.\n- \u00b7 Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term  of  the  contract  and  are  recognised  in net profit in the period when these estimates change  or  when  the  estimates  are  revised. Revenues  and  the  estimated  total  costs  or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses.\n\n## (xv)  Finance costs\n\nFinance costs comprises interest cost on borrowings, lease liabilities and net defined benefit liability, gains or losses arising on re-measurement of financial assets measured  at  FVTPL,  gains/(losses)  on  translation  or settlement of foreign currency borrowings and changes in fair value and gains/ (losses) on settlement of related derivative  instruments.  Borrowing  costs  that  are  not directly attributable to a qualifying asset are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method.\n\n## (xvi)  Finance and other income\n\nFinance and other income comprises interest income on  deposits,  dividend  income  and  gains/(losses)  on disposal of investments. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is  recognised  when  the  right  to  receive  payment  is established.\n\n## (xvii)  Income tax\n\nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## a) Current income tax\n\nCurrent  income  tax  for  the  current  and  prior periods  are  measured  at  the  amount  expected to  be  recovered  from  or  paid  to  the  taxation authorities based on the taxable income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period. While determining the tax provisions, the Company assesses whether each  uncertain  tax  position  is  to  be  considered separately or together with one or more uncertain tax  positions  depending  upon  the  nature  and circumstances of each uncertain tax position. The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax  liabilities,  where  it  has  a  legally  enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously.\n\n## b) Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred  income  tax  is  recognised  using  the balance  sheet  approach.  Deferred  income  tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the  tax  base  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their carrying  amount  in  these  consolidated  financial statements,  except  when  the  deferred  income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or  an  asset  or  liability  in  a  transaction  that  is not  a  business  combination  and  affects  neither accounting nor taxable profits or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profit  will  be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  recognised for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  except  in respect of taxable temporary differences that is expected to reverse within the tax holiday period, taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with investments in subsidiaries, associates and foreign branches where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

Diluted earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted average number of equity and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for options, except where the results would be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe  number  of  equity  shares  and  potentially  dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented  for  any  splits  and  bonus  shares  issues including for change effected prior to the approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors.\n\n## (xix) Statement of cash flows\n\nCash  flows  are  reported  using  the  indirect  method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash from operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  of  the Company are segregated.\n\n## (xx)  Assets held for sale\n\nSale of business is classified as held for sale, if their\n\ncarrying amount is intended to be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. The condition  for  classification  as  held  for  sale  is  met when disposal business is available for immediate sale and  the  same  is  highly  probable  of  being  completed within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\n## (xxi)  Discontinued operations\n\nA  discontinued  operation  is  a  component  of  the Company's business that represents a separate line of business that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\n## (xxii) Disposal of assets\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  arising  on  disposal  or  retirement  of assets is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nNew Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Company e/ffective from April 1, 2020:\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 103- Business combinations\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs  ('MCA')  has  issued amendments to Ind AS 103, 'Business Combinations', in connection with clarification of business definition, which help in determining whether an acquisition made is of a business or a group of assets. The amendment added  a  test  that  makes  it  easier  to  conclude  that a  Company  has  acquired  a  group  of  assets,  rather than a business, if the value of the assets acquired is substantially all concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets. The adoption of amendment to Ind AS 103 is applicable to new acquisition on a prospective basis and did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe MCA amended some of its requirements for hedge accounting.  The  amendments  provide  relief  from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform. In addition, the amendments require companies to provide additional information to investors about their hedging relationships that are directly affected by these uncertainties.  The  adoption  of  amendment  to  Ind  AS 109 and Ind AS 107 did not have any significant material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.",

The amendments clarify the definition of 'material' and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance that until now has featured elsewhere in Ind AS Standards. The new definition clarifies that, information is considered material  if  omitting,  misstating,  or  obscuring  such information, could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial  statements  make  based  on  those  financial statements.  The  definition  of  material  in  Ind  AS  8 has been replaced by a reference to the definition of material in Ind AS 1. In addition, the MCA amended other Standards that contain a definition of material or refer to the term 'material' to ensure consistency. The adoption of the amendment to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8 did not have any material impact on its evaluation of materiality in relation to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 116 - Leases\n\nThe MCA issued amendments to Ind AS 116, 'Leases', provide  lessees  with  an  exemption  from  assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. The amendments allowed the expedient to  be  applied  to  COVID-19-related  rent  concessions to payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021 and also require disclosure of the amount recognised in profit or loss to reflect changes in lease payments that  arise  from  COVID-19-related  rent  concessions. The  reporting  period  in  which  a  lessee  first  applies the amendment, it is not required to disclose certain quantitative  information  required  under  Ind  AS  8. Accordingly, the Company recognised ' 61 as reversal of lease liability in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year ended March 31, 2021 respectively.\n\n## New  Accounting  standards  not  yet  adopted  by  the Company:\n\nMCA  notifies  new  standard  or  amendments  to  the existing standards.

Goodwill and other intangible Assets\n\nThe movement in goodwill balance is given below:\n\n|                                                              | Year ended  March 31, 2021   | Year ended  March 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the year                         | '  126,894                   | '  113,220                   |\n| Translation adjustment                                       | (1,219)                      | 8,841                        |\n| Acquisition through business combinations* (Refer to Note 7) | 9,472                        | 4,833                        |\n| Balance at the end of the year                               | '  135,147                   | '  126,894                   |\n\nThe Company is organised by three operating segments: IT Services, IT Products and India State Run Enterprise Services. Goodwill as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 has been allocated to the IT Services operating segment.\n\nGoodwill recognised on business combinations is allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs), within the IT Services operating segment, which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisitions.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company re-organised its IT Services segment from seven industry verticals to four Strategic Market Units (Refer to Note 36). Accordingly, goodwill has been re-allocated to the CGUs, using a relative value approach as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 as follows:\n\n|                                         | Year ended  March 31, 2021   | Year ended  March 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| CGUs                                    |                              |                              |\n| Americas 1                              | '  64,469                    | '  63,323                    |\n| Americas 2                              | 32,172                       | 30,463                       |\n| Europe                                  | 24,953                       | 20,404                       |\n| Asia Pacific Middle East Africa (APMEA) | 13,553                       | 12,704                       |\n|                                         | '  135,147                   | '  126,894                   |\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company's procedure for determining the recoverable value of each CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the market capitalisation approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nBased on the above testing, no impairment was identified as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the calculation's sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings multiples), did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU's recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.\n\nThe movement in other intangible assets is given below:\n\n|                                                             | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   | Other intangible assets   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                             | Customer-related          | Marketing-related         | Total                     |\n| Gross carrying value:                                       |                           |                           |                           |\n| As at April 1, 2020                                         | '  32,490                 | '  6,698                  | '  39,188                 |\n| Translation adjustment                                      | (56)                      | (159)                     | (215)                     |\n| Acquisition through business combinations (Refer to Note 7) | 2,460                     | 828                       | 3,288                     |\n| Deductions/Adjustments                                      | (8,568)                   | (5,756)                   | (14,324)                  |\n| As at March 31, 2021                                        | '  26,326                 | '  1,611                  | '  27,937                 |",

The Company's long-term debt has been contracted at market rates of interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair value. Further, finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances approximates the fair value.\n\nInvestments in liquid and short-term mutual funds, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset values at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date. Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified as FVTOCI is determined using market and income approaches.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and forward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nThe following table presents fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n\n|                                                       | As at March 31, 2021                      | As at March 31, 2021                      | As at March 31, 2021                      | As at March 31, 2021                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Particulars                                           | Fair value measurements at reporting date | Fair value measurements at reporting date | Fair value measurements at reporting date | Fair value measurements at reporting date |\n|                                                       | Total                                     | Level 1                                   | Level 2                                   | Level 3                                   |\n| Assets                                                |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| Derivative instruments:                               |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                                      | '  2,998                                  | '  -

Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying. As at March 31, 2021, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.\n\nInvestment in commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds: Fair value of these instruments is derived based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market as at reporting date.\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 3 financial instruments included in the above table.\n\nInvestment in equity instruments: Fair value of these instruments is determined using market and income approaches.\n\n## Details of assets and liabilities considered under Level 3 classification\n\n| Investment in equity instruments                               | As at March 31, 2021   | As  at March 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the year                           | '  9,178               | '  6,668                |\n| Additions                                                      | 1,575                  | 2,124                   |\n| Disposals                                                      | (1,256)                | (1,327)                 |\n| Transfers out of level 3                                       | (27)                   | -                       |\n| Gain/(loss) recognized in foreign currency translation reserve | (252)                  | 855                     |\n| Gain recognized in other comprehensive income                  | 1,009                  | 858                     |\n| Balance at the end of the year                                 | '  10,227              | '  9,178                |\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, as a result of M&A transactions, the Company sold its shares in CloudGenix and Emailage Corp at a fair value of ' 1,256 and recognised a cumulative gain of ' 884 in other comprehensive income.\n\n|                                                                | As at  March 31, 2021   | As at  March 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Contingent consideration                                       |                         |                         |\n| Balance at the beginning of the year                           | '  -                    | '  -                    |\n| Additions (Refer to Note 7)                                    | (2,293)                 | -                       |\n| Finance expense recognised in statement of profit and loss     | (25)                    | -                       |\n| Gain/(loss) recognised in foreign currency translation reserve | 25                      | -                       |\n| Balance at the end of the year                                 | '  (2,293)              | -                       |\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, as a result of M&A transactions, the Company sold its shares in CloudGenix and Emailage Corp at a fair value of ' 1,256 and recognised a cumulative gain of ' 884 in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Description of significant unobservable inputs to valuation:\n\n| As at March 31, 2021   |                     |                          |       |          |          |          |\n|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Items                  | Valuation technique | Significant unobservable | Input | Movement | Increase | Decrease |\n|                        |                     | input                    |       | by       | ( ' )    | ( ' )    |\n| Unquoted equity        | Discounted          | Long term growth rate    | 3.0%  | 0.5%     | 304      | (295)    |\n| investments            | cash flow model     | Discount rate            | 10.9% | 0.5%     | (393)    | 395      |\n\n## As at March 31, 2020\n\n| Items           | Valuation technique   | Significant unobservable  input   | Input   | Movement  by   | Increase  '   | Decrease   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------|------------|\n|                 |                       |                                   |         |                | ( )           | ( ' )      |\n| Unquoted equity | Discounted            | Long term growth rate             | 3.0%    | 0.5%           | 298           | (273)      |\n| investments     | cash flow model       | Discount rate                     | 11.6%   | 0.5%           | (388)         | 404        |\n\nAs at March 31, 2021 and 2020, 0.5 percentage point increase/(decrease) in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of other Level 3 assets does not have a significant impact in its value.",

Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2021and 2020 is not material.\n\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected as part of borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company's earnings and equity to losses.\n\n## Risk Management Procedures\n\nThe Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe  Company  operates  internationally,  and  a  major  portion  of  its  business  is  transacted  in  several  currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows. The Company also designates foreign currency borrowings as hedge against respective net investments in foreign operations.\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, a ' 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in approximately ' 3,095 (consolidated statement of profit and loss ' 1,395 and other comprehensive income ' 1,700) decrease in the fair value, and a ' 1 decrease would result in approximately ' 2,845 (consolidated statement of profit and loss ' 1,395 and other comprehensive income ' 1,450) increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative instruments (forward and option contracts).\n\nThe below table presents foreign currency risk from non-derivative financial instruments as at March 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n|                                                | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   | As at March 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Particulars                                    | US $                   | Euro                   | Pound  Sterling        | Australian  Dollar     | Canadian  Dollar       | Other  currencies #

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other lines of credit. The Company's investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. The Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as onMarch 31, 2021, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ' 829.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Company's corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management.

Revenue from Operations\n\n## A. Contract Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognises a receivable for revenues related to time and materials contracts or volume based contracts. The Company presents such receivables as part of unbilled receivables at their net estimated realisable value. The same is tested for impairment as per the guidance in Ind AS 109 using expected credit loss method.\n\nContract assets: During the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, ' 15,101 and ' 13,068 of contract assets pertaining to fixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n\nContract liabilities: During the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognised revenue of ' 16,082 and ' 21,193 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\n\nContract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## B. Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRevenue  allocated  to  remaining  performance  obligations  represents  contracted  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been recognised, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n\nAs  at  March  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  aggregate  amount  of  transaction  price  allocated  to  remaining  performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ' 384,881 and ' 360,033, respectively, of which approximately 59% and 62%, respectively, is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\n\n## C.  Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment(refer to Note 36 'Segment Information'), sector and type of contract. The Company believes that the below disaggregation best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from economic factors",

The estimates of future salary increase considered takes into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors. Attrition rate considered is the management's estimate, based on previous years' employee turnover of the Company.\n\n## The expected future contribution and estimated future benefit payments from the fund are as follows:\n\n| Expected contribution to the fund during the year ending March 31, 2022   | '  1,787   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Estimated benefit payments from the fund for the year ending March 31:    |            |\n| 2022                                                                      | '  1,802   |\n| 2023                                                                      | 1,417      |\n| 2024                                                                      | 1,406      |\n| 2025                                                                      | 1,385      |\n| 2026                                                                      | 1,361      |\n| Thereafter                                                                | 15,915     |\n| Total                                                                     | '  23,286  |\n\nThe expected benefits are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company's benefit obligations as of March 31, 2021.\n\nSensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed to show the movement in defined benefit obligation by 1 percentage.",

Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified and carry forward losses on acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment to goodwill. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n\nDeferred tax asset amounting to ' 8,676 and ' 8,124 as at March 31, 2021and 2020, respectively in respect of unused tax losses have not been recognised by the Company. The tax loss carry-forwards of ' 31,993 and ' 29,736 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the Company, because it is probable that future taxable profits will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. Approximately, ' 17,691 and ' 14,429 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards is not currently subject to expiration dates. The remaining tax loss carry-forwards of approximately ' 14,302 and ' 15,307 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, expires in various years through fiscal 2038.\n\nThe Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ' 1,637 and ' 2,044 primarily in respect of carry forward losses including certain subsidiaries as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Management's projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise these deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Company calculates its tax liability for domestic taxes after considering MAT. The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions. Deferred tax asset relating to MAT payment of ' Nil and ' 3,425 has been recognised in the statement of consolidated financial position as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company's India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to export operations and profits from units established under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme.",

Certain tax benefits are also available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ' 11,458 and ' 11,963 for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate the Company would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was ' 2.03 and ' 2.05, respectively.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, deferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries amounting to ' 59,793 and ' 56,391 as at March 31, 2021and 2020, respectively and branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profit have not been recognised. Further, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n\n## 29.

The Company's focus is on keeping a strong total equity base to ensure independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Company.\n\nThe Company's goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual dividends in future periods.\n\nThe amount of future dividends/ buyback of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.\n\nThe capital structure as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | As at   March 31, 2021   | As at   March 31, 2020   | % Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| Equity attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company (A) | '  549,010               | '  553,217               | (0.76)%    |\n| As percentage of total capital                                    | 84%                      | 85%                      |            |\n| Current borrowings*                                               | 75,874                   | 73,202                   |            |\n| Non-current borrowings                                            | 7,458                    | 4,840                    |            |\n| Lease liabilities                                                 | 21,182                   | 19,198                   |            |\n| Total borrowings and lease liabilities (B)                        | '  104,514               | '  97,240                | 7.48%      |\n| As percentage of total capital                                    | 16%                      | 15%                      |            |\n| Total capital (A) + (B)                                           | '  653,524               | '  650,457               | 0.47%      |\n\nBorrowings represents 16% and 15% of total capital as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company is not subjected to any externally imposed capital requirements.\n\n## 35.  Commitments and Contingencies\n\nCapital commitments: As at March 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company had committed to spend approximately ' 7,490 and ' 14,011 respectively, under agreements to purchase/construct property and equipment. These amounts are net of capital advances paid in respect of these purchases.\n\nGuarantees: As at March 31, 2021and 2020, guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the Company to the Indian Government, customers and certain other agencies amount to approximately ' 17,128 and ' 18,655 respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.\n\nContingencies and lawsuits: The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims (including tax assessment orders/ penalty notices) which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business. Some of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Company's assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2016 in India. The Company has received demands on multiple tax issues in India. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the Company's undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the appeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor",

Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits on profits earned from Software Technology Park and Special Economic Zone units, capitalisation of research & development expenses, transfer pricing adjustments on intercompany / inter unit transactions and other issues.\n\nIncome tax claims against the Company amounting to ' 80,032 and ' 77,873 are not acknowledged as debt as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These matters are pending before various Appellate Authorities and the management expects its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for excise duty, custom duty, sales tax and other matters amounting to ' 11,413 and ' 8,033 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. However, the resolution of these disputed demands is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, through a ruling in February 2019, provided interpretation on the components of Salary on which the Company and its employees are to contribute towards Provident Fund under the Employee's Provident Fund Act. Based on the current evaluation, the Company believes it is not probable that certain components of Salary paid by the Company will be subject to contribution towards Provident Fund due to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India order. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments.\n\n## 36.

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Wipro Limited\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Wipro Limited and subsidiaries (the 'Company')  as  of  March  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 9, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 3 and 3(viii) to the financial statements, the  Company  has  changed  its  method  of  accounting  for leases in fiscal year 2020 due to adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard 16, Leases .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial  statements  based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud.  Our  audits included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\n\nthe  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising  from  the  current-period  audit  of  the  financial statements  that  were  communicated  or  required  to  be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging, subjective,  or  complex  judgments.  The  communication  of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate  opinions  on  the  critical  audit  matters  or  on  the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iv)(a), 3(xiv)B and 24 to the financial statements .\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nRevenue  from  fixed-price  contracts,  including  software development, and integration contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\n\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company  to  determine  the  project  costs  incurred  to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The estimation of total project costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated  losses,  if  any,  on  uncompleted  contracts  are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated project costs.\n\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts where the percentage-of-completion method is used as a critical  audit  matter  because  of  the  significant  judgment involved in estimating the efforts to complete such contracts.\n\nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred to-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the lives of the contracts.\n\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence supporting the application of the input method used to recognize revenue and a higher extent of audit  effort  to  evaluate  the  reasonableness  of  the  total estimated  amount  of  revenue  recognized  on  fixed-price contracts.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  estimates  of  efforts  to complete  for  fixed-price  contracts  accounted  using  the percentage-of-completion  method  included  the  following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  (1) recording  of  efforts  incurred  and  estimation  of  efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations,  and  (2)  access  and  application  controls pertaining to time recording and allocation systems, which prevents  unauthorised  changes  to  recording  of  efforts incurred.\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated management's  ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation by comparing actual information to estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n- \u00b7 We  selected  a  sample  of  fixed  price  contracts  with customers  accounted  using  percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:\n- o  Read  the  contract  and  based  on  the  terms  and conditions evaluated whether recognizing revenue over time was appropriate, and the contract was included in management's calculation of revenue over time.\n- o  Evaluated other information that supported the estimates  of  the  progress  towards  satisfying  the performance obligation.\n- o  Evaluated the appropriateness of and consistency in the application of management's policies and methodologies to estimate progress towards satisfying the performance obligation.\n- o Compared efforts incurred with Company's estimate of efforts incurred to date to identify significant variations and  evaluate  whether  those  variations  have  been considered  appropriately  in  estimating  the  remaining efforts to complete the contract.\n- o Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery  of  milestones  and  customer  acceptances  to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require  changes  in  estimated  efforts  to  complete  the remaining performance obligations.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses Refer Notes 2(iv)(g), 3(x)(A), 9 and 25 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  allowance  for  credit  losses based  on  historical  loss  experience  adjusted  to  reflect\n\ncurrent  and  estimated  future  economic  conditions.  The Company  considered  current  and  anticipated future economic conditions on the basis of the credit reports and other related credit information for its customers to estimate the probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19.\n\nWe identified allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter  because  of  the  significant  judgment  involved  in calculating the expected credit losses. This required a high degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  an  increased  extent  of effort  when  performing  audit  procedures  to  evaluate  the reasonableness of management's estimate of the expected credit losses.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur  audit  procedures  related  to  the  allowance  for  credit losses  for  trade  receivables,  unbilled  receivables  and contract assets included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  (1) development  of  the  methodology  for  the  allowance  for credit losses, including consideration of the current and estimated future economic conditions, (2) completeness and  accuracy  of  information  used  in  the  estimation  of probability of default, and (3) computation of the allowance for credit losses.\n- \u00b7 For a sample of customers we tested the input data such as credit reports and other credit related information used in estimating the probability of default by comparing them to external and internal sources of information.\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  the  incorporation  of the applicable assumptions into the estimate of expected credit losses and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation of the allowances by using the same input data used by the Company.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss rates, including assessing  the  basis  for  the adjustments  and  the  reasonableness  of  the  significant assumptions.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP\n\nBengaluru, India June 9, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since fiscal 2018.",

The Company overview\n\nWipro  Limited  (' Wipro ' or  the  ' Parent  Company '), together  with  its  subsidiaries  and  controlled  trusts (collectively,  ' we ', ' us ', ' our ', ' the  Company '  or  the ' Group ') is  a  global  information  technology  (' IT' ), consulting  and  business  process  services  (' BPS' ) company.\n\nWipro  is  a  public  limited  company  incorporated  and domiciled in India. The address of its registered office is Wipro  Limited, Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road, Bengaluru - 560 035, Karnataka, India. The Company has  its  primary  listing  with  BSE  Ltd.  and  National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. The Company's American Depository Shares (' ADS ') representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  these consolidated financial statements for issue on June 9, 2021.\n\n## 2. Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements\n\n## (i) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been prepared  in  compliance  with  International  Financial Reporting  Standards  and  its  interpretations  (' IFRS '), as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards Board  (' IASB '). All  accounting  policies  have  been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated  financial  statements,  except  for  new accounting standards adopted by the Company.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  correspond  to the classification provisions contained in IAS 1 (revised), ' Presentation  of  Financial  Statements' . For  clarity, various  items  are  aggregated  in  the  consolidated statement  of  income,  consolidated  statement  of comprehensive  income  and  consolidated  statement of  financial  position.  These  items  are  disaggregated separately  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, where applicable.\n\nAll  amounts  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  are  reported  in  millions  of  Indian  rupees ( ' in millions) except share and per share data, unless otherwise  stated.  Due  to  rounding  off,  the  numbers presented  throughout  the  document  may  not  add up  precisely  to  the  totals  and  percentages  may  not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\n## (ii) Basis of measurement\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been prepared  on  a  historical  cost  convention  and  on  an accrual basis, except for the following material items\n\nwhich have been measured at fair value as required by relevant IFRS:\n\n- a. Derivative financial instruments,\n- b. Financial  instruments  classified  as  fair  value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss,\n- c. The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognized as the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets; and\n- d. Contingent consideration.\n\n## (iii) Convenience translation (unaudited)\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared and reported in Indian rupees, the functional currency of the Parent Company. Solely for the convenience of the readers, the consolidated financial statements  as  at  and  for  the  year  ended  March  31, 2021, have been translated into United States dollars at the certified foreign exchange rate of $1 = ' 73.14 as  published  by  Federal  Reserve  Board  of  Governors on March 31, 2021. No representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have been, could have been or could be converted into United States dollars at such a rate or any other rate. Due to rounding off, the translated numbers presented throughout the document may not add up precisely to the totals.\n\n## (iv) Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  the management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nEstimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information  about  significant  areas  of  estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are included in the following notes:\n\n- a) Revenue recognition : The Company applies judgement to determine whether each product or service promised to a customer is capable of being distinct, and is distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised product or service is combined and accounted as a single performance obligation. The Company allocates the arrangement consideration",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nto  separately  identifiable  performance  obligation deliverables  based  on  their  relative  stand-alone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to  determine  the  stand-alone  selling  price  the Company uses expected cost-plus margin approach in  estimating  the  stand-alone  selling  price.  The Company  uses  the  percentage  of  completion  of method using the input (cost expended) method to measure  progress  towards  completion  in  respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs. This method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of  the  revenues  and  costs  applicable  to  various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that  are  reviewed  in  estimating  the  future  costs to  complete  include  estimates  of  future  labor costs  and  productivity  efficiencies.  Because  the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, revenue recognized, profit and timing of revenue for remaining performance obligations are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume  discounts  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is recorded based  on  estimate  of  future  revenue  from  the customer.\n\n- b) Impairment testing :  Goodwill and intangible assets with  indefinite  useful  life  recognized  on  business combination  are  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually  and  when  events  occur  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset  pertain  is  less  than  the  carrying  value.  The Company assesses acquired intangible assets with finite useful life for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  The  recoverable amount  of  an  asset  or  a  cash  generating  unit  is higher  of  value-in-use  and  fair  value  less  cost  of disposal. The calculation of value in use of an asset or a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which include turnover, growth  rates  and  net  margins  used  to  calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions.\n- c) Income  taxes : The  major  tax  jurisdictions  for  the Company are India and the United States of America. Significant judgments are involved in determining\n\nthe provision for income taxes including judgment on  whether  tax  positions  are  probable  of  being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.\n\n- d) Deferred taxes : Deferred  tax  is  recorded  on temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  at  the  reporting  date.  The  ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax  loss  carry-forwards  become  deductible.  The Company  considers  expected  reversal  of  deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could reduce in  the  near  term  if  estimates  of  future  taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\n- e) Business combinations : In accounting for business combinations,  judgment  is  required  in  identifying whether  an  identifiable  intangible  asset  is  to  be recorded  separately  from  goodwill.  Additionally, estimating  the  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  the identifiable  assets  acquired  (including  useful  life estimates),  liabilities  assumed,  and  contingent consideration assumed involves management judgment.  These  measurements  are  based  on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Changes in  these  judgments,  estimates,  and  assumptions can materially affect the results of operations.\n- f) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences : The cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences  and  the  present  value  of  the  defined benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These  include  the  determination  of  the  discount rate,  future  salary  increases  and  mortality  rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n- g) Expected  credit  losses  on  financial  assets: The impairment provisions of financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected timing  of  collection.  The  Company  uses  judgment in  making  these  assumptions  and  selecting  the",

Fair value of investments is determined using  the  market  and  income  approaches.  The market  approach  includes  the  use  of  financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as  revenue,  earnings,  comparable  performance multiples,  recent  financial  rounds  and  the  level of marketability of the investments. The selection of  comparable  companies  requires  management judgment  and  is  based  on  number  of  factors, including comparable company sizes, growth rates, and  development  stages.  The  income  approach includes  the  use  of  discounted  cash  flow  model, which  requires  significant  estimates  regarding the  investees'  revenue,  costs,  and  discount  rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available historical and forecast data.\n- i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment : The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of  the  assets.  The  charge  in  respect  of  periodic depreciation  is  derived  based  on  an  estimate  of an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and  the  expected residual  value  at  the  end  of  its  life.  The  lives  are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- j) Useful  lives  of  intangible  assets : The  Company amortizes intangible assets on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life  is  estimated  based  on  a  number  of  factors including  the  effects  of  obsolescence,  demand, competition and other economic factors such as the stability  of  the  industry  and  known  technological advances and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\n- k) Leases: IFRS  16 defines a lease term as the noncancellable  period  for  which  the  lessee  has  the right to use an underlying asset including optional periods,  when  an  entity  is  reasonably  certain  to exercise an option to extend (or not to terminate) a\n\nlease. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise the option when determining the lease term. The option to extend lease is included in the lease term, if it is reasonably certain that the lessee  would  exercise  the  option.  The  Company reassesses the option upon occurrence of either a significant event or change in circumstances that are within the control of the lessee.\n\n- l) Provisions and contingent liabilities: The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations  as  a  result  of  past  events  and  it  is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n\nThe Company  uses  significant  judgement  to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are  disclosed  when  there  is  a  possible  obligation arising  from  past  events,  the  existence  of  which will  be  confirmed  only  by  the  occurrence  or  nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company  or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or  a  reliable  estimate  of  the  amount  cannot  be made. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n\n- m) Other  estimates :  The  share-based  compensation expense  is  determined  based  on  the  Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. Fair valuation of derivative hedging instruments designated as cash flow hedges involves significant estimates relating to the occurrence of forecasted transactions.\n- n) Uncertainty relating to the global health pandemic on  COVID-19: In  assessing  the  recoverability  of receivables including unbilled receivables, contract assets  and  contract  costs,  goodwill,  intangible assets, and certain investments, the Company has considered internal and external information up to the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements including credit reports and economic forecasts. The Company has performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used herein. Based on the current indicators of future economic conditions, the Company expects to recover the carrying amount of these assets.\n\nThe Company bases its assessment on the belief that  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  forecasted",

The Company has considered the effect of changes, if any,  in  both  counterparty  credit  risk  and  its  own credit risk while assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring  hedge  ineffectiveness  and  continues to believe  that  COVID-19  has  no  impact  on effectiveness of its hedges.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain and may be different from what we have estimated as of the date  of  approval  of  these  consolidated  financial statements and the Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.\n\n## 3. Significant accounting policies\n\n## (i) Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries and controlled trusts\n\nThe  Company  determines  the  basis  of  control  in line  with  the  requirements  of IFRS  10,  Consolidated Financial  Statements . Subsidiaries  and  controlled trusts are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the parent has power over the entity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled trusts  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\nAll  intra-Group  balances,  transactions,  income  and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill)  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  are  identified separately from the Company's equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable  net  assets.  The  choice  of  measurement basis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis. Subsequent  to  acquisition,  the  carrying  amount of  non-controlling  interest  is  the  amount  of  those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest's share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nInvestments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method are  entities  in  respect  of  which,  the  Company  has\n\nsignificant influence, but not control, over the financial and  operating  policies.  Generally,  a  Company  has a  significant  influence  if  it  holds  between  20  and 50  percent  of  the  voting  power  of  another  entity. Investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of investment is increased/ decreased to  recognize  investors  share  of  profit  or  loss  of  the investee after the acquisition date.\n\n## Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  of  disposal  groups  that  are available  for  immediate  sale  and  where  the  sale  is highly probable of being completed within one year from the date of classification are considered and classified as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. Non-current assets and disposal groups  held  for  sale  are  measured  at  the  lower  of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (ii) Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each of  the  Company's  entities  are  measured  using  the currency of the primary economic environment in which these  entities  operate  (i.e.  the  'functional  currency'). These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company.\n\n## (iii) Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\n## a)  Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions  in  foreign  currency  are  translated into  the  respective  functional  currencies  using the  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  date  of  the transaction.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and  from  translation  at  the  exchange  rates prevailing at the reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net,  within  results  of  operating  activities  except when  deferred  in  other  comprehensive  income as  qualifying  cash  flow  hedges  and  qualifying net investment hedges. Gains/(losses), net, relating to translation or settlement of borrowings denominated  in  foreign  currency  are  reported within finance expense. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currency  and measured  at  historical  cost  are  translated  at  the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments",

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and held in foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), a component of equity, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interest. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign  operation  and  translated  at  the  exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## c)  Others\n\nForeign currency differences arising on the translation  or  settlement  of  a  financial  liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent the hedge is effective. To the extent the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nWhen  the  hedged  part  of  a  net  investment  is disposed  of,  the  relevant  amount  recognized  in FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal. Foreign currency differences arising from translation of  intercompany  receivables  or  payables  relating to  foreign  operations,  the  settlement  of  which  is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are  considered  to  form  part  of  net  investment  in foreign operation and are recognized in FCTR.\n\n## (iv) Financial instruments\n\n## A) Non-derivative financial instruments:\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments consist of:\n\n- \u00b7  financial  assets  which  include  cash  and  cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance  lease  receivables,  employee  and  other\n\nadvances, investments in equity and debt securities and eligible current and non-current assets; Financial assets are derecognized when substantial risks and rewards  of  ownership  of  the  financial  asset  have been  transferred.  In  cases  where  substantial  risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are neither  transferred  nor  retained,  financial  assets are  derecognized  only  when  the  Company  has  not retained control over the financial asset.\n\n- \u00b7  financial  liabilities  which  include  long  and  shortterm  loans  and  borrowings,  bank  overdrafts,  trade payables and accrued expenses, lease liabilities and eligible current and non-current liabilities.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative  financial  instruments  are  measured as described below:\n\n## a.  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks and demand deposits with banks, which can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty on the principal.\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and are considered part of the Company's cash  management  system.  In  the  consolidated statement  of  financial  position,  bank  overdrafts are  presented  under  borrowings  within  current liabilities.\n\n## b. Investments\n\nFinancial instruments measured at amortized cost:\n\nDebt instruments that meet the following criteria are measured at amortized cost (except for debt instruments  that  are  designated  at  fair  value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) on initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7  the asset is held within a business model whose objective  is  to  hold  assets  in  order  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7  the  contractual  terms  of  the  instrument  give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nFinancial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI):\n\nDebt instruments that meet the following criteria are measured at fair value through other",

Other  changes  in  fair  value  of  FVTOCI  financial assets  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive income. When the investment is disposed of, the cumulative  gain  or  loss  previously  accumulated in  reserves  is  transferred  to  the  consolidated statement of income.\n\nFinancial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value through profit or loss (FVTPL):\n\nInstruments that do not meet the amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end  of  each  reporting  period,  with  any  gains  or losses arising on re-measurement recognized in consolidated  statement  of  income.  The  gain  or loss on disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nInterest income is recognized in the consolidated statement of income for FVTPL debt instruments. Dividend on financial assets at FVTPL is recognized when  the  Group's  right  to  receive  dividend  is established.\n\nInvestments in equity instruments:\n\nThe Company carries certain equity instruments which are not held for trading. At initial recognition, the  Company  may  make  an  irrevocable  election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument in other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or through statement  of  income  (FVTPL).  For  investments designated to be classified as FVTOCI, movements in fair value of investments are recognized in other comprehensive income and the gain or loss is not transferred to consolidated statement of income on  disposal  of  investments.  For  investments designated  to  be  classified  as  FVTPL,  both movements in fair value of investments and gain or\n\nloss on disposal of investments are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nDividends from these investments are recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the Company's right to receive dividends is established.\n\n## c.  Other financial assets:\n\nOther financial assets are non-derivative financial assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are presented  as  current  assets,  except  for  those maturing later than 12 months after the reporting date which are presented as non-current assets. These  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value  and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. These comprise trade receivables, unbilled receivables,  finance  lease  receivables,  employee and other advances and eligible current and noncurrent assets.\n\n## d.  Trade  payables,  accrued  expenses,  and  other liabilities\n\nTrade  payables,  accrued  expenses,  and  other liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, and subsequently  carried  at  amortized  cost  using the effective interest method. For these financial instruments,  the  carrying  amounts  approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. Contingent consideration recognized in the  business  combination  is  subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## B) Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign  operations  and  forecasted  cash  flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company limits the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by following established risk management policies including the use of derivatives. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments where the counterparty is primarily a bank.\n\nDerivatives are recognized and measured at fair value. Attributable transaction costs are recognized  in consolidated statement of income as cost.\n\nSubsequent  to  initial  recognition,  derivative  financial instruments are measured as described below:\n\n## a.

To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net, within results  from  operating  activities.  If  the  hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the consolidated statement  of  income  upon  the  occurrence  of  the related  forecasted  transaction.  If  the  forecasted transaction  is  no  longer  expected  to  occur,  such cumulative balance is immediately recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## b.

Others\n\nChanges in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments neither designated as cash flow hedges nor hedges of net investment in foreign operations are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statement of  income  and  reported  within  foreign  exchange gains/(losses),  net  within  results  from  operating activities. Changes in fair value and gains/(losses), net,  on  settlement  of  foreign  currency  derivative instruments relating to borrowings, which have not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance expenses.\n\n## C) Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under IFRS 9. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to  recognize  the  financial  asset  and  recognizes  a borrowing for the proceeds received. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the  Company's  statement  of  financial  position  when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## (v) Equity and share capital\n\n## a) Share capital and Share premium\n\nThe  authorized  share  capital  of  the  Company  as  at March 31, 2021 is ' 25,274 divided into 12,504,500,000 equity shares of ' 2 each, 25,000,000 preference shares of ' 10 each and 150,000 10% optionally convertible cumulative preference shares of ' 100 each. Par value of the equity shares is recorded as share capital and the amount received in excess of par value is classified as share premium.\n\nEvery holder of the equity shares, as reflected in the records of the Company, as at the date of the shareholder meeting shall have one vote in respect of each share held for all matters submitted to vote in the shareholder meeting.\n\n## b) Shares held by controlled trust (Treasury shares)\n\nThe  Company's  equity  shares  held  by  the  controlled trust,  which  is  consolidated  as  a  part  of  the  Group are  classified  as  Treasury  shares.  The  Company  has 27,353,853, 22,746,081 and 19,401,215 treasury shares as  at  March  31,  2019,  2020  and  2021,  respectively. Treasury shares are recorded at acquisition cost.\n\n## c) Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings comprises of the Company's undistributed earnings after taxes. This includes Capital reserve as at March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 amounting to ' 1,139, ' 1,139, and ' 1,139 respectively, which is not freely available for distribution.\n\n## d) Special Economic Zone Re-Investment reserve\n\nThe SEZ Re-Investment Reserve has been created out of profit of eligible SEZ units as per provisions of section 10AA(1)(ii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for acquiring new plant and machinery.

The amounts recorded in share-based payment reserve are transferred to share premium upon exercise of stock options and restricted stock unit options by employees.\n\n## f) Foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR)\n\nThe exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, differences arising  from  translation  of  long-term  inter-company receivables or payables relating to foreign operations, settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated  as  hedge  of  net  investment  in  foreign operations  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive income, net of taxes and presented within equity in the FCTR.\n\n## g) Cash flow hedging reserve\n\nChanges in fair value of derivative hedging instruments designated  and  effective  as  a  cash  flow  hedge  are recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income,  net  of taxes and presented within equity as cash flow hedging reserve.\n\n## h) Other reserves\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income and actuarial gains and losses on remeasurements  of  the  defined  benefit  plans  are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and presented within equity in other reserves.\n\nOther reserves also include Capital redemption reserve, which  is  not  freely  available  for  distribution.  As  per the Companies Act, 2013, Capital redemption reserve is created when a company purchases its own shares out of free reserves or securities premium. A sum equal to  the  nominal  value  of  the  shares  so  purchased  is transferred to capital redemption reserve. The reserve can  be  utilized  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of  section  69  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013.  Capital redemption reserve amounting to ' 1,122 (March 31, 2020: ' 647) is not freely available for distribution.\n\n## i) Dividend\n\nA final dividend, including tax thereon, on common stock is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders. An interim dividend, including tax thereon, is recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the board of directors.\n\nj)\n\n## Buyback of equity shares\n\nThe buyback of equity shares and related transaction costs  are  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  free  reserves. Further,  capital  redemption  reserve  is  created  as  an apportionment from retained earnings.\n\n## k) Bonus issue\n\nFor the purpose of bonus issue, the amount is transferred from capital redemption reserves, securities premium and retained earnings to the share capital.\n\n## (vi) Property, plant and equipment\n\n## a) Recognition and measurement\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures directly attributable to  the  acquisition  of  the  asset.  General  and  specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost.\n\nCapital  work-in-progress  are  measured  at  cost  less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## b) Depreciation\n\nThe Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over the estimated useful life on a straightline basis from the date the assets are available for use. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term. Term licenses are amortized over their respective contract  term.  Freehold  land  is  not  depreciated.  The estimated useful life of assets is reviewed and where appropriate  are  adjusted,  annually.  The  estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\n\n| Category                          | Useful life    |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                         | 28 to 40 years |\n| Plant and equipment               | 5 to 21 years  |\n| Computer equipment and software   | 2 to 7 years   |\n| Furniture, fixtures and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Vehicles                          | 4 to 5 years   |\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.  Subsequent  expenditure  relating  to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nDeposits  and  advances  paid  towards  the  acquisition of  property,  plant  and  equipment  outstanding  as  at",

The  cost  of  an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments  issued  at  the  date  of  exchange  by  the Company.  Identifiable  assets  acquired,  and  liabilities and  contingent  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business combination  are  measured  initially  at  fair  value  at the date of acquisition. Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration measured as at the date of acquisition. Any subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities, other than measurement period adjustments, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## b) Goodwill\n\nThe  excess  of  the  cost  of  an  acquisition  over  the Company's  share  in  the  fair  value  of  the  acquiree's identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is  recognized  as goodwill. If the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain  is  recognized  immediately  in  the  consolidated statement of income. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment (if any).\n\nGoodwill associated with disposal of an operation that is  part  of  cash-generating  unit  is  measured  based on  the  relative  values  of  the  operation  disposed  of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained, unless some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  acquired  separately  are  measured at cost of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business  combination  are  measured  at  fair  value  as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.\n\nThe  amortization  of  an  intangible  asset  with  a  finite useful life reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is expected to be generated and is included in selling  and  marketing  expenses  in  the  consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe estimated useful life of amortizable intangibles is reviewed and where appropriate is adjusted, annually. The estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets for the current and comparative periods are as follows:\n\n| Category                      | Useful life      |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Customer-related intangibles  | 0.75 to 15 years |\n| Marketing-related intangibles | 3 to 10 years    |\n\n## (viii) Leases\n\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company adopted IFRS 16 'Leases', which applied to all lease contracts outstanding as at April 1, 2019, using modified retrospective method by recording the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to opening retained earnings.\n\nThe Company has made use of the following practical expedients available in its transition to IFRS 16: -\n\n- a) The Company will not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of lease  in  accordance  with  IAS  17  and  IFRIC-4  will continue to be applied to lease contracts entered by the Company or modified by the Company before April 1, 2019,\n- b) The  Company  has  applied  a  single  discount  rate to a portfolio of leases of similar assets in similar economic environment. Consequently, the Company has  recorded  its  lease  liability  using  the  present value  of  remaining  lease  payments,  discounted using  the  incremental  borrowing  rate  at  the  date of initial application and the Right-of-use (' RoU ') asset  at  its  carrying  amount  as  if  the  standard had  been  applied  since  the  commencement  date of the lease, but discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application,\n- c) The Company excluded the initial direct costs from measurement of the RoU asset,\n- d) The Company does not recognize RoU assets and lease  liabilities  for  leases  with  less  than  twelve months of lease term and low-value assets on the date of initial application.\n\nThe weighted average of discount rates applied to lease liabilities as at April 1, 2019 is 5.7%.\n\nOn adoption of IFRS 16,\n\n- a)  the Company has recognized RoU assets of ' 13,630 and corresponding lease liability of ' 15,379,\n- b)  the net carrying value of assets procured under the finance lease of ' 1,243 (gross carrying value and",

Such arrangements are generally for a fixed period but may have extension or termination options. The Company assesses, whether the contract is, or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to -\n\n- (a)  control use of an identified asset,\n- (b)  obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, and\n- (c)  direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nThe Company determines the lease term as the noncancellable  period  of  a  lease,  together  with  periods covered  by  an  option  to  extend  the  lease,  where  the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nThe Company at the commencement of the lease contract recognizes a RoU asset at cost and corresponding lease liability, except for leases with term of less than twelve months (short-term leases) and low-value assets. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe  cost  of  the  RoU  assets  comprises  the  amount of  the  initial  measurement  of  the  lease  liability,  any lease payments made at or before the inception date of the lease plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives received. Subsequently, the RoU assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The RoU assets are depreciated using the straight-line method\n\nfrom the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Company applies IAS 36 to determine whether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of nonfinancial assets below.\n\nFor lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease, the Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.  The  lease  payments  are  discounted  using  the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow  funds,  including  the  consideration  of  factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment.\n\nAfter  the  commencement  date,  the  amount  of  lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  the  amount  of  the  remeasurement  of  lease  liability  as  an  adjustment  to the  RoU  assets.  Where  the  carrying  amount  of  the RoU  asset  is  reduced  to  zero  and  there  is  a  further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognizes any remaining amount of the remeasurement in consolidated statement of income.\n\nLease liability payments are classified as cash used in financing  activities  in  the  consolidated  statement  of cash flows.\n\n## The Company as a lessor\n\nLeases under which the Company is a lessor are classified as a finance or operating lease. Lease contracts where all the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the lessee are classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating lease.\n\nFor leases under which the Company is an intermediate lessor, the Company accounts for the head-lease and the  sub-lease  as  two  separate  contracts.  The  sublease is further classified either as a finance lease or an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the head-lease.\n\n## (ix) Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value, including necessary provision for obsolescence. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (x) Impairment\n\n## a) Financial assets\n\nThe Company applies the expected credit loss model for  recognizing  impairment  loss  on  financial  assets measured  at amortized cost, debt instruments classified as FVTOCI, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, finance lease receivables, and other financial assets. Expected credit loss is the difference between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive, discounted using the effective interest rate.\n\nLoss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables  are  measured  at  an  amount  equal  to lifetime expected credit loss. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial  instrument.  Lifetime  expected  credit  loss  is computed based on a provision matrix which takes in to account, risk profiling of customers and historical credit  loss  experience  adjusted  for  forward  looking information. For other financial assets, expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal to twelve months expected credit loss unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case  those  are  measured  at  lifetime  expected  credit loss.\n\n## b) Non-financial assets\n\nThe  Company  assesses  long-lived  assets  such  as property, plant and equipment, RoU assets and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying amount  of  an  asset  or  group  of  assets  may  not  be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of assets.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same time and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash -generating units which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (' FVLCD ') and its value-in-use (' VIU '). The VIU of longlived assets is calculated using projected future cash\n\nflows.  FVLCD  of  a  cash  generating  unit  is  computed using turnover and earnings multiples. If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. If at the reporting date, there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and  the  impairment  losses  previously  recognized are reversed such that the asset is recognized at its recoverable  amount  but  not  exceeding  written  down value which would have been reported if the impairment losses had not been recognized initially. An impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.\n\n## (xi) Employee benefits\n\n## Post-employment and pension plans\n\nThe  Group  participates  in  various  employee  benefit plans. Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined  benefit  plans.  Under  a  defined  contribution plan,  the  Company's  only  obligation  is  to  pay  a  fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognized as an expense during the period when the employee provides service. Under  a  defined  benefit  plan,  it  is  the  Company's obligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the Company. The present value of the defined benefit obligations  is  calculated  by  an  independent  actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nRemeasurements  of the defined benefit plans, comprising  actuarial  gains  or  losses,  and  the  return on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  are  immediately recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and  not  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in  subsequent period.\n\nNet interest recognized in profit or loss is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit  obligation  to  the  net  defined  benefit  liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or  below  the  discount  rate,  is  recognized  as  part  of remeasurements of the defined benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.",

Provident fund\n\nEmployees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. The employer and employees  each  make  periodic  contributions  to the plan. A portion of the contribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution is  made  to  the  government  administered  pension fund. The contributions to the trust managed by the Company is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return.\n\n## b.  Superannuation\n\nSuperannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is administered by third party fund managers. The Company makes annual contributions based on a specified  percentage  of  each  eligible  employee's salary.\n\n## c. Gratuity and Pension\n\nIn accordance  with  the  Payment  of  Gratuity Act,  1972,  applicable  for  Indian  companies,  the Company  provides  for  a  lump  sum  payment  to eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment  based  on  the  last  drawn  salary  and years of employment with the Company. The gratuity fund is managed by third party fund managers.\n\nThe Company also maintains pension and similar plans for employees outside India, based on country specific  regulations.  These  plans  are  partially funded, and the funds are managed by third party fund  managers.  The  plans  provide  for  monthly payout  after  retirement  as  per  salary  drawn  and service period or for a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund.\n\nThe Company's obligations in respect of the above plans, which are defined benefit plans, are provided for based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.  The  Company  recognizes remeasurement gains and losses of the net defined benefit  liability  /  (asset)  in  other  comprehensive income, net of taxes.\n\n## d.  Termination benefits\n\nTermination  benefits  are  expensed  when  the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\n## e.  Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are\n\nmeasured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are recorded  as  expense  as  the  related  service  is provided.  A  liability  is  recognized  for  the  amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans, if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## f. Compensated absences\n\nThe  employees  of  the  Company  are  entitled  to compensated  absences.  The  employees  can  carry forward  a  portion  of  the  unutilized  accumulating compensated  absences  and  utilize  it  in  future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement.  The  Company  measures  the expected  cost  of  compensated  absences  as  the additional  amount  that  the  Company  expects  to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company  recognizes  accumulated  compensated absences  based  on  actuarial  valuation  using  the projected  unit  credit  method.  Non-accumulating compensated absences are recognized in the period in which the absences occur.\n\n## (xii)  Share-based payment transactions\n\nSelected employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments or  cash  settled  instruments,  for  rendering  services over  a  defined  vesting  period  and  for  Company's performance-based  stock  options  over  the  defined period.  Equity  instruments  granted  are  measured  by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date of grant. In cases, where equity instruments are granted at a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value. The expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of income with  a  corresponding  increase  to  the  share-based payment reserve, a component of equity.\n\nThe  equity  instruments  or  cash  settled  instruments generally  vest  in  a  graded  manner  over  the  vesting period.  The  fair  value  determined  at  the  grant  date is expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such grants (accelerated amortization). The stock compensation expense is determined based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will eventually vest.\n\nCash Settled instruments granted are re-measured by reference to the fair value at the end of each reporting",

Provisions  for  onerous  contracts  are  measured  at the  present  value  of  lower  of  the  expected  net  cost of  fulfilling  the  contract  and  the  expected  cost  of terminating the contract.\n\n## (xiv) Revenue\n\nThe Company derives revenue primarily from software development, maintenance of software/hardware and related services, business process services, sale of IT and other products.\n\nEffective  April  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  IFRS 15  'Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers'  using the  cumulative  catch-up  transition  method,  applied to  contracts  that  were  not  completed  as  of  April  1, 2018. The adoption of the new standard has resulted in a reduction of /.notdef 2,279 in opening retained earnings, primarily  relating  to  certain  contract  costs  because these do not meet the criteria for recognition as costs to fulfil a contract.\n\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations  under  the  contract,  and  the  contract is  legally  enforceable.  Revenue  is  recognized  upon\n\ntransfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products  or  services.  To  recognize  revenues,  the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAt  contract  inception,  the  Company  assesses  its promise to transfer products or services to a customer to  identify  separate  performance  obligations.  The Company  applies  judgement  to  determine  whether each  product  or  service  promised  to  a  customer  is capable of being distinct, and are distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised products or services are combined and accounted as a single performance obligation.  The  Company  allocates  the  arrangement consideration  to  separately  identifiable  performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling price or residual method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses third-party prices for similar deliverables or the Company uses expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price.\n\nFor performance obligations where control is transferred over  time,  revenues  are  recognized  by  measuring progress  towards  completion  of  the  performance obligation.  The  selection  of  the  method  to  measure progress  towards  completion  requires  judgment  and is  based  on  the  nature  of  the  promised  products  or services to be provided.\n\nThe method for recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the services rendered:\n\n## A. Time and materials contracts\n\nRevenues  and  costs  relating  to  time  and  materials contracts  are  recognized  as  the  related  services  are rendered.\n\n## B. Fixed-price contracts\n\n## i. Fixed-price development contracts\n\nRevenues from fixed-price development contracts, including  software  development,  and  integration contracts, where  the  performance  obligations",

The performance obligations are satisfied as and when the  services  are  rendered  since  the  customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses. Percentage of completion is determined based on project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The cost expended (or input) method has been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. If the Company is not able to reasonably measure  the  progress  of  completion,  revenue  is recognized only to the extent of costs incurred, for which  recoverability  is  probable.  When  total  cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognized in the consolidated statement  of  income  in  the  period  in  which  such losses  become  probable  based  on  the  current contract estimates as an onerous contract provision.\n\nA contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time.  Contract  assets  primarily  relate  to  unbilled amounts  on  fixed-price  development  contracts and  are  classified  as  non-financial  asset  as  the contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.\n\nA contract liability is an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.\n\nUnbilled  receivables  on  other  than  fixed-price development contracts are classified as a financial  asset  where  the  right  to  consideration is  unconditional  and  only  the  passage  of  time  is required before the payment is due.\n\n## ii. Maintenance contracts\n\nRevenues related to fixed-price maintenance contracts  are  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis when services are performed through an indefinite number  of  repetitive  acts  over  a  specified  period or ratably using percentage of completion method when  the  pattern  of  benefits  from  the  services rendered to the customers and the cost to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive.\n\nRevenue  for  contracts  in  which  the  invoicing  is representative  of  the  value  being  delivered  is recognized  based  on  our  right  to  invoice.  If  our invoicing  is  not  consistent  with  value  delivered,\n\nrevenues are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method.\n\nIn certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term. In such contracts, revenue is recognized with respect to the actual output achieved till date as a percentage of total contractual output. Any residual service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on completion of the term.\n\n## iii.  Element or Volume based contracts\n\nRevenues and costs are recognized as the related services are rendered.\n\n## C. Products\n\nRevenue  on  product  sales  are  recognized  when  the customer obtains control of the specified product.\n\n## D. Others\n\n- \u00b7  Any  change  in  scope  or  price  is  considered  as  a contract  modification.  The  Company  accounts  for modifications  to  existing  contracts  by  assessing whether the services added are distinct and whether the  pricing  is  at  the  stand-alone  selling  price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the stand-alone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the stand-alone selling price.\n- \u00b7  The  Company  accounts  for  variable  considerations like, volume discounts, rebates and pricing incentives to customers and penalties as reduction of revenue on a systematic and rational basis over the period of the contract. The Company estimates an amount of such variable consideration using expected value method or the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which the Company may be entitled and when it is probable that  a  significant  reversal  of  cumulative  revenue recognized  will  not  occur  when  the  uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\n- \u00b7  Revenues  are  shown  net  of  allowances/  returns, sales tax, value added tax, goods and services tax and applicable discounts and allowances.\n- \u00b7  The Company  accrues  the  estimated  cost  of warranties at the time when the revenue is recognized. The accruals are based on the Company's historical experience  of  material  usage  and  service  delivery costs.",

The asset so recognized is amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates.\n- \u00b7  The  Company  assesses  the  timing  of  the  transfer of goods or services to the customer as compared to  the  timing  of  payments  to  determine  whether a  significant  financing  component  exists.  As  a practical  expedient,  the  Company  does  not  assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist.\n- \u00b7  The Company may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the principal (i.e. report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e. report revenues on a net basis). In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, Company is the principal; if not, the Company is the agent.\n- \u00b7  Estimates  of  transaction  price  and  total  costs  or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contract and are recognized in net profit in the period  when  these  estimates  change  or  when  the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses.\n\n## (xv)  Finance expenses\n\nFinance expenses comprises interest cost on borrowings,  lease  liabilities  and  net  defined  benefit liability, gains or losses arising on re-measurement of financial assets measured at FVTPL, gains/(losses) on translation or settlement of foreign currency borrowings and  changes  in  fair  value  and  gains/  (losses)  on settlement of related derivative instruments. Borrowing\n\ncosts that are not directly attributable to a qualifying asset are recognized in the consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method.\n\n## (xvi)  Finance and other income\n\nFinance and other income comprise interest income on deposits, dividend income and gains / (losses) on disposal of investments. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is  recognized  when  the  right  to  receive  payment  is established.\n\n## (xvii)  Income tax\n\nIncome  tax  comprises  current  and  deferred  tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of income except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## a) Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the taxable income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period. While determining the tax provisions, the Company assesses whether each uncertain tax position is to be considered separately or together with one or more uncertain tax positions depending upon the nature and circumstances of each uncertain tax position. The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable  right  to  set  off  the  recognized  amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously.\n\n## b) Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet  approach.  Deferred  income  tax  assets  and liabilities  are  recognized  for  deductible  and  taxable temporary  differences  arising  between  the  tax  base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in financial statements, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination  and  affects  neither  accounting  nor taxable profits or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized  to  the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against  which  the  deductible  temporary  differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.",

Diluted  earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the weighted  average  number  of  equity  and  dilutive equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method for options, except where the results would be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity  shares  are  adjusted  retrospectively  for  all periods  presented  for  any  splits  and  bonus  shares issues  including  for  change  effected  prior  to  the approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors.\n\n## (xix)  Statement of cash flows\n\nCash  flows  are  reported  using  the  indirect  method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated\n\nwith investing or financing cash flows. The cash from operating,  investing  and  financing  activities  of  the Company are segregated.\n\n## (xx)  Assets held for sale\n\nSale of business is classified as held for sale, if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. The condition for classification as held for sale is met when disposal business is available for immediate sale and the same is highly probable of being completed within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\n## (xxi) Discontinued operations\n\nA  discontinued  operation  is  a  component  of  the Company's business that represents a separate line of business that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\n## (xxii) Disposal of assets\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  arising  on  disposal  or  retirement  of assets is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nNew Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Company e/ffective from April 1, 2020:\n\n## Amendment to IFRS 3 - Business combinations\n\nThe  International  Accounting  Standard  Board  has issued amendments to IFRS 3, 'Business Combinations', in connection with clarification of business definition, which help in determining whether an acquisition made is of a business or a group of assets. The amendment added  a  test  that  makes  it  easier  to  conclude  that a  Company  has  acquired  a  group  of  assets,  rather than a business, if the value of the assets acquired is substantially all concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets. The adoption of amendment to IFRS 3  is  applicable  to  new  acquisition  on  a  prospective basis and did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe IASB amended some of its requirements for hedge accounting.

The adoption of amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 did not have any significant material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## Amendment to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material\n\nThe IASB issued Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial  Statements  and  IAS  8  Accounting  Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to update a new definition of material in IAS 1. The amendments clarify the definition of 'material' and how it should be applied by including in the definition guidance that until now  has  featured  elsewhere  in  IFRS  Standards.  The new definition clarifies that, information is considered material  if  omitting,  misstating,  or  obscuring  such information, could reasonably be expected to influence the  decisions  that  the  primary  users  of  generalpurpose  financial  statements  make  based  on  those financial statements. The definition of material in IAS 8 has been replaced by a reference to the definition of material in IAS 1. In addition, the IASB amended other Standards and the Conceptual Framework that contain a definition of material or refer to the term 'material' to ensure consistency. The adoption of the amendment to IAS 1 and IAS 8 did not have any material impact on its evaluation of materiality in relation to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS 16 - Leases\n\nThe  IASB  issued  amendments  to  IFRS  16,  'Leases', provide  lessees  with  an  exemption  from  assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. The amendments allowed the expedient to  be  applied  to  COVID-19-related  rent  concessions to payments originally due on or before June 30, 2021 and also require disclosure of the amount recognized in profit or loss to reflect changes in lease payments that  arise  from  COVID-19-related  rent  concessions. The  reporting  period  in  which  a  lessee  first  applies the amendment, it is not required to disclose certain quantitative information required under IAS 8. Accordingly, the Company recognized ' 61 as reversal of lease liability in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2021.On March 31, 2021, the IASB has extended the relief by one year to cover rent concessions that reduce only lease payments due on or before 30 June 2022. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021.\n\n## New amendments not yet adopted:\n\nCertain new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for annual periods beginning after April 1, 2020 and have not been applied\n\nin preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The  amendments  aim  to  promote  consistency in  applying  the  requirements  by  helping  companies to  determine  whether,  in  the  statement  of  financial position,  debt  and  other  liabilities  with  an  uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or  potentially  due  to  be  settled  within  one  year)  or non-current.  The  amendments  also  clarified  the classification requirements for debt a company might settle by converting it into equity. These amendments are  effective  for  annual  reporting  periods  beginning on  or  after  January  1,  2023  and  are  to  be  applied retrospectively, with earlier application permitted. The adoption of amendments to IAS 1 is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendment to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n\nOn May 14, 2020, the IASB issued 'Onerous Contracts -  Cost  of  Fulfilling  a  Contract  (Amendments  to  IAS 37)', amending the standard regarding costs a company should  include  as  the  cost  of  fulfilling  a  contract when  assessing  whether  a  contract  is  onerous.  The amendment  specifies  that  the  'cost  of  fulfilling'  a contract comprises the 'costs that relate directly to the contract'. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, with earlier application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of amendment to IAS 37 on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 9 - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n\nOn May 14, 2020, IASB amended IFRS 9 as part of its Annual  Improvements  to  IFRS  Standards  2018-2020.

The amendments complement those  issued  in  2019  and  focus  on  the  effects  on financial statements when a company replaces the old interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate as a result of the reform. The amendments in this final phase relate to the modification of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities, specific hedge accounting requirements, and disclosure requirements applying  IFRS  7  to  accompany  the  amendments regarding modifications and hedge accounting.

The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments clarify that  accounting  policy  information  may  be  material because  of  its  nature,  even  if  the  related  amounts are  immaterial.  The  amendments  also  clarified  that accounting  policy  information  is  material  if  users of  an  entity's  financial  statements  would  need  it  to understand other material information in the financial statements; and the amendments clarify that if an entity discloses  immaterial  accounting  policy  information, such information shall not obscure material accounting\n\npolicy information.

The  amendments  provided  'Definition  of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)' to help entities  to  distinguish  between  accounting  policies and accounting estimates. This distinction is important because changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively,  but  changes  in  accounting  policies  are applied retrospectively. These amendments are effective for  annual  reporting  periods  beginning  on  or  after January 1, 2023 and are to be applied retrospectively, with  earlier  application  permitted.  The  Company  is currently evaluating the impact of amendment to IAS 8 on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - 'Income Taxes'\n\nOn  May  7,  2021,  the  IASB  amended  IAS  12  'Income Taxes'  and  published  'Deferred  Tax  related  to  Assets and  Liabilities  arising  from  a  Single  Transaction (Amendments  to  IAS  12)'  that  clarify  how  companies account  for  deferred  tax  on  transactions  such  as leases and decommissioning obligations. In specified circumstances, companies are exempt from recognizing deferred tax when they recognize assets or liabilities for  the  first  time.  The  amendments  clarify  that  this exemption does not apply to transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations and companies are required to recognize deferred tax on such transactions. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 and are to  be  applied  retrospectively,  with  earlier  application permitted.

Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nThe movement in goodwill balance is given below:\n\n|                                                              | Year ended March  31, 2020   | Year ended March  31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the year                         | '  116,980                   | ' 131,012                    |\n| Translation adjustment                                       | 9,199                        | (1,357)                      |\n| Acquisition through business combinations* (Refer to Note 7) | 4,833                        | 9,472                        |\n| Balance at the end of the year                               | ' 131,012                    | ' 139,127                    |\n\nThe Company is organized by three operating segments: IT Services, IT Products and India State Run Enterprise Services. Goodwill as at March 31, 2020 and 2021 has been allocated to the IT Services operating segment.\n\nGoodwill recognized on business combinations is allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs), within the IT Services operating segment, which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisitions.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company re-organized its IT Services segment from seven industry verticals to four Strategic Market Units (Refer to Note 34). Accordingly, goodwill has been re-allocated to the CGUs, using a relative value approach as at March 31, 2020 and 2021 as follows:\n\n| CGUs                            | Year ended March 31, 2020   | Year ended  March 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Americas 1                      | ' 63,432                    | ' 64,573                     |\n| Americas 2                      | 32,392                      | 34,038                       |\n| Europe                          | 22,149                      | 26,641                       |\n| Asia Pacific Middle East Africa | 13,039                      | 13,875                       |\n|                                 | ' 131,012                   | '  139,127                   |\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company's procedure for determining the recoverable value of each CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the market capitalization approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data. The fair value measurement is categorized as a level 2 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nBased on the above testing, no impairment was identified as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the calculation's sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings multiples), did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU's recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.\n\nThe movement in intangible assets is given below:\n\n|                                                             | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                             | Customer-related    | Marketing-related   | Total               |\n| Gross carrying value:                                       |                     |                     |                     |\n| As at April 1, 2019                                         | ' 26,924            | '   5,945           | '  32,869           |\n| Translation adjustment                                      | 1,031               | 382                 | 1,413               |\n| Acquisition through business combinations (Refer to Note 7) | 4,535               | 371                 | 4,906               |\n| As at March 31, 2020                                        | '  32,490           | '   6,698           | ' 39,188            |\n| Accumulated amortization/ impairment:                       |                     |                     |                     |\n| As at April 1, 2019                                         | ' 15,345            | '   3,762           | ' 19,107            |\n| Translation adjustment                                      | 220                 | 226                 | 446                 |\n| Amortization and impairment *                               | 2,333               | 940                 | 3,273               |\n| As at March 31, 2020                                        | '  17,898           | '   4,928           | '  22,826           |\n| Net carrying value as at March 31, 2020                     | '  14,592           | '   1,770           | '  16,362           |",

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis and hence are not offset.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, employee and other advances, eligible current and non-current assets, loans, borrowings and bank overdrafts, trade payables and accrued expenses, and eligible current liabilities and non-current liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, loans, borrowings and bank overdrafts, trade payables and accrued expenses, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company's long-term debt has been contracted at market rates of interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair value. Further, finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2020 and 2021, the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances approximates the fair value.",

Fair value of investments in commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date. Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified as FVTOCI is determined using market and income approaches.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and forward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nThe following table presents fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n\n| Particular                                          | As at March 31, 2020 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2020 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2020 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2020 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2021 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2021 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2021 Fair value measurements at reporting date   | As at March 31, 2021 Fair value measurements at reporting date   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Total                                                            | Level 1                                                          | Level 2                                                          | Level 3                                                          | Total                                                            | Level 1                                                          | Level 2                                                          | Level 3                                                          |\n| Assets                                              |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |\n| Derivative instruments:                             |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |                                                                  |\n| Cash flow hedges                                    | '  1,382                                                         | '  -

Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with  market  observable  inputs  are  mainly  interest  rate  swaps,  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  and  foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying. As at March 31, 2021, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognized at fair value.\n\nInvestment in commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds: Fair value of these instruments is derived based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market as at reporting date.",

Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 is not material.\n\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected as part of loans and borrowings in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.\n\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company's earnings and equity to losses.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Risk Management Procedures\n\nThe Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe  Company  operates  internationally,  and  a  major  portion  of  its  business  is  transacted  in  several  currencies. Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows. The Company also designates foreign currency borrowings as hedge against respective net investments in foreign operations.\n\nAs at March 31, 2021, a ' 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in approximately ' 3,095 (consolidated statement of income ' 1,395 and other comprehensive income ' 1,700) decrease in the fair value, and a ' 1 decrease would result in approximately ' 2,845  (consolidated statement of income ' 1,395 and other comprehensive income ' 1,450) increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative instruments (forward and option contracts).\n\nThe below table presents foreign currency risk from non-derivative financial instruments as at March 31, 2020 and 2021:\n\n|                                                         | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   | As at March 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                         | US $                   | Euro                   | Pound  Sterling        | Australian  Dollar     | Canadian  Dollar       | Other   currencies  #  | Total                  |\n| Trade receivables                                       | '  42,329              | '  8,860               | '  7,735               | '  3,044               | '  1,388               | '  4,522               | '  67,878              |\n| Unbilled receivables                                    | 11,127                 | 1,030                  | 2,221                  | 784                    | 291                    | 1,126                  | 16,579                 |\n| Contract assets                                         | 5,517                  | 1,559                  | 2,850                  | 654                    | 146                    | 790                    | 11,516                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                               | 13,481                 | 3,978                  | 1,697                  | 586                    | 1,292                  | 1,733                  | 22,767                 |\n| Other assets                                            | 49,835                 | 4,314                  | 3,283                  | 413                    | 1,447                  | 1,805                  | 61,097                 |\n| Loans, borrowings and bank overdrafts                   | (36,578)               | -                      | -                      | -                      | -                      | -                      | (36,578)               |\n| Lease Liabilities                                       | (3,393)                | (2,606)                | (373)                  | (214)                  | (16)                   | (1,412)                | (8,014)                |\n| Trade payables, accrued expenses and  other liabilities | (27,457)               | (3,419)                | (3,718)                | (1,228)                | (605)                  | (3,087)                | (39,514)               |\n| Net assets/ (liabilities)                               | '  54,861              | '  13,716              | '  13,695              | '  4,039               | '  3,943               | '  5,477               | '  95,731              |",

The Company's investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. From time to time, the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2021, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ' 829.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, or revenues for the year ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Company's corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. As at March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.",

Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified  and  carry  forward  losses  on  acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment to goodwill. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards become deductible. The Company considers the expected  reversal  of  deferred  tax  liabilities, projected  future  taxable  income  and  tax  planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable, however,  could  be  reduced  in  the  near  term  if  the estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\n\nDeferred tax asset amounting to ' 8,124 and ' 8,676 as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively in respect of unused tax losses have not been recognized by the Company. The tax loss carry-forwards of ' 29,736 and ' 31,993 as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the Company, because it is probable that future taxable profits will not be available against which the unused tax  losses  can  be  utilized  in  the  foreseeable  future. Approximately, ' 14,429, and ' 17,691 as at March 31, 2020  and  2021,  respectively,  of  these  tax  loss  carryforwards is not currently subject to expiration dates.\n\nThe remaining tax loss carry-forwards of approximately ' 15,307 and ' 14,302 as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, expires in various years through fiscal year 2038.\n\nThe  Company  has  recognized  deferred  tax  assets of ' 2,044 and ' 1,637 primarily in respect of carry forward  losses  including  certain  subsidiaries  as  at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Management's projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilize these deferred tax assets.\n\nThe  Company  calculates  its  tax  liability  for  domestic taxes after considering MAT. The excess tax paid under MAT  provisions  over  and  above  normal  tax  liability can  be  carried  forward  and  set-off  against  future tax  liabilities  computed  under  normal  tax  provisions. Deferred tax asset relating to MAT payment of ' 3,425 and ' Nil  has  been  recognized  in  the  statement  of consolidated financial position as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company's India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to export operations and profits from units established under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005  scheme.  Units  in  designated  special  economic zones  providing  service  on  or  after  April  1,  2005  will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. Certain tax benefits are also available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting defined conditions.  Profits  from  certain  other  undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires  in  various  years  through  fiscal  2034-35.  The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of",

The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 was ' 2.56, ' 2.05, and ' 2.03, respectively.\n\nDeferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  recognized  for all  taxable  temporary  differences  except  in  respect of taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with investments  in  subsidiaries  where  the  timing  of  the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will not  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Accordingly, deferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries amounting to ' 56,391 and ' 59,793 as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively and branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profit have not been recognized. Further, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n\n## 22.  Dividends, Bonus and Buyback of equity shares\n\nThe  Company  declares  and  pays  dividends  in  Indian rupees.  According  to  the  Companies  Act,  2013  any dividend  should  be  declared  out  of  accumulated distributable  profits.  A  Company  may,  before  the declaration  of  any  dividend,  transfer  a  percentage  of its  profits  for  that  financial  year  as  it  may  consider appropriate to the reserves.\n\nThe cash dividends paid per equity share were ' 1, ' 1 and ' 1, during the years ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, including an interim dividend of ' 1, ' 1 and ' 1 for the year ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  March  31,  2019,  the  bonus issue in the proportion of 1:3 i.e.1 (One) bonus equity share of ' 2 each for every 3 (three) fully paid-up equity shares held (including ADS holders) was approved by the shareholders of the Company on February 22, 2019, through Postal Ballot /e-voting.

The Company is not subjected to any externally imposed capital requirements.\n\n## 24. Revenue\n\n## A. Contract Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset.\n\nA receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognizes a receivable for revenues related to time and materials contracts or volume based contracts. The Company presents such receivables as part of unbilled receivables at their net estimated realizable value. The same is tested for impairment as per the guidance in IFRS 9 using expected credit loss method.\n\nContract liabilities: During the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of ' 21,193 and ' 16,082 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 respectively.\n\nContract assets: During the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, ' 13,068 and ' 15,101 of contract assets pertaining to fixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n\nContract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## B. Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRevenue  allocated  to  remaining  performance  obligations  represents  contracted  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been recognized, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n\nAs at March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ' 373,879, ' 360,033 and ' 384,881, respectively of which approximately 59%, 62% and 59% respectively is expected to be recognized as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with asubstantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\n\n## C. Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment (refer to Note 34 'Segment Information'), sector and contract-type. The Company believes that the below disaggregation best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from economic factors.",

There are no materially significant related party transactions made by the Company with Promoters, Directors or Key Managerial Personnel, which may have a potential conflict with the interests of the Company at large.\n\n## 33.  Commitments and contingencies\n\nCapital commitments: As at March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had committed to spend approximately ' 14,011 and ' 7,490 respectively, under agreements to purchase/  construct  property  and  equipment.  These amounts are net of capital advances paid in respect of these purchases.\n\nGuarantees: As at March 31, 2020 and 2021, guarantees provided  by  banks  on  behalf  of  the  Company  to  the Indian  Government,  customers  and  certain  other agencies  amount  to  approximately ' 18,655  and ' 17,128 respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.\n\nContingencies and lawsuits: The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims (including tax assessment orders/  penalty  notices)  which  have  arisen  in  the ordinary  course  of  its  business.  Some  of  the  claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings.  However,  the  resolution  of  these  legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect  on  the  results  of  operations  or  the  financial position of the Company.\n\nThe  Company's  assessments  are  completed  for  the years up to March 31, 2016 in India. The Company has received demands on multiple tax issues in India. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of  profits  earned  by  the  Company's  undertaking  in Software  Technology  Park  at  Bengaluru,  the  appeals filed  against  the  said  demand  before  the  Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by\n\nthe Income tax authorities before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits  on  profits  earned  from  Software  Technology Park and Special Economic Zone units, capitalization of research & development expenses, transfer pricing adjustments on intercompany / inter unit transactions and other issues.\n\nIncome tax claims against the Company amounting to ' 77,873 and ' 80,032 are not acknowledged as debt as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. These matters are pending before various Appellate Authorities and the management expects its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for excise duty, custom duty, sales tax and other matters amounting  to ' 8,033  and ' 11,413  as  of  March  31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. However, the resolution of these disputed demands is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, through a ruling in February  2019,  provided  interpretation  on  the components of Salary on which the Company and its employees  are  to  contribute  towards  Provident  Fund under  the  Employee's  Provident  Fund  Act.  Based  on the current evaluation, the Company believes it is not probable  that  certain  components  of  Salary  paid  by the Company will be subject to contribution towards Provident  Fund  due  to  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court of India order. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments.",

Revenue relating to these items is reported as revenue from the sale of IT Products.\n\nISRE: This segmentconsists of IT Services offerings to entities  and/or  departments  owned  or  controlled  by Government of India and/or any State Governments.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Company  has  been  identified as  the  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  (' CODM ')  as defined by IFRS 8, 'Operating Segments'. The Chairman of the Company evaluates the segments based on their revenue growth and operating income.\n\nAssets and liabilities used in the Company's business are not identified to any of the operating segments, as these  are  used  interchangeably  between  segments. Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and  liabilities  since  a  meaningful  segregation  of  the available data is onerous.\n\nInformation on reportable segments for the year ended March 31, 2019 is as follows:\n\nIT Services\n\n|                                    |             |             |            |           |             | Reconciling   | Reconciling        | Reconciling   | Reconciling   | Reconciling   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                    | Americas  1 | Americas  2 | Europe     | APMEA     | Total       | IT  Products  |                    | ISRE          | Items         | Total         |\n| Revenue                            | '  164,321  | '  168,264  | '  157,165 | '  76,907 | '   566,657 | '             | 14,480             | '  7,932      | '  (9)        | ' 589,060     |\n| Other operating income/(loss), net | -           | -           | -          | -         | 4,344       |               | -                  | -             | -             | 4,344         |\n| Segment Result                     | 23,020      | 29,612      | 31,550     | 9,421     | 93,603      | (1,038)       | (1,892)            |               | 418           | 91,091        |\n| Unallocated                        |             |             |            |           | 4,475       |               | -                  | - -           |               | 4,475         |\n| Segment Result Total               |             |             |            |           | '   102,422 | '             | (1,038) '  (1,892) | '             | 418           | '  99,910     |\n| Finance expense                    |             |             |            |           |             |               |                    |               |               | (7,375)       |\n| Finance and other income           |             |             |            |           |             |               |                    |               |               | 22,923        |",
