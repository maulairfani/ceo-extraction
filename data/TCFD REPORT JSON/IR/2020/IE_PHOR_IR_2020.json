Each SDG relies on rigorous studies that have identified such potential consequences of these challenges that no one will remain uninvolved.\n\nIt is obvious that SDGs are global in nature and are relevant to all countries, people, institutions, companies, etc. It is also clear that they receive attention\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLEAN WATER\n\nAND SANITATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDECENT WORK AND\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINDUSTRY,\n\nINNOVATION AND\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nfrom investors and consumers of our products, as people want to enjoy a clean environment and expect companies to supply safe foods and products.\n\nBusinesses, including those in Russia, are set to play a key role in achieving the Goals. Such insight gave rise to the Global Compact, the largest association of businesses seeking to implement the SDGs. Its mission is to make sure that businesses adhere to and deliver on the Global\n\nCompact's 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, as well as contribute to achieving the SDGs. Importantly, Russian companies are actively joining its ranks, while some of them, like PhosAgro, are among the few LEAD businesses in the world.\n\nJoining climate change initiatives was a trend among companies in 2020. Industry leaders define and endorse science-based targets to cut GHG\n\nemissions, develop roadmaps to meet them and undertake to file reports on their activities in this area. PhosAgro is no stranger to this. In December 2020, the Board of Directors approved the Climate Strategy and the plan for low-carbon transition to 2028. We are delighted to present our first separate report on climate related aspects of our business under the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Setting UN SDG priorities\n\nIn 2020, we prioritised the UN sustainable development goals, which the Company promotes\n\n## The approach:\n\n- \u00b7 We identified the key areas of impact on the society and the environment by PhosAgro as a mining and processing company, based on academic and industry articles and reports.\n- \u00b7 For each area identified, we compiled a list of goals and indicators that are used to measure and report on the impact of mining and processing companies (with a focus on phosphate mining and fertilizer production) on the society, including the UN SDGs, GRI, UNCTAD, and Social Life Cycle Assessment and SDG Compass.\n- \u00b7 We matched the list of goals and indicators with the categories and principles of responsible investment (including Green and Social Bonds, Sustainable Bond Guidelines, Green Loan Principles, Sustainability Linked Loan Principles).\n- \u00b7 We matched the list of goals and indicators with material topics for PhosAgro Group's key stakeholders, and conducted interviews with responsible divisions to prioritise the impacts.\n\nProject results:\n\n- \u00b7 A list of priority impact areas was compiled\n- \u00b7 The list of priority SDGs was updated to reflect the identified impact areas\n- \u00b7 A list of priority SDG objectives was compiled\n- \u00b7 For each objective:\n- -The measures being taken by Company were indicated\n- -The management approach was described\n- -The Company's obligations were defined\n- -The quantitative targets were selected\n- -The relevant GRI indicators were defined\n\nThe ESG agenda can be called a driver of sustainable business transformation. As part of the Company's Development Strategy to 2025, we are seeking to contribute to 11 UN SDGs, keeping a close eye on our progress. This report is intended to give a clear view of how we integrate these SDGs into the Company's strategic priorities and operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how we set UN SDG priorities, see the Sustainability section of the Company's website\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Goals, see the Commitment to UN SDGs section of the Company's website",

PhosAgro Group will invest USD 1.2 million in this project.\n\nIn partnership with FAO, PhosAgro is promoting sustainable soil management among farmers and expanding the Regional Soil Laboratory Network (RESOLAN) in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, which stands out as a unique and successful project, whereby the Russian business community could help developing countries to achieve SDG 2: Zero hunger.\n\nThe initiative is aimed primarily at creating regional soil laboratory networks across developing countries with an emphasis on assessing the quality and safety of fertilizers. PhosAgro plays a key role in the project as it develops a unified global framework to promote technology and know-how, including Russian practices, in sustainable land use and agriculture.  This should help agricultural producers who use intensive farming practices to effectively grow crops without causing additional plant contamination or damaging ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on SDG 2, see the Commitment to UN goals section of the Company's website",

More than three million lives have been lost around the world, and over hundred million people have been infected. The world's economy contracted strongly.\n\nPhosAgro reacted promptly to the first signs of this global pandemic by developing an action plan designed to protect the health of its employees and their families wherever the Company operates. Measures to minimise operational disruptions were swiftly put in place, including Industry-wide cooperative initiatives to maintain the global supply chain in the mineral fertilizer Industry and the wider agricultural economy. PhosAgro made a further contribution to the country's healthcare system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith its emergency PPE and testing kit procurement programme in the amount of more than RUB 3.5 bln.\n\nOur management team led by Andrey Guryev reacted swiftly to this crisis by putting in place an emergency COVID-19 action plan whilst continuing to successfully execute our 2025 Strategic Plan.

The Company met its objectives for 2020 to ramp up its production capacities and improve the long-term sustainability of its operations around the world and is on course to deliver a 25% increase in fertilizer and phosphate production by 2025. It completed its large-scale RUB 100 bln upgrade programme at the Cherepovets site. The SK-3300 sulphuric acid production line was fully commissioned. We also launched the Kryolite railway station.

Total fertilizer exports increased by 4.2% to 7.1 mln t throughout the year, buoyed by the Company's investments in its sales and distribution network and the high quality of its sustainable fertilizers free from cadmium and other toxic substances that can damage human health.\n\nBesides our investment in new projects and our corporate social responsibility programmes and thanks to the strong cash flows generated in 2020, the Board approved an increased dividend of RUB 39 bln, or 83% of adjusted net profit.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Company's strategic focus on sustainability and its longterm investment programme to support it certainly paid dividends in this most challenging year.\n\nIn 2020, the Company continued to improve on its strong sustainability ratings as assessed by Sustainalytics and MSCI ESG Research and maintained its contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as per our 2025 Strategy Plan. The United Nations once again named PhosAgro as a Global Compact LEAD company along with only 41 other businesses worldwide.\n\nThe Board of Directors also approved the Company's updated priority UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adding SDG 13 (Climate Action) to the list of ten previously approved goals. This is in line with the Group's Climate and Water strategies and the low carbon transition plan. Efforts in reducing GHG emissions will focus on cutting emissions at PhosAgro sites across its entire production chain, as well as on energy efficiency measures at the Company's production and infrastructure facilities. In 2020, the Company's CDP rating was raised to B-, further confirming the progress made in combating climate change.\n\nB-\n\nCDP rating raised\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nPhosAgro's Board remains committed to reviewing the Company's corporate governance practices from time to time to protect investors and ensure adherence to the highest standards of corporate governance, including disclosures and director independence.

All individual mandates, including committee memberships and chairmanships, have been confirmed for 2021.\n\nIn keeping with best practice and upon the recommendation of our Audit Committee Chairman, Marcus Rhodes, the Board approved the Company's new IFRS auditor. I would like to take this opportunity to thank KPMG for their outstanding and highly professional service over the past 15 years and welcome PwC as our new audit firm.\n\n## THE YEAR AHEAD\n\nMindful of its obligations to commercial partners and farmers around the world and its responsibility to ensure food security in Russia and over 100 other countries with a reliable supply of its effective fertilizers, the Company\n\nwill remain focused on the execution of its 2025 Strategic Plan as it upgrades its facilities, continues to invest in sustainability and the safe operation of all its production assets. PhosAgro is well-positioned to further increase its share of the global market for sustainable fertilizers as the economic recovery takes a firmer hold worldwide, particularly in Asia, and the UN forecasts a 40% increase in the world's population by the end of the century.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nXavier R.

Amid this unmatched challenge, the health and safety of our employees, their families, and local communities in the regions where we operate remained at the top of our priorities. Thanks to our robust business processes, we were able to quickly adjust to the new operating environment while avoiding disruptions in production and sales of fertilizers in our key markets. In 2020, PhosAgro was leading the way in Russia in terms of safety of its employees and local communities, having taken unprecedented measures to fight the virus. Amid ravages wrought by COVID-19, we introduced ad hoc work practices, spanning from transportation of employees to their workplaces and special\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naccess control at our production sites to creating a safe working environment. Dedicated production workload regulations and schemes ensuring the availability of key reserve personnel supporting continuous production facilities were created for any epidemiological scenario. More than 3,500 people of PhosAgro's 17,500 employees transitioned to work remotely.\n\nEach facility established a response task force. Supported by the management of the Company and its subsidiaries and working in conjunction with highly qualified leading experts in virology and antiepidemic efforts, the task forces helped us ensure that PhosAgro's feel safe at their workplace.\n\nIn addition to caring for our employees and their families, we actively assisted healthcare institutions across our footprint:\n\nwe purchased necessary equipment and protective gear such as oxygen concentrators, lung ventilators, disposable syringes, vacutainers and biomaterials, medical masks and infection prevention suits, disinfectants, as well as tests and reagents for express testing of our employees and residents of the regions where we operate.\n\nIt was through the teamwork and joint efforts that we managed to avoid COVID-19 outbreaks and maintain a safe and comfortable work environment at all of our facilities while at the same time ensuring uninterrupted supply of fertilizers to our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite all the challenges and restrictions of 2020, PhosAgro has done more than simply adjusting to the new circumstances and demonstrating sustainably strong performance: we also delivered record-high production and sales of fertilizers, reached new milestones in our major strategic investment projects, and honoured our promises to investors. With 2020 marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, PhosAgro remained focused on the health of our employees and their families while also working to ensure food security for the Russian market. We have weathered the last year's hardships and lived up to all the challenges we faced.\n\n## STEADY PROGRESS TOWARDS STRATEGY TO 2025\n\n2020 was an exceptionally successful year for PhosAgro, despite all the challenges caused by the COVID19 pandemic. We met all the targets under our Strategy to 2025. In particular, we achieved sustainable growth in production by consistently upgrading existing facilities and adding new ones and also enhancing production efficiency throughout the year. In 2020, PhosAgro's output was up by 5% y-o-y, reaching 10.2 mt.\n\nFertilizer sales were also strong, rising by 5.3% y-o-y to almost 10 mt. Sales growth was driven by higher production volumes and stronger demand in our priority markets. Most importantly, we continued to strengthen our positions in Russia, which is a strategic priority for PhosAgro, with record-high sales of over 3.5 mt, up by more than 12% y-o-y.\n\nEven during the pandemic, PhosAgro kept on implementing its major strategic investment projects as scheduled. In 2020, the Company completed a large-scale upgrade and re-equipment programme at the Cherepovets site worth over RUB 100 bln, which will more than halve our procurement of ammonium sulphate from external suppliers. We commissioned the SK-3300 sulphuric acid production line and launched traffic at the Kryolite railway station. In August 2020, we finished yet another stage of upgrading Balakovo's mineral fertilizer capacities. Our last year's efforts culminated in early 2021, when we completed the first stage of constructing an ammophos plant with a capacity of 231 ktpa in Volkhov and finalised unique repairs on main shaft No. 2, one of the Kirovsk mine's key ore drawing assets set to increase our output going forward.\n\nOur CAPEX in 2020 reached\n\nRUB 40.9 bln, or 49% of the EBITDA, precisely in line with our Strategy to 2025.\n\nNotwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, we stayed on track. For years, PhosAgro has been successfully implementing its investment programme to generate free cash flow enabling us to finance our continued growth, increase our contribution to sustainability efforts, and deliver on our promises to investors.",

PhosAgro's fertilizer output was up by 5% y-o-y, reaching to 10 mt. We delivered this growth by upgrading existing facilities and adding new ones and also enhancing production efficiency throughout the year. During the year, PhosAgro benefitted from a favourable market environment. Robust demand and high availability of fertilizers, coupled with limited global phosphate production, enabled us to increase sales by more than 5% y-oy. As I have already mentioned, we achieved record-high sales in our key market, Russia. As a result, the domestic market share in our total supplies was up by 7.4% y-o-y.\n\nDriven by sales growth, PhosAgro's revenue in 2020 increased by 2.3% y-o-y to RUB 253.9 bln (USD 3.5 bln). EBITDA grew by 11.5% to RUB 84.3 bln (USD 1,2 bln), while EBITDA margin remained strong at 33.2%, up by 2.7 pp y-o-y. In 2020, our free cash flow rose by more than half to over RUB 42 bln, hitting another record. PhosAgro's strong growth enhances our ability to deliver on all our existing obligations to partners and the public at large.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS ONE OF THE PILLARS OF OUR STRATEGY\n\nPhosAgro is a responsible producer of mineral fertilizers used in more than 100 countries across the globe. Sustainable development\n\n## Sales by market, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Russia & CIS\n- Poland, Baltics, Balkans, Western Europe\n- Latin & North America\n- Asia, Africa & RoW\n\nis key to implementing our Strategy to 2025. All of our efforts are geared to creating value for our stakeholders and the public at large. 2020 was an important step towards our goals. PhosAgro's Board of Directors approved climate and water strategies and endorsed a low-carbon transition plan, including measures to cut emissions at the PhosAgro sites and across the value chain, as well as to enhance energy efficiency at the Company's production and infrastructure facilities.\n\nIn September 2020, the UN once again named PhosAgro a Global Compact LEAD company for its ongoing commitment to the Compact's principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption activities. The Company was identified as being among the most highlyengaged participants of the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. Today, there are only 41 LEAD participants globally.\n\n## EBITDA margin, RUB bln\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhosAgro joined efforts with the Russian Association of Fertilizer Producers to support the initiative on green labelling of products with improved environmental characteristics, with an emblem depicting a green wheat spike in a circle to confirm eco-friendliness of Russian-made fertilizers. This indicates the country's increased focus on food quality and security, which we are willing to support and guarantee.\n\nMarking another milestone in 2020, PhosAgro launched a project to use renewable energy sources at its production and social facilities, with solar panels installed in Balakovo. In early 2021, PhosAgro increased green electricity use in agrochemical production after the Apatit mining and processing plant signed a contract for the supply of hydroelectric power from plants on the Kola Peninsula, which covered around 20% of its output. These initiatives are fully in line with PhosAgro's growth trajectory and the UN Sustainable Development Goals it pursues.\n\nOn top of that, the Company's numerous projects won recognition among the largest Russian and international organisations focusing on sustainable development. In October 2020, PhosAgro won the Grand Prix at the Russian Business Leaders: Dynamics and Responsibility Awards held by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Of particular note is that the Grand Prix has been awarded only twice in the history of the awards, and both times it has gone to PhosAgro taking more than half of the nominations. Also in 2020, Sustainalytics improved PhosAgro's ESG rating from 43.8 to 26.9, which is one of the best scores among the largest fertilizer producers in Russia and beyond. In August 2020, MSCI ESG Research, another prominent sustainability firm, upgraded PhosAgro's rating to BBB. Later in December 2020, the Carbon Disclosure Project, one of the largest and most authoritative studies of companies in terms\n\n## GHG emissions per unit of output, kg/t 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof climate responsibility metrics, raised PhosAgro's rating from C to B-. Having achieved appreciation on a global scale, we will keep evolving as we continue to deliver strong results for our stakeholders and the public at large.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\n2020 proved that PhosAgro is on the right track. Even during tough times, the Company demonstrated excellent performance and enhanced its potential for the benefit of our shareholders and all stakeholders while also maintaining its leadership in our key market, Russia. We will certainly continue our progress in 2021 by upgrading existing facilities and adding new ones in line with our investment programme.

The virus first appeared in China at the end of 2019 and spread across the globe over the next couple of months. Countries had to close borders and introduce lockdowns to curb the outbreak, while healthcare systems strained under the pressure.\n\nThe crisis caused by COVID-19 is one of the most economically challenging since World War II. It has led to a significant drop in business and trade activity across global markets (especially during the first wave in March-May 2020) and brought about considerable\n\nuncertainty over the near- and mid-term economic development prospects. The lockdown spurred massive social changes with consequences yet to be fully seen.\n\nAs the pandemic broke out, the mineral fertilizer market did not experience any major shocks. On the contrary, it was actively expanding, with the growth in fertilizer demand supporting the prices. Even under the tightest restrictions, many countries kept supplying and transporting mineral fertilizers to safeguard the agricultural chain. A key contributor to the planet's food security, our industry turned out to be less affected by the global crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RUSSIA'S REVISED FOOD SECURITY DOCTRINE\n\n## JANUARY 2020\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin approved the country's revised Food Security Doctrine. In addition to securing food independence, and accessibility and affordability of high-quality foods to every citizen nationwide, from now on increasing food exports will be among the doctrine's targets. In addition, the doctrine provides for boosting the yield of key crops and fertility of agricultural land, sustainable use of farm soils and for promoting land reclamation.\n\nCompetitive pricing is yet another factor to place Russian eco-efficient agricultural products at the centre of the global consumer market. According to Russia's Ministry of Agriculture, the share of crops to be supplied under the Green One brand will account for 10-15% of all agricultural exports by 2024.\n\n## LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE GREEN ONE BRAND\n\n## MARCH 2020\n\nThe government introduced the first out of six packages of the national standard for production, transportation and storage of improved agricultural products, raw materials, and food. This includes introduction of GOST R 58658-2019 'Agricultural products, raw materials and food with improved environmental characteristics. Mineral fertilizers.

An even greater number of people suffered a severe disease form. The pandemic is expected to push nearly 90 million people into extreme poverty. Global economy is still recovering from the steep plunge it took in April 2020 amid the lockdown restrictions. However, due to the ongoing spread of COVID-19, many countries have slowed down the lifting of prohibitive prescriptions, while some other nations are reintroducing part of the lockdown restrictions to protect the most vulnerable groups of populations. The crisis caused by COVID-19 is one of the most economically challenging since World War II, as it led to a significant drop in business and trade activity across global markets (especially during the first wave in March-May 2020) and brought about considerable uncertainty over the near- and mid-term economic development prospects.\n\nAccording to the IMF outlook 1 , global economy will lose 4.4% in 2020, with a growth of 5.2% forecasted for 2021. That said, the scale and speed of recovery remain largely unknown. The IMF believes that industrial production in both advanced and developing economies will drop below the 2019 level. With its strong and resilient recovery rates, China stands out as one of the remarkable exceptions. According to the World Trade Organisation, global trade saw a sharp decline in the first half of 2020, comparable to the plunge experienced during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.\n\nAfter the recovery in 2021, global growth rates are expected to gradually slow down to approximately 3.5% in the mid-term. This implies only limited progress toward catching up to the path of economic activity for 2020-2025 projected before the pandemic for both advanced and emerging market and developing economies. It is also a severe setback to the projected improvement in average living standards across all country groups.\n\nWorld Economic Outlook, IMF, October 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evolution of global GDP, %\n\n| Countries                                 |   Actual |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |       |   Forecast |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|------------|\n|                                           |   2010   | 2011   | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020  |     2021   |\n| World                                     |      5.1 |    3.9 |    3.4 |    3.3 |    3.4 |    3.2 |    3.2 |    3.7 |    3.6 |    2.8 | (4.4) |        5.2 |\n| Advanced economies                        |      3   |    1.7 |    1.2 |    1.4 |    1.8 |    2.1 |    1.7 |    2.3 |    2.2 |    1.7 | (5.8) |        3.9 |\n| Emerging market and  developing economies |      7.4 |    6.2 |    5.1 |    4.7 |    4.6 |    4   |    4.3 |    4.7 |    4.5 |    3.7 | (3.3) |        6   |\n\n## RUSSIAN ECONOMY\n\nIn 2020, the Russian economy faced unprecedented challenges due to the suspension of business activity in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19, as well as the drop in oil prices and export demand. The pandemic crisis led to a significant fall in Russian GDP, record-breaking reduction of real disposable incomes, growing unemployment rates, slowdown in consumption and investment, and, finally, a 'staggering' budget\n\ndeficit (as the Russian authorities put it themselves). Estimates of the pandemic scale and timeline changed throughout the year. To date, the range of forecasts and projections is still very broad.\n\nAccording to the forecast by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, the GDP decline in 2020 will amount to 3.9%, with a growth of 3.3% projected for 2021. The key assumption in the forecast\n\nby the Russian Ministry of Economic Development is that of gradual global economic recovery, including the revival of foreign export demand. Oil and gas are not expected to dominate the export mix. The 2021 forecast also assumes the resumption of product and service imports (up by 10% in real terms) primarily driven by recovery in the service segment.\n\n## Russian economic growth\n\n| Item                     |   Actual |   Actual |        |        |        |       |        |        |        |        | Forecast   | Forecast   |\n|--------------------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n|                          |   2010   |   2011   | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015  | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020       | 2021F      |\n| GDP, %                   |      4.5 |      4.3 |    3.7 |    1.8 |    0.7 | (2.0) |    0.3 |    1.8 |    2.5 |    1.3 | (3.9)      | 3.3        |\n| Industrial production, % |      7.3 |      5   |    3.4 |    0.4 |    1.7 | (3.4) |    1.1 |    2.1 |    2.9 |    2.3 | (4.1)      | 2.6        |",

These goods benefitted from preferential supply terms during the lockdown. As a result, we saw an increase in trade volumes for both core agricultural products and fertilizers. Farmers from many advanced and developing economies received additional government subsidies designed to boost the resilience of supply chains in the agricultural sector. This had a positive effect on the global mineral fertilizer market.\n\n## HIGH LEVEL NUTRIENT DEMAND REVIEW\n\nThe International Fertilizer Association (IFA) expects 1 global fertilizer use to rebound by 1.6% to 189.8 mln t nutrient in 2019/20, following an estimated decline of 1.7% to 186.8 mln t nutrient in 2018/19.\n\n## Global fertilizer use, mln t nutrient\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nThe rise in global fertilizer use in 2019/20 was led by India, where the monsoon brought abundant rainfall, and improved consumption in the US. In South Asia and North America consumption grew by ca. 6.0%, or 2.0 and 1.4 mln t nutrient respectively. Eastern Europe and Central Asia (FSU countries) registered a more than 10%  (0.9 mln t nutrient) growth in 2019/20, mostly driven by higher consumption in Russia. Latin America and the Middle East saw an increase of 0.5 mln t nutrient, or 2% and 10% respectively. Fertilizer use remained almost stable in West and Central Europe (WCE) and Oceania\n\nand was estimated to be down in Africa by some 0.2 mln t nutrient, or 2.4%. Lower consumption was also recorded in East Asia (down by 2.3 mln t nutrient, or 3.5%) primarily due to reduced demand in China, Indonesia and Malaysia caused by unfavourable weather conditions (drought) coupled with adverse trends in the palm oil market.\n\nIn 2020/21, IFA anticipates a 2% increase in global fertilizer use to 193.5 mln t nutrient despite the COVID19 pandemic. Phosphorus (P2O5) consumption is expected to increase by 3%, compared with 1.6% for nitrogen (N) and 1.4% for potassium (K2O).\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to greater fertilizer demand, including government measures to support agricultural producers and the mineral fertilizer industry, resilient crop prices, weakening of domestic currencies in large agricultural exporting countries, and favourable weather in key consuming countries.\n\nDespite the overall growth in global fertilizer use, some countries are still experiencing difficulties due to logistics and other limitations related to the pandemic.\n\nThe World Bank, International Grains Council (IGC) and other industry organisations expect global production of grains and oilseeds to grow, with drivers including increases in cultivated land and crop yields across the key regions (in Brazil and the USA following a recovery from the 2019 challenges). Global output of rice rose slightly on expanded acreage in Asia, while wheat output remained stable.\n\nSouth Asia (with an anticipated growth of 5.6 mln t nutrient) is expected to be the main positive driver of global fertilizer use in 2020/21, followed by North America and Latin America (0.5 and 0.7 mln t nutrient respectively) and Europe (0.5 mln t nutrient). Four regions could gain around 100,000 tonnes of nutrients each: EECA, Africa, Oceania and WCE.\n\nIndia will be the main contributor to global demand growth in 2020/21, including as a result of a favourable monsoon season in the second half of 2020. In Latin America, Brazil will be the main growth driver given an expected soy and corn acreage expansion. Further recovery in fertilizer use is anticipated in the USA and Canada, also as a result of expanded acreage. Russia is also expected to deliver stable growth in fertilizer use attributable to favourable conditions in the grains market.\n\n## Global fertilizer demand, mln t nutrient\n\n| Nutrient             |   2019/20 |   2020/21 | 2019/2020, %   |   2020/2021, % |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Nitrogen (N)         |     106.7 |     108.4 | 2.8            |            1.6 |\n| Phosphate (P 2 O 5 ) |      47.1 |      48.6 | 2.6            |            3.2 |\n| Potassium (K 2 O)    |      36.1 |      36.6 | (2.7)          |            1.4 |\n| Total                |     189.9 |     193.6 | 1.7            |            1.9 |\n\n## Fertilizer consumption trends by region in 2019-2021, mln t nutrient\n\n## Anticipated changes in fertilizer consumption by region in 2020-2021, mln t nutrient\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HIGH LEVEL NUTRIENT SUPPLY REVIEW\n\nWorld fertilizer supply in 2020 remained relatively resilient globally. Despite uncertainties and new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply of ammonia, urea, MAP and potassium fertilizers was on a steady growth path, while both DAP and TSP production declined slightly.\n\nTemporary shutdowns or closures of plants in the nitrogen and potassium market segments were balanced by the start-up of new facilities / ramp-ups. As for phosphate products, capacities remained almost unchanged compared with 2019. The key factors affecting the supply of fertilizers in 2020 included natural gas price volatility, notably in Europe, higher inflation, FX rate fluctuations, and new trade defence measures. In June 2020, US-based Mosaic\n\n1\n\nfiled petitions with the country's Department of Commerce and  International Trade Commission for countervailing duty investigations to determine whether producers of phosphate fertilizers in Morocco and Russia were receiving subsidies. In November 2020, the US Department of Commerce issued preliminary determinations on phosphate fertilizer imports, with rates ranging from 17% to 75% depending on the producer from Morocco or Russia. The investigations are expected to end with a final decision on the rates in Q2 2021.\n\nAccording to IFA 1 , despite the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the output of raw materials demonstrated moderate growth. Estimates show that global output of ammonia, phosphate rock and primary potash was up by 1% each.\n\nIn 2020, global supply of the key nutrients - nitrogen, phosphate and potassium - was estimated at 253 mln t nutrient, up 0.7% yearon-year. Fertilizer demand (79% of total demand) was estimated at 191.4 mln t nutrient, up 2.2% year-on-year. Net industrial uses, non-allocated tonnages and distribution losses totalled 51.7 mln t nutrient.\n\nProduction capacities showed mixed performance in the key segments, remaining almost flat in phosphoric acid and increasing in ammonia and potassium. Overall global net capacity growth in the three segments was 5.4 mln t nutrients.\n\n- Executive Summary Short-Term Fertilizer Outlook 2020-2021 Market Intelligence and Agriculture Services International Fertilizer Association (IFA), November 2020.",

Jordan and other North African countries accounted for 18% and 14% of global exports respectively. The largest importers of phosphate rock were India (25%), Europe (23%) and Latin America (15%). Phosphate rock prices were growing gradually throughout 2020 amid favourable trends in  phosphatebased fertilizer markets.\n\n## Phosphate-based fertilizers\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, global production of the main types of phosphate-based fertilizers (DAP/ MAP) grew by 3% in 2020 to 64 mln t in real terms. MAP output increased by ca. 5% driven by higher production in Russia, Brazil, Morocco and the US, while DAP output grew by 2%, in particular as a result of reduced production in China and India caused by COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\nGlobal trade in DAP/MAP in 2020 was 31.3 mln t vs 30.1 mln t in 2019. Imports of DAP/MAP to Latin America and South Asia (India) grew strongly, whereas supplies to the US shrank due to, among other things, the investigation opened to determine whether producers from Morocco and Russia, the key suppliers of phosphatebased fertilizers globally, were receiving subsidies. Exports of DAP from China declined in 2020 on the back of lower production/ exports amid COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nGlobal prices for the main types of phosphate-based fertilizers were mostly growing in 2020 supported by favourable conditions in the core agricultural product markets\n\nand high affordability of fertilizers as a result. Besides, the key markets enjoyed favourable weather conditions, which also contributed to higher seasonal demand in India, Brazil and the US. As DAP/MAP exports from China and the US reduced in favour of domestic supplies, this served as an additional driver of higher global prices.\n\n## AMMONIA AND UREA MARKET\n\n## Ammonia\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, global ammonia production in 2020 expanded by 1.1% to 179.4 mln t, with Russia, the USA and Saudi Arabia among the main growth contributors. At the same time, ammonia production contracted in Latin America (with amplified idle capacity in Brazil, disruptions in natural gas supplies in Venezuela, and one of the plants shut down in Trinidad) and South Asia (due to disruptions in commodity supplies and fallout from COVID19 in Bangladesh and India). Despite the closure of production capacities in Kuwait and trade sanctions imposed on Iranian products still\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJanuary February March April  May  June  July August September October November December\n\nJanuary February March April  May  June  July August September October November December\n\nin force, ammonia production in the Middle East increased by 1% driven by growth in Saudi Arabia.\n\nGlobal ammonia trade volumes in 2020 are estimated at 19.7 mln t, up 0.4% year-on-year. Russian exports account for 24% of world trade. The share of Trinidad and Tobago in global ammonia exports stands at 23%. There is also a notable rise in exports from Eastern Europe, Central Asia and North America. In 2020, contraction of ammonia imports was recorded in India, Mexico and Ukraine, whereas China, Morocco and the USA increased their imports. Pricing in the global ammonia market was influenced by low natural gas prices and decreased import activity in Q2-Q3 2020, including due to the impact from COVID-19. In late 2020, global ammonia prices began to recover on the back of stronger seasonal demand in the key merchant ammonia export markets.\n\n## Urea\n\nGlobal urea production in 2020 increased by 2.8% to 181.7 mln t driven by growing volumes in Asia, Africa and North America.\n\nChina still ranks as the largest urea manufacturer in the world, with production in 2020 rising by 2.9% to 56.8 mln t. The only recorded contraction was in Latin America due to the suspension of production and disruptions in commodity supplies in Brazil, Bolivia and Venezuela.\n\nGlobal urea trade volumes in 2020 are estimated at 52.2 mln t, up 3.4% year-on-year. This is due to a considerable increase in demand for imports in Brazil and other Latin American countries and continued demand from India, the world's largest urea importer. 2020 saw the resumption of urea exports from Ukraine driven by relatively low prices for natural gas and higher production volumes.\n\nGlobal urea prices are traditionally highly volatile due to seasonal changes in the balance between demand and supply in the global market. The reduction of prices from April to June comes about as seasonal demand in the key sales markets (North America, Europe, China and Russia draws to an end, with recovery following on the back of higher import\n\n## Evolution of merchant ammonia prices, USD per tonne, FOB, Baltic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndemand from India and Brazil, the leading urea consumers.\n\n## POTASH FERTILIZER MARKET\n\nAccording to the preliminary IFA estimates, global production of potash feedstock in 2020 recovered by 0.8% to 42.1 mln t of \u041a2\u041e, including as a result of higher demand from the key markets of North and South America and India. New capacity launches in 2020 had a limited impact due to the gradual ramp-up of new capacities.\n\n## Global trade volumes\n\nfor potassium chloride, the key type of potash-based fertilizers, reached approximately 51.4 mln t in 2020, up 5.8% year-on-year. With favourable weather conditions and continued growth in the agricultural markets, the USA, Brazil and India increased their imports, whereas the key consumption markets in Asia (China, South East Asia) cut back on import demand, producing a negative on global prices, especially in the first half of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrilled\n\nGranulated",

Biotechnology advances are set to greatly boost crop yields without damaging ecosystems and bring the agriculture to a whole new level of development. Given the limited soil resources and the strong population growth, biotechnology is key to achieving the global food security.\n\n## Sales support\n\nPhosAgro seeks to be closer to its customers and make eco-efficient mineral fertilizers even more available to domestic farmers.\n\n## Transition to the service model\n\nThe Company started migrating from a commodity seller to a service provider. The new model relies on a digital environment to offer a compound product, i.e. product + agronomic expertise or access to innovations.\n\nThe product offering is customised to the fullest extent based on big data (customer data obtained in a digital environment).\n\n## Digital crop nutrient monitoring system using NFC tags\n\nIn 2020, PhosAgro successfully completed its pilot project to deploy a digital system using NFC tags to carry out remote monitoring of the effectiveness of mineral fertilizers. This was a joint project between PhosAgro-Region and Exact Farming. One of the advantages of using the NFC technology is the ability to control the delivery and application of PhosAgro's mineral fertilizers along the entire logistics chain 'from factory to farm' in order to minimise the loss or theft of fertilizers during transportation.

In 2020, long trains accounted for 69% of PhosAgro's total shipments, greatly speeding up the traffic, increasing the rolling stock turnaround, and resulting in a positive environmental effect due to lower energy costs per tonne of cargo.\n\nTargets\n\nInvestments\n\n## Current status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease in\n\nthe railway\n\nthroughput\n\ncapacity from 12\n\nto over\n\n16.5\n\nmtpa\n\nThe decision to electrify the Kriolit railway station during its construction enabled PhosAgro to spare two diesel locomotives, resulting in a positive economic and environmental effect.\n\nthe key goal in logistics - expansion of the Company's rail infrastructure throughput to over 16.5 mtpa.\n\n## Contribution to UN SDGs\n\nINDUSTRY,\n\nINNOVATION AND\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SDG 9.1\n\nDeveloping rail infrastructure and contributing to the development of local communities through our value chain.\n\n## Increase in the number of long trains\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Switching to long trains (100 railcars in length)\n\n2020 Kriolit station launched (Apatit)\n\n2022 Port infrastructure improvement in Vistino with the Northern park to be launched (phase 2)\n\n2023 Revamp of the Aykuven railway station (Kirovsk Branch of Apatit)\n\nHigher traffic speed\n\nQuicker railcar turnaround\n\nEnvironmental effect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRUB bln\n\nTraffic service started in December 2020 at the Kriolit station and along the track connecting to the Nelazskoye station\n\nA rail car service station to be designed and constructed in 2021-2022\n\nProject\n\nschedule\n\n2018-2022\n\nApatity\n\nUst-Luga\n\nPorts of discharge\n\nCherepovets\n\n## DEVELOPING PORT INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n## Enhancing port infrastructure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to developing its distribution network in Russia, our key market, PhosAgro continues to expand its footprint and enhance the competitiveness of its products in foreign markets by both building up state-of-the-art transshipment facilities and reducing the cost of transportation.\n\nThe new transshipment destinations enable the Company to optimise empty runs and come closer to achieving even more ambitious goals of increasing the train carrying capacity. The joint project between PhosAgro and Russian Railways provides for both companies' infrastructure upgrades and aims to start operating 100-car trains on the Apatity-Cherepovets-UstLuga-Apatity loop as early as in 2023. If successful, this project will make transportation of phosphate rock and mineral fertilizers much more efficient, both economically and environmentally.\n\nThe Kriolit railway station in Cherepovets launched in 2020 and specifically designed to service 100-car trains is the linchpin of this loop.\n\nPhosAgro is a key partner of such ports as Tuloma Sea Terminal (Lavna) and Ultramar Terminal (Vistino). These ports are being constructed in compliance with all applicable environmental requirements and located outside the 500 m water protection area.\n\n## Ultramar Terminal in Ust-Luga\n\nPhosAgro and Ultramar signed a long-term agreement for transshipment of PhosAgro's mineral fertilizers through the new terminal being built by Ultramar at the port of Ust-Luga. The terminal will be the largest in Europe in terms of cargo storage capacity. Going forward, it will be able to handle up to 25 mtpa,\n\nincluding more than 3 mtpa of PhosAgro fertilizers, which will make it a crucial facility for the Company. The transshipment through the Ultramar Terminal is scheduled to begin in 2021-2022. The terminal will be able to handle 100-car trains delivering mineral fertilizers from Cherepovets.\n\n## Tuloma Sea Terminal\n\nPhosAgro signed a memorandum of cooperation with Infotech Baltika concerning the construction of a specialised marine terminal for the transshipment of mineral fertilizers and apatite concentrate at the seaport of Murmansk.\n\nInfotech Baltika is building a terminal in the area of the Lavna River. The start of operations is planned for March 2023.\n\nThe project will help provide PhosAgro with the needed transshipment capacity and reduce transport costs. The ability of the terminal, which is currently under construction, to receive large Panamax-class vessels will improve the economic efficiency of sea transportation through the northern territories, while the proximity of the terminal to the Company's production assets will streamline the railway logistics for transshipments.\n\n## Contribution to UN SDGs:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SDG 9.1\n\nDeveloping port infrastructure, creating employment opportunities and implementing social investment programmes.",

The long-term development programme allowed us to produce more than ten million tonnes of commercial products a year for the first time ever, while total fertilizer sales grew by more than 5%. Growth in fertilizer sales against a backdrop of favourable pricing environment on the global markets ensured an 11.5% increase in the Company's EBITDA to RUB 84.3 bln. At the same time, our EBITDA margin of more than 33% remains one of the highest in the industry.\n\nI would also like to highlight our business's ability to generate significant cash flows despite the challenging conditions - by the end of the year our cash flow reached RUB 42.5 bln, an all-time record for the Company.\n\nPhosAgro's leverage is stable at 1.86x net debt / EBITDA, while CAPEX for the reporting period amounted to less than 50% of EBITDA.\n\nWe currently see a surge in demand and prices for all major types of mineral fertilizers as a result of high prices for major crops and seasonal demand in key sales markets - Europe, the domestic market of the US, and China.\n\nOn top of that, India is likely to contribute to fertilizer demand in the near term due to low carry-over stocks and, consequently, a potential early start of seasonal procurement.\n\nAlexander Sharabaiko,\n\nDeputy CEO for Finance and International Projects\n\n## KEY DRIVERS OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nPhosAgro's financial performance in 2020 was materially impacted by the following key factors and events:\n\n- \u00b7 surge in prices for all major types of mineral fertilizers during the year as a result of high prices for major crops and seasonal demand in key sales markets - Europe, the domestic market of the US, and China;\n- \u00b7 limited supply of phosphatebased fertilizers due to lack of new production capacities and lower output at the beginning of the year amid the spread of COVID-19;\n- \u00b7 shrinking phosphate-based fertilizer exports from China and other countries.\n\n## REVENUE ANALYSIS\n\nRevenue for 2020 grew by 2.3% y-o-y and amounted to RUB 253.9 bln. Revenue growth was driven by higher sales.\n\nIn 2020, lower average sales prices for phosphate- and nitrogen-based fertilizers were fully offset by a 5.3% increase in sales volumes and an 11.4% depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY 2020 financial and operational highlights, RUB mln\n\n| Item                        | 12M 2019         | 12M 2020         | Change y-o-y, %   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Revenue                     | 248,125          | 253,879          | 2.3               |\n| EBITDA 1                    | 75,582           | 84,280           | 11.5              |\n| EBITDA margin               | 30.5%            | 33.2%            | 2.7 p.p.          |\n| Net profit                  | 49,408           | 16,921           | (65.8)            |\n| Adjusted net profit 2       | 37,062           | 46,791           | 26.3              |\n| Free cash flow              | 28,272           | 42,517           | 50.4              |\n|                             | 31 December 2019 | 31 December 2020 |                   |\n| Net debt                    | 131,583          | 156,875          |                   |\n| 12M net debt / EBITDA       | 1.74             | 1.86             |                   |\n| Sales volume, kt            | 12M 2019         | 12M 2020         | Change y-o-y, %   |\n| Phosphate-based fertilizers | 7,255            | 7,669            | 5.7               |\n| Nitrogen-based fertilizers  | 2,197            | 2,286            | 4.0               |\n| Total sales                 | 9,452            | 9,955            | 5.3               |\n\n## Revenue breakdown by key products, RUB bln\n\n| Item                     |   2019 |   2020 |   Change y-o-y, % |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|-------------------|\n| Phosphate-based products |  201.3 |  203.6 |               1.1 |\n| Nitrogen-based products  |   37.9 |   38.7 |               2.1 |\n| Other                    |    9   |   11.6 |              28.9 |\n| Total                    |  248.1 |  253.9 |               2.3 |\n\n## Revenue breakdown by region, RUB bln\n\n| Item          |   2019 |   2020 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Russia        |   80.7 |   85.1 |\n| CIS           |   13.6 |   10.5 |\n| Europe        |   72.4 |   66.5 |\n| South America |   34.8 |   41.9 |\n| Africa        |    9.5 |   12.3 |\n| India         |   14.2 |   21.6 |\n| North America |   19.4 |   12.3 |\n| Others        |    3.9 |    3.6 |\n\n- 1.

The growth was driven by high EBITDA margin and efficient working capital management.\n\nCapital investments for the year reached RUB 40.9 bln (USD 567 mln), which is equal to 49% of the 2020 EBITDA. The Company's investments were focused around the development of the raw material base in Kirovsk, upgrade of fertilizer production and railway infrastructure in Cherepovets, launch of a new flexible line producing ammonium sulphate in Balakovo and construction of new facilities at the Volkhov site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n42.5 RUB bln free cash flow (FCF) in 2020\n\n## Change in EBITDA components in 2020, RUB bln\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 EBITDA (plan/actual), RUB bln\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBITDA to FCF conversion in 2020, RUB bln\n\n<!-- image -->",

Robust demand and high affordability of fertilizers, coupled with limited global phosphate production, laid grounds for a 5% y-o-y sales growth for this type of product. We greatly benefitted from our consistent investments in production over the previous years.\n\nThe Kirovsk branch of Apatit reached stable annual production of more than 10.5 mln t of apatite concentrate. The Cherepovets site increased its output by almost 5%. The Balakovo branch launched the production of granulated ammonium sulphate, a product new for the Company and unique for the Russian market. The Volkhov branch of Apatit is undergoing a global transformation, PhosAgro's largest investment project to date, worth about RUB 28 bln.\n\nAs a result of higher output and larger share of higher-margin complex fertilizers, we were able to solidify our leadership on the Russian market and increase sales to domestic farmers by almost 10%.\n\nMikhail Rybnikov, First Deputy CEO\n\n## PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company developed its own green label certifying the environmental safety of products. PhosAgro's fertilizers do not have as much cadmium content as would be dangerous for health (less than 5 mg / kg, which is much less than the 20 mg / kg threshold recommended by France's ANSES), contributing to cleaner soil, healthy crops and high quality of foods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Today, PhosAgro's portfolio includes\n\n52 fertilizer grades\n\n12\n\n## Mineral fertilizers\n\nNitrogen-phosphorus and complex fertilizers\n\nNitrogen-phosphorus and complex fertilizers with micronutrients\n\nNitrogen-based fertilizers\n\nLiquid complex\n\nfertilizers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhosAgro is the only producer of liquid nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers in Russia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincluding 12 with micronutrients.\n\n## Feed additives\n\nFeed grade\n\nurea\n\nMonocalcium phosphate feed grade\n\n## Concentrates\n\nHigh-grade phosphate rock\n\nSyenite alkali aluminium concentrate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNepheline concentrate\n\n## Industrial phosphates\n\nSodium Tripolyphosphate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndustrial products",

Apatit is the world's largest producer of high-grade phosphate rock and Russia's only producer of nepheline concentrate.\n\n## UPSTREAM\n\nPhosAgro has its own deposits of apatite-nepheline ore, which is unique in terms of its environmental friendliness and safety. Its feedstock reserves are of igneous origin, and so they do not have concentrations of toxic heavy metals. PhosAgro's own deposits of apatite-nepheline ore ensure 100% self-sufficiency when it comes to the production of phosphate rock (apatite concentrate extremely rich in P2O5). The mine life of the Company's resource base is estimated at around 60 years.\n\nThe branch develops six Khibiny deposits: Kukisvumchorr, Yukspor, Apatitovy Cirque, Rasvumchorr Plateau, Koashva and Njorkpahk.\n\n## Further development\n\nof the Kirovsk branch depends on underground and open pit mining. The development of the raw material base is currently seen as a priority and PhosAgro's capital investments are focused on the construction of new mining facilities to replace the retired ones, increase in productivity, as well as upgrade and purchase of equipment.\n\n## PhosAgro ore reserves as at 1 January 2021\n\n| Deposit             | Balance reserves, kt   (A+B+C1+C2)   |   Average P 2 O 5  content,  % |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Kukisvumchorr       | 368,549                              |                          14.17 |\n| Yukspor             | 462,056                              |                          13.98 |\n| Apatitovy Cirque    | 98,824                               |                          13.82 |\n| Rasvumchorr Plateau | 88,569                               |                          10.64 |\n| Koashva             | 748,634                              |                          15.94 |\n| Njorkpahk           | 53,204                               |                          13.87 |\n| Total               | 1,819,836                            |                          14.65 |\n\n## Licences\n\n## Mining licences\n\n| Kirovsky mine                                      | Kukisvumchorr and Yukspor  deposits                | 31.12.2025   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Vostochny mine                                     | Koashva deposit                                    | 31.12.2038   |\n|                                                    | Njorkpahk deposit                                  | 31.12.2063   |\n| Rasvumchorrsky mine                                | Apatitovy Cirque and Rasvumchorr  Plateau deposits | 01.01.2024   |\n| Vostochny / Rasvumchorrsky mine                    | Rasvumchorr Plateau deposit                        | 31.12.2021   |\n| Geological survey, exploration and mining licenses | Geological survey, exploration and mining licenses |              |\n| Plot Plateau                                       | Plot Plateau                                       | 14.12.2040   |\n| Iyolitovy Otrog deposit                            | Iyolitovy Otrog deposit                            | 01.02.2024   |\n\nIn 2020, the Company produced 37.55 mln t of apatite-nepheline ore, and it plans to increase the output to 41 mln t by 2027.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, the Company produced of apatite-nepheline ore\n\n37.55 mln t\n\n## Key projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 In Q4 2020, a skip hoisting complex was commissioned at main shaft No. 1 with an annual design capacity of 3.4 mln t.

Creating a favourable environment for improving educational standards and providing targeted career guidance to final-year students.\n- \u00b7 Cooperating with technical colleges in our regions of operation. Creating a pipeline of skilled employees with relevant competencies who are competitive in the labour market, understand related professions, and have what it takes to pursue career opportunities.

The Code clearly outlines the basic requirements for Company employees and establishes rules and regulations for individual and collective behaviour within the Company. The document covers all professional and business relationships, both at PhosAgro and with business partners and other external parties.\n\nWhen agreeing and concluding contracts with external contractors, it is an imperative for us to cover arrangements and commitments related to mutual respect of human rights and compliance with the Company's Code of Ethics. Commitment to these principles ensures that all our employees take pride in their work and are keen to communicate with colleagues, feel comfortable in a team and can grow both professionally and personally.\n\n## KEY INDICATORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Productivity 1 , t per person\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Average headcount by region of operation in 2020, people 4\n\n| Region           | Men      | Women   | Total   |\n|------------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Saratov region   | 1,263    | 623     | 1,886   |\n| Murmansk region  | 5,997    | 2,021   | 8,018   |\n| Moscow region    | 216      | 172     | 388     |\n| Leningrad region | 721      | 479     | 1,200   |\n| Vologda region   | 3,129    | 2,365   | 5,494   |\n| Other            | 653      | 252     | 905     |\n| Total            | 11,978.5 | 5,912.8 | 17,891  |\n\n17,891 people\n\nthe Company had an average headcount In 2020\n\n- 1.

In 2020, our employees reported no human rights violations via the hotline.\n\nResponding to the way people have to communicate in the wake of the turbulences and remote working of 2020, we are active\n\nin introducing novel technology in corporate communications.

The Company's personnel training framework is mainly designed to help the employees unlock their career potential and ensure ongoing improvement of their professional and managerial competencies.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and external restrictions in 2020, we completely transformed our personnel management processes both on the operational and strategic sides. Personnel training, evaluation and development all went online, helping to develop distance learning and evaluation. In 2020, PhosAgro implemented new solutions such as employee potential assessment used along\n\nwith managerial competency assessment to decide on whether an employee should be promoted; personality tests and questionnaires for white-collar workers and executives to quickly identify risk areas in personnel management and fine-tune the cycle of management initiatives for higher operational efficiency.\n\n## PROGRAMMES FOR UPGRADING EMPLOYEE SKILLS AND TRANSITION ASSISTANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhosAgro relies on its Talent Pool initiative as a means of identifying talented staff with the potential to step into senior positions. Eligible employees are provided with additional training they need to succeed. The programme includes management training courses on personal and business skills such as decision-making, leadership and delegation, conflict management, project management, communication skills and staff mentoring.\n\n2020 saw the launch of the Senior and Middle Management Mentoring Programme, with the senior executives (mentors) sharing their expertise and knowledge and taking the Company's management culture to the next level. This is a unique opportunity for those included into the talent pool (mentees) to learn the skill of management from the best professionals.

The project focuses on comprehensive evaluation of the safety culture and the OHS management system's performance, as well as development and finalisation of action plans to improve them in line with established targets.\n\nFor better OHS efficiency, and to automate and streamline the relevant processes, we have been successfully using the Safety and Instructions (Shift Assignments) management systems.\n\nThey helped us achieve the following goals:\n\n- \u00b7 improve the manageability of employees and equipment safety;\n- \u00b7 optimise administrative expenses associated with managing the safety of employees and equipment;\n- \u00b7 obtain reliable and complete information about the safety of employees and equipment.\n\nWith these systems, we also reached the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 centralised health and industrial and fire safety management;\n- \u00b7 faster collection, processing and analysis of employee and equipment safety data;\n- \u00b7 real-time reporting across the Group, including reports to government authorities;\n- \u00b7 24/7 access to current information about every employee and site.\n\nIn line with statutory requirements, the Company is subject to scheduled external audits by Russian regulatory authorities, including the Federal Service for the Supervision of Environment, Technology and Nuclear Management (Rostekhnadzor), State Labour Inspectorate, Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor), and Ministry for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters (EMERCOM). We may also engage consulting companies, or international associations of which the Company is a member to conduct additional external audits, or may organise such audits as part of a special assessment of workplace conditions.\n\nIn 2020, state supervisory authorities carried out 146 audits at Apatit and its managed companies. A considerable decrease in the number of audits (vs 286 in 2018 and 368 in 2019) was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to some of them (including scheduled audits) being cancelled or postponed.",

Orders contain remedial action plans, including the deadlines and persons responsible for their implementation. Identified breaches are remedied within the agreed time limits, and gaps that can be eliminated at no additional cost are addressed immediately.\n\nThe Company has a procedure for drafting, submitting and reviewing reports on internal and external OHS audits. The results of all internal and external assessments and audits are recorded\n\nin the Safety and Instructions (Shift Assignments) management systems for further analysis, gap identification and elimination monitoring. We also submit all relevant reports to state supervisory bodies and statistical agencies in accordance with the Russian laws.\n\n## WORKERS COVERED BY AN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n403-8\n\n100 % In 2020, our health and safety management system covered all of the Company's employees.\n\n## HAZARD IDENTIFICATION, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has implemented a systems-based approach to hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation as a fully integrated process. This approach seeks to integrate occupational health and safety management into the Company's overall business processes.\n\nWe have adopted a system that moves through a 'plando-check-act' cycle, promoting leadership and best practices through meaningful consultation and participation of employees from all job levels in the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has introduced audits and assessments to ensure compliance with and PhosAgro's corporate standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApatit, our largest enterprise, is certified for compliance with OHSAS 18001.\n\nWe are constantly working to assess and mitigate risks. We perform risk assessment and identify material risks using our proprietary methodology. Following hazard identification and risk assessment, the unit's OHS officer compiles a list of local occupational risks, which is then used as a basis for the Company's list of material occupational risks. Risk assessment takes into account the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 degree of personnel exposure;\n- \u00b7 impact on personnel;\n- \u00b7 frequency of occurrence;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the applicable regulatory and other OHS requirements.\n\nThe list of material occupational risks is available on our intranet site. We update the lists of hazards and risks to factor in new inputs.\n\nIn 2020, we implemented a Risk Management module in the Safety and Instructions (Shift Assignments) management systems to enable the use of check lists for systemsbased internal OHS assessments at all business units of Apatit. The module will simplify control and analysis and boost the efficiency of production H&S control.\n\nThe Company has a formal procedure for addressing workplace hazards. When a hazard is identified, employees are required to suspend work and report it to their supervisors directly or via the Public Inspector mobile app (the report is then used to develop a remedial action plan).\n\n## Using the Public Inspector app\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with an established procedure, information about incidents is provided by eyewitnesses to the supervisors in charge and by those supervisors to the dispatcher of the enterprise. Next, the dispatcher notifies the designated persons using text messages and phone calls.\n\nIndustrial accidents and incidents are investigated in accordance with legislative requirements and internal procedures to determine the root causes. The Company encourages its staff to disclose information on potential sources of danger to employee health and life.",

The system provides for both internal and external communication and includes a feedback procedure.\n\nInternal communication is achieved through:\n\n- \u00b7 health and safety committees;\n- \u00b7 management meetings and conferences to discuss the health and safety performance of our enterprises; regular OHS meetings in departments, on production sites and at facilities;\n- \u00b7 health and safety bulletin boards, posters and other visuals;\n- \u00b7 corporate television (screens), intranet site, e-mail;\n- \u00b7 corporate periodicals;\n- \u00b7 preventive practices by OHS officers at business units (including one-on-one meetings, training, mentoring and supervision).\n\nThere are health and safety committees in place at all Group enterprises. They are both an integral part of our OHS management system and a form of employee participation in it. In their work, these committees rely on the principles of social partnership. In 2020, we revised the rules of procedure of our health and safety committees to enhance their efficiency. Now, they meet on a monthly basis (instead of at least once in three months previously) to review reports on 13 focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of workplace conditions, and healthcare\n- \u00b7 Trade union\n- \u00b7 Accident/incident investigation\n- \u00b7 Safety assessments and audits\n- \u00b7 PPE effectiveness\n- \u00b7 Education and training\n- \u00b7 Contractors' safety\n- \u00b7 OHS leadership, promotion and communication\n- \u00b7 Industrial safety\n- \u00b7 Fire safety\n- \u00b7 Transport safety\n- \u00b7 Safety Culture Transformation Project\n- \u00b7 LOTO system implementation stage 2\n\nWorking groups have been created to cater to these areas.\n\nEmployees are represented on the committees by heads/ representatives of local unions. In 2020, the committees met 15 times, passing more than 250 resolutions.\n\nWe are making special efforts to strengthen the role of OHS officers, the key and most common element in unions' health and safety monitoring. These people stand out from other monitors thanks to their omnipresence and continuous work. Always in contact with employees, they can\n\ninfluence their attitudes to safety and ongoing OHS compliance.\n\nChannels for health and safety feedback:\n\n- \u00b7 regular OHS meetings at business units and enterprises;\n- \u00b7 OHS meetings on production sites, in departments and at facilities;\n- \u00b7 union and union committee meetings (for feedback from OHS officers);\n- \u00b7 one-on-one meetings, and supervision;\n- \u00b7 OHS training sessions and briefings;\n- \u00b7 industrial and fire safety drills;\n- \u00b7 corporate e-mail;\n- \u00b7 corporate periodicals;\n- \u00b7 health and safety committees;\n- \u00b7 employee loyalty surveys and OHS questionnaires.\n\nEmployees can also use the Public Scrutiny application to submit their health and safety proposals.",

This was achieved through tighter 24/7 H&S control measures at underground mines and a six-fold increase in unscheduled inspections from 625 to 2,302.\n\nAnother major factor contributing to lower injury rate is a new system motivating employees to work safely.

Based on the results, we develop measures to bring risks pertaining to significant environmental aspects to an acceptable level\n- \u00b7 Managers and experts responsible for making operational and other decisions that may adversely affect the environment take a specially designed training course in environmental safety. Only specially trained employees are cleared to handle hazard class 1-4 waste\n\nSTRUCTURAL UNIT\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nThe Environmental, Health and Safety Committee and Sustainable Development Committee of the Board of Directors\n\nApatit's Department of Ecology and Environmental Management\n\nsubsidiary contributes greatly to its own and the Company's environmental performance and sustainable development.\n\nTreating the enterprise's operations as a set of processes can boost its efficiency through optimising internal and external interactions, preventing critical excesses at all stages of production, continuously monitoring the quality\n\nof raw materials and measuring production parameters. Compliance with environmental standards is achieved by constantly measuring parameters, monitoring and automating production processes and conducting rapid assessments of the operating environment.\n\n## COMPLIANCE\n\nEnvironmental compliance is key to running a responsible business.\n\nPhosAgro's environmental management practices ensure our compliance with the applicable environmental and nature conservation regulations. To that\n\nend, the Company has developed an internal and external control framework, which includes internal audit and external compliance reviews, a reporting system designed in accordance with legislative requirements, and a staff training system.\n\nAll our facilities that have an adverse environmental impact are included in dedicated state registers, with relevant categories assigned to them. PhosAgro has all necessary permits in place for each of these facilities.\n\n## ASSESSMENT, ANALYSIS, AND MONITORING\n\nThe Company continuously monitors the impact of its operations to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. At all stages of production, we take the following steps to evaluate our environmental performance: control atmospheric emissions at the source, monitor air quality near sanitary protection zones, monitor pollutants in waste-waters discharged into water bodies, keep records of areas used to store production and consumption waste for all of the Company's assets, including the operations of contractors.\n\nMonitoring is based on dedicated programmes in effect at each of the Company's production assets. The results are submitted to local environmental monitoring authorities in the regions where the Company operates. In case of deviations\n\nfrom the standards, the Company develops corrective measures. The monitoring results are used as a basis for:\n\n- \u00b7 investment decisions and financial planning;\n- \u00b7 initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of production operations;\n- \u00b7 assessing the achieved effects;\n- \u00b7 identifying and controlling environmental issues, determining risks and opportunities, developing and implementing risk management and response activities.\n\nEnvironmental risk management is subject to regular assessment by the Board of Directors.

The uptick is due to the accounting for the impact the in-pit crushing and conveying system at the Koashvinsky open pit of the Vostochny mine has on air. Subject to accounting since 2020, the pit's dust emissions have exceeded 1 kt (+3% to the Group's total emissions). The environmental effect of 2020 measures to reduce pollutant emissions will be determined in 2021 based on the achieved results.\n\nPhosAgro's strategic goal is to achieve a 23.7% reduction in

It provides an analysis of climate scenarios in line with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), identifies climate risks and opportunities, sets scientifically verified targets for GHG emissions, and outlines measures to achieve them - a low carbon transition plan.\n\nThe Strategy also includes provisions for interacting with participants in the Company's value chain, including a supplier engagement concept. The main purpose of the interaction provisions is to manage GHG emissions across\n\nthe value chain by providing relevant data that will allow the Company to regulate internal corporate processes and activities and guide suppliers and consumers on reducing GHG emissions.\n\nThe Climate Strategy is aimed at ensuring the adoption and implementation of obligations and an end-to-end efficiency enhancement measures by the Company in the face of growing climate change and tightening of environmental regulations for businesses.\n\n## AS PART OF ITS PRIORITIES, PHOSAGRO'S CLIMATE STRATEGY SEEKS TO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExpand the ranks of climate-responsible businesses in Russia and globally by responsible supplier selection\n\nReduce the climate risks of production and business processes and use potential climate opportunities to develop and strengthen the Company's business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease the Group's openness and transparency, including by expanding cooperation with stakeholders and international platforms with a view to advancing the climate agenda\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInclude climate matters in the Company's management and decision-making processes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy adopting and implementing its Climate Strategy, PhosAgro makes a new commitment to the global community and future generations - an essential requirement for ensuring the Company's sustainable development in the modern world.\n\nPhosAgro has set a 14% reduction target for total GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 2028.

With RUB 22.785 mln spent on the project, the initiative resulted in lower lime consumption in treating effluents and reduced generation of hazard class 4 waste.\n\nAnother project included developing and deploying a technology allowing to use phosphogypsum (phosphoric acid production waste) in road construction. In June 2020, IFA included this project in the Phosphogypsum: Leadership, Innovation, Partnership report as an innovative practice in waste by-product management illustrating transition to a circular economy.\n\n## Share of recycled and decontaminated hazard class 1-4 waste, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur strategic goal to 2025 is to increase the share of recycled and decontaminated hazard class 1-4 waste to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n40 %\n\nWe place major emphasis on safe operation of tailings, which are special hydraulic structures and equipment for storage and disposal of mineral processing wastes.\n\nBased on the safety requirements for hydraulic structures approved by the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Oversight (Rostekhnadzor)\n\nin 2018, the Company's tailings have the highest safety level. This means that they fully meet the design requirements and applicable rules and regulations. The state of structures and foundations\n\ncorresponds to the requirements.

From October 2019 to May 2020, the amount of snow fallen grew by 54.2% year-on-year. This led to higher water inflows across the branch sites during the thaw. At the same time, the Company's overall water consumption has been on the decline in recent years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe strategy is available on the Company's website\n\n## Water strategy\n\nIn 2020, PhosAgro developed a Water Strategy to improve its water management.\n\n## Its main objectives are as follows\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreasing water use efficiency\n\nWe optimise our own production processes and try to reclaim water without having to draw more and discharge treated waste water. Two plants, in Volkhov and Balakovo, have implemented arrangements that basically exclude the discharge of treated industrial waste water into surface water bodies. All water from the production cycle passes through a multi-stage treatment system and returns into production.\n\nThe Water Strategy contains a list of projects for each branch, including the following investment programmes:\n\n- \u00b7 Water efficiency improvement at Apatit (Vologda Region) during production upgrade in 2020-2025;\n- \u00b7 Reduction of discharge volumes and improvement of waste water quality at the Kirovsk branch of Apatit in 2019 and beyond;\n- \u00b7 Creation of a closed water circulation system at the Volkhov branch of Apatit (elimination of waste water discharge into the Volkhov River)\n\n## These activities have been consolidated into a single schedule\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThanks to long-term reductions in specific water intake and waste water discharge rates and to our investment programmes, we can set ambitious strategic goals for water protection.\n\nFor many years, we have been implementing joint riverside cleaning programmes with local volunteer associations.",

EIAs help identify all potential environmental and public health impacts of business or other projects, determine the respective risk levels and assess their adverse economic and social effects. If needed, a plan can be developed to mitigate these risks. EIAs also offer a look into public attitudes to matters like protecting biodiversity, with the findings incorporated later in the decision-making.\n\nIn early 2021, PhosAgro's Environmental Policy was amended to set forth the Company's obligations to preserve biodiversity, natural landscapes and habitats across its footprint and prevent its projects from causing any harm to the same.\n\nDevelopment Committee in late 2021, will include a programme we adopted a few years ago to promote reproduction of aquatic biological resources.\n\nSince 2020, with research institutions engaged, we have also been working on a programme that will establish our priorities in protecting biodiversity based on indicator species monitoring and help us check and restore the ecosystem health across our footprint.\n\nThe document, which we expect to submit to the Sustainable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fish released in 2020\n\n| Asset                   | Species                  | Quantity   | Water body          |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Apatit (Vologda region) | Juvenile carp            | 6,500      | Gorky Reservoir     |\n|                         | Pike larvae              | 654,400    | Rybinsk Reservoir   |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile carp            | 25,000     | Volgograd Reservoir |\n|                         | Juvenile silver carp     | 20,000     | Volgograd Reservoir |\n|                         | Juvenile silver carp     | 440        | Volgograd Reservoir |\n|                         | Sterlet yearling         | 471        | Volgograd Reservoir |\n|                         | Juvenile carp            | 26,393     | Saratov Reservoir   |\n| Volkhov branch          | Char                     | 2,116      | Lake Ladoga         |\n| Kirovsk branch          | Juvenile Atlantic salmon | 4,000      | Umba River          |\n| Total                   |                          | 739,320    |                     |\n\n## Fish released in 2019\n\n| Asset                   | Species                          | Quantity   | Water body          |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Apatit (Vologda region) | Juvenile carp                    | 6,500      | Gorky Reservoir     |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile carp                    | 30,000     | Volgograd Reservoir |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile silver carp             | 25,000     | Volgograd Reservoir |\n| Kirovsk branch          | Sterlet yearling                 | 84,353     | Sukhona River       |\n| Kirovsk branch          | Juvenile Atlantic salmon (2 yrs) | 2,130      | Umba River          |\n| Total                   |                                  | 147,983    |                     |\n\n## Fish released in 2018\n\n| Asset                   | Species                  | Quantity   | Water body          |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Apatit (Vologda region) | Juvenile carp            | 6,500      | Gorky Reservoir     |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile carp            | 45,000     | Volgograd Reservoir |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile silver carp     | 45,000     | Volgograd Reservoir |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile carp            | 16,620     | Saratov Reservoir   |\n| Balakovo branch         | Juvenile silver carp     | 10,140     | Saratov Reservoir   |\n| Metachem                | Juvenile whitefish       | 2,276      | Volkhov River       |\n| Kirovsk branch          | Juvenile Atlantic salmon | 5,000      | Umba River          |\n| Total                   |                          | 130,536    |                     |",

PhosAgro published its climate reporting for the second time. As a result, the Company's CDP rating was raised from C to B- (on an A-F scale, where A is the best possible score). The improvement is associated with work on the implementation of the Company's climate strategy, which includes development and analysis of climate scenarios, a climate risk assessment, emissions reduction targets and a lowcarbon transition plan, as well as improved nonfinancial disclosure.\n\nAnother project included developing and deploying a technology allowing for the use of phosphogypsum (phosphoric acid production by-product) in road construction. In June, IFA included this project in the Phosphogypsum: Leadership, Innovation, Partnership report as an innovative practice in waste by-product management illustrating transition to a circular economy.\n\n## ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DEVELOPING ENERGY EFFICIENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN 2020\n\nIn the reporting period, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Climate Strategy, with its key elements made part of the Company's Corporate Strategy to 2025 (Strategy to 2025).\n\nAn important milestone was the approval of Apatit's Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving Policy. The Policy sets out the following key goals:\n\n- \u00b7 continuously improving energy efficiency;\n- \u00b7 using energy resources in a sustainable and efficient manner;\n- \u00b7 streamlining the energy management process for all types of operating activities.\n\nTo implement the provisions of Strategy 2025 and obligations listed in Apatit's Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving Policy, in August the Board of Directors' Sustainable Development Committee approved\n\na unified Energy Efficiency Programme in addition to existing energy efficiency programmes at each of the Company's four production sites. The Programme comprises over 20 measures to develop the following aspects.\n\nThe initiative timelines range from several months to two years and are regularly monitored by the Board of Directors' Sustainable Development Committee. The Energy Efficiency Programme is open to updates and additions, with new proposals considered on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Programme's implementation is reviewed by the Board of Directors once every six months. Since the Company has approved and carried out a number of initiatives expected to deliver strong results, this will have a positive effect on energy consumption in 2021.\n\nThe activities of the Energy Efficiency Program are aimed at developing the following areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin-house power generation through utilisation of sulphuric acid production steam;\n\nincrease of the share of renewable energy sources;\n\nintroduction of technologies aimed at loss reduction and energy savings (e.g. LED lighting, frequency converters, less heat energy losses).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Energy Efficiency Programme is available on the Company's website\n\nThe Company delivered on its commitment to install and launch a fixed station for air quality control, the first facility of its kind in Volkhov and the Leningrad region. The station assesses air quality in the ground layer of the atmosphere against permissible concentrations and informs local residents accordingly via the website of the Volkhov municipal district administration. The site for the station was selected following public discussions and approved by the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) in the Leningrad region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY INITIATIVES OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMME FOR 2020-2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Project                                                                                                                                                   | Details and effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Spending,   RUB mln                               | Completion   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Implemented in 2020                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                   |              |\n| Cherepovets Construction of the SK 3300 plant at  the phosphate facility of Apatit                                                                        | SK 3300 generates steam in the amount of 175 t/h for  the thermal power station.

In absolute terms, the electricity generated by PhosAgro went up by 22 mln kWh year-on-year (the increase in total electricity consumption in 2020\n\nwas 89 mln kWh, with the new facilities commissioned). In 2021, the share of electricity generated in-house is likely to increase due to the planned launch of the 34 MW thermal power station at the Volkhov branch.\n\n## In-house electricity generation with the use of secondary products\n\n## Electricity generated through utilisation of sulphuric acid production steam\n\n| Asset                   | In-house electricity  generation, mln kWh   |   mln kWh |    % |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|------|\n| Apatit (Vologda region) | 1,167.0                                     |     534.2 | 45.8 |\n| Balakovo branch         | 355.1                                       |     346.2 | 97.5 |\n\n## Initiatives 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhosAgro launched a project to use renewable energy sources at its production and social facilities, with the Izumrud corporate health resort in Balakovo becoming a pilot site. The first 25 kW solar power plant was installed on the roof of the resort's medical treatment building. The spring of 2021 will see similar panels installed on Izumrud's hotel building, resulting in a total capacity of 45 kW. It is also planned to test the technology at the Company's chemical facility in Balakovo to assess the viability of a further scale-up.\n\nApatit's Kirov branch signed a contract with TGC-1 to purchase electricity generated by hydroelectric power plants. In 2021, 323 mln kWh of green electricity will be supplied, covering around 20% of the mining and processing plant's output. Entering into a power supply contract with TGC-1 is yet another step toward achieving our goal to reduce GHG emissions (Scope 2). This will help diminish the carbon footprint and make our products more attractive for international customers.\n\nThe Group's facilities widely use LED lighting, which has made it possible to cut lighting costs by 2-2.5 times. The lighting system of Apatit's apatitenepheline beneficiation plant (ANBP-3) was upgraded to LED in 2019, and a similar project will be implemented at ANBP-2 in 2021. These initiatives serve to reduce GHG emissions and, consequently, the carbon footprint of the Company's finished products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 39.8 %\n\nthe Company's production facilities were 39.8% self-sufficient in terms of electricity needs in 2020\n\n## PhosAgro's energy consumption 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                 | Unit         | 2018       | 2019       | 2020       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Electricity                                     |              |            |            |            |\n| Purchased electricity                           | mln kWh      | 2,165.56   | 2,234.57   | 2,300.77   |\n| Purchased electricity (per unit)                | ths kWh/t    | 0.071      | 0.069      | 0.068      |\n| Produced electricity (non-renewables)           | mln kWh      | 1,485.00   | 1,500.11   | 1,519.00   |\n| Produced electricity (non-renewables), per unit | ths kWh/t    | 0.048      | 0.046      | 0.045      |\n| Internal use electricity                        | mln kWh      | 3,650.57   | 3,734.68   | 3,819.77   |\n| Internal use electricity (per unit)             | ths kWh/t    | 0.119      | 0.115      | 0.113      |\n| Electricity cost                                | RUB bln      | 8.919      | 10.286     | 10.418     |\n| Heat energy                                     |              |            |            |            |\n| Produced by TPPs                                | ths Gcal     | 2,847.59   | 2,742.82   | 2,435.44   |\n| Produced by boilers (steam)                     | ths Gcal     | 1,055.83   | 1,121.49   | 1,030.34   |\n| Purchased (in hot water)                        | ths Gcal     | 388.07     | 406.60     | 374.54     |\n| Sold (in hot water)                             | ths Gcal     | 178.01     | 155.46     | 200.78     |\n| Exhaust steam                                   | ths Gcal     | 6,854.24   | 7,215.41   | 8,091.16   |\n| Internal use heat energy                        | ths Gcal     | 10,967.71  | 11,330.87  | 11,730.70  |\n| Internal use heat energy (per unit)             | ths Gcal/t   | 0.357      | 0.349      | 0.347      |\n| Heat energy cost                                | RUB bln      | 10.009     | 10.748     | 10.491     |\n| Natural gas                                     |              |            |            |            |\n| Natural gas for production purposes             | mln m 3      | 2,667.47   | 2,704.24   | 2,699.88   |\n| Natural gas consumption (per unit)              | ths m 3  / t | 0.087      | 0.083      | 0.079      |\n| Natural gas cost                                | RUB bln      | 11.467     | 12.058     | 12.413     |\n| LNG                                             |              |            |            |            |\n| LNG consumption                                 | t            | 2,704.60   | 3,134.80   | 2,273.40   |\n| LNG cost                                        | RUB bln      | 0.076      | 0.091      | 0.069      |\n| Fuel oil                                        |              |            |            |            |\n| Fuel oil consumption                            | t            | 147,976.68 | 154,132.80 | 146,785.80 |\n| Fuel oil cost                                   | RUB bln      | 2.200      | 2.538      | 1.551      |\n| Heating oil                                     |              |            |            |            |\n| Heating oil consumption                         | t            | 697.43     | 703.30     | 725.50     |\n| Heating oil cost                                | RUB bln      | 0.004      | 0.004      | 0.004      |\n| Diesel fuel                                     |              |            |            |            |\n| Diesel fuel consumption                         | thou t       | 40,343.58  | 40,071.98  | 53,054.25  |\n| Diesel fuel cost                                | RUB bln      | 1.769      | 2.100      | 2.268      |\n\n1.\n\n- The cost of electricity per finished products\n\n## Total for production assets",

To this end, PhosAgro collaborates and maintains partnership with regional and local authorities, charitable foundations and nongovernmental organisations, and has also established its own non-profit organisations.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Company focuses on creating safe and convenient public spaces that form leisure destinations for local residents while also providing opportunities for physical\n\nand aesthetic development of children.\n\n## Most of the projects\n\nimplemented in 2020 were aimed at the development of rural communities, which is fully consistent with the Company's commitment to SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities.\n\nThe Company also continues a project to develop transport infrastructure in the regions where it operates. In 2020, the concrete covering of the airfield of the Khibini Airport was repaired as part of the project. The development of the road network continues in Volkhov, Cherepovets and Balakovo.\n\nOur projects to develop rural communities in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->",

The key areas of working with children: organisation of athletic events, spiritual and patriotic training, environmental projects, artistic festivals, and mass cultural events. In 2020, despite the pandemic, we saw the number of alumni grow to 5,920 people.\n\nThe programme focuses on SDG 4 Quality Education, SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 3 Good Health and Well-Being.\n\nIn 2020, three students of the DROZD programme became winners and awardees of international contests; 44 won prizes and awards in Russian contests; 233 gained recognition in regional and local competitions.\n\n## Educational institutions supported by PhosAgro in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCherepovets\n\nVolkhov\n\nKirovsk\n\nBalakovo\n\nSchools\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCherepovets\n\nVolkhov\n\nVolkhov\n\nKirovsk\n\nBalakovo\n\nKirovsk\n\n## DROZD-Khibiny centre attendance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCherepovets\n\nVolkhov\n\nKirovsk\n\nBalakovo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we implemented a project for the construction of a sports centre with a 25 m five-lane swimming pool, a gym and a conference room at the Cherepovets Chemical Technical College. The pool features an advanced water purification system. The sports centre is accessible to people with disabilities. PhosAgro invested some RUB 16 mln to build the facility and will bear the cost of its maintenance going forward.\n\nA project to build a climbing wall and a rope park was implemented by PhosAgro in the village of Kadui, Vologda Region, following consultations with the local residents. It will help improve leisure and recreation opportunities for children and youth, and promote creativity, sports and local tourism.\n\nSeveral projects were implemented by the Company in Kirovsk:\n\n- \u00b7 A new chairlift was launched on the southern slope of the Bolshoi Vudyavr Ski Resort to replace the outdated 20-year old one, and another magic carpet was added, doubling the resort's total throughput capacity.\n- \u00b7 The Company continued with the development of the Tirvas Ski Stadium, a major training venue for Russian skiers with internationally certified 5 km and 10 km tracks. It hosts two iconic races - Khibiny Race and Khibiny Spring - which traditionally open and close the skiing season of the Russian Cross-Country Skiing Federation. Plans for 2021 include upgrading the lighting along the ski tracks, installing a stationary snowmaking system and a drainage system, asphalt paving of a roller skiing track for summer training, laying a cable for a timing system, building a biathlon shooting range with 30 stands, a tribune and a penalty loop, and a parking lot with a passageway.\n\nFurther plans to develop the DROZDKhibiny youth cultural centre in Kirovsk include opening four gyms, a volunteer and rehabilitation centre, and a centre for military and patriotic training. In five years, the number of children attending the centre increased to nearly 2.5 thousand, tightening its need for new classes, so the Company decided to step in and partially finance the facility's upgrade.\n\nIn 2020, a 300 sq m ski lodge was constructed and put into operation at a ski resort in Volkhov. The ski lodge is connected to the city's utilities grids and has locker rooms, a first aid post, a cafe, a ski rental, a boiler room and a commentator's booth with a panoramic view of the track. The area features newly completed landscaping, a parking lot, and football and volleyball playgrounds. It offers barrier-free environment with access for persons with disabilities and limited mobility.",

The memorial has a shape of a waving banner and is decorated with granite. The images were made using photo printing technology and are weather resistant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting community and volunteer projects\n\nWe see volunteering as an activity consistent with our corporate values as it helps strengthen social ties within the team, promote a positive image of a volunteer and get more people involved in socially important initiatives, which contributes to creating a favourable social environment in the regions where we operate.\n\nIn late May 2020, PhosAgro joined the #WeAreTogether campaign launched by the All-Russia People's Front and the Medical Volunteers public movement. The proposal to join the campaign was raised by the members of PhosAgro's youth organisation who engage in volunteering and was strongly supported by employees across all our enterprises. Participation in the #WeAreTogether campaign came as a natural step for PhosAgro in line with its corporate strategy to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nAs part of the campaign, the Company donated ventilators and two split systems to the Cherepovets-based coronavirus hospital. The devices were purchased in partnership between local entrepreneurs and PhosAgro.\n\nEmployees of the Volkhov branch of Apatit launched a fund-raising campaign to purchase laptops for schoolchildren from low-income families. The campaign helped collect RUB 550,000 and purchase 20 laptops that were handed over to primary and middle school students from low-income families in Volkhov.\n\nThe #WeAreTogether campaign launched in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak was also aimed at supporting doctors and volunteers. The proceeds were received by volunteers (23 people),\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt helped employees of the Balakovo branch of Apatit raise about\n\n750 ths RUB\n\nmembers of the Veterans Council (15 people), primary healthcare practitioners (89 people), and health professionals of the additional medical station at the infectious hospital based on the Balakovo City Clinica Hospital (26 people).",

It will continue to support the management team in its implementation of the PhosAgro's Development Strategy to 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Xavier Rolet,\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors of PJSC PhosAgro\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainalytics upgraded our ranking from 50.6 ('Average Performer') to 59.1 ('Outperformer') , while MSCI revised our score from 6.7 to 6.9 on a scale from 0 to 10, which puts the Company in the top 22% best-rated companies globally and top 5% domestically.",

The non-compliance relates primarily to the remuneration of the Company's directors, members of the executive bodies, and other key employees. Cases of partial compliance with the recommendations of this CGC section are mainly due to the fact that the Company does not have a single bylaw governing\n\npayments to its directors, members of the executive bodies, and other key managers. At the same time, its approaches to remuneration, including that payable to directors, are clearly defined in other internal documents the resolutions of annual shareholders' meetings.\n\nFor every case of partial compliance, the Company specifies the measures taken to mitigate the associated risks.\n\nThe only case of non-compliance with the CGC recommendations, which relates to principle 4.3.2, is caused by the lack of a long-term share-based incentive programme for members of the executive bodies and other key\n\nmanagers. The Company believes that in the current situation its existing system of executives' remuneration is sufficiently motivating, meets the needs of the Company and its shareholders, aligns the executives' goals with those of the Company, and minimises the risks of qualified leadership talent attrition, which is why the Company is not currently considering any share-based incentive programmes.\n\nIn 2020, the Internal Audit Department assessed the quality of the Company's corporate governance in line with best practices represented by the recommendations of CGC and the UK Corporate\n\nFor the degree of alignment between these two documents, see PhosAgro's corporate website\n\nGovernance Code adopted by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2018. The Internal Audit Department verified and confirmed the degree of compliance of the Company's corporate practices with the CGC recommendations as stated in the 2019 report. On top of that, it reported a high degree of compliance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code relevant to PhosAgro's operations.\n\nIn March 2020, PhosAgro's Board of Directors reviewed the report on the Company's corporate governance quality, taking into account the MSCI and Sustainalytics ratings, the report on compliance with the CGC principles and recommendations, as well as the assessment of compliance with the Russian and UK corporate governance codes performed by the Internal Audit Department.\n\nNoting a high level of compliance, the Board of Directors also analysed the governance quality criteria that were not met fully or partially, and reviewed an improvement plan. Among other things, it includes the following improvements:\n\n- \u00b7 providing more detailed information to shareholders ahead of general shareholders' meetings about external auditors, interested-party transactions, notable appointments of external candidates to the Board of Directors and their contribution to its work, as well as the procedure for net profit distribution and its compliance with the Company's dividend policy;\n- \u00b7 disclosing information about PhosAgro's Corporate Governance Code and its compliance with the CGC approved by the Bank of Russia, on the Company's official website;\n- \u00b7 expanding the scope of the annual report to include the Board of Directors' viability statement, the going concern assumptions, consideration given to key stakeholders' voice in the Board's decision-making, information about notable external appointments to the Board, and more details on the activities of the Audit Committee, Remuneration and Human Resources Committee, and the Corporate Secretary; 3 123 2 750\n\n- \u00b7 including additional matters related to corporate culture, leadership succession planning, diversity, gender equality, and inclusion in the agenda of the Board of Directors and its committees.\n\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors approved the report on compliance with CGC principles and recommendations in 2020 and gave a positive assessment of the progress against the improvement plan.\n\nIn 2021, the Company will keep working to identify more areas for improvements based on the UK Corporate Governance Code and the review of best practices, and ensure their phased implementation.\n\nDegree of disclosure to explain noncompliance (partial compliance) with CGC recommendations at PhosAgro and other Russian companies, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance with CGC recommendations at PhosAgro and other Russian companies, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.\n\n- 2019 - the most recent year assessed by the Bank of Russia",

In May 2020, the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting was held in absentia to elect a new Board of Directors and Review Committee, determine the Board of Directors' remuneration, distribute the 2019 profit, including dividend payouts, and resolve on other matters within the its remit. It was held in absentia due to the COVID-19\n\noutbreak.

Its activities are governed by the Regulations on the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors held\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11\n\nmeetings\n\n(three of them by absentee voting) and reviewed a total of \\\n\n79 matters\n\n2020 saw a slight increase in the number of matters considered by the Board of Directors. Less attention was paid to discussing the organisation of the Board's activities and preparation for general shareholders' meetings, while matters such as strategy (nine matters vs seven in 2018 and 2019), sustainable development (six matters vs two and five in 2018 and 2019, respectively) and IT security (two matters vs zero and one in 2018 and 2019, respectively) were addressed more often.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic made crisis management an important part of the Company's operations. The Board of Directors included this matter in the agenda of its scheduled sessions and held an ad hoc meeting on the pandemic response in April 2020.\n\nKey activities undertaken by the Board of Directors in 2020 included:\n\n- \u00b7 assessment and quarterly monitoring of the risk management process;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the first time, the Board considered corporate culture and its correlation with the Company's values and strategy. The sustainability agenda included a significant block of climaterelated issues. In May 2020, the Board of Directors' Sustainable Development Committee approved the main parameters of the Company's future climate strategy. And already in November, the committee reviewed the draft document and recommended it to the Board of Directors. As part of the strategy, the Board approved climate scenarios, risks and targets for reducing total GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3), and adopted a low-carbon transition plan.\n\n- \u00b7 assessment and quarterly monitoring of subsidiary activities with a focus on workplace health and safety, industrial safety and environmental protection;\n- \u00b7 assessing the degree to which the requirements of the Company's Insider Information Policy were met;\n- \u00b7 the Company's strategy in the area of international projects;\n- \u00b7 the sales strategy for mineral fertilizers;\n- \u00b7 Climate Strategy;\n- \u00b7 Water Strategy;\n- \u00b7 development of a project management system at Group enterprises;\n- \u00b7 evaluation of the performance of the Company's CEO and Management Board;\n- \u00b7 oversight over management relations with shareholders, investors and other stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 monitoring the implementation of priority areas of PhosAgro's activities in 2020 and determining priority areas of its activities for 2021;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the Company's budget for 2021, as well as quarterly follow-up on the 2020 budget utilisation;\n- \u00b7 determination of sustainable development priorities;\n- \u00b7 determining whether PhosAgro's corporate culture is aligned with its mission, values and strategy, as well as assessing and monitoring the corporate culture;\n- \u00b7 IT security and management of cyberrisks;\n- \u00b7 anti-crisis management;\n- \u00b7 performance and work plans of the Internal Audit Department.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned issues, the Board of Directors also reviewed and approved financial statements on a quarterly basis, appointed the Company's top executives, approved major and interested-party transactions, and convened shareholders' meetings.\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors continued to foster cooperation with the Company's functional units by reviewing reports and issuing recommendation for such functions as procurement, project management, IT and global projects.",

This includes developing a special section of PhosAgro's corporate website and our electronic bidding platform to enhance procurement transparency, and encouraging small and medium-sized businesses and local counterparties to become our suppliers or contractors.\n\nProcurement principles\n\nOur employees have a special place among the Company's stakeholders, which is reflected, in particular, in one of our strategic objectives - increasing the loyalty and satisfaction of our staff. Employee satisfaction and loyalty surveys and programmes based on their results are at the forefront\n\n## PROSPECTS\n\nPhosAgro's development scenarios are reviewed by the Board of Directors when approving its Strategy. The Company's strategic planning cycle spans five years, which we believe to be optimal given the growing speed of external changes and our investment horizon. Since 2019, in addition to our traditional analysis of sensitivity to FX rate fluctuations and changes in product and feedstock prices, the Board of Directors has been considering a Contingency Plan to prepare for critical changes in the external operating environment, such\n\nof the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee's agenda.\n\nAnalysis of hotline complaints and respective management response is reviewed by our Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. Importantly, the said committees are composed solely of independent directors.\n\nAlthough at the moment we do not apply such practices as appointing directors from among the employees or appointing a non-executive director responsible for interaction with employees for considering their standpoint when managing the Company, we consider it effective and are actively involved in a dialogue on all major management issues with the trade union organisation (Minudobreniya Association), which has historically been an equal partner for the Company's management and an authorised representative of employees in collective bargaining, review and resolution of labour disputes.\n\nIn addition, heads of each production site of the Company regularly (at least twice a year) visit all business units and hold meetings with employees, at which they inform the staff about the Company's performance, implemented measures, and plans for production and social development. Based\n\nas possible restrictions on our supplies to key markets. These risks must be assessed and managed - a key takeaway for us from 2020, when the USA initiated a countervailing duty investigation causing PhosAgro to suspend virtually all of its supplies to this key market.\n\nWhen approving the Strategy to 2025, the Board of Directors also weighed the associated strategic risks. Risk management maps were drawn for each, containing a detailed description along with mitigants\n\non employees' suggestions and comments, an action plan for improving organisational and technological processes is then developed and implemented.\n\nIn 2020, the Company also expanded its dialogue with stakeholders about our environmental footprint. Under the guidance of the Sustainable Development Committee, we implemented a project to identify and prioritise the Company's environmental and social impacts, develop management approaches and mitigants to maximise positive and minimise negative effects. We worked intensively with local communities, holding public hearings on the development of the Company's production sites and their environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand probability, materiality and risk appetite estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our strategic risks, see the Strategic Report section, p. 72.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Board of Directors finds it reasonable to believe that the Company will, without any reservations, be able to continue its operations and meet all its obligations as they fall due while the Strategy to 2025 is in force.",

Independent directors make a valuable contribution to the Board's decision-making as their opinions rely on professional skills and expertise, as well as a comprehensive study of the matter. Their position is unbiased, independent and free from the influence of other members of the Board and PhosAgro's management, and primarily focused on improving the Company's performance. At present, seven of the ten directors are independent, which\n\nis well above the average in Russia and at par with the best global practices 1 . Independent directors chair five of the six Board committees.\n\nIndependent directors are world-class experts with unique competencies and a track-record in investment and management of major businesses, financial and research organisations and government agencies. They are equipped with a full set of knowledge and skills needed to propel the Company and its Board of Directors forward and foster dialogue with stakeholders at various levels.\n\nThe independence of Board members and nominees is assessed biannually by the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee. The assessment meets the criteria established by the Regulations on the Board of Directors and the Moscow Exchanges rules. In 2020, a special resolution of the Board of Directors recognized two of its members, Sven Ombudstvedt and Markus Rhodes, as independent, despite them having a formal affiliation with the Company after serving for nine years on its Board of Directors.\n\n## ONBOARDING OF NEWLY ELECTED DIRECTORS\n\nDespite the fact that there were no changes in the Board composition in 2019 and 2020, the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee updated the onboarding programme for new Board members. This is done annually to provide them\n\nwith an effective tool to gain an insight into the Company's operations. As part of the onboarding programme, newly appointed directors visit PhosAgro's production sites and meet with functional managers.\n\n## PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company views commitment to continuous professional growth as a cornerstone of good corporate governance. By expanding their knowledge and skills, directors add value to the Board of Directors and the Company on the whole. An annual performance assessment highlights the need for the qualification upgrade and training of the Board members. The following areas are in most demand:\n\n- \u00b7 industry trends in Russia and abroad;\n- \u00b7 risk management;\n- \u00b7 cyberrisks and cybersecurity;\n- \u00b7 technological and agricultural innovations.\n\nIn 2020, trainings could not be held in a traditional format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the development areas identified during the 2020 assessment of the Board of Directors performance, including innovative development, cyberrisks and cybersecurity, were addressed. These topics were added to the meeting agendas, and heads of the relevant functions were invited to the Board meetings, which ensured deep understanding of these matters by the Board members and gave an impetus for PhosAgro's accelerated development in these areas.\n\n- 1. According to the Stanton Chase study of 109 largest public companies of Russia conducted in August 2020, the average share of independent directors stands at 29%.\n\nBesides, given the adoption of the updated Inside Information Regulation in August 2020, which reflects all the changes in applicable Russian and European laws, a training was held for directors and senior management with the leading Russian experts invited as guest speakers.\n\nThe Board of Directors regularly receives newsletters from the Company, including quarterly newsletters on corporate governance and weekly updates on the developments in the chemical and related industries.\n\n## D&O LIABILITY INSURANCE\n\nDirectors and officers liability for damage caused to third parties by their duties is insured by SOGAZ (contract No. 18 DO 0028 in effect from 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2019, contract No. 19 DO 0020 in effect\n\nfrom 1 June 2019 to 31 May 2020, contract No. 20 DO 0018 in effect from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021) and is covered up to USD 75 mln (in rouble equivalent) and extended by USD 2 mln for independent\n\ndirectors. Apart from directors' liability, the above contracts include the liability of the Company's officers (since 2012).\n\n## INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with CGC recommendations, PhosAgro assesses the performance of its Board of Directors on an annual basis, with external experts engaged for this purpose once every three years. Each new assessment relies on previous assessments allowing to analyse both absolute values and any changes that occur over time. February 2020 saw KPMG conduct an external assessment of the Company's Board of Directors.\n\nThe independent consultant recognised the Board's high\n\nefficiency and a strong engagement of its members.\n\nKPMG also highlighted a balanced split between executive and independent directors and confirmed that they have the required skills, competencies and expertise. In terms of independence and the presence of foreign directors, PhosAgro is almost on a par with foreign industry practices and ahead of the Russian players. The current Board's composition is fully in line with the Company's needs, which\n\n## Self-assessment: the key aspects of the Board of Directors operations 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.\n\ncontributes to well-reasoned decision-making.\n\nThe efficiency of the Board's key functions was also highly rated by the independent consultant. The Board of Directors discusses a wide range of matters to ensure the effective governance of the Company's operations.\n\nIn February 2021, the Board of Directors completed a selfassessment exercise confirming that it operates to a high standard in all aspects of its role.\n\n- 1   Organising the business of the Board of Directors\n- 2   Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n- 3   Continuous improvement\n- 4   Liaising with committees\n- 5   Corporate Secretary assessment\n- 6   Composition and structure of the Board of Directors\n\nAssessed on a 5-point scale.",

The primary role of the committees is the preliminary consideration of key issues submitted for review by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## COMMITTEE REPORTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\n## Committee members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarcus Rhodes, Committee Chairman, independent director\n\nSven Ombudstvedt, Committee member, independent director\n\nJames Rogers, Committee member, independent director\n\nAndrey Sharonov, Committee member, independent director\n\n## Activities in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarcus Rhodes, chairman of the committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegulation on the Audit Committee\n\nAccording to the Regulations on the Company's Audit Committee, the Audit Committee shall consist of at least three current members of the Board of Directors, and shall be chaired by an independent director. Since 2018, the Committee has consisted of four independent directors. Marcus Rhodes, chairman of the committee, has the necessary experience and expertise in preparation, analysis, assessment and audit of accounting (financial) statements.\n\nThe Committee's remit includes:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the IFRS financials for integrity and transparency;\n- \u00b7 analysis of financial reporting processes, including regular\n\nreviews and recommendations for the Board of Directors;\n\n- \u00b7 recommending the Company's external auditor to the Board of Directors and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the external auditor;\n- \u00b7 support to the Internal Audit function and analysing the quarterly results of their work;\n- \u00b7 discussing and approving the annual internal audit plan;\n- \u00b7 ensuring compliance with applicable legislation and relevant standards of business conduct.\n\nThe committees are responsible for making sure that issues brought before the Board have been sufficiently reviewed as a way to enable the directors to cast their votes based on full and accurate information. To achieve this, committee members maintain an ongoing dialogue\n\nwith the management team, the Company's external auditor and other advisors on the issues that fall within their remit.\n\nThe existing committees were established by the Board of Directors on 26 May 2020 without any changes to their composition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Audit Committee held five meetings, where the following matters were considered:\n\n- \u00b7 analysis of the Company's financial performance based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements, including reasons for changes as compared with the previous periods' results; review of the quarterly results compared with the budget;\n- \u00b7 review and discussion of the quarterly IFRS financial statements, along with ensuring the adequacy of disclosures;\n- \u00b7 drafting the quarterly press releases on the Company's performance for investors;\n- \u00b7 analysis of the Company's compliance with Russian and European legislation on protection and use of insider information;\n- \u00b7 analysis of the Company's corporate governance compliance with the Bank of Russia's Corporate Governance Code and the UK Corporate Governance Code;\n- \u00b7 assessing the Company's internal control and internal audit system;\n- \u00b7 further improving the quality of the financial accounting and reporting preparation process;\n- \u00b7 developing the of the Company's Internal Audit Department's plan of activities for 2021 and monitoring the implementation of the previously approved plan for 2020, as well as assessing the Internal Audit Department's performance and control over follow-up on its recommendations.\n\nIn 2020, the project for integration of the IFRS consolidated management reporting and financial statements preparation procedures using Oracle Hyperion Financial Management was finally completed under the guidance and supervision of the Audit Committee, which allowed for reducing the reporting preparation period by 1.5 months due\n\nto introduction of a consolidation system, unification of IFRS and RAS accounting procedures and automatic integration with the accounting systems. Besides, the project introduced a convenient tool for analysing sales efficiency and generating management reports, enabled in-depth analytics across a wide range of financial and operational indicators, and full harmonisation of management reporting and IFRS statements.\n\nIn line with best corporate governance practices, the Company has prepared a draft policy for selecting an external auditor to be approved by the Board of Directors, which specifies the grounds and procedure for selection, maximum duration of services, rotation rules for the audit partner, and maximum cost of non-audit services in the total scope of auditor services.\n\n## External auditor\n\nA key element of the Audit Committee's work is ongoing interaction with the external auditor, as well as drafting recommendations for the Board of Directors regarding the approval of the auditor. When selecting an auditor, we evaluate the following factors in addition to the cost of their services:\n\n- \u00b7 Composition of the audit team (in terms of experience and qualifications), which should ensure that the statements are audited within acceptable deadlines and with adequate quality.\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the auditor's independence based on a variety of factors, including assessment of the scope of non-audit services provided to us by the candidate company during the relevant periods. Each offer from the current auditor for non-audit services requires confirmation by the audit partner to make sure there is no risk to independence and is submitted to the Company's Audit Committee for consideration and approval. The Committee consents to the contract only if the scope of the non-audit services is not so substantial as to call into\n\nquestion the ability to perform the audit service independently and impartially. The Committee's assessment of the auditor's independence is also significantly influenced by the auditor's internal procedures for controlling the impartiality and professional ethics of the auditor's staff, including requirements for periodic rotation of the audit partner, training arranged in this area and the use of specialised software to perform the respective audits.\n\n- \u00b7 Balance between the benefits of long-term cooperation with the auditor and the need for a fresh look at the Company's financial statements and preparation procedures.\n- \u00b7 Auditor's performance over the previous period.\n\nFinally, when assessing the possibility of continuing cooperation with the external auditor, the Committee e may form its opinion on the quality of the external auditor's work during in-person Committee meetings, where the external auditor's mandatory participants are a manager and the partner, as well as during meetings between the audit team and the Chairman of the Audit Committee held prior to the Committee meetings.\n\nIn December 2020, as recommended by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors approved the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (\u00abPwC\u00bb) as auditor of the Company's 2021 IFRS financial statements. This recommendation was the result of a formal tender between six audit firms in Russia, including the incumbent KPMG. Based upon extensive presentations and discussions these six firms were reduced to a short list of two, out of which PWC was chosen. Meanwhile, it should be noted that, the Company was extremely satisfied with the high quality of the audit conducted by KPMG over the last 15 years, and is grateful for the constructive cooperation and utmost professionalism that the KPMG team showed during this period.",

We additionally discussed succession planning for members of the Board of Directors, members of executive bodies and other key employees, and gave a number of relevant recommendations for N-1 executives.\n- \u00b7 Incentive system . we scrutinised all internal regulations of PhosAgro related to the incentive system. The Committee strives to find a balance so as to ensure the number of documents\n- \u00b7 planning staff appointments so as to ensure, inter alia, continuity of the executive bodies' work;\n- \u00b7 analysing the Board's composition by way of assessing its members' professional skills, expertise, independence and involvement in the Board's work, identifying priority areas for improvements, and assessing qualifications and independence of nominees to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 arranging for an annual selfappraisal or third-party appraisal of the Board of Directors' and its Committees' efficiency.\n\nregulating remuneration is both sufficient to provide the details of all existing processes and gives a clear understanding of the remuneration framework to employees. The existing management incentive system, which relies on key performance indicators (KPIs) correlated with strategic targets, made another step forward in 2020, covering as many as 277 people from N to N-3 levels, up 2.6 times year-on-year. A notable part of this growth came from the extended scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof KPIs linked to the Company's sustainability targets. The Committee confirmed that the existing remuneration framework is efficient and in line with the Company's requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the remuneration, please see the Management remuneration section, p. 246\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity, gender equality and inclusion . 2020 was the first year when the progress in securing diversity, gender equality and inclusion became a part of the Committee's agenda. We are adamant that our people's professionalism, consistently strong performance and adherence to corporate values are a prerequisite and the only guarantee of career growth, and we are happy that the Company's management shares this belief. As early as in April 2021, the Committee's goals and objectives set forth in the Regulations on the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee will comprise control over securing diversity, gender equality and inclusion.\n- \u00b7 Corporate culture. The reporting year also was the first year when the Committee discussed whether the goals, values and strategy of the Company are aligned with its corporate culture, along with its assessment and monitoring. PhosAgro fosters a corporate culture where all employees have the freedom to be themselves and can fully unlock their potential. In 2020, following the Committee's proposal, questions that help evaluate various aspects and evolution of the corporate culture were included in the annual staff loyalty\n\nand satisfaction survey conducted by a third-party expert since 2013.\n\nThe above matters must become a permanent item on the Committee's agenda because they are key to the Company's long-term success and sustainable development.\n\nWe also stayed focused on regular matters:\n\n- \u00b7 assessment of professional skills, independence, engagement and important external nominations or appointments to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 best practice guidance and analysis following the appraisal of the Board of Directors' performance;\n- \u00b7 assessment of the performance of the Company's executive bodies, other key employees, and the Corporate Secretary;\n- \u00b7 assessment of social and employee training programmes, including the progress towards a sustainability target approved in the Strategy to 2025 the number of employee training hours;\n- \u00b7 review of the outcomes following the annual staff loyalty and satisfaction survey, including progress towards a sustainability target approved in the Strategy to 2025 - integrated employee loyalty index.\n\nTwo times a year, when initially assessing nominations to the Board of Directors and subsequently when finalising its composition, the Committee decides which reasons should disqualify members from serving on it.\n\nWhile preparing the shareholder information for the annual\n\ngeneral meeting, the Committee, among other factors, analysed the effect of the below appointments of independent directors on their ability to duly discharge their responsibilities as the Company's Board members.\n\n## Independent directors' external appointments:\n\n- \u00b7 Xavier Rolet: Saudi Stock Exchange TADAWUL, Shore Capital Markets, TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P., Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc., Golden Falcon Special Acquisition Corporation;\n- \u00b7 Sven Ombudstvedt: Norske Skog;\n- \u00b7 James Rogers: Virtus Total Return Fund Inc, Beeland Interests Inc., AgroGard-Finance, ENPlus Co Ltd, etc.;\n- \u00b7 Andrey Sharonov: Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO, Sovcomflot, Rosseti, En+ Group, Medicina, etc.;\n- \u00b7 Natalia Pashkevich: St Petersburg Mining University;\n- \u00b7 Irina Bokova: Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens, International Automobile Federation, FIA Foundation.\n\nThe Committee found that in 2020 the above external appointments did not prevent the Board members from duly discharging their responsibilities, while also maximising their contribution to the Company's growth.",

Although it produces a small amount of energy as yet, the project is very important for the Group. We will meticulously study its effects and then decide on its further replication.\n\nIn 2020, we approved the Energy Efficiency Programme covering all our projects and initiatives designed to reduce energy consumption. In 2021, the Committee will monitor the programme implementation.\n\nWe also remained focused on regulatory compliance, reviewing, among others, draft laws, which are yet to be considered and approved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

According to a resolution of the Board of Directors, control over compliance of the current activities with the approved strategy is carried out at least twice a year by reviewing the monitoring results, as well as in the course of the Board of Director' review of the Company's annual budgets. At both meetings, in March and August 2020, the Committee checked the production volumes, sales in priority markets, and expansion of sales and transport infrastructure against the Strategy. Another innovation for the Committee was the mandatory monitoring of approved ESG indicators.\n\nThe 2020 results show that we are well on our way to the Goals 2025:\n\nWe expect the production of phosphate rock to exceed the approved target level of 11 mln t in 2025. This will be largely due to commissioning in Q4 2020 of the main shaft of the Kirovsk mine, as well as the ongoing construction and expected commissioning in late 2021 of another major ore and raw material resource development project - the 1st start-up facilities at level 10 of the Kirovsk mine.\n\nSimilarly, the 2025 target for our internal phosphate rock processing (8.4 mln t) will be met, with the corresponding increase in mineral fertilizer production, through, among other things, the ambitious projects already underway to develop the Balakovo and Volkhov sites.\n\nWe expect the Company to maintain its target sales share in premium markets, although we allow for minor deviations due to changes in market conditions and adherence to the best netback strategy.\n\nWe successfully achieved our interim goals 2020 in such indicators as the number of distribution and logistics centers (as many as 29 now), storage capacity for solid and liquid mineral fertilizers (more than 700 kt). We believe that the Goals 2025 will also be successfully achieved in this important area, reflecting our commitment to be closer to the consumer.\n\nThe completion in late 2020 of construction, and launch of traffic at the Kryolite railway station (Cherepovets production site) became an important milestone on the way to achieving our key logistics goal\n\nof expanding the capacity of our rail infrastructure to over 16 mln t per year. We also comply with our interim targets for other logistics indicators of Strategy 2025: acquisition of our own rolling stock and port infrastructure development.\n\nThe adoption of the Climate and Water Strategies in 2020 was an important step toward achieving the ESG targets.\n\nIn addition, the Committee focused on monitoring the progress of the investment projects underlying PhosAgro's ongoing growth in the current strategic cycle, together with development of new projects that will ensure the further dynamic evolution of the Company.\n\nOur strategy cannot be static, we are developing, the external business environment is changing, and we hope that in 2021 we will be able to present amended, even more ambitious strategic goals for the period up to 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\n## Committee members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSven Ombudstvedt, Committee Chairman, independent director\n\nXavier Rolet, Committee member, independent director\n\nAndrey A. Guryev, Committee member, executive director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegulations on the Risk Management Committee\n\n## Activities in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSven Ombudstvedt, chairman of the committee\n\nIn 2020, the Committee held three meetings focusing on:\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Results of a reassessment of the Company's key risks and updating its risk map for 2020. One of the key changes introduced as part of the risk map update was the integration of the cybersecurity risk into it. In addition to the IT infrastructure continuity, the Committee started focusing on key cybersecurity metrics and the status of initiatives to promote computer security. With the effective cybersecurity tools in place, the Company did not record any material incidents in this area in 2020.\n\nThe Committee assists the Board of Directors and other governing bodies of PhosAgro in developing recommendations to identify material risks, work out risk management initiatives and upgrade the risk management framework. The Committee's activities are governed by the Regulations on the Risk Management Committee.\n\nThe Committee's remit includes:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the effectiveness of the Company's risk management framework and providing recommendations for its improvement;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of the Company's risk management and internal control system. Audit completed in 2020 once again showed that the PhosAgro complies with the industry's leading practices, while in some areas (such as the establishment and convincing performance of a dedicated risk management committee under the Board of Directors) it is far ahead of the peers.\n- \u00b7 Results of monitoring of the Company's key risk management activities (quarterly).\n\nThe key novelty of the risk monitoring exercise in 2020 was the necessity to address the risk of the new coronavirus infection. The spread of COVID-19 had its toll on practically all operations of the Company, tipping the probability scales of inherent risks to a higher level. As a result, the Company placed a particular emphasis on the management of COVIDrelated risks and the impact they\n\n- \u00b7 defining the methodology and identifying the Company's most material risks to ensure their continuous monitoring and management;\n- \u00b7 drafting recommendations for improving the comprehensive risk management framework;\n- \u00b7 defining the Company's risk appetite.\n\nhad on the continuity of business processes. The steps taken by the Company in response to COVID-19 helped prevent the suspension of production operations and avoid disruptions to other material business processes.\n\n- \u00b7 Management of key specific corporate risks. In addition to the cybersecurity and COVID-19 risks, climate change was a focus of attention for the Committee in 2020. In 2021, the Committee will keep a close watch for the use of a risk-oriented approach in the implementation of PhosAgro's Climate Strategy.\n\nThe risks were also reviewed in the context of the Company strategy implementation, with regular risk monitoring done to assess their impact on the Company's strategic goals.",

At its first meeting in May 2020, the committee outlined a plan for drafting an appropriate strategy until 2028, determined responsible persons and control points.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAndrey Sharonov, independent director\n\nMikhail Rybnikov, executive director\n\nThe Committee's remit includes:\n\n- \u00b7 building and analysing PhosAgro's framework of sustainable development bylaws, controlling their drafting, relevance, effectiveness and quality;\n- \u00b7 engaging with key stakeholders and contributing to the development and growth of healthy and sustainable communities in all regions where the Company operates;\n- \u00b7 controlling compliance with applicable statutory requirements and internal sustainability objectives;\n\nAlready in November, committee members reviewed a draft strategy, including climate scenarios, a list of risks and opportunities associated with each scenario, a lowcarbon transition plan, as well as scientifically verified GHG reduction targets.\n\nImportantly, the low-carbon transition plan reflects the rules for interacting with other parties involved in the Company's value chain, including a supplier engagement concept.\n\nIn this way, PhosAgro commits to climate change action across the entire value chain.\n\n- \u00b7 organising staff training on best sustainable development practices;\n- \u00b7 preparing recommendations to the Board of Directors on determining the Company's strategic sustainable development objectives;\n- \u00b7 reviewing sustainable development reports;\n- \u00b7 supervising PhosAgro's sustainable development disclosure;\n- \u00b7 Analysing PhosAgro's practices and bylaws in terms of compliance with sustainable development rating requirements and managing efforts to maintain and improve the Company's rating positions.\n\nFor each of the three scopes of GHG emissions, the actual volumes and their evolution, the main sources as well as possible measures to reduce emissions were quantified and analysed.\n\nFollowing the review and the Committee's recommendations, the Board of Directors approved the Climate Strategy and endorsed the lowcarbon transition plan.\n\nWe are pleased that the Company is already taking action under the plan.\n\nIt is active in implementing initiatives to reduce direct (Scope\n\n1) GHG emissions. In particular, the Company has been expanding the use of steam associated with sulphuric and nitric acid production to generate electricity and heat. PhosAgro has prepared and is evaluating an action plan aimed at achieving the Scope 1 GHG emission reduction targets.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Company launched a solar power station pilot in Balakovo. The Committee is awaiting the plant's operational update before deciding to expand the project and replicate it at the Company's other sites. Moreover, in December 2020 PhosAgro signed a contract to purchase hydro-generated electricity for its mining and processing plant in Kirovsk, the largest production site of the Company. Finally, the Committee approved a new Energy Efficiency Programme, which combines the existing energy efficiency programmes at each of the Company's production sites and establishes a schedule to be followed by the Company's management in designing and reviewing these initiatives.\n\nThe three projects, as they are implemented, will definitely contribute to the reduction of Scope 2 GHG emissions.\n\nIn early 2021, PhosAgro and the Russian Academy of Sciences are set to sign a cooperation agreement aimed at building carbon farms in the Vologda region. Coupled with other initiatives, such as the production of urea with inhibitor launched in 2020 to significantly reduce nitrous oxide emissions in fertilizer application, the project will also contributes to the achievement of Scope 3 GHG emission reduction targets.\n\nWe are closely monitoring developments surrounding the expected introduction in 2023 of the carbon border adjustment mechanism and analysing, together with the senior management, associated risks and mitigations as well as opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7 External assessments of the Company's sustainable development activities.\n\nThe Committee believes that external assessments, such as ratings, are an effective measure of the Company's sustainable development activities. We value opinions of specialist ESG agencies, including Sustainalytics, MSCI, CDP and others, as we can gauge the Company's performance against best global practices and identify areas of improvement and communication with stakeholders. Therefore, at the Committee's recommendation, an action plan was developed to improve the Company's key ESG ratings, and the Committee reviewed appropriate reports at each of its three meetings in 2020. We intend to maintain this approach in the future. We are pleased that PhosAgro has made significant progress in this area and look forward to further improvements.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Setting sustainable development priorities . At the Committee's initiative, the Company implemented an important project to prioritise sustainable development goals in 2020. In 2019, the Company approved its priority strategic goals and objectives and related activities based on internal discussion and dialogue with stakeholders, and in 2020 the Committee decided that expert justification was required for setting SDG-related priorities, selecting indicators to measure the Company's environmental impact, designing environmental management approaches and actions to boost the positive impact, while reducing the negative impact.\n\nAbout 80 sources were reviewed, and 36 types of impact across the value chain were identified. The approach reflects the Company's multifaceted impact on the achievement of SDGs during the product life cycle and is based on recommendations of the SDG Compass, GRI, the UN Global Compact\n\nand the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). As a result, we created a matrix describing the Company's approaches to achieving SDGs.\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring environmental and social performance. At each of its meetings, the Committee reviewed the status of activities approved in 2019 in terms of achieving the environmental and social goals until 2025, including waste water discharge levels, Scope 1 GHG emissions, occupational injury and accident rates, hazardous waste treatment, employee satisfaction and loyalty, and training hours. On the Committee's initiative, in 2020 the Board of Directors approved PhosAgro's Water Strategy, which consolidated all initiatives related to the three types of impact that the Company's production sites have on water bodies such as water intake, discharge and consumption. As is the case with the Energy Efficiency Programme, the Water Strategy set the schedule for specific activities to be designed and reviewed by the senior management. The strategy has urged the Company to toughen its targets for discharges into water bodies.",

It also embraces actions taken by the Company to strike the right balance between value growth, profitability and risks, support financial sustainability, and ensure efficient operations, protection of its assets, compliance with the laws, and bylaws, along with timely and accurate reporting.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the key principles of, and approaches to, risk management and internal controls, oversees the Company's executive bodies, and performs other key functions. The Risk Management Committee provides recommendations to the Board of Directors on identifying material risks and developing relevant management tools and measures to enhance the risk management framework. The Audit Committee focuses on assessing and making proposals to improve the risk management and internal control efficiency. On top of that, its members supervise the preparation of accounting (financial) statements and the measures taken to prevent fraudulent behaviour of the Company's employees or third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor key roles and other relevant information, see the Risk Management and Internal Control Policy.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrganisational structure of the risk management and internal control framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Review Committee elected by the General Shareholders' Meeting exercises control over the financial and business operations of the Company.\n\nThe executive bodies establish and maintain an efficient risk management and internal control framework. To this effect, they have set up a Risk Commission that monitors the status and effectiveness of risk management initiatives. The results serve as a basis for the relevant proposals issued by the Commission to executive bodies and the Board of Directors.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIn 2020, PhosAgro's risk management and internal control framework performed strongly thanks to timely identification and assessment of risks, as well as development and implementation of risk management measures. On a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors reviewed reports on the management of the Company's key risks. PhosAgro's executives paid special attention to managing these key risks. The Risk Commission continuously monitored the status of risk management activities and, when necessary, initiated changes to improve those related to key risks.\n\n## Development of the risk management and internal control framework in 2020\n\nThe Company is making a consistent effort to develop its risk management and internal control framework. In 2020, the Board\n\nFollowing the audits, the Internal Audit Department provides the Board of Directors and executive bodies with recommendations and reports, including, among other things, the assessment of the current status, reliability and efficiency of the corporate governance, risk management and internal control framework.\n\nThe Risk Management and Internal Control Department is charged with the general supervision of risk management, including related activities and consolidated reporting to the Board of Directors and executive bodies.\n\nof Directors reviewed the results of the framework's assessment, which showed that it was on par with those adopted by the industry's leading companies, including:\n\n- \u00b7 full compliance with regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 risk management and internal controls being in place at production sites;\n- \u00b7 the key risk indicators being monitored;\n- \u00b7 the risk appetites being evaluated and regularly reviewed.\n\nThe reporting year saw the production sites and the Company as a whole complete a full-year cycle of risk management and internal control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 ongoing risk monitoring;\n\nAs part of their duties, heads of other organisational units are responsible for building, documenting, implementing, monitoring and developing the risk management and internal control framework in their respective functional areas. The framework requires the Company's employees to identify and assess relevant risks and efficiently implement the controls and risk management initiatives.\n\n- \u00b7 analysis of key risk indicators;\n- \u00b7 development of corrective actions;\n- \u00b7 follow-up control and review.\n\nIn 2020, the Company also rearranged the risks related to climate change and analysed climate scenarios for its regions of operation.\n\n## Plans for 2021\n\nWe look to maintain the existing elements of our risk management framework, focus on their further integration into the Company's processes and practices, and improve climate risk monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on key risks and risk management, see the Strategic Report section, p. 72",

Additional compensation is linked to achieving the Company's key performance indicators (KPIs) and accomplishing additional tasks and objectives, as determined by the Board of Directors and the CEO for the reporting year or quarter. KPIs for each senior manager are set by period and take into account metrics related to operational efficiency and individual contribution to the corporate growth and strategic performance. The Company calculates the additional annual compensation using EBITDA for the reporting period as resolved by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2013, PhosAgro implemented a KPI framework in accordance with the adopted Regulations on KPI Targets and Performance Assessment.\n\nDepending on the manager level, KPI proposals are reviewed by the remuneration and human resources committees of Apatit and PhosAgro or in consultation with the Human Resources and Social Policy Director, functional managers and key directors, while individual KPI scorecards are determined by the respective CEO or functional manager.\n\nEach year culminates in an order which provides a basis for actual KPIs and performance calculations vs KPI scorecards, with interim KPI assessments held every six months.\n\nAny and all KPI disputes are resolved by the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee for manager levels of N-1 and N-2 or in consultation with the Human Resources and Social Policy Director, functional managers and key directors for levels of N-3 and below.\n\nIn 2020, the Company cascaded the KPI framework down to N-3 level (heads of units and functions) in order to roll out the performance assessment process and incentivise managers' focus on results and strategic goals. The KPI framework now covers 277 employees, up 173 employees (163%) year-on-year.\n\n## KPI driven areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommitment to sustainability,\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoosting logistics efficiency,\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof KPIs\n\n## Performance breakdown by management level, %\n\n## Performance breakdown by function, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe average employee performance in 2020 stood at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n104\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreasing sales in priority markets,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof KPIs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExpansion of production capacities through improved operational efficiency,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof KPIs\n\n28\n\n%\n\nDevelopment in highpotential areas,\n\n%\n\nof KPIs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImproved investment case,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll KPIs are aligned with the Company's strategic goals defined in its Strategy to 2025 and oriented towards their achievement.\n\nWhen defining KPIs for 2021, the Company further increased the number of sustainability KPIs and expanded their coverage of managers at all levels:\n\n- \u00b7 in terms of OHS, the KPI framework added LTIFR for contractors, with OHS KPIs now covering more KPI holders;\n- \u00b7 in terms of human resources and social policy, the KPIs based on strategic sustainable development goals were cascaded down to more employees;\n- \u00b7 sustainability KPIs were included in KPI scorecards for managers of the Marketing Department and the Corporate Secretary Office;\n- \u00b7 in terms of environmental protection, KPIs remained unchanged vs 2020, but the Company decided to include climate change KPIs in KPI scorecards for managers in charge of implementing the low carbon transition plan starting from 2022.\n\n## MANAGEMENT BOARD REMUNERATION\n\nThe amount of remuneration and additional compensation due to PhosAgro's CEO is regulated by a contract between them and the Company, which is signed\n\nby the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The total remuneration reflects the CEO's qualifications and their personal contribution to the Company's financial results.\n\nRemuneration paid to the CEO and six other Management Board members who represent the senior management team for their services to the Company, RUB '000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Pay type                    | 2018       | 2019      | 2020        |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Total                       | 185,575.96 | 451,201.7 | 1,098,922.6 |\n| Salary                      | 90,288.48  | 170,490.6 | 421,033.0   |\n| Bonus                       | 94,929.98  | 280,408.6 | 677,807.1   |\n| Other types of remuneration | 357.5      | 302.5     | 82.5        |\n| Fee                         | 0          | 0         | 0           |\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITOR'S REMUNERATION\n\nIn 2020, the Company engaged KPMG (10 Presnenskaya Embankment, Moscow, Russia) to audit its IFRS financial statements.\n\nThe actual remuneration paid to the auditor for this service stood at RUB 36.5 mln, net of VAT and overhead costs.\n\nIn addition, KPMG was engaged in preparing the Company's Eurobond\n\nissue and received RUB 16.3 mln, net of VAT, for this service.\n\nFurthermore, during the reporting year, other agreements were signed with the auditor for nonaudit services worth of RUB 1.8 mln, net of VAT, as well as for non-audit services provided to the Company's subsidiaries worth of RUB 4.9 mln, net of VAT.\n\nIn 2020, the Company engaged FBK to audit its RAS accounting statements.\n\nThe actual remuneration of FBK to audit the Company's RAS accounting statements in 2020 was RUB 590,000 plus VAT.\n\nThe KPI driven remuneration as a percentage of annual salary depends on the manager's position and level ranging from 15% for N-3 to 150% for N-1.\n\nThe Company does not provide for any compensation payable to managers in case of their voluntary resignation or the Company's acquisition or the change of its owner (golden parachutes). Neither does it use options, pre-determined unconditional bonuses or a clawback mechanism.",

Higher transparency and predictability of dividend payments are a priority for the Company as it seeks to strengthen its investment case.\n\nAll resolutions on the payment of dividends and the timing and amount of such payment are subject to approval of the General Shareholders' Meeting, based on recommendations provided by the PhosAgro Board of Directors. When preparing recommendations\n\nfor the General Shareholders' Meeting on any dividend payout (declaration), besides the current financial standing assessment, the Board of Directors factors in and sticks to relevant provisions of the Company's dividend policy which states that the amount of distributed dividends ranges from 50% to over 75% (subject to the Company's leverage ratio) of the Company's consolidated free cash flow for the respective year under IFRS. At the same time, the amount of declared dividends should not be lower than 50% of net profit for the year under IFRS.\n\nOn 14 April 2021, PhosAgro's Board of Directors recommended that the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting (AGM) approve dividends of RUB 63 per share (RUB 21 per depositary receipt), or RUB 8,158.5 mln in total. If approved by the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting on 25 May 2021, declared dividends for 2020 will amount to RUB 38,461.5 mln or 90% of the free cash flow calculated on the basis of the Company's 2020 IFRS consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full text of our dividend policy is available\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dividend information\n\n| Type and date of the General  Shareholders' Meeting where             |                                                                                                      | Declared               | Declared dividends per: ordinary  depositary   | Declared dividends per: ordinary  depositary   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| the relevant resolution on  the declaration of dividends  was adopted | Reporting period for which (following the  results of which) the declared dividends  are (were) paid | dividends, total,  RUB | share, RUB                                     | receipt, RUB                                   |\n| EGM 14 December 2020                                                  | -

When determining its borrowing requirements, the Company\n\nassesses the cost of borrowing from banks and public debt markets, the amount and maturity available while striving to ensure that this fits into the Group's long-term debt reduction strategy. The choice of the currency of borrowings\n\nis based on the structure of the Company's revenue, 70% of which is in foreign currency and the rest is strongly correlated with US Dollar exchange rate.\n\n## BONDS\n\n| Borrower                       | PJSC PhosAgro                  | PJSC PhosAgro                  | PJSC PhosAgro              |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| PhosAgro Bond Funding  Limited | PhosAgro Bond Funding  Limited | PhosAgro Bond Funding  Limited | Issuer                     |\n| 3 May 2017                     | 24 January 2018                | 23 January 2020                | Settlement date            |\n| 500,000,000                    | 500,000,000                    | 500,000,000                    | Principal outstanding, USD |\n| Apatit, PhosAgro-Cherepovets   | Apatit                         | Apatit                         | Guarantors                 |\n\n## RELATIONSHIP WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND INVESTORS\n\nAt PhosAgro, we are committed to transparency and consistency, and maintain an ongoing dialogue with the investor community through a variety of communication channels and with involvement of the Company's senior management and independent directors.\n\n- \u00b7 We keep the market abreast of the Company's performance by publishing quarterly operational and financial results that are made available to investors via press releases, presentations, conference calls and webcasts.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Russian Federation and with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the requirements in the Russian Federation and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAudited entity: PJSC 'PhosAgro'\n\nRegistration number in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities: No. 1027700190572.\n\nMoscow, Russia\n\nIndependent auditor: JSC 'KPMG', a company incorporated under the Laws of the Russian Federation, a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.\n\nRegistration  number  in  the  Unified  State  Register  of  Legal  Entities: No. 1027700125628.\n\nMember  of  the Self-regulatory Organization of Auditors Association 'Sodruzhestvo' (SRO AAS).

The recovery of the deferred tax assets also depends on achieving sufficient taxable profits in the future.\n\nThe assessment of the recoverability of tax  losses  depends  on  the  projected profitability of the Group, which is formed on the basis of planned sales volumes and prices for sold products and expected inflation rates and exchange rates.\n\nThere is inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting timing and quantum of future taxable profits, which support the extent to  which  tax  assets  are  recognised. Therefore, this is the key judgmental area our audit is concentrated on.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\nWe considered the Group's assessment of possible options for the utilization of deferred tax asset and its assessment of the likelihood of those options.\n\nWe tested the accuracy of the taxable profits forecast model used to estimate the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of management's key assumptions and estimates used by management to assess the likelihood of generating  sufficient future taxable profits to support the recognition of deferred  tax  assets,  taking  into  account external market indicators such as trends in prices for chemical fertilizers, inflation rates and exchange rates.\n\nUsing KPMG tax specialists, we considered the  appropriateness  of  the  application  of relevant  tax  legislation  by  the  Group,  in relation  to  the  utilization  of  tax  losses, including analysis of the most likely option for their utilization.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPJSC 'PhosAgro' Independent Auditors' Report Page 4\n\nopinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.  We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships  and  other  matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be communicated  in  our  report  because  the  adverse  consequences  of  doing  so  would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is:\n\nJSC 'KPMG'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoscow, Russia\n\n18 February 2021",

The Company was registered in October 2001. The Company's location is Leninsky prospekt 55/1 building 1, Moscow, Russian Federation, 119333.\n\nThe Group's principal activity is production of apatite concentrate and mineral fertilisers at plants located in the cities of Kirovsk (Murmansk region), Cherepovets (Vologda region), Balakovo (Saratov region) and Volkhov (Leningrad region), and their distribution across the Russian Federation and abroad.\n\nThe Company's key shareholders are two Cyprus entities holding approximately 44% of the Company's ordinary shares in total. The majority of the shares of the Company are ultimately owned by trusts, where the economic beneficiary is Mr. Andrey G. Guryev and his family members.\n\n## (b) Russian business environment\n\nThe Group's operations are primarily located in the Russian Federation. Consequently, the Group is exposed to the economic and financial conditions of the Russian Federation, which display characteristics of an emerging market. The legal, tax and regulatory frameworks continue development, but are subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes which together with other legal and fiscal impediments contribute to the challenges faced by entities operating in the Russian Federation.\n\nStarting in 2014, the United States of America, the European Union and some other countries have imposed and expanded economic sanctions against a number of Russian individuals and legal entities. The imposition of the sanctions has led to increased economic uncertainty, including more volatile equity markets, a depreciation of the Russian rouble, a reduction in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit. As a result, some Russian entities may experience difficulties accessing the international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on state support for their operations. The longerterm effects of the imposed and possible additional sanctions are difficult to determine.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 virus has become a global pandemic. Together with other factors, this has resulted in a sharp decrease of the stock market indices, which, on the backdrop of simultaneous oil price collapse, led to depreciation of the Russian Rouble. PhosAgro was one of the first companies in Russia to start introducing measures to combat the spread of the virus among its employees. The Group provided protective equipment, medical supplies, testing kits and other essentials to the communities where it operates. The Group has developed plans for mitigating the impact on its business and has reviewed the economic environment; the demand for the Group's products; its supply chain; its available bank facilities; and the possible effects on its cash flow and liquidity position, including consideration of debt covenants. Management has considered events and conditions that could give rise to material uncertainties and concluded that the range of possible outcomes does not cast significant doubt over the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect management's assessment of the impact of the Russian business environment on the operations and the financial position of the Group. The future business environment may differ from management's assessment.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe Group additionally prepares IFRS consolidated financial statements in the Russian language in accordance with the Federal Law No. 208-FZ On consolidated financial reporting.\n\n## (b) Going concern\n\nNote 30 to the consolidated financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group has considerable financial resources together with long-standing relationships with a number of customers across different geographic areas. The excess of current liabilities over current assets would be resolved by raising of new long-term borrowings, please see the Note 30 (d). As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.\n\nThe directors remain confident that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\n## (c) Basis of measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the financial assets measured at fair value.\n\n## (d) Functional currency\n\nThe national currency of the Russian Federation is the Russian Rouble ('RUB'), which is the functional currency of the Parent and its subsidiaries, except for foreign trading subsidiaries, where the functional currency is USD, EUR and other currencies.\n\n## (e) Presentation currency\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in RUB. All financial information presented in RUB has been rounded to the nearest million, except per share amounts.\n\nThe translation from USD into RUB, where applicable, was performed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2020 were translated at the closing exchange rate of RUB 73.8757 for USD 1 (31 December 2019: RUB 61.9057 for USD 1);\n- \u00b7 Profit and loss items for 2020 were translated at the average exchange rate for the appropriate month for USD 1:\n\n| January   | February   | March   | April   | May     | June    | July    | August   | September   | October   | November   | December   |\n|-----------|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| 61,7823   | 63,8836    | 73,3183 | 75,2321 | 72,6187 | 69,2239 | 71,2853 | 73,7998  | 75,6621     | 77,5924   | 77,0462    | 74,0563    |\n\nProfit and loss items for three months ended 31 March 2019, 30 June 2019, 30 September 2019 and 31 December 2019 were translated at the average exchange rates RUB 66.1271, RUB 64.5584, RUB 64.5685 and RUB 63.7192 for USD 1 respectively;\n\n- \u00b7 Equity items arising during the year are recognised at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction;\n- \u00b7 The resulting foreign exchange difference is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe translation from EUR into RUB, where applicable, was performed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2020 were translated at the closing exchange rate of RUB 90.6824 for EUR 1 (31 December 2019: RUB 69.3406 for EUR 1);\n- \u00b7 Profit and loss items for 2020 were translated at the average exchange rate for the appropriate month for EUR 1:\n\n| January   | February   | March   | April   | May     | June    | July    | August   | September   | October   | November   | December   |\n|-----------|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| 68,7249   | 69,7001    | 81,0512 | 81,9481 | 79,0550 | 77,9624 | 81,3800 | 87,3414  | 89,2870     | 91,2900   | 91,0875    | 90,0734    |",

Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nInformation about critical assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 note 3(c)(iii) - estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment;\n- \u00b7 note 18 - recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which carry-forward tax losses can be used.\n\n## (g) Adoption of new and revised standards and interpretations\n\nThe following amended standards became effective from 1 January 2020, but did not have any material impact on the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (issued on 29 March 2018 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020).\n- \u00b7 Definition of a business - Amendments to IFRS 3 (issued on 22 October 2018 and effective for acquisitions from the beginning of annual reporting period that starts on or after 1 January 2020).\n- \u00b7 Definition of materiality - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 (issued on 31 October 2018 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020).\n- \u00b7 Interest rate benchmark reform - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (issued on 26 September 2019 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020).\n- \u00b7 COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions Amendment to IFRS 16 (issued on 28 May 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020).\n\n## (h) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nA number of new standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 or later, and which the Group has not early adopted, but is in process of assessing the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' (issued on 18 May 2017 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 17 and an amendment to IFRS 4 (issued on 25 June 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n- \u00b7 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current - Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 23 January 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).\n- \u00b7 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current, deferral of effective date - Amendments to IAS 1 (issued on 15 July 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\n\n- \u00b7 Proceeds before intended use, Onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling a contract, Reference to the Conceptual Framework - narrow scope amendments to IAS 16, IAS 37 and IFRS 3, and Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2018-2020 - amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 41 (issued on 14 May 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).\n- \u00b7 Interest rate benchmark (IBOR) reform - phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (issued on 27 August 2020 and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021).\n\n## 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (a) Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n## (ii) Loss of control\n\nUpon the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as measured at FVOCI financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.\n\n## (iii) Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests\n\nAny difference between the consideration paid to acquire a non-controlling interest, and the carrying amount of that non-controlling interest, is recognised in equity.\n\nAny difference between the consideration received from disposal of a portion of a Group's interest in the subsidiary and the carrying amount of that portion, including attributable goodwill, is recognised in equity.\n\n## (iv) Associates\n\nAssociates are those enterprises in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence effectively commences until the date that significant influence effectively ceases. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the Group's interest in the associate, that interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.\n\n## (v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled enterprises are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the enterprise. Unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment in the associate. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.",

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the dates the fair values were determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\n## (c) Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Owned assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS was determined by reference to its fair value at that date ('deemed cost') as determined by an independent appraiser.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\n\nWhere an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent expenditure\n\nExpenses in connection with ordinary maintenance and repairs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as they are incurred.\n\nExpenses in connection with periodic maintenance on property, plant and equipment are recognised as assets and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period until the next periodic maintenance, provided the criteria for capitalizing such items have been met.\n\nExpenses incurred in connection with major replacements and renewals of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and depreciated on a systematic basis.\n\n## (iii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets. Depreciation commences on the month of acquisition or, in respect of internally constructed assets, from the month when an asset is completed and ready for use. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe estimated useful lives as determined when adopting IFRS (1 January 2005) are as follows:\n\n| Buildings             | 12 to 17 years;   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Plant and equipment   | 4 to 15 years;    |\n| Fixtures and fittings | 3 to 6 years.     |\n\nTangible fixed assets acquired after the date of adoption of IFRS, are depreciated over the following useful lives:\n\n| Buildings             | 10 to 60 years;   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Plant and equipment   | 5 to 35 years;    |\n| Fixtures and fittings | 2 to 25 years.    |\n\n## (d) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Research and development\n\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the profit or loss as an expense as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the profit or loss as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n## (ii) Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets acquired by the Group are represented by Oracle software, which has finite useful life and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n## (iii) Amortisation\n\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from the date the asset is available for use. The estimated useful lives are 3 - 10 years.\n\n## (e) Financial instruments\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group financial assets are classified in the following measurement categories based on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows: financial assets at amortised cost; financial assets at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or profit or loss).\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL'):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThe financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Any gains or losses arising from derecognition are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI').\n\nFinancial assets are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they meet both of the following conditions and are not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 their contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss ('FVPL').\n\nFinancial asset that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss ('FVPL').",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## (f) Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\nThe cost of inventories is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\n## (g) Impairment\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit loss (ECLs) on financial asset measured at amortised cost and debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI').  The loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases: 12-month ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date; and lifetime ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nFor trade receivables the Group estimated the expected credit losses for the entire period, applying a simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses lifetime expected loss allowance. In the terms of calculating the expected credit loss, the Group considers the credit rating for each counterparty, adjusted with forward-looking factors specific to the debtors, historical credit loss experience and economic environment in which they operate.\n\nIf, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired financial assets increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, then the impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 'cash-generating unit').\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, if any, and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\n## (h) Leases\n\n## As a lessee\n\nApplying IFRS 16 for all leases (except as noted below), the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position, initially measured at the present value of future lease payments;\n- \u00b7 Recognises depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income; and\n- \u00b7 Separates the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest (presented within operating activities) in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and making certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on the rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nLease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is revalued when there is a change in future lease payments arising from adjusted interest rate, extension or termination option and other events.\n\nUnder IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.\n\nFor short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets the Group has opted to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. This expense is presented within cost of sales, administrative expenses and selling expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n\n## (i) Share capital\n\n## (i) Repurchase of share capital\n\nWhen share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is deducted from equity.\n\n## (ii) Dividends\n\nDividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.\n\n## (j) Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, borrowings and bonds and derivative financial instruments.  The Group financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities include derivatives, other liabilities held for trading, and liabilities that the Group designates to be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## (k) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Pension plans\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets, if any, is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in the profit or loss. To the extent the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the profit or loss.\n\nAll actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (ii) Long-term service benefits other than pensions\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (iii) State pension fund\n\nThe Group makes contributions for the benefit of employees to Russia's State pension fund. The contributions are expensed as incurred.\n\n## (l) Provisions\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## (m) Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n## (n) Revenues\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services, taking into account any trade, volume and other discounts. Advances received before the control passes to a customer are recognised as the contract liabilities. The amount of consideration does not contain a significant financial component as payment terms for the majority of contracts are less than one year. No information is provided about remaining performance obligations as at the reporting date that have an original expected duration of one year or less, as allowed by IFRS 15.\n\nContracts with customers for the supply of goods use a variety of delivery terms. The Group determined that under the terms of the majority contracts for the supply of mineral fertilizers the Group undertakes to provide delivery and the related delivery services after the transfer of control over the goods to the buyer at the loading port. Under IFRS 15, these services are a separate performance obligation, which revenue must be recognised during the period of delivery as revenue from logistics activities. The Group recognises revenue from these logistics services at the time of delivery, due to the fact that the potential difference is calculated and recognised as insignificant.\n\nIn the revenue disclosure the sales of certain product groups include the proceeds from logistics services. Costs related to rendering of logistics services are mainly represented by transportation costs and included in selling expenses.\n\n## (o) Finance income and costs\n\nFinance income comprises interest income, dividend income, gain on the financial assets at FVTPL, gain arising from operations with foreign currency, unwind of discount of financial assets, share of profit of associates and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment is established.\n\nFinance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, loss on the financial assets at FVTPL, bank fees, securitisation fees, loss arising from operations with foreign currency, discount of financial assets, share of loss of associates and foreign currency losses. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\nForeign currency gains and losses, gains and losses arising from operations with foreign currency, securitisation fees, share of profit and losses of associates are reported on a net basis.\n\n## (p) Overburden removal expenditure\n\nIn open pit apatite rock mining operations, it is necessary to remove the overburden and other waste in order to access the economically recoverable resources.\n\nStripping costs incurred during the pre-production phase of the open pit mine are capitalised as the cost of the development of the mining property and amortised over the life of the mine.\n\nAccording to the Group's approach to stripping, the ore, which becomes accessible after the overburden removal, is extracted within three months. Therefore, the stripping ratio (volume of overburden removed over the volume of resources extracted) is expected to stay relatively constant over the future periods and stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the open pit mine are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.",

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held.\n\nIf the number of ordinary shares outstanding increases/ (decreases) as a result of a share split/(reverse share split), the calculation of the EPS for all periods presented is adjusted retrospectively.\n\nDiluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible notes and share options granted to employees.\n\n## (s) Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets, related head office expenses and Group's associates.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES\n\nA number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u00b7 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nIf the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.\n\nThe Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nFair values have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes based on the methods described in notes 4(a) to 4(\u0441). When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.\n\n## (a) Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nThe fair values of financial assets carried at amortised cost, which are mainly loans issued and trade and other receivables, approximate their carrying amounts as at the reporting date.\n\n## (b) Financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined using inputs from observable market data and are categorised as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial liabilities, represented by put and call options on oil (Brent) contracts, are based on broker quotes. Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments.\n\n## (c) Other financial liabilities not measured at fair value\n\nThe fair values of other financial liabilities, which are mainly loans and borrowings and lease liabilities, are determined for disclosure purposes and categorised as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values are calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.",

The strategic business units offer different products, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Phosphate-based products segment includes mainly production and distribution of ammophos, diammoniumphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and other phosphate based and complex (NPK) fertilisers on the factories located in Cherepovets, Balakovo and Volkhov, and production and distribution of apatite concentrate extracted from the apatite-nepheline ore, which is mined and processed in Kirovsk;\n- \u00b7 Nitrogen-based products segment includes mainly production and distribution of ammonia, ammonium nitrate and urea on the factory located in Cherepovets.\n\nCertain assets, revenue and expenses are not allocated to any particular segment and are, therefore, included in the 'other operations' column. None of these operations meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments.\n\nInformation regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on gross profit, as included in internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group's CEO.\n\nSegment information as at 31 December 2020 and for the year then ended is as follows:\n\n| RUB million                        | Phosphate-based  products   | Nitrogen-based  products   | Other  operations   | Total     |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Segment revenue and profitability  |                             |                            |                     |           |\n| Segment external revenues,         | 203,561                     | 38,701                     | 11,617              | 253,879   |\n| thereof:                           |                             |                            |                     |           |\n| Export                             | 135,506                     | 31,530                     | 1,771               | 168,807   |\n| Domestic                           | 68,055                      | 7,171                      | 9,846               | 85,072    |\n| Cost of sales                      | (106,240)                   | (16,489)                   | (10,606)            | (133,335) |\n| Gross segment profit               | 97,321                      | 22,212                     | 1,011               | 120,544   |\n| Certain items of profit or loss    |                             |                            |                     |           |\n| Amortisation and depreciation      | (20,545)                    | (5,558)                    | (523)               | (26,626)  |\n| Total non-current segment assets 1 | 169,287                     | 56,613                     | 5,379               | 231,279   |\n| Additions to non-current assets1   | 43,678                      | 4,356                      | 784                 | 48,818    |\n\n1.\n\nSegment information of the Group as at 31 December 2019 and for the year then ended is as follows:\n\n| RUB million                       | Phosphate-based  products   | Nitrogen-based  products   | Other  operations   | Total     |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Segment revenue and profitability |                             |                            |                     |           |\n| Segment external revenues,        | 201,248                     | 37,882                     | 8,995               | 248,125   |\n| thereof:                          |                             |                            |                     |           |\n| Export                            | 135,220                     | 31,100                     | 1,098               | 167,418   |\n| Domestic                          | 66,028                      | 6,782                      | 7,897               | 80,707    |\n| Cost of sales                     | (111,086)                   | (16,609)                   | (8,529)             | (136,224) |\n| Gross segment profit              | 90,162                      | 21,273                     | 466                 | 111,901   |\n| Certain items of profit or loss   |                             |                            |                     |           |\n| Amortisation and depreciation     | (17,521)                    | (5,723)                    | (687)               | (23,931)  |\n| Total non-current segment assets1 | 144,680                     | 60,645                     | 4,968               | 210,293   |\n| Additions to non-current assets1  | 37,084                      | 5,587                      | 963                 | 43,634    |\n\nThe analysis of export revenue by regions is as follows:\n\n|               | 2020 RUB million   | 2019 RUB million   |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Europe        | 66,516             | 72,372             |\n| South America | 41,915             | 34,836             |\n| India         | 21,623             | 14,153             |\n| Africa        | 12,336             | 9,509              |\n| North America | 12,287             | 19,397             |\n| CIS           | 10,512             | 13,634             |\n| Asia          | 3,519              | 3,477              |\n| Australia     | 99                 | 40                 |\n|               | 168,807            | 167,418            |",

Due to amendments to the Russian tax legislation, starting from 1 January 2017, tax losses for Russian tax purposes carried forward existing as at 31 December 2020 do not expire.\n\nManagement has developed a tax strategy to utilise the tax losses above. In assessing the recoverability of the tax losses, management considers a forecast of future taxable profits of the Group and the Group's tax position. The forecast is reviewed at each reporting date to ensure that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, no deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences of RUB 19,984 million has been recognised (31 December 2019: RUB 57,156 million), either because the Parent can control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, or because the applicable tax rate is expected to be 0%.\n\n## (b) Movement in temporary differences during the year\n\n| RUB million                                          | 31 December  2020   | Recognised in  profit or loss   | Recognised in other  comprehensive  income   | Reclassification   | 1 January  2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets | (12,007)            | (78)                            | (2)                                          | -

The Board of Directors' recommendations depend on such factors as the Company's earnings for the reporting period and its financial position. To calculate the amount of dividend payments, the Board of Directors considers the Company's consolidated free cash flow for the reporting period (quarter, six months, first nine months or year) under IFRS. A decision on the payment of an interim dividend is made at the General Shareholders' Meeting within three months of the end of the relevant reporting period. The term for dividend payments is determined by the General Shareholders' Meeting and must not exceed 60 days from the date of the resolution to pay the same.

Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.\n\n## (b) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily USD and EUR.\n\nIn respect of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.\n\nThe Group implemented a natural hedge approach (policy) aiming at reducing its exposure to foreign currency risk by means of borrowing in the same currencies in which sales agreements are denominated.\n\nThe Group has the following foreign-currency-denominated financial assets and liabilities:\n\n|                                  | 31 December 2020 RUB Million   | 31 December 2020 RUB Million   | 31 December 2019 RUB Million   | 31 December 2019 RUB Million   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Group companies in Russia        | USD denominated                | EUR denominated                | USD denominated                | EUR denominated                |\n| Current assets                   | 439                            | 28                             | 2,593                          | 250                            |\n| Receivables                      | 366                            | 5                              | 530                            | 5                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 73                             | 23                             | 2,063                          | 222                            |\n| Other current investments        | -

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2019.\n\nThe foreign exchange loss recognized in profit or loss of RUB 25,070 million (RUB 12,346 million of foreign exchange gain for the comparative period) resulted from the (depreciation) appreciation of the Russian Rouble against major currencies during the reporting and comparative periods.\n\n## Foreign currency translation differences\n\nIn addition, the net assets of the Group's foreign subsidiaries denominated in USD, EUR and other currencies  amount to RUB 16,760 million as at the reporting date (31 December 2019: RUB 15,235 million).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely impact the financial results of the Group. Management does not have a formal policy of determining how much of the Group's exposure should be to fixed or variable rates. However, at the time of raising new loans or borrowings management uses its judgment to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable to the Group over the expected period until maturity.\n\nThe interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n\n|                           | 31 December 2020 RUB Million   | 31 December 2019 RUB Million   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Fixed rate instruments    |                                |                                |\n| Other non-current assets  | 259                            | 363                            |\n| Other current investments | 4,605                          | 2,693                          |\n| Long-term borrowings      | (94,498)                       | (87,285)                       |\n| Short-term borrowings     | (53,027)                       | (33,610)                       |\n| Lease liabilities         | (7,122)                        | (7,214)                        |\n|                           | (149,783)                      | (125,053)                      |\n| Variable rate instruments |                                |                                |\n| Long-term borrowings      | (9,537)                        | (9,572)                        |\n| Short-term borrowings     | (2,293)                        | (3,236)                        |\n|                           | (11,830)                       | (12,808)                       |\n\nAt 31 December 2020, a 1% increase/(decrease) in LIBOR/EURIBOR would have decreased/(increased) the Group's profit and equity by RUB 118 million (31 December 2019: RUB 128 million).\n\n## (c) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from the Group's receivables from customers, loans issued to related parties, current and non-current financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of its financial assets and amounted to RUB 26,189 million (31 December 2019: RUB 24,720 million).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's financial assets measured at amortised cost amounted to RUB 25,597 million (31 December 2019: RUB 24,118 million).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's financial assets measured at fair value amounted to RUB 592 million (31 December 2019: RUB 602 million).\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual specific characteristics of each customer. The general characteristics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.\n\nManagement has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group's review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum amount of outstanding receivables; these limits are reviewed quarterly. Customers that fail to meet the Group's benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk management committee has also been performing more frequent reviews of sales limits for customers in regions and industries that are severely impacted.\n\nThe Group is monitoring the economic environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and is taking actions to limit its exposure to customers that are severely impacted. The majority of the Group's customers have been transacting with the Group for several years, and losses have occurred infrequently. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics. Trade and other receivables relate mainly to the Group's wholesale customers.\n\nThe Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except for new customers who are required to work on a prepayment basis or present an acceptable bank guarantee or set up letter of credit with an acceptable bank.\n\nIn addition, the major part of trade receivables in the Group's foreign subsidiaries is insured.\n\nThe Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of the expected credit losses in respect of trade and other receivables and other financial assets. The Group estimated the expected credit losses for the entire period, applying a simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses lifetime expected loss allowance. In the terms of calculating the expected credit loss, the Group considers the credit rating for each counterparty, adjusted with forward-looking factors specific to the debtors, historical credit loss experience and economic environment in which they operate.\n\nThe Group allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings, audited financial statements, management accounts and cash flow projections and available press information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default and are aligned to external credit rating definitions from agencies.\n\nExposures within each credit risk grade are segmented by geographic region and industry classification and an ECL rate is calculated for each segment based on delinquency status and actual credit loss experience over the past years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.\n\nThe Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from individual customers, which comprise a very large number of small balances. Loss rates are calculated using a 'roll rate' method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off. Roll rates are calculated separately for exposures in different segments based on the following common credit risk characteristics - geographic region, age of customer relationship.",

These trade receivables are derecognised from the statement of financial position, because the Group transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards - primarily credit risk and late payment risk. The amount of cash proceed received on transfer is recognised in cash and cash equivalents. The arrangement with the bank is such that the customers remit cash directly to the Group and the Group transfers the collected amounts to the bank. The receivables are considered to be held within a held-to-collect business model consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the receivables.\n\nThe following information shows the carrying amount of trade receivables for the reporting period that was transferred and derecognised and the cash proceeds received.\n\n|                                           | 31 December 2020 RUB Million   | 31 December 2019 RUB Million   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Trade receivables transferred to the bank | 14,897                         | 11,696                         |\n| Associated cash inflow                    | 2,362                          | 6,646                          |\n| Associated cash outflow                   | (3,894)                        | (1,314)                        |\n| Net-off with other payables               | 12,535                         | 5,050                          |\n| Other non-cash operations                 | 63                             | 474                            |\n\nPayables to the bank as at 31 December 2020 amounted to RUB 5,460 million (31 December 2019: RUB 748 million) are presented within other payables. Receivables from the bank as at 31 December 2020 amounted to RUB 537 million (31 December 2019: RUB 474 million) are presented within trade receivables.\n\n## Current and non-current financial assets\n\nThe Group lends money to related parties and to third parties, who have good credit standing. Based on the prior experience, management believes that there is no significant credit risk in respect of related party and third party loans.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are primarily held with banks with high credit rating.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Group considers that financial guarantee contracts entered into by the Group to guarantee the indebtedness of other parties are insurance arrangements in accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee (note 33).\n\nThe Group's policy is to provide financial guarantees only to the subsidiaries or related parties.\n\n## (d) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nTypically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 30 days, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. In addition, the Group maintains several lines of credit in various Russian and international banks.\n\nAt the end of 31 December 2020 the Group's current liabilities excess over current assets by RUB 22,101 million. To ensure timely obligations fulfilment the Group plans to raise additional long-term borrowings in the upcoming year.\n\nThe table below illustrates the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments, which are converted at the closing exchange rates, where applicable:",

The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital invested and the level of dividends to shareholders.\n\nThere were no changes in the Board's approach to capital management during the year.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements including the statutory requirements of the country of their domicile and the bank covenants.\n\n## 31 COMMITMENTS\n\nThe Group has entered into contracts to purchase plant and equipment for RUB 29,421 million (31 December 2019: RUB 43,603 million).\n\n## 32 CONTINGENCIES\n\n## (a) Litigation\n\nThe Group has a number of small claims and litigations relating to regular business activities and small fiscal claims. Management believes that none of these claims, individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on the Group.\n\n## (b) Taxation contingencies\n\nThe taxation system in the Russian Federation continues to evolve and is characterised by frequent changes in legislation, official pronouncements and court decisions, which are sometimes contradictory and subject to varying interpretation by different tax authorities.\n\nThe tax authorities have the power to impose fines and penalties for tax arrears. A tax year is generally open for review by the tax authorities during three subsequent calendar years. Currently the tax authorities are taking a more assertive and substance-based approach to their interpretation and enforcement of tax legislation.\n\nCurrent Russian transfer pricing legislation requires transfer pricing analysis for the majority of cross-border intercompany and major domestic intercompany transactions.  Starting from 2019, transfer pricing control, as a general rule, is applied to domestic transactions only if both criteria are met: the parties apply different tax rates, and the annual turnover of transactions between them exceeds RUB 1 billion.\n\nThe Russian transfer pricing rules are close to OECD guidelines, but have certain differences that create uncertainty in practical application of tax legislation in specific circumstances. A very limited number of publicly available transfer pricing court cases in Russia does not provide enough certainty as to the approach to applying transfer pricing rules in Russia. The impact of any transfer pricing assessment may be material to financial statements of the Group, however, the probability of such impact cannot be reliably assessed.\n\nRussian tax authorities may review prices used in intra-group transactions, in addition to transfer pricing audits. They may assess additional taxes if they conclude that taxpayers have received unjustified tax benefits as a result of those transactions.\n\nRussian tax authorities continue to exchange transfer pricing as well as other tax related information with tax authorities of other countries. This information may be used by the tax authorities to identify transactions for additional in-depth analysis.\n\nThe Group circumstances may create tax risks in the Russian Federation that are substantially more significant than in other countries. Management believes that it has provided adequately for the tax liabilities based on its interpretations of applicable Russian tax legislation, official pronouncements and court decisions. However, the interpretations of the tax authorities and courts including the interpretation of Group's planed transactions could differ and the effect on these consolidated financial statements, if the tax authorities are successful in enforcing their interpretations, could be significant.\n\n## (c) Environmental contingencies\n\nThe environmental legislation, currently effective in the Russian Federation, is relatively new and characterised by frequent changes, official pronouncements and court decisions, which are often unclear, contradictory and subject to varying interpretation by different authorities.\n\nThe Group is involved in chemical production, which is inherently exposed to significant environmental risks. The Group companies record environmental obligations as they become probable and reliably measurable. The Group companies are parties to different litigations with the Russian environmental authorities. The management believes that based on its interpretations of applicable Russian legislation, official pronouncements and court decisions no provision is required for environmental obligations. However, the interpretations of the relevant authorities could differ from management's position and the effect on these consolidated financial statements, if the authorities were successful in enforcing their interpretations, could be significant.\n\n## (d) Compliance with covenants\n\nThe Group is subject to certain covenants related primarily to its loans and borrowings. Non-compliance with such covenants may result in negative consequences for the Group including growth in the cost of borrowings and declaration of default.\n\nThe Group was in compliance with covenants at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019.",

However, the effect of seasonality on the Group's revenue is partially offset by the fact that the Group sells its fertilisers globally and fertiliser application and purchases vary by region.\n\nThe Group's costs are generally stable throughout the year, however several maintenance activities undertaken at the Group's production facilities may not be evenly spreaded.\n\n## 36 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nStarting from 1 January 2021 the rate for mineral extraction tax (note 11) will change from 4% to 14%. Management estimates the amount of the tax due for 2021 at RUB 3,623 million. The estimate for 2021 is based on an assumption that the volumes extracted and the costs of extraction will remain unchanged compared to 2020.\n\nStarting from 1 January 2021 the rate for income tax paid for dividends due to shareholders in Cyprus will change from 5% to 15%.\n\n## MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY\n\n## STATEMENT\n\nThe Company' management hereby confirms that, to the best of its knowledge:\n\nThe financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.\n\nThe management report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nThe Company was guided by GRI standards, as well as the principles of the ISO 26000 and AA 1000\n\nstandards during the preparation of the integrated report.\n\nA draft of this integrated report was reviewed and pre-approved at PhosAgro's Board of Directors meeting on 14 April 2021.

The Integrated annual report represents information related to the Company and its subsidiaries (hereinafter together - the 'Group').\n\n## SELECTED INFORMATION\n\nWe assessed the qualitative and quantitative information specified in Appendix 1 to this report, that is disclosed in the Integrated annual report and referred to or disclosed in the GRI content index of the Integrated annual report (hereinafter - the 'Selected Information').\n\nThe scope of our assurance procedures was limited to the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2020 only. We have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other items included in the Integrated annual report and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.\n\n## REPORTING CRITERIA\n\nWe assessed the Selected Information using relevant criteria, including reporting requirements, in the respective GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 102, 202, 203, 205, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 401, 403, 404 and 413 (hereinafter - the 'GRI Standards') published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (hereinafter the 'Reporting Criteria'). We believe that the Reporting Criteria are appropriate given the purpose of our limited assurance engagement.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE GROUP\n\nThe management of the Group is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 establishing internal methodology, including objective reporting criteria, and guidelines for preparing and reporting the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;\n- \u00b7 preparing, measuring and reporting of the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; and\n- \u00b7 the accuracy, completeness and presentation of the Selected Information.\n\n## OUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nWe are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and\n- \u00b7 reporting our conclusion to the management of the Group.\n\nThis report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the management of the Group in accordance with the agreement between us, to assist management in reporting on the Group's sustainability performance and activities. We permit this report to be disclosed in the Integrated annual report, which will be published on the Company's website 1 , to assist management in responding to their governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent limited assurance report in connection with the Selected Information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the management of the Group for our work or this report.\n\n## PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS APPLIED AND LEVEL OF ASSURANCE\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n- 1. The maintenance and integrity of the Company's website is the responsibility of management; the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported Selected Information or Reporting Criteria when presented on the Company's website.",

We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## WORK DONE\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information. In doing so, we:\n\n- \u00b7 made enquiries of the Group's management, including the Sustainability Reporting team and those with responsibility for Sustainability Reporting management and group reporting;\n- \u00b7 conducted interviews of personnel responsible for the preparation of the Integrated annual report and collection of underlying data;\n- \u00b7 performed analysis of the relevant internal methodology and guidelines, gaining an understanding and evaluating of the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording, preparing and reporting the Selected Information;\n\n## Audited entity:\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company 'PhosAgro'\n\nCertificate of inclusion in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities issued on 5 September 2002 under registration \u2116 1027700190572\n\nTaxpayer Identification Number 7736216869\n\n55/1 building 1, Leninsky prospect, Moscow, 119333, Russian Federation\n\n- \u00b7 performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected Information to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported.\n\n## REPORTING AND MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGIES\n\nUnder the GRI Standards there is a range of different, but acceptable, measurement and reporting techniques. The techniques can result in materially different reporting outcomes that may affect comparability with other organisations. The Selected Information should therefore be read in conjunction with the methodology used by management in preparing the Integrated annual report, described therein, and which the Group is solely responsible for.\n\n## OUR CONCLUSION\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe, that the Selected Information for the year ended 31 December 2020 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\n27 April 2021\n\nMoscow, Russian Federation\n\n## A.Y.
