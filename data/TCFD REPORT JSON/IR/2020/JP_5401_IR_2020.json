Because of its diverse properties, such as strength and easiness to work with, steel has been chosen as the most superb material for creating social infrastructure. Steel is for here for all of us now and will be with us in the future.\n\nWe have been leading the world as a steelmaker for many decades, and have supported growth and development of society, by providing this indispensable basic material for all industries and infrastructure building. Along with global population growth and associated economic growth, the world's crude steel production is expected to continue increasing. At the same time, significant long-term structural changes in society and industries are certain to increase demand for steel to provide more advanced performance. This includes advanced functions as material as well as considerations to the environment and society.\n\nWe are pledged to maximize the potential of steel and enhance its competitiveness as a material. On this basis we intend to deploy our accumulated technology and integrated power, by means such as in combining steel with other materials in new ways, and develop and provide total solutions, which incorporate utilization and processing technology in addition to supply of materials. By doing so, we are determined to contribute to a sustainable development of society - a commitment of us, engaged in steelmaking.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a global steelmaker with origins in Japan, Nippon Steel is incorporating a diversity of DNAs of people and companies, and growing into the future. Keeping that determination in mind, we renamed ourselves as 'Nippon Steel Corporation' on April 1, 2019. On that occasion, a common brand mark for Nippon Steel and the Nippon Steel Group companies was adopted in order to unify the branding of the entire group.\n\nThe brand mark is a combination of the corporate mark and the English logo.

With the subsequent efforts to restore profitability, the foundation for achieving this plan has been prepared. By steadily implementing this plan, we intend to achieve our target of a global crude steel capacity of 100 million tons by combining the efforts of our strong domestic mother mills and overseas local mills.\n\nWe are also taking up the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions through the development of breakthrough technologies and other efforts, as a corporate and industrial leader on the path to a decarbonized society. We intend to lead the global steel industry, by winning development competition with Europe, the United States, China, and South Korea while also pursuing a virtuous cycle of environmental sustainability and corporate growth, and improving corporate value.\n\n## Efforts taken for swift recovery in profitability\n\nAfter I became president in April 2019, swift recovery in profitability has been our first priority and we have made our best possible effort to achieve it, on both the hard side, such as equipment, and the soft side, such as management. The biggest challenge we faced was to free the domestic steel business from the constraint of a lossmaking structure. Under the strong sense of crisis that radical changes in the profit structure, namely large-scale structural reform, are inevitable in order to turn the situation around, I had numerous direct dialogues with our people on the two workfronts, namely, those in manufacturing and those in sales. I worked with the management team and other staff to formulate action programs. The results of the study were announced in February 2020 as our first big step in structural reform. We have decided to significantly reduce fixed costs by no-holds-barred selective concentration on certain products and facilities, and focusing investment on competitive facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfit/loss, domestic steel\n\nbusiness of the parent  (non-consol.)\n\nNon-consolidated operating income (loss)\n\nexcl. inventory valuation differences\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to our initial plan for fiscal 2020 (established in February 2020), we had a good prospect of getting out of the red, thanks to a significant reduction in fixed costs and improvement in variable costs. Unfortunately, in the first half, the collapse of economic activities, prompted by the COVID-19 outbreak, resulted in a significant deficit, but we returned to profitability in the second half, with a delay of six months. Fig. 1 While we recorded a significant loss in the first half of fiscal 2020 due to the sharp decline in demand caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, I am pleased that we were able to respond promptly and move quickly to the minimum-cost operation stance we decided to take, calling for consolidating production facilities through structural reform.

Specifically, we acquired Essar Steel, an integrated steel mill in India, decided to build a new electric arc furnace at AM/NS Calvert in the United States, sold VSB, a seamless steel tube joint venture in Brazil, and consolidated the tin business. These efforts have resulted in generating record-high profits in the overseas business in the second half of fiscal 2020, making this part a major profit contributor. Fig. 3\n\nAs a result of these efforts to improve profits in domestic and overseas steel business, we achieved consolidated business profit of \u00a5110 billion for the full fiscal year 2020, despite a significant decrease in production volume, which was made unavoidable by the difficult environment.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, we are forecasting consolidated business profit of \u00a5600 billion which will be record-high profits, renewing the post-integration high profits in fiscal 2014\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfit contribution of the overseas business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(since our business integration into the current form in 2012; Fig. 4 ).While a post-COVID-19 recovery in demand is expected in fiscal 2021, the external environment seems worse than that of fiscal 2014. Despite the severe environment, we will strive for achieving record-high profits by ensuring a return to profitability. The driving forces are cost improvement by promoting new structural measures and stabilization of overseas business profits. With regard to our challenge to improve tied (long-term contract) sales prices*, we will continue to earnestly ask our customers for a fair allocation of cost burden for raw materials and commodities among players in the supply chain and reflection in steel prices of our high value-added product qualities and solutions to keep our stable supply of, and R&D and investment in high-quality products that customers demand.\n\n* Prices of order-made steel products for customers\n\nConsolidated business profit and loss (incl. ex-Nippon Steel Nisshin)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Changes in the steelmaking business environment and Nippon Steel's Medium- to Long-Term Management Plan\n\n## Medium- to long-term changes in the steelmaking business environment\n\nGlobal steel demand is expected to steadily increase, particularly in the Asian region, including India Fig. 5 , with a significant growth in demand for high-grade steel, including demand derived from efforts on behalf of carbon neutrality. In Japan, however, steel demand is expected to continue decreasing due to the declining population and an increase in overseas local production by Japanese customers. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend of 'local production and local consumption' and 'favoring domestic production.' The globally-connected markets are likely to reverse direction, shifting toward being divided. Competition in overseas markets is likely to intensify, mainly because demand in China, which accounts for 60% of the world's steel production, is peaking.\n\nAs global awareness of climate change is growing, the realization of carbon neutrality will be expressed in an all-out battle involving public and private sectors of various nations. We believe that the establishment of zero-carbon steel technology, ahead of other countries, will be a key to determine competitiveness, profitability, and brand strength in the future steel industry.\n\n## Nippon Steel Group Medium- to Long-Term Management Plan\n\nIn light of these changes in the business environment, we announced in March 2021 a new medium- to long-term management plan, with the aim of continually growing to become 'the best steelmaker with world-leading capabilities' that contributes to Japan's industrial competitiveness from the present and into the future. The plan consists of four major strategies:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rebuild domestic steel business and strengthen our group's management\n\nThe central policy here is the restructuring of our domestic steel business. It is an unprecedented large-scale structural reform, more drastic than the measures announced in February 2020 This is needed to build a resilient profit structure that will ensure profits even in the event of a further deterioration in the business environment. We will reduce the number of blast furnaces from 15 to 10 and crude steel production capacity by 10 million tons,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteel demand forecasts\n\nGlobal steel demand (100 MMT/Y)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nequivalent to approximately 20% of total capacity, and rationalize the workforce by more than 20% to improve labor productivity. The structural reform combined with the previously-announced measures is estimated to have an impact of around \u00a5150 billion. Although this is a very challenging plan, we had devised and developed it based on numerous direct dialogues with our people in manufacturing and sales. I firmly believe that we can complete it by fiscal 2025.\n\nThis series of measures is not intended to merely arrive at a lower equilibrium. We are now at the stage to invest a large amount of money, such as for renewal of aging facilities and for strategic investments aimed at supplying high-grade steel products, which is needed in a carbon-neutral society and we find it difficult to further reduce the total fixed cost. We will therefore continue to work toward a more advanced order mix with a higher proportion in high value-added products that ensures profitability to us. While the volume of domestic production will decrease, we plan to increase revenues and profit, and significantly improve labor productivity. Let me share with you examples of our strategic investments. Electric vehicles, which are heavier than conventional vehicles due to batteries, require materials that contribute to weight reduction, and the need for high-grade electrical steel sheets for drive motors is greatly increasing. Our top-quality electrical steel sheets are also essential for electrical power saving. We have therefore decided to install a new next-generation hot strip mill at the Nagoya Works for stable, economical mass production of state-of-the-art ultra-high-tensile steel sheets, and to work on measures to improve the capacity and quality of electrical steel sheets at the Setouchi Works Hirohata Area and the Kyushu Works Yawata Area. The need for carbon neutrality and digital transformation is also robust and is unlikely to turn around and decline. By responding to new, non-reverting needs such as carbon neutrality and digital transformation, we will make the advanced order mix and a profit-generating production structure that is independent of production volume.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promote a global strategy to deepen and expand our overseas business\n\nBy further deepening and expanding our overseas operations, along with the expansion of the consolidated profit base, we intend to establish global capability of 100 million-tons of crude steel production. In so doing, we will thereby maintain our position as a major player in the expanding global steel industry. Over the mid- to long-term, steel demand in Asia and other parts of the world will grow, while the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend of\n\nSteel product demand forecasts (MMT/Y)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'local production and local consumption' and 'favoring domestic production.' In this environment, our main focus will be the integrated steelmaking business, which allows us capture the entire local demand as potential market. We will shift into high gear in full-scale overseas business that will ensure higher added value. With regard to ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India), an acquired integrated steelmaker in India, we consider to expand its capacity, including the construction of a second steel mill. In Asia, particularly ASEAN, acquisition of or equity participation in an integrated steel mill is under consideration. Fig. 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taking on the challenge of zero-carbon steel\n\nThe Challenge of Zero-Carbon Steel has two aspects. One is the provision of our technology and products to those who can benefit from them, and can contribute to the realization of a green society. This also presents business opportunities to us. That is why we have decided, as advance investments, to implement measures to improve the capacity and quality of electrical steel sheets, and to invest in the construction of a next-generation hot strip mill in the Nagoya Works.\n\nAnother challenge is the development of a new production process that will promote CO2 emission reduction in manufacturing processes. Breakthrough technology development, including development in unexplored areas, is needed. With all integrated steelmakers using blast furnaces in the world including China, we face the enormous challenge of our connections to the environment. We are taking on this challenge as Nippon Steel's paramount priority issue and as an opportunity to reestablish outstanding industrial superiority by taking advantage of our world's best technology development capabilities and by implementing technologies ahead of other steelmakers. We endeavor to provide 'green steel' products to our customers at the earliest time. This, we hope, will also further strengthen our position in customer relationships.\n\nThrough development and practical implementation of breakthrough technologies ahead of other countries, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% compared to 2013 in 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality in 2050 (Figure 7). Zero-carbon steel, however, cannot be achieved by the efforts of the steel industry alone. As prerequisite, we need government support for research and development and equipment implementation, establishment of a hydrogen supply infrastructure, realization of carbon-free power supplies, and establishment of a system that enormous costs will be borne by society as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToward global 100 million-ton crude\n\nsteel production structure\n\n## Long-term vision (MMT/Y)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promote digital transformation strategies\n\nWe have been attentively collecting and analyzing the vast amounts of data generated at manufacturing and business sites to reduce costs and improve quality. These accumulated data are our strength. Aiming to become a digital advanced company in the world steel industry, we will make full use of our treasure chest of vast, sophisticated data and digital technologies, innovate our production and business processes, accelerate decision-making from the management level to our people on the frontline, and strengthen problem-solving capabilities.\n\n## In closing\n\nWe are committed to achieving both environmental sustainability and corporate growth. Specifically, we will steadily carry out the management plan and build a global 100 million-ton crude steel production structure that comprises our strong domestic and overseas local mills. At the same time, we will tackle the Nippon Steel Carbon Neutral Vision 2050 - the Challenge to ZeroCarbon Steel. Moreover, we will work on digital transformation to streamline operations and decision-making, and make earnest efforts toward diversity and inclusion to create a company where diverse employees feel proud and fulfilled.\n\nWe declare in our Management Principles that we are dedicated to pursuing world-leading technology and manufacturing capabilities, and to provide products and services that benefit society. This precisely echoes the concept of the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG). I recognize that ESG initiatives are one of the priority issues and form part of the base that supports the very existence and growth of our company. We intend to steadily promote its execution and follow-up of our materiality in ESG issues, by checking the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and to strive to contribute to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), as well as improvement of our corporate value.\n\nI would like to thank all our stakeholders for their continued understanding and support of Nippon Steel Corporation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNippon Steel's CO2 emission reduction scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(MMT/Y)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thanks to its diverse properties and infinite potential, steel will continually contribute to a sustainable society.\n\n## Steel is an abundant, sustainable material that can be reborn endlessly\n\n## Steel is an outstanding material from the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteel represents 90% or more of metal products, as steel being abundant, cheap, and having good workability, and has a wide range of applications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteel is an affordable material and is cheaper than water in a plastic bottle (in comparing price per unit weight).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steel is a sustainable material to be reborn in new steel products endlessly\n\nSteel is easily sorted from a mixture with other materials and can be endlessly recycled without causing deterioration in quality - quite a unique characteristic. Steel is a perfect material for recycling as it can be recycled endlessly into all kinds of steel products after the end of its product life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diverse properties and a wide range of applications\n\n## Infinite potential\n\nDue to diverse advantages such as strength and easiness to work, steel has been used in a wide range of applications and deserves recognition as the most outstanding material for the infrastructure of society, a material that supports people's lives and overall economic development.\n\nSteel is close to us and we cannot live without steel products. Steel is for here for all of us now and will be with us in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diverse properties that support a wide range of applications\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Strength    | Weldability          | Heat resistance     |\n|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Toughness   | Paintability         | Cold resistance     |\n| Robustness  | Magnetism            |                     |\n| Workability | Corrosion resistance | Weather  resistance |\n\nSteel is a material with great potential due, in part, to its having a much higher theoretical strength than other materials.\n\nIn addition to adjusting carbon and other content to give a certain steel product specific desired characteristics, steel's properties can be finely controlled to meet function and performance requirements, including requirements that did not exist in the past. We do this by controlling the combination of its temperature and rolling at the manufacturing stage or by adding alloys. Further development in steel and its usage will push the potential horizon further outward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*1 Gigapascal (GPa) is a unit to measure tensile strength. Giga denotes a factor of one billion (10 9 ). *2 Theoretical strength is said to be 1/5 to 1/7.5 of the modulus of rigidity. The above data uses 1/7.5.\n\nSome materials have low environmental impact in use but may have high environmental impact in the overall life cycle.\n\n## The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is therefore important.\n\nLCA-based assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nComparing product materials...\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on the public data of WorldAutoSteel\n\n## Steel's environmental impact in production is extremely lower than other materials , some of which are lighter than steel.\n\nNote: Moreover, high-tensile steel is about 25% lighter than conventional steel and has a lower environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoing forward, with the aim to further reduce environmental impact on climate change, Nippon Steel will make development toward carbon neutrality in steelmaking process.\n\n## Let's consider the overall life cycle\n\nThe Life Cycle Assessment method (LCA) is a way of thinking to evaluate environmental impact of a product over its entire life cycle. While many aspects of environmental impact cannot be seen, the LCA is an attempt to visualize the impact over the life cycle of a product, from production of its raw material to use, disposal and recycling of the end product.\n\nFrom the LCA perspective, steel's environmental impact can be said to be very low relative to other materials. In order to continue to supply steel as a sustainable material, while taking advantage of its excellent LCA characteristics, we aim to realize zero-carbon steel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental impacts of steel made via the BF and EAF routes, using an LCA approach\n\nThe blast furnace (BF) route to reduce iron ore to make steel may appear to generate a higher environmental impact than the method that melts steel scrap in an electric arc furnace (EAF) to make steel. However, the BF route creates steel products that generate scrap that, through recycling, has an effect of CO2 emission reduction. As that scrap recycling effect offsets the CO2 emissions in the BF process, environmental impacts of the BF and EAF routes in total terms are the same as steel is repeatedly recycled.\n\nThis approach is recognized in the ISO 20915 and the JIS Q 20915 and is becoming a global standard.\n\n## Acquisition of the 'Eco-Leaf' environmental label\n\nNippon Steel has obtained the 'Eco-Leaf' - an ecolabel certified by the Sustainable Management Promotion Organization (SuMPO), in compliance with the ISO 14025 international standards, for 15 of its products.\n\nThe Eco-Leaf is an EPD* 3 certification program in use in Japan to disclose quantitative environmental information about the entire life cycle of a product, from resource mining and manufacturing to disposal and recycling. This allows customers to assess the environmental impact of the products they use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *3  EPD (Environment Product Declaration): The type III environmental label specified in the ISO 14025 international standard, which is designed to disclose quantitative environmental data certified by a third-party organization.",

At the same time, aggressive investments will be made to upgrade the remaining facilities for achieving higher productivity and cost competitiveness, and to improve the capacity and quality of strategic products and add more value to them. These investments will be compliant with our program for production facility structural improvements.\n\n## Business investments\n\nIn promotion of definite capacity expansion of AM/NS/India and in preparation for potential acquisition of, or equity participation (brownfield investment) in integrated steel mills in China or ASEAN, business investments over the next five years are expected to be around \u00a5600 billion. These investments will be made toward establishing a global crude steel capacity of 100 million tons.\n\n## Profit and financial targets, and shareholder return (FY2025)\n\n## Profit targets\n\nThe targets for fiscal 2025 are ROS (Return on Sales) of around 10% and ROE (Return on Equity) of around 10%. In the main steelmaking business, we assume that the production and shipment volume will be lower than the present levels, but we plan to increase total marginal profit. We will do this by improving average marginal profit and by making our order mix more sophisticated and improving long-term contract prices and variable cost controls. Fixed costs were drastically reduced in fiscal 2020 by implementing fixed cost reduction measures, including the effects of the production facility structural reform, despite an expected increase in depreciation costs due to investment to renew facilities and to strengthen strategic product offerings. We intend to maintain restraint on fixed cost and both improve the breakeven point and increase profits even if and when production and shipment volume declines.\n\nAs for our steelmaking group companies, efforts have been made to 1) expand profits from their overseas\n\n## Financial soundness\n\nWe aim to acquire and secure sufficient financial strength (an A rating by international credit rating) as will be necessary for our large-scale investment in zero-carbon steel-related equipment and other key areas which is scheduled to start in fiscal 2025. Our goal for fiscal 2025 is to maintain the D/E at 0.7 or lower - the level at the start of the Medium- to Long-term Management Plan (March 2021) -\n\noperations, 2) strengthen competitiveness and profitability in their domestic Group companies, 3) deepen alliances and strengthen the management base, 4) enhance profitability of the overall Group and Nippon Steel's products business units and 5) optimize the group structure by 'selecting and concentrating,' with the aim to increase profits.\n\nEach of the non-steel segments is also making the following efforts to increase profits:\n\n- Engineering and Construction: Expand its stable earnings base in operation and maintenance business, and strengthen the engineering procurement and construction (EPC) business in areas such as renewable energy infrastructure development and renewal.\n- Chemicals and Materials: Concentrate resources in the electronic materials field and expand doing business in key products.\n- System solutions: Focus on the DX business area and continually grow business.\n\neven in the case of a worsening business environment. With regard to shareholder return, we will maintain our current dividend distribution policy based on the allocation of profits in accordance with operating and financial performance, and by taking into account funds needed to invest for improving corporate value, performance forecasts, consolidated financial position, and other factors.",

        "page_content": "## Potential risks and opportunities in the steel market\n\nIn Japan steel demand is expected to continue declining, along with a declining population and overseas expanding production. Worldwide demand for steel, however, is expected to continue growing steadily, particularly in the Asian region including India.\n\nDemand will continue to grow for high-grade steel as it is the kind of product that helps solve social challenges, such as the challenge of ensuring the satisfaction of conditions for the realization of a carbon-neutral society.\n\n## The world's steel demand keeps increasing, mainly in emerging countries\n\n## Steel production is indispensable in 'leaving no one behind' and realizing an affluent world\n\nSteel products that have been manufactured have been stocked in society in the form of end products, such as in infrastructure (i.e., buildings and bridges), industrial equipment in plants or vessels, and consumer durables (i.e., vehicles and consumer electronics). The aggregate present steel stock per capita is about 4 tons for the world, and about 8 - 12 tons in developed countries. The level of per-capita steel stock can be said as a barometer of an affluent, safe, reliable life. The amount per capita is expected to reach 10 tons in China within the first half of the 21st century and in India by the end of the century.\n\nLet's make an estimate. Assuming a global population growth (from approx.  7.4 billion in 2015 to 9.8 billion in 2050), economic growth mainly in emerging countries,\n\n## Demand growth in emerging countries\n\nSteel demand for each country or region changes along with economic growth. At the initial stage of economic development, construction demand for infrastructure facilities is robust and industrialization boosts steel demand from the manufacturing industry. In export-oriented countries that ship large quantities of manufactured goods, demand for indirect exports increases and steel demand per capita remains at a high level. In the case of Japan, the annual steel demand per capita increased to approx. 800kg during the high-growth period when infrastructure was being actively built, and since then has been at around 500kg. In South Korea, where the manufacturing industry's export ratio is high, the same steel demand is as high as 1,000kg. China has already reached 500kg, while the U.S. and European countries have declined\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimplementation of SDG initiatives, and 7 tons in steel stock required per capita in the world, the world's crude steel output that satisfies such demand can be estimated to be approx. 2.7 billion tons per year in 2050. An increase of this\n\nmagnitude cannot be satisfied by steelmaking that uses recycled steel scrap and about 1.4 billion tons of steel per year is estimated to be made from iron ore using the blast furnace and other methods even in 2050.\n\n## Steel stock per capita\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: 'Sustainable steel: at the core of a green economy', World Steel Association, 2012\n\nto about 300kg, along with a decline in the ratio of the manufacturing industry in the overall economy.\n\nIn ASEAN countries, India, and other emerging countries, the annual steel demand per capita is about 100-200kg and is expected to increase. Along with population growth, a significant growth in steel demand can be anticipated.\n\nIn 2020, steel demand has decreased in various countries due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly in emerging countries, it may take time before a recovery as their currency depreciation depressed their purchasing power and lower oil prices deteriorated the economy of resource-rich countries. Nevertheless, even with a delay, steel demand in emerging countries is expected to return to a growth path over the long term.\n\n## Steel demand per capita (kg/person, year)\n\n(Source: World Steel Association) Equivalent to crude steel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Japan where demand is shrinking, we have maintained our domestic production capacity by raising our export ratio. However, it is now necessary to assume that the current business model will be difficult to sustain because competition in the overseas market is expected to intensify, mainly as demand in China, which represents 60% of the world's steel production, seems to have already peaked, while we are entering a period which will require our main steelworks to provide large-scale investments for renewal of their aging facilities.\n\n## Japan's steel market anticipates a gradual decline\n\n## Domestic demand\n\nJapan's annual crude steel production passed 100 million tons for the first time in 1973 and has been in a range of 100-110 million tons up to now. Domestic steel demand peaked at around 90 million tons per year during the bubble period and has since been on a downtrend due to a fall in demand for civil engineering and construction after the bubble burst, manufacturers' overseas shift in production mainly in the strong-yen period after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, and other factors. A decline in domestic demand has been offset by an increase in exports of steel products, thereby maintaining steel production at above 100 million tons.\n\nAbout 100 million tons of steel products produced per year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n73\n\n81\n\n89\n\n77\n\n85\n\n93\n\n99\n\n11\n\n05\n\n17\n\n75\n\n83\n\n91\n\n97\n\n09\n\n03\n\n15\n\n79\n\n87\n\n95\n\n01\n\n13\n\n07\n\n## Increasing difficulty to export\n\nDirect exports of steel products are expected to be difficult in the future, due to intensifying competition with overseas emerging steelmakers and the ongoing trend of 'local production and local consumption' and 'favoring domestic production.' The trend may accelerate, driven by the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. On the back of\n\nswift recovery (as of this writing) from the COVID-19 impact, Chinese major steelmakers are expected to expand their predominance and make the market more competitive. The supply chain disruption, caused by the COVID-19, may also speed up the above trend.\n\n## The high-grade steel market is promising with potential growth in quality and quantity\n\nHigh-grade steel products are products which make use of various properties and limitless potential of steel, are designed to meet various specifications for steel quality, depending on the needs of customers, demonstrate superb functionality in use, and contribute to value creation of end products. Prime examples are Eco Products TM , which contribute to preservation of resources and energy and reduction in environmental impact, and products that\n\nprovide solutions for national resilience, contributing to the creation of safe, reliable infrastructure, resilient in disasters. In the changing social, industrial structure and progress in SDG initiatives in the world, properties required for materials are more diversified and advanced, and demand for those high-grade steel products is anticipated to increase both in quality and quantity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin Japan can be roughly broken down to 20 million tons for the domestic civil engineering and construction sector, 40 million tons for the domestic manufacturing industry, and 40 million tons for direct exports. Roughly half of 40 million tons for the domestic manufacturing industry, or 20 million tons, are exported in the form of vehicles, machinery, and other end products made of steel, hence equivalent to indirect exports.\n\nThere is a concern that Japan's declining and aging population is likely to depress or reduce domestic steel demand for the domestic civil engineering and construction sector and the manufacturing industry.\n\n<!-- image -->",

innovation in the steel manufacturing process, we are contributing to the realization of a carbon neutral society by providing high-function steel products (Eco-Products) that help customers save energy and reduce CO2 emissions when using final products. Specifically, we will provide high-performance electrical steel sheets for drive motors as well as ultra-high-tensile steel plates for lighter body weight of electric vehicles, to achieve significant CO2 reduction effects when our products are used as manufactured products.\n\nAs measures to improve the capacity and quality of electrical steel sheets, we have decided to invest over 100 billion yen in total in the Kyushu Works Yawata Area and Setouchi Works Hirohata Area. In addition, in response to the growing demand for ultra-high-tensile steel sheets that achieve lighter weight and higher strength in automobiles, we have also begun to establish a new-generation hot-rolling mill in the Nagoya Works. We will continue to expand our capacity to develop and supply high-function products that meet the needs in the future carbon-neutral society. P.82\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to the global value chain (Eco Solutions)\n\nThe Japanese steel industry, including Nippon Steel, contributes to reducing CO2 emissions on a global scale by transferring Japan's excellent energy-saving technology overseas. Specifically, we are promoting bilateral energy conservation and environmental international cooperation with India and countries in Southeast Asia, through three ways: public-private partnership meetings; technologies customized\n\nlist; and assessment of steelworks on their status of energy saving. Noteworthy is the technology transfer for the Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) equipment; use of this equipment has a significant effect on reducing CO2 emissions. The transfer was made by Nippon Steel Engineering Co. of the Nippon Steel Group, contributing to CO2 emission reduction of approximately 22.96 million tons globally by fiscal 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Adaptation to climate change\n\nIn addition to taking mitigation actions against climate change, Nippon Steel is making initiatives to prepare and adapt to potential impacts of such change. We have many products that are used for a long time as construction material for embankments and other public infrastructure. They contribute to providing solutions for 'National Resilience,' such as protecting towns from flooding or high tides caused by heavy rains or typhoons. Adaptation to\n\nclimate changes also leads to business opportunities for Nippon Steel. In various steelworks in Japan and overseas, water storage tanks have been installed and an administration office is built on a piloti structure, which allows to create an open space with no walls on the lowest floor and makes the building less vulnerable to tsunami. This is a part of efforts of Nippon Steel to be well prepared for emergencies such as flooding and high waves.\n\n## Use of by-products and waste in CO2 reduction\n\n## Waste plastics\n\nUsing coke ovens at seven areas of Nippon Steel's five steelworks, about 200,000 tons of used plastic containers and packaging collected from general households nationwide are recycled 100%, in compliance with the Act for Promotion of Use of Recycled Resources. This contributes to reduction of about 600,000 tons of CO2 a year. In the future, we will consider further expanding the use of waste plastics.\n\n## Blast furnace cement\n\nUse of blast furnace slag in production of cement enables us to reduce use of limestone and fuel, contributing to reduction of 320 kg in CO2 emission per one ton of cement (40% reduction compared to ordinary cement production).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Blue carbon\n\nNippon Steel has promoted scientific analysis on usefulness and safety of use of steel slag - a by-product from the steelmaking process. To improve this technology, we began a basic study on blue carbon (CO2 absorption and fixation in the marine ecosystem), which is getting more attention as\n\na measure against climate change.  Nippon Steel's approach is to use our own large water tank (sea laboratory), to develop methods for creating tidal flats, shallow bottoms, seaweed beds, etc. by utilizing steel slag, and improve the environment in coastal areas. We started by aggregating basic data in order to find out how much CO2 can be fixated.\n\nLarge water tank Sea Laboratory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information disclosure according to recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\n- Medium- to long-term growth in global steel demand is projected, largely influenced by population growth and economic growth in emerging countries, according to the Long-Term Vision for Climate Change Mitigation published by the Japan Iron and Steel Federation in 2018. Since scrap alone cannot meet all steel demand, pig iron production in the blast furnace route is expected to increase (from 1.22 billion tons in 2015 to 1.40 billion tons in 2050).\n- As companies are increasingly required to respond to climate changes and to disclose related information, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly interested in the steel industry's response to risks, such as (1) potential significant reduction in CO2 emissions; (2) changing trends of steel users, including the automobile sector (i.e., increase in electric vehicles, shift to lightweight materials); and (3) adoption of carbon pricing that leads to an increase in operating cost.\n- Upon identifying our potential risks and opportunities driven by climate change and considering their significance to our current business strategies, we made scenario analysis for a long-term span to 2050, while referring to the two scenarios (below 2\u00b0C warming scenario and 4\u00b0C warming scenario* 1 ) of the International Energy Agency (IEA), so as to utilize them for devising our future business strategies.\n- In addition, we have formulated a new climate change countermeasure vision with the aim of achieving 'carbon neutral in 2050' consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario, and have decided to tackle development of breakthrough technologies aimed at zero-carbon steel as a top management challenge.\n- *1 The below 2\u00b0C warming scenario is a case wherein much-needed measures will be implemented to keep global average temperature increase below 2\u00b0C (1.75\u00b0C) compared to pre-Industrial Revolution times.\n- The 4\u00b0C warming scenario is a case that global average temperature will increase by 4 degrees, without taking any economic or additional measures against climate change.\n\n## TCFD scenario analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Factor Events Transition factor 1 Advance in electric                                                                             | Estimates for 2050* 2 EVs: 911mn units                                                      |                                                                                                  | Impact to Nippon Steel  Potential decline in the ratio of  powertrain-related steel demand,                                                                                                                                                                                                | Nippon Steel's strategy  Capturing growing demand by providing  high-performance steel products                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Transition factor 2 Shift to other lightweight materials, prompted by tighter fuel efficiency regulations, etc. (multi materials) | Shift to other lightweight materials, prompted by tighter fuel efficiency regulations, etc. | Opportunities in  demand growth  of high-strength  steel; capturing  demand for other  materials | Switch to other lightweight materials is  possible but should not be significant as  steel remains superior in environmental  impact from the LCA viewpoint.

Our domestic steelworks are positioned as mother mills which play a core role in our global steelmaking business strategy and we aim to establish an optimal production system which enables us to efficiently produce top-class products.\n\nWe are also strengthening our Group management in order to improve consolidated business profitability and maximize corporate value.\n\n## Restructuring of domestic steelmaking business and early recovery in profitability\n\nAt the time when steel demand is expected to decrease in Japan while competition in overseas markets intensifies, we are approaching a time when our main steelworks' aging facilities require large-scale, renewal investment. This equation would make it difficult for us to continue the current business model of 'maintaining the scale of domestic production and offsetting shrinking domestic demand by boosting exports.'\n\nResponding to such circumstances, we are vigorously promoting the strengthening of the domestic steelmaking business with emphases based on three key strategies: 1) concentrated production of strategically selected products and\n\nequipment; 2) shift to a more sophisticated order mix by actively investing in strategic products; and 3) renewal and improvement of facilities to ensure that technological capabilities are linked to profits, as we aim to establish an optimal production system in which domestic steelworks, as mother mills, produce top-grade products and play a core role in our global steelmaking business strategy. We will thus reestablish cost competitiveness that surpass our competitors, secure proper margins', and strengthen the profit base of our domestic steelmaking business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Concentrated production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNippon Steel's production facility structural measures aim at concentrating production in competitive facilities while shutting down less-competitive ones, in order to make the production framework to be streamlined and more efficient. Our plan is to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCrude steel\n\nproduction capacity\n\n## Down 10 million tons/year or approx. 20%\n\n## 50 to 40 million tons/year\n\n(non-consolidated + Nippon Steel Stainless)\n\nreduce the number of blast furnaces from 15 to 10, reduce domestic crude steel production capacity by about 20%, realize the cost reduction impact of \u00a5150 billion per year, mainly in fixed costs, and improve labor productivity.\n\nCost reduction impact\n\nLabor productivity improvement\n\n## Down 20% or more in personnel\n\nFY2021-2025\n\nStructural measures and DX measures for the rationalization of staffing (Nippon Steel and outsourcing cooperative companies)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shift to a more sophisticated order mix\n\nWe are investing to improve the capacity and quality of strategic products. We intend to improve average marginal profit by raising the ratio of higher-value-added products and reducing the ratio of commodity-grade products along with the streamlining of production capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewal and improvement of facilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are making selective investment in competitive facilities to improve productivity and cost, and realize a production framework that allows us to steadily supply value-added-products, ensuring our technologies are utilized to generate profit.\n\n## Further improvement in the breakeven point\n\nBy building an optimal production system, we are favorably repositioning the breakeven point and establishing a profit base that ensures profitability regardless of production volume. After drastic compression in fiscal 2020, fixed cost has been reduced (see P 86). We will maintain it at a low level, with a contribution by the impacts of reduced fixed costs through the production facility structural measures and other efforts. These positive impacts are expected to more than offset an increase in depreciation expenses, stemming from measures to improve the\n\ncapacity and quality of strategic products and capital investment for facility improvement.\n\nIn addition to improving the average marginal profit through a shift to a more sophisticated order mix, we will continue to improve variable costs and contract prices, thereby further improving the average marginal profit. We ultimately aim at further improving the breakeven point that we had drastically reduced in fiscal 2020, and strengthening the profit base of our domestic steelmaking business.\n\nImprovement in the breakeven point by FY2025\n\n<!-- image -->",

They include the structural measures announced in February 2020 and the additional ones included in the Medium to Long-term Management Plan announced in March 2021.\n\n## 1. Product manufacturing process\n\nWith the aim of strengthening the business and making an optimal, more efficient production system, some production lines are being shut down, and production is being concentrated in lines that are more competitive or closer to centers of demand. We will withdraw from certain products in light of their medium- to long-term demand trends.\n\n## 2. Upstream steelmaking process\n\nWith the aim of increasing competitiveness in the integrated steelmaking process, all facilities at the Setouchi Works Kure Area and the No. 1 blast furnace and related facilities at the Kansai Works Wakayama Area were shut down by taking into account each steelworks' competitiveness in terms of integrated production/shipment capacity, cost, product strength, and other factors.\n\nThe No. 3 blast furnace and related facilities at the East Nippon Works Kashima Area, as well as the No. 1 continuous casting machine at the Kimitsu Area of the same works will be shut down by taking into account the overall situation including company-wide upstream steelmaking balance and the integrated production/shipment capacity, and cost of the areas where the product manufacturing lines are to be shut down.\n\n## Overview of the production facility structural measures\n\n|                       | Steelworks

Demand growth is of growing importance in connection with efforts to realize a carbon-neutral society. These high-end steel products are identified as 'strategic products' and we will vigorously invest in facilities to improve their production capacity and quality.\n\n## 1) Strategic investment in a next-generation hot strip mill at the Nagoya Works\n\nIn the automotive industry, where global environmental regulations are showing a trend of tightening and where collision safety standards are becoming more stringent, demand for high-performance materials is expected to further grow in response to the need for lighter, stronger vehicle bodies. For the foreseeable future, demand for electric and hybrid vehicles will have high growth potential, creating need to\n\nreduce vehicle weight and increase body strength, particularly because of problems concerning mileage and battery weight. In strategic response to these needs, we will establish a nextgeneration hot strip mill as a means of fundamentally strengthening our production system for ultra-high-tensile steel sheets and other high-grade products at the Nagoya Works - our core base for manufacturing automotive steel sheets.\n\n(The existing hot strip mill to be shut down after the blowing-in of the new mill)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2) Strengthening the manufacturing system of high-end electrical steel sheets\n\nAs the world is rapidly moving toward decarbonization, regulations concerning energy efficiency of transformers have been tightened in a number of countries. With regard to grain-oriented (GO) electrical steel sheets used in the iron core of transformers, the need for higher-grade materials with less energy loss is anticipated to further increase. In the meantime, demand for high-efficiency high-grade non-oriented (NO) electrical steel sheets used in the iron core of electric vehicles (EVs) is also expected to dramatically increase, driven by accelerated growth in demand for EVs, along with the stricter\n\nregulations for CO2 emissions and average fuel consumption for vehicles.\n\nWe decided to improve the capacity and quality of electrical steel sheets at the Setouchi Works Hirohata Area and the Kyushu Works Yawata Area before November 2020, and have been working to make these changes fully effective by the first half of fiscal 2023. An additional capacity increase measure has been decided for the Setouchi Works Hirohata Area, in order to quickly respond to growing needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewal and improvement of facilities\n\nThe facilities will be renewed and improved by selectively investing in competitive facilities, including using funds to improve the capacity and quality of strategic products.\n\n|                     | Steelworks                                      | Facility                                                            | Start-up           |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Blast  furnace (BF) | Muroran Works (Hokkai Iron & Coke) Nagoya Works | #2 BF relining #3 BF relining                                       | Nov. 2020  1H 2022 |\n|                     | East Nippon Works Kashima Area                  | #2E CO capacity increase                                            | May 2018           |\n|                     | East Nippon Works Kimitsu Area                  | #5 CO refurbishment                                                 | Feb. 2019          |\n| Coke oven  (CO)     | Muroran Works (Hokkai Iron & Coke)              | #5 West CO refurbishment                                            | Sep. 2019          |\n| Nagoya Works        |                                                 | #3 CO refurbishment 1H 2021                                         |                    |\n|                     | Kyushu Works Yawata Area                        | Construction of #3 continuous caster                                | May 2019           |\n|                     | East Nippon Works Kashima Area                  | Installment of #6 hot-dip galvanizing line                          | Jan. 2021          |\n|                     | Setouchi Works Hirohata Area                    | Construction of an electric arc furnace                             | 1H 2022            |\n| Other               | Nagoya Works                                    | Installment of a next-generation hot strip mill                     | 1Q 2026            |\n|                     | Kyushu Works Yawata Area                        |                                                                     | 1H 2023 to 1H 2024 |\n|                     |                                                 | Improvement of the capacity and quality of  electrical steel sheets | 1H 2023 to 1H 2024 |\n\nWe will continue to work at well-timed and accurate assessment and analysis of demand trends and other factors in order to establish an optimal production system and will develop further measures, if needed.\n\n## Strengthening Group Management\n\nIn order to improve consolidated business profitability and maximize corporate value, we are working on 1) strengthening the competitiveness and profitability of each Group company, 2) optimizing the structure of the Group by selecting and concentrating businesses, and 3) deepening collaboration among the Company and the Group companies, as well as improving and enhancing the management infrastructure.\n\nAs for Group companies in steelmaking, we will continue to further clarify the mission of each company, enhance their profitability consistent with the Company's business divisions of each product type, and 'select and concentrate' Group companies in consideration of sustainability, among other factors.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Business and the Chemical & Materials Business implement measures that are closely aligned with the various measures of the steelmaking business, and will expand profits based on the 'selection and concentration' of each company's individual business.

We have developed our business mainly in Asia (especially China, the ASEAN countries and India), whose market size and growth rate are relatively large globally, and we are well positioned to profit from the scale and growth of this market.\n\nIn order to further improve our profitability in this environment, we will maintain our traditional business of exporting steel products, mainly high-grade steel, and supplying by overseas\n\n## Toward global crude steel capacity of 100 million tons\n\n## As of March 31, 2021\n\n## Long-term vision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimple sum of crude steel production at full capacity* (million tons/year)\n\n## World Steel Demand (billion tons/year)\n\n## Steel demand forecast (million tons/year)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAM/NS India Capacity expansion (including a second steel mill)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAcquisition of and equity participation in integrated steel mills in Asia, mainly in ASEAN and China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*  Simple sum of crude steel production at full capacity of 1) companies with a 30% or more stake (including USIMINAS) subject to World Steel Association's crude steel production statistics; and 2) an equity method affiliate with less than 30% stake, to which Nippon Steel plays a significant role in supply of materials (AGIS)\n\ncompanies in charge of producing predominantly cold-rolled and plating products, and will move toward a full-scale overseas business that enables local demand to be captured in its entirety and provides added value to our products.\n\nThe Nippon Steel Group aims to achieve 100 million tons of global crude steel capacity per annum, which is our vision, by capturing demand in growth markets through the sale of products from our strong domestic mother mills and local mills overseas.\n\nAM/NS India\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Specific measures\n\n## 1 Measures toward global crude steel capacity of 100 million tons\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Nippon Steel Group is expanding its integrated steelmaking facilities starting from the upstream processes, mainly in the Asian region, including India and ASEAN, where demand is growing, and China, which is the world's largest market. We aim to expand our overseas crude steel\n\nproduction capacity from the current 16 million tons per year to over 50 million tons per year in the long term and to achieve a global crude steel production capacity of 100 million tons per year, with domestic crude steel capacity of over 40 million tons per year.\n\n## 1. India\n\nThe population of India is currently about 1.3 billion, and is expected to continue to grow, surpassing China in about a decade, and becoming the world's largest population. On the other hand, India's annual steel consumption is currently around 70kg per person per year, and is at a low level compared to industrialized countries such as Japan and China (about 500kg per person per year), the United States and developed countries in Europe (about 300kg), ASEAN countries (about 130kg), and Brazil (about 100kg). In the future, with the progress of industrialization and urbanization, demand for steel materials per person is expected to increase in India, and especially to increase for infrastructure. Due to the synergy between the increase in steel demand per person and the increase in the population, steel demand is expected to increase steadily over the long term.\n\nIndia's government, under its 'Make in India' policy, is resolutely protecting India's steel industry as a key industry, while India's steel market has had a high domestic production rate and has a structure in which Indian insiders enjoy the growth in demand. On the other hand, new integrated steelworks are unlikely to be rapidly constructed in the near\n\n## 2. ASEAN and China\n\nIn ASEAN, where demand is expected to continue growing, and China, which is the world's largest market, we will consider acquisition of, and equity participation (brownfield investment) in integrated steel mills, in order to maintain a\n\nfuture because of restrictions in acquisition and utilization of industrial sites. India's steel market had been fragmented with low concentration in top-tier companies and little progress in industry consolidation. However, since 2016 when the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code entered into force, a largescale industry consolidation process has started. Going forward, further concentration into top-tier makers is expected, together with a possibility for a more stable market.\n\nThe Indian steel market is thus anticipating market expansion and tighter supply and demand. In December 2020, we acquired Essar Steel, one of the major four steelmakers in India, jointly with ArcelorMittal, and began operating it as AM/ NS India, an equal partnership of both Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal.\n\nIn line with the growth of the Indian steel market, we plan to expand our capacity, with AM/NS India as a core. In addition to expand the capacity of the acquired Hazira steel mill on the west coast of India from 7 million tons to over 14 million tons, we are considering capacity expansion, including the construction of a second steel mill on the east coast.\n\nsupply/demand balance in the market where excess capacity in crude steel production demands attention. Also needed is to avoid the risks associated with a new launch.\n\n## Measures to enhance profitability of the existing businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith regard to existing overseas businesses, we have concentrated operations, and narrowed our focus to certain businesses, as we have almost completed the reorganization of our overseas tinplate business and our withdrawal from VSB and other businesses which would not be economically viable for us to continue.

To produce steel products, oxygen must be removed (= reduced) from iron ore. Starting from Tatara steelmaking in the ancient times of Japan, the process using the blast furnace (BF) and the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which removes oxygen from iron oxide by carbon (charcoal, coal), has been used. Within a gigantic BF, a chemical reaction called reduction occurs, and steel is continually and efficiently produced from iron ore.\n\nAt present, the use of carbon (coal) is the best, stable, cost-effective method for reducing iron ore in large quantities. The reaction, however, emits CO2 as carbon removes the oxygen in the iron ore.\n\nAs the major share of CO2 emissions in the steelmaking process is derived from the iron ore reduction process in the BF, the reducing agent needs to be reconsidered in order to drastically reduce CO2 emissions in steelmaking.\n\nSteelmaking can also be done by a process using the electric arc furnace (EAF) with steel scrap as raw material. As steel scrap is already reduced, this method enables less CO2 emission in steelmaking but has its own shortcomings: difficulty in making larger facilities, which make it less suitable for large-scale mass production; limited supply of scrap at present; and difficulty in making high-grade steel due to impurities contained in scrap.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BF + BOF process\n\n- A stable, cost-effective, efficient steelmaking method for large quantities\n- Ample resources of raw material (iron ore)\n- Manufacturing of high-grade steel with little impurities\n- Inevitable generation of CO2 caused by use of carbon as reducing agent\n\n## EAF process\n\n- Difficulty in making larger facilities, which make it less suitable for large-scale mass production\n- Limited supply of scrap as raw material\n- Difficulty in making high-grade steel due to impurities contained in scrap\n- Low CO2 emissions due to use of already-reduced steel scrap as raw material",

We seek to make a larger EAF, raise efficiency in production, and use carbon- free electric power, in order to further reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nIn the BF + BOF route, the existing BF is partially retrofit for the COURSE50 project and further advanced for the Super COURSE50 project.In these furnaces, the reducing agent is replaced, by some of the coking coal (coke) being substituted by hydrogen. This produces H2O and hence reduces the amount of CO2 emissions.\n\nMoreover, in either of the routes, direct-reduced iron (DRI),\n\n## Zero carbon steel production process\n\nmanufactured by the direct reduction process by 100% hydrogen, is partially used as raw material, with the aim of further CO2 emission reduction.\n\nIn summary, we will thus take up three challenges to develop breakthrough technologies: 1 high-grade steel production in large-sized EAFs; 2 COURSE50 BF and Super-COURSE50 BF projects; and 3 100% hydrogen use in the direct reduction process. CO2, which is still emitted after these processes, is to be offset by CCUS to ultimately achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nIn order to realize this plan, supply of carbon-free electric power and hydrogen are indispensable.\n\nThree breakthrough technologies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThree external conditions required to achieve zero carbon steel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncombine two steelmaking routes, utilizing their respective features: the blast furnace (BF) and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) route together, and the electric arc furnace (EAF) route. Either route, however, has its own big challenges.\n\n## Challenge\n\n## high-grade steel production in large-sized EAFs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe EAF steelmaking uses steel scrap, which enables reduction in CO2 emissions during steel production. However, there are many challenges in the production of high-grade steel by EAFs and in large-scale mass production.\n\nFirst of all, copper and other impurities in scrap and nitrogen contamination during melting affect the quality of steel, thereby limiting the product types and making it difficult to manufacture high-grade steel that satisfies user requirements for weight reduction and strength.\n\nIn addition, in the EAF route, the initial melting of scrap and other cold iron sources as well as refining with natural convection in an EAF take a long time, hence, the result is less productivity compared to the use of a BOF in which strong agitation occurs by an oxygen gas jet. This problem\n\n## Challenge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwill be more pronounced in larger-scale EAFs.\n\nThat is why the current average annual production capacity of the EAF route is approximately 0.7 million tons per unit, far less than the BF + BOF route of approximately 4.0 million tons. Moreover, the melting of DRI is expected to decrease production efficiency due to the deterioration of heat transfer, melting time, and refining load, caused by a large amount of gangue and voids in DRI.\n\nIn summary, the production of high-grade steel, which uses a certain amount of DRI in an EAF, especially large-scale EAFs, has many challenges in terms of quality and productivity. We will take up the challenge of establishing the technology to eliminate hazardous impurities and to improve productivity with a larger-scale, higher-efficiency EAF.\n\n## Hydrogen injection into BF (COURSE50 and Super COURSE50 projects)\n\nSince hydrogen reduction is achieved by reducing iron ore by use of hydrogen rather than by conventional carbon (coal), the reduction process produces H2O with no CO2 emission. We are therefore taking up the challenge of reducing CO2 emission by partially replacing carbon by hydrogen as the reducing agent, and switching from iron ore to direct reduced iron (DRI). This will be enabled by retrofitting existing blast furnaces (BFs) into COURSE50 and Super-COURSE50 BFs in the zero-carbon steel production process.\n\nAs mentioned previously, a blast furnace is an ultralarge chemical reactor that continuously and efficiently produces iron from iron ore. In the process, coke is 1) a\n\n## Challenge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreducing agent, 2) a source of heat, and 3) plays a role to support raw materials at high temperature in a solid state while facilitating to maintain ventilation in the furnace. However, the following issues arise as the hydrogen reduction ratio in blast furnaces increases.\n\nIn response to these issues, we will mainly work on 1) the technology to ensure maximum ventilation and control stable reduction and melting when the amount of coke in the blast furnace declines, 2) the technology to blow in a large amount of hot combustible gas into the furnace, and 3) the advancement of technology to estimate actual machine reactions when scaling up from test machines to actual machines.\n\n## 100% hydrogen use in direct reduction process\n\nIn the 100% hydrogen use in direct reduction, we target zero CO2 emissions in reduction process by fully using hydrogen as the reduction agent. Since this process produces solid direct reduced iron (DRI), it is necessary to melt it in the next process such as in the blast furnace (BF) or electric arc furnace (EAF).\n\nMost of the actual direct reduction methods currently use methane (natural gas) as the reducing agent but methane contains carbon and hence emits CO2. In contrast, the 100% hydrogen direct reduction process aims at 100% use of hydrogen as reduction agent. This method,\n\n## Development of CCUS technology\n\nCCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage) is a technology that separates, captures, and stores CO2 in the ground, or directly uses CO2 or converts it into other materials and utilizes it. In the zero-carbon steel production process, CCUS technology is used to process CO2 still generated from the steelmaking process even after it has been minimized.\n\nRealization of this technology requires the related technology development as well as preparation of external conditions. The required technologies include development and installment of\n\nhowever, has its own high technical issues, too. Since hydrogen reduction is an endothermic reaction, it is necessary to supply heat to maintain the reduction reaction. In addition, in the case of using a shaft furnace, powdering and sticking of DRI tend to occur at low temperature.\n\nWe will therefore take up the challenges of developing technologies for the stable production of DRI by direct hydrogen reduction, and operation technologies for expanding raw material sources. We will be bold in our efforts for realizing a zero-carbon steel production process.\n\nCO2 separation and recovery technology (high-performance chemical adsorption liquid) and development of CO2-based manufacturing technologies for chemicals and fuels. The necessary external conditions include the securing of the storage space needed for building the storage infrastructure for CCS, legislation, and tax incentives, the ensuring of business profitability of chemicals and fuels manufactured by CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization), and preferential treatment of carbon recycled products.",

This is our most important management challenge.\n\nIn our estimates, the needed innovations will roughly require a half trillion yen in R&D expenses and 4-5 trillion yen in capital expenditures. In such a case the production cost of crude steel may more than double the current cost even if external conditions, including the estimated prices of electric power and hydrogen, are best met in around 2050.\n\nBeside the challenges taken by the steel industry, collaboration with others in society is essential in various aspects to realize zero-carbon steel: 1) long-term and multiyear government support for R&D in the field of breakthrough innovation etc.; 2) establishment of an inexpensive, stable, large-scale hydrogen supply infrastructure; 3) action on behalf of realization of carbon free power at an international competitive cost, 4) promotion of national projects for the development and commercialization of economically-rational CCUS; 5) securing of equal-footing in international competition; and 6) building of a system for society as a whole to bear enormous cost. Facing these issues, we have been carefully\n\nexplaining our ideas to relevant ministries and experts. Through Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) and the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, in which we take a leading position, we are making various recommendations regarding Japan's climate change measures and energy policies in accordance with the Paris Agreement, at councils and committees of various ministries in Japan.\n\nInvestments needed for the zero-carbon steel project\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Three factors to increase costs for realizing zero-carbon steel\n\n- 1.

Nippon Steel is working to enhance its system for centralized management of data from each remote manufacturing site by using\n\n## Use of conventional wireless IoT sensors\n\nLPWA (low power wide area wireless communication) and cloud technology. Going forward, we will promote the application of this technology with a view to expanding it to all of our manufacturing bases and Group companies.\n\n## Platform using wireless IoT sensors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are promoting 'Cyber Physical Production (CPP)' to realize the sophistication of manufacturing by combining such elements as real time analysis of big data collected from IoT equipment, in addition to digital twins which simulate the production and equipment conditions of manufacturing sites in a digital space. We are using CPP to detect operational changes at an early stage, predict equipment aging and deterioration, and otherwise enhance our strength in maneuvering data, thereby promoting smart manufacturing to achieve advanced stability in production.\n\nCyber Physical Production (CPP)Steel works/production line\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Company-wide integrated planning and optimization of steel works and productspecific planning (Production Planning DX)\n\nWe will build an integrated production planning platform by integrating the actual production data,  efficiency results and detailed order specification information for each process accumulated by each steel works. We will use this platform to unify company-wide information and introduce an integrated production planning simulator that can accurately respond to customer orders and changes in the raw material procurement environment. With this initiative, we aim to significantly reduce the workload at each steel works through the sophistication of production planning operations and strengthen optimal production control throughout the company. We started applying the prototype in FY2021 and will proceed to implement it through agile development.\n\n## Promotion of ICT education\n\nNippon Steel defines DX human resources as 'people who can identify and solve business problems based on data.' By 2030, we will promote the development of DX human resources by promoting DX strategy and providing ICT education as well as learning of various skills to all office staff and engineers. Of particular importance is the development of data scientists who can make advanced use of data in their work and who can plan and implement innovations. We have started data science education with the aim of training about 20% of all office staff and engineers (more than 1,000 people) as data scientists by 2025.\n\nIn addition, we will provide digital management education according to position and rank so that employees in operational divisions can promote business process innovation by acquiring management knowledge to utilize digital technologies.\n\n## DX promotion organization\n\nWith the Digital Innovation Division at the core, the operational divisions and the research and development divisions will work together to strengthen business competitiveness by promoting DX mainly through integrated responses to company-wide cross-sectional issues and data management. Furthermore, we will continue to take on the challenge of advanced initiatives in cooperation with external organizations and with the collective strength of the Nippon Steel Group, including NS Solutions Corporation and Nippon Steel Texeng Co., Ltd.\n\nWe have established the Business Innovation and DX Promotion Committee, chaired by the Executive Vice President in charge of business innovation and DX promotion. It is discussing company-wide policies and strategies and promoting related activities based on both the business innovations we have been working on and the promotion of DX.\n\n## Integrated production planning platform [production planning DX]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nD\n\na\n\nt\n\na\n\ns\n\nc\n\nie\n\nnt\n\nis\n\nt\n\nk\n\nno\n\nw\n\nle\n\ndg\n\ne\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital innovation promotion organization\n\n<!-- image -->",

Toward the way to low-carbon power generation, we will consider highly efficient use of facilities and switching to other fuel sources.\n\nNippon Steel recycles 100% of waste plastic containers and packaging that are collected from households, via a chemical recycling method using a coke oven. The collected waste amounts to approximately 0.2 million tons per year, which is equivalent to about 30% of household waste plastic containers and packaging in Japan.\n\n## Steelworks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExhaust heat, generated in the blast furnaces, sintering facilities, coke ovens, converters, and other facilities, is recovered and used in steam generation and power generation. In fiscal 2020, the volume of waste heat recovery steam decreased mainly due to shutdowns of coke ovens and related facilities stemming from a substantial production cut.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*2 Including Cooperative Thermal Power Companies and related electric furnace companies\n\n3\n\n/year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## By-product gas\n\nBy-product gases, such as coke oven gas generated when coal is thermally cracked in an oxygen-free environment in the coke manufacturing process and blast furnace gas generated from blast furnaces, are fully utilized as fuel gas for steel heating furnaces or energy sources for power generation plants on the premises of steelworks.\n\n## By-products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy-products generated in steelmaking are recycled for reuse in the same process or for commercial use. We thus promote achieving zero emission and contribute to conservation of resources and energy.\n\nNippon Steel's share in Japan's primary energy supply (FY2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: 'General Energy Statistics' by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy; Japan Iron and Steel Federation (JISF)",

Use of advanced IT in business has also been identified as an important element to enhance competitiveness.\n\n## Research & development\n\n## Top-level R&D resources among world steelmakers\n\nNippon Steel has approximately 800 researchers (nonconsolidated basis) working on steel-related projects. No other steel company in the world has such a large research staff. This human resource is allocated according to priority and each project is carried out according to a road map which sets forth milestones, goals, and returns. Five major areas of development that our research emphasizes and that foresees potential change in customer needs are 1) CO2 emissions reduction measures; 2) response to challenges of sustainability issues, such as expanded recycling; 3) development of highfunction products, and related design and processing technology; 4) innovative process development and 5) use of advanced ICT and artificial intelligence (AI). We are resolved in our determination to develop technology which can become key drivers for zero-carbon steel and other innovations, and we are also resolved to continue to lead the world in steel technology in the future.\n\n## R&D organization\n\nNippon Steel's approximately 800 R&D employees work in three core research centers - Research & Engineering Center (Futtsu in Chiba Prefecture), Amagasaki R&D Center (Amagasaki in Hyogo Prefecture), and Hasaki R&D Center (Kamisu in Ibaraki Prefecture) - as well as in the Plant Engineering and Facility Management Center (Head Office) and R&D laboratories at steelworks across Japan. They collaborate to ensure integrated R&D activities that encompass basic and fundamental research, application development and engineering.\n\nIn April 2018, a new R&D unit was established which is central to development of materials and products that respond to steel-user needs for flat product (among other products), and their corresponding advanced application technology development and solutions. We also established the Intelligent Algorithm Research Center which is engaged\n\nNippon Steel's strength\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin enhancing our research on use of advanced IT. The Nippon Steel Group's top-class researchers in this field have been assigned to this new facility, supporting a part of the DX strategy.\n\nOur R&D capabilities feature six strengths: 1) comprehensiveness , facilitated by the integration of R&D and engineering, which we call Research & Engineering (RE), and speed of development; 2) an R&D network having locations near customers; 3) integrated solutions enhanced by Group companies' products and technologies; 4) the ability to address environmental and energy-related concerns with solutions based on steelmaking process technology; 5) collaboration between industry and academic institutions, overseas alliances, and joint research with customers; and 6) an extensive portfolio of fundamental and platform technologies.\n\n## ESG Materiality 2-(2) R&D and intellectual property management\n\n## ESG Materiality 2-(2) R&D and intellectual property management\n\nCompany's global strategies.

        "page_content": "## Use of ICT\n\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) and Digital Technology are rapidly becoming indispensable in people's lives. Nippon Steel believes that they also have become a critical element that encourages business innovation and affects corporate competitiveness. We are therefore focusing on how to make best use of ICT.\n\n## Integration of ICT departments\n\nThe ICT System Planning Departments, each of which had belonged to each works, were integrated on April 1, 2021 with the objective to promote digital innovation as advocated in the management strategy, and for optimal construction, maintenance, and operation of systems. Accordingly, the AI Solution Section was established to expand and improve AI and optimization technologies, as well as advanced ICT that supports digital innovation, across Nippon Steel. The now integrated system division keeps abreast of the ever-evolving\n\nICT trend, draws a medium- to long-term road map on use of ICT, in accordance to the management strategy, and seeks for efficient ICT introduction across the Company. The Division alone has over one hundred persons involved in systems work. In addition, NS Solutions (NSSOL) - a Group company and one of Japan's top-level IT services companies - has over 10 times more staff than in Nippon Steel steelrelated divisions who are engaged in actual system development, maintenance, and management.\n\n## ICT realizes a new workstyle\n\nWe are establishing a Smart Platform, which enables us to 1) make communication anytime, anywhere, with anyone, 2) use ICT, including the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and the Self Business Intelligence (BI), to reduce to a bare minimum our employees' primary and incidental tasks at their work stations, and 3) support their intelligent work.\n\nBasic to the Smart Platform is use of mobile devices (i.e., smartphones, tablets) in all working environments. We began distribution of mobile devices to on-site workers in fiscal 2017 and have almost completed it and better and more efficient\n\nsafety checks have become possible. The instant input and output of actual site/product information is leading to greater assurance of stable quality and stable operation and at the same time raise yield and productivity by preventing trouble. Moreover, using the on-site workers' feedback and suggestions on new ways of using the devices, smarter production sites are being created. At Muroran Works, we have started verification of a self-operated wireless network, in anticipation of adopting local 5G communication.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlatform\n\nIn the case of distributing mobile devices to office staff and engineers, in addition to on-site workers, we are accelerating efforts to complete it in the head office within the current fiscal 2021 and at all steelworks by early fiscal 2022. We are thus promoting efficient operation by use of telework as a new workstyle and for enhanced functionality. As an internal network, based on the Zero Trust concept has already been set up, in addition to expanded adoption of web conferences and electronic contract and enhanced workflow systems, we were able to smoothly introduce working at home after the COVID-19 outbreak and have since been seamlessly continuing business.\n\nGoing forward, we intend to create an integrated data platform for collection and management of data, which is a key to digital innovation. Our goal is to enable all employees to\n\nperform their 'strength in connecting,' and 'strength in maneuvering' data at best. We are establishing an environment where all our employees can access information needed accurately at the right time. NS-DIG TM , a platform for comprehensive data analysis, will also be introduced to support intelligent production. In addition, KAMONOHASHI TM , NSSOL's AI development tool, will be adopted so that even our Citizen data scientists who are not system experts can develop AI models. Further, AIRON-EDGE TM , a base of edge computing, will facilitate easy adoption of AI models at worksites, by use of the container technology. These platforms will allow us to realize digital innovation at an early stage. We are hence promoting efficient development, use, and optimization of the information systems across the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity is becoming ever more important in the new workstyle using ICT: Information is exchanged in all different forms, in all kinds of situations and fields. As teleworking becomes a part of normal business life, mobile devices can all too easily create a torrential flow of data, and that data is stored and analyzed by using the cloud, we find it important to provide a reliable cybersecurity environment for all employees. We are therefore offering continuous e-learning opportunities on security, and training sessions on targeted attack e-mails, to promote employees' enhanced IT literacy and resultant sensitivity to cybersecurity. Moreover, in addition to the conventional\n\ncentralized cybersecurity measures, we are implementing the latest security measures that incorporate the Zero Trust concept to always verify security before being connected.\n\nCybersecurity of the entire Nippon Steel Group must also be ensured. The Nippon Steel Group - Computer Security Incident Response Team (NSG-CSIRT) is steadily increasing the number of member companies to 17 as of June 2021. We are also enhancing cybersecurity measures of our overseas Group companies and promoting enhanced IT literacy of overseas employees through education programs and training sessions, to ensure strong cybersecurity for the entire corporate Group.",

Based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Nippon Steel Group Conduct Code has been set. By adhering to its nine principles, Nippon Steel conducts business ethically, while paying full heed to human rights issues arising with the increasing globalization of the economy. Nippon Steel gives due attention to the rights of workers, and staunchly opposes the use of forced or child labor. These are prerequisites of our\n\n## Addressing human rights risks\n\nFrom the viewpoint of promoting human rights (HR) awareness activities by assigning human rights awareness advocates at each steelworks and each office, and of implementing corporate-wide human rights awareness activities, we hold a 'corporate-wide forum of human rights awareness advocates' in March each year to exchange views on human rights awareness education and new human rights risks, and to consider the related action policy for the next fiscal year. Based on this, we hold a 'corporate-wide forum of human rights anti-discrimination promotion' at the beginning of the fiscal year, chaired by the Executive Officer in charge of Human Resources, with the HR managers of each steelworks and each office as members. At this forum, the fiscal year's policy for promoting human rights development is determined. In addition to implementing human rights awareness activities\n\nin accordance with the policies decided at the forum, each\n\n## Prevention of forced or child labor\n\n## Compliance concerning salaries\n\nAdhering to international norms concerning forced or child labor, Nippon Steel has the policy of prevention and eradication of both types of labor. We conduct regular monitoring surveys of our Group companies to prevent such violations in our business activities.\n\nIn compliance with laws and regulation concerning salary and wages payment, Nippon Steel has set up pay at a higher level than minimum wage stipulated by the country, region, and type of work where we do business. With regard to bonuses, we regularly survey related matters, including the status of each country, region, and type of work, and hold meetings with labor representatives, to appropriately reward employees with due consideration given to business conditions and financial performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG Materiality 4-(1) Respect for human rights\n\ncorporate activities. We have also prohibited as unjust the discriminatory treatment of workers based on nationality, race, belief, creed, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability. In addition, we give careful consideration to the traditions and culture, business practice, and labor practice of each country or region as we accelerate overseas business development.\n\nBased on these basic ideas concerning respect for human rights, we strive to create a workplace environment where employees can share diverse values and maximize their abilities. We thereby seek to improve productivity, work conditions, benefits, and the working environment, with the aim to enrich the life of employees and achieve the corporate development.\n\nsteelworks and each office are actively engaged in employee awareness-raising activities, including holding workshops on a specific issue of the steelworks or office. We also participate in enlightenment organizations and activities hosted by public entities and others in each community. We do this as concerted efforts for human rights enlightenment with the communities.\n\nAlong with the group-wide expansion of our efforts to Group companies in Japan and overseas, monitoring surveys on the status of compliance with labor-related laws and regulations, the establishment of consultation contacts, and other issues are regularly conducted via a checklist on internal controls.\n\nThrough these efforts, we are continuously and systematically promoting activities to prevent human rights abuses. This includes the understanding of human rights risks that change with the times and the development of a system and a strategy to reduce the risks.\n\n## Human rights awareness education\n\nBased on the policy decided at the \"corporate-wide forum of human rights anti-discrimination promotion,\" information on human rights awareness is incorporated in training courses for all ranks, from new employees to experienced ones. We also provide education on a variety of subjects, including the issues of harassment and anti-discrimination, understanding of LGBTQ, and human rights issues in the conduct of our business.\n\n## The number of recipients of training courses by rank on human rights in fiscal 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwo-way communication with employees based on good labormanagement relations is important in order to prevent human rights abuses. We therefore incorporate education toward building sound labor management relationships in\n\n## Mechanism of corrective actions\n\nWe have clarified whom to contact for consultation on various compliance issues including human rights. This is a part of efforts to establish a groupwide claim handling mechanism that makes it easy for employees and related personnel to ask for consultation, and that enables the Company to understand and identify incidents of discrimination.\n\nSpecifically, a Compliance Consultation Room has been established to accept inquiries and reports and give counseling regarding human rights abuses such as harassment, from employees of the Company and Group companies and their families, as well as from employees of business partners reports and consultations from various stakeholders are accepted through the Inquiry Form accessible on the website. Regarding the response to these individual incidents, such as internal reports and consultations, we investigate the facts and, if necessary,\n\n## Communicating with stakeholders\n\nAdhering to laws and the group-company labor agreements, and respecting the rights to organize and to bargain, Nippon Steel strives to maintain sound labor-management relationships. With a focus on mutual understanding through two-way dialogue, we have a place for discussion with labor unions for the entire Company as well as for each steelworks and each office. We discuss the operating and financial performance, safety, health, and production management issues, working conditions such as salaries and bonus payments, balancing of work and personal life, and other issues. Close labor-management communication is also maintained, particularly concerning the actual work cases for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntraining of executives of the Company and the Group companies.\n\nIn addition to general education that contributes to the prevention of human rights abuses in workplaces, we also address specific human rights abuse risks in formulating and oversight of specific work assignments. Examples include education on fair recruitment selection by employees assigned to the tasks of hiring in order to prevent job discrimination, and education on cross-cultural understanding and communication for those assigned to overseas business in the context of preventing human rights abuses (i.e., consideration for each country's unique traditions, culture, business practices, and labormanagement practices).\n\nseek advice from outside parties, including lawyers and outside professional organizations, to protect the privacy of the persons and to ensure that they do not receive unfavorable treatment. We then provide guidance and education to those involved, and strive to appropriately resolve the incidents.\n\nFurthermore, since labor-management relations play an important role in preventing human rights abuses and resolving related incidents, in the event of disputes concerning the interpretation of collective agreements, labor-management agreements or other rules directly related to them, a grievance committee is established to resolve the dispute, based on the agreement concerning complainthandling procedures that has been concluded with the labor union. The committee comprises members from both the management and the labor side.\n\nwhich the labor unions received reports from their members. The minutes of these discussions are recorded and shared through the Intranet and other means broadly, from senior management to work union members.\n\nIn-house magazines for the entire Company as well as each steelworks and each office are regularly published as a means to send various messages to employees. PR magazines are also published to convey our business and other information outside. Our steelworks and offices also regularly set up a place for dialogue with the nearby residents' associations to ask for their understanding of our business operations and listen to opinions and requests from them; this is part of what we do to realize better communication with the local community.\n\nNumber of union members and unionized rate (March 31, 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 'Diversity & Inclusion Dept.' has been established as a dedicated unit to promote diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\n## ESG Materiality 4-(2) diversity & inclusion\n\n- Promote female employee's participation and career advancement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Realize work life balance so as to enable employees with various backgrounds and circumstances to perform at their best\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3 Develop health management in order for employees to perform at their best until the retirement age of 65\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrevent harassment\n\n- 5 Promote empowerment of the elderly and the disabled\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promotion of women's participation and career advancement\n\n## What we have done so far\n\n## Improved hiring and retention\n\nWe have introduced the following programs: 1) a childcare leave which is more generous than legally required; 2) a program for employees who rejoin the company after having left it because of childcare or nursing care and other reasons; 3) a leave to assist overseas relocation of a spouse; and 4) a temporary exemption program for employees who have difficulty in relocation because of childcare or nursing care and other reasons. We have also been opening 24-hour childcare centers in steelworks and have introduced maternity work clothes for use by steelwork employees who are in the childbirth/childcare period, in order to help them continue their shift work without feeling concerned. We are thus enhancing programs to support employees' work-life balance. In addition, we are investing in improving work infrastructure such as showers, toilets, and dressing rooms at manufacturing sites, and improving work practices, so as to establish a comfortable working environment for female employees.\n\nIn-house childcare center (Nagoya Works)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Toward further promoting women's participation in the workplace\n\nBased on the various programs and work environments that we have established, we have developed an action plan to support female employees to continue to demonstrate their abilities through career development, and to promote their empowerment in all workplaces and levels. We target at least doubling and possibly tripling the number of female employees in management positions in 2025 from 36 in 2020, and an increase by at least four times and possibly seven times by 2030.\n\nThe ratio of women in overall hiring is 17%, and we will continue to expand their hiring. We also seek to improve the retention rate of female employees by taking the following measures: 1) promotion of teleworking; 2) elimination of long work hours (for those with constraint on workplace or work time due to childcare or other conditions to continue to work); 3) career assessments for female employees; and 4) flexible placement and development based on the understanding of individual circumstances.\n\nOur other continual efforts include investment in the work environment with the aim of expanding women's placement mainly at steelworks, and child-care support measures such as the establishment of childcare centers that offer night-time service. In fiscal 2021 we plan to open in-house childcare centers at the East Nippon Works' Kashima area and the Muroran Works.\n\nThe ratio of women in overall hiring (Average ratio for FY2019-FY2021)\n\nOffice staff and engineers 31%\n\nOperators and\n\n12% maintenance personnel\n\nOverall hiring 17%\n\n## Support for employees' career development and work-life balance\n\nIn addition to establishing career education programs to contribute to the further promotion of female employees' performance, we also encourage them to develop their capability by providing opportunities for growth through proactive efforts in anticipation of various life events, and by actively promoting advancement to managerial positions.\n\nWe will create a workplace culture where work and home life are comfortably balanced by making various programs well known to employees, through improvement and introduction of brochures which explain the programs. We also provide to managers education concerning unconscious bias and diversity management.\n\nWith the aim of encouraging male employees with young children to actively participate in childcare, we encourage them to take child-care and related leave.\n\n## Realizing the work life balance as a means to enable people with diverse situations perform well in the workplace\n\n## Enabling flexible ways of working\n\nAll human resources with their diverse attributes and circumstances, such as age, gender, and restrictions on work time and workplace due to childcare and nursing care, ideally should make the most of their finite time available and perform at their best. From this viewpoint, we are expanding our work system to move away from traditionally-set ways of working and pursue more flexible and diverse ways of working in accordance with the nature of work at any given time and fluctuation in workload flow of operation needed at that time,\n\nand the circumstances of each individual.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we revised the work-at-home system, which was previously limited to childcare cases, and introduced the teleworking system.\n\nAmong employees under the flexible time system and those eligible to the short-work hour program for childcare and nursing care, those approved by the Company on the basis of their work assignment can do teleworking. The workplace in this case is not limited to home but any location.\n\nAlong with the introduction of the teleworking system, we have also adopted various IT tools to develop the environment that allows employees to work at any place as in the office. This has led to an efficient way of work, using spare time on business trip or out of office, and maximizing the ability of employees with childcare, nursing care, and other circumstances. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and since the Japanese Government made initial requests to refrain from going out and declared of the state of emergency, we have used the accumulated knowledge and experience, and\n\nhave actively utilized the teleworking system.\n\nA flexible time system has also been introduced. Since fiscal 2019, a more flexible management structure has been in place by our expanding the workplaces that could use the 'coreless flexible system,' which eliminated the core time - an essential time period to be in the office, so that we can achieve a more harmonious way of working, balanced with personal life.\n\nBased on these systems, we aim to achieve improved productivity and employees' work-life balance, while pursuing ways in which individuals can perform at their best.\n\n## Realization of a flexible way to take time off from work\n\nWe have been establishing the employee environment so that it facilitates a flexible way to take time off from work, tailored to the circumstances of individual employees and their life stage.\n\nWith regard to annual paid leave, we encourage employees to use it to get refreshed physically and mentally. Each business site has set recommended dates to acquire annual paid leave. The head office, for example, sets every Friday in August as an 'Eco-paid leave day,' and recommends that employees not set meetings and other events on those days in order to make it easier to take off those days. The annual leave utilization rate in and before fiscal 2019 exceeded 70%, but declined to about 60% in fiscal 2020 partly due to the effects of the temporary leave that was implemented in response to a large-scale production cuts. Looking ahead toward the target of 75% or higher in terms of the utilization rate, we will continue to work together with labor union to promote taking planned annual paid leaves in accordance with individual needs.\n\nConcerning childcare leave, we encourage male employees who are entitled to child care leave to take parental leave and get actively involved in childcare. We also focus on fostering a workplace culture that makes it easier for employees to take childcare leave.\n\nMatched to the ongoing aging of Japanese society, programs for nursing care leave and time off for nursing care have been established to support employees continue working while attending to nursing care. The expired leave days that have been accrued can be used for nursing care purposes, as part of our efforts to provide an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind while providing care.\n\nTo promote the use of these programs, we distributed a brochure that summarizes each type of work and vacation program applicable for each life stage. We try to make the programs better known through various training programs.\n\n## Promote health management for employees to with a goal of maximizing workability until retirement at age 65.\n\n## Basic thinking\n\nWe aim all employee work at their best from the time of joining the company to retirement, which has been extended to the age of 65. In order to accomplish this, we support them to maintain and enhance both mental and physical health. We conduct health promotion measures focusing on disease prevention as well as early detection and treatment. We are committed to providing an advanced health\n\ncheckup including cancer or mental disorder screening and encouraging employees to take regular checkups and provide a consultation or a counseling about lifestyle or stress coping by health care professionals, as needed. Employees are expected to also be committed to implementing measures for their own health maintenance, such as to get various checkups and improve their daily lifestyle.\n\n## Promoting physical wellness\n\n## Cancer disease control\n\nVarious cancer screening (including non-statutory exams) based on age and gender are incorporated in our health checkups. In particular, regarding exams for gastric and colon cancer, which are high risk diseases, we set the priority targets age and screening frequency for the examination, based on evidence. We also set our target rate of exam-taking and encourage employees to take exams for early detection and treatment of cancer. Cerebral cardiovascular disease control\n\nWe have established a unique company-wide system that\n\nenables us to assess and manage the risk of diseases based on the results of health checkups. We provide health guidance according to risk factors or control the frequency of health checkups.\n\nIt is important that worker with high risk of cardiovascular disease improve their lifestyle. , We will improve the implementation rate of specified health guidance, which aimed at improving the dietary and exercise habits of workers, by setting a target rate and promoting medical visits. We cooperate with the Health Insurance Union for achieving the goal.\n\n## Promoting mental wellness\n\nAiming for each employee in the Nippon Steel Group to enjoy a robust life on and off the job, we provide a consulting service for prevention and early detection in the area of mental health, and have incorporated the issue of mental health in in-house seminars for each rank of employee. We also offer education on how to be aware of one's own stress and to deal with it, how managers should care for their subordinates and manage their teams, and how to coordinate with the corporate health care professionals (physician, nurses, and other staff). We provide the stress check which is workplace stress survey every fall. Occupational health care professionals give guidance for improvement by teams and individuals based\n\non the result of the stress check. In contributing to a vigorous work environment, managers implement necessary measures according to the issues of a team or an individual, coordinating with the personnel department and the health department. Because early detection and early response are important in the treatment of mental illness, we identify those who are at risk at the Health Consulting Contact by various measures in association with the Company's 'mental health e-learning and questionnaire event conducted every June.' Occupational health care professionals swiftly respond to the findings of the events to foster mental wellbeing.",

A goal of HR development is to create people who can understand and implement our Corporate Philosophy and our Employee Action Guidelines. All our employees keep this in mind.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNippon Steel's basic approach to HR development is for supervisors to transfer to their subordinates, through daily dialogues on the job, understanding and knowledge of criteria for judgment and of operational skills. In order to share this mind with all employees, the following 'Basic Policy for Human Resource Development' has been established.\n\n## Development of operators and maintenance staff\n\nThe operators and maintenance staff ceaselessly put into practice their accumulated skills in steelmaking and maintenance, from joining the Company on the assumption of long-term employment to retirement. They thus fundamentally support the Company's manufacturing worksites. Smooth transmission of technology and skills from veterans to younger workers is essential and a system that facilitates this\n\nis needed. Therefore, after identifying, through a supervisorsubordinate dialogue, the skill or skills to be acquired, a skill development plan is developed and carried out. The status of planning and skill transfer is monitored by using a skill map - a list of skills for each individual. If needed the plan and its implementation are modified.\n\nIn light of the ongoing diversification in recruitment sources\n\nHR development is the job itself, and supervisors play an important role in HR development\n\nOJT training is a basis of HR development and is complemented by offthe-job training.\n\nSupervisors share objectives and outcomes of HR development clearly with their subordinates.\n\nEach individual strives for continual personal improvement for further growth.\n\n## Objective\n\nNumber of training/learning hours\n\n0.78 mn hours/year (27 hours/year per employee)\n\nPromote measures to develop human resources who serve the enhancement of workplace strength and technological advancement\n\nunconscious biases as part of our training programs. Several dedicated consultation and reporting points of contact have been established so that employees who face a harassment issue can consult with other people, in addition to someone close to themselves, such as their supervisor or colleague. We are striving to create an environment wherein a harassment issue can be resolved without the employee concerned taking it on all alone.\n\nEach of the contact points takes individual actions and makes sure not to disbenefit anyone for reporting or cooperating. After investigating and confirming the existence of a problem, we conduct fact checks and take strict measures in accordance with employment rules and other regulations.\n\n(especially the increase in female employees and middlecareer recruitment) in response to the rapidly declining working-age population in Japan, it is essential to promote the development of infrastructure and the creation of a workplace environment in which diverse personnel can be motivated and collaborate with each other. Specific efforts along these lines include the establishment of an environment and education on human rights and harassment. Off-the-job training (OFFJT), which complements on-the-job training (OJT), is used\n\nthroughout the Company by organizing the minimum skills and knowledge required by each rank of employees of Nippon Steel into a company-wide standard system. Through this, we work at measures to maintain and improve motivation of the elderly to continue working with health and motivation, and at education of workplace leaders to further increase their ability to add to and improve our knowledge base from the field ('field technology').\n\n## Development of office staff and engineers\n\nFollowing the Basic Policy for HR Development, Nippon Steel uses a 'HR Development PDCA' for office staff and engineers, who implement OJT-based HR development plans. Specifically, development plans are formulated for each person based on the corporate philosophy and organizational strategies, and are discussed by supervisors and subordinates. Implementation is routinely checked and, if needed, revised. This PDCA for HR development follows a one-year cycle, from April through March of the following year. An employee's period of time from joining the Company to becoming a manager is divided into three steps: 'Discipline', 'Creation' and 'Independence'. Based on the OJT, work reporting sessions and training by rank are carried out at the milestones of the 2nd, 3rd, or 5th anniversaries of the start of employment.\n\nIn the initial few years, new hires learn the basics in each of our fields of expertise, and acquire the manners and basic patterns for work as a social person through each practice. Discipline\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe employees in this step are assigned to perform a certain task from start to finish, develop their execution ability, identify their own field of expertise, and acquire a firm basic foothold in it. Creation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough experience of working according to their own responsibility, the employees develop their leadership skills. Together with development of skills, when they reach this phase they must also pay close attention to the development of their subordinates or junior colleagues. Independence\n\nIn addition, various OFF-JT training courses are provided to learn specific skills and researches, which cannot be covered by OJT, and to acquire common skills required throughout the Company depending on the employee's qualification.\n\n## Development of staff who support technological advancement\n\nWith the aim of achieving world-leading technologies and manufacturing capabilities, basic courses in engineering are taught so that employees can learn the essential technologies needed to systematically acquire the skills required for\n\n## Development of managers\n\nThe training courses are provided to managers match the managers' qualification and position, and are given so that they can acquire proper understanding of their responsibilities and authority as managers; knowledge, skills, and mindset that contribute to enhancing the management as supervisors; and group management capabilities. We gather managers in similar positions to cultivate each other and share experiences and\n\nsteelmaking. In particular, the content of courses classified as process-specific technologies is at the core of Nippon Steel's technology. Most of the lectures on the underlying and advanced technologies are given by our own engineers.\n\nopinions. In recent years, we have given increased attention to management education. We added new courses including one for line manager candidates to enhance line management skills on the manufacturing field, and one for new managers to ensure they have a correct understanding of their roles and responsibilities as managers, and acquire the required knowledge and management skills to conduct business.\n\n## Development of staff for roles in overseas expansion\n\nNippon Steel is actively expanding business to overseas growth markets and many Nippon Steel employees are working on these projects, together with employees of our joint ventures and local employees. At these bases, we also contribute to local communities by locally hiring employees and creating job opportunities.\n\nNippon Steel also has programs for employees who can contribute to our overseas business expansion. For global Group employees and managers, we have been standardizing English 'dialog ability' for each qualification, and a language education system suitable for any level of English has been created for that. Further, for young managers, there are middle-management seminars designed for them to acquire the knowledge, skills, and mindset necessary for domestic\n\nand overseas business. For young employees, we offer opportunities to study abroad or work at overseas operational companies for a certain period. We also provide a course for employees who are assigned to work abroad and their family members.\n\nConcerning development of overseas local staff, we also make efforts to transfer to them Nippon Steel's criteria for judgment and operational skills, mainly through OJT, in line with the Company's Basic Policy for HR Development. In the ASEAN countries and India, where our overseas Group companies are concentrated, training courses by rank, as well as OFF-JT courses for specific skill learning or for special subjects are conducted.\n\n## Development of employees who can contribute to digital innovation\n\nWe make extensive use of data and digital technologies for production and business process innovation and are promoting a Digital Transformation (DX) strategy combined with implementing measures to speed up decisionmaking and enhance our problem-solving.\n\nAmong our DX activities we have established a skills training\n\nprogram for employees to acquire data science knowledge and enhance competence in order to add strength to our professional staff in this area and strengthen cyber-skills among all employees. Management education courses are also given to reform managers' consciousness in order to promote DX in each department.",

While we aim to achieve the D/E ratio of around 0.5, a level that allows us to maintain a long-term A rating by international credit rating agencies over the long term, our immediate target had been to maintain the D/E ratio of around 0.7, by offsetting an increase in interestbearing debt with an increase in shareholders' equity during the 2020 Mid-term Management Plan period when investing cash flow was at a high level because we needed large-scale refurbishment for domestic facilities and tried not to miss opportunities for overseas growth investment.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, the D/E ratio after recognizing equity credit attributes of the subordinated loan and the subordinated bonds was 0.7 and reached the 2020 Mid-term Management Plan's target of around 0.7. Our next target is to maintain or lower the D/E ratio of 0.7 in fiscal 2025, even if the business environment further deteriorates.\n\nThe steel industry is a gigantic equipment-based industry, which uses a massive amount of fixed assets, including machinery equipment and other tangible fixed assets, in its business.

We intend to further compress assets in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COLUMN\n\n## Asset compression by disposing of strategic shareholdings\n\nMost of the asset compression comes from sale of strategic shareholdings.\n\nStrategic shareholdings are judged to contribute to maintaining and strengthening its business foundation such as the business relationships and alliance relationships between Nippon Steel and the investees, enhancing the profitability of both parties, and thereby contributing to sustainable growth and improving mid- to long-term corporate value of Nippon Steel and the Group. However, we dispose of holdings of companies, with whom we confirmed, based on sufficient dialogues with them, that the above objectives could be achieved without holding their shares.\n\ntn\n\n\u00a52.5\n\n(adjusted for equity credit attributes)\n\nOur strengths\n\n## How we think about cash flow management\n\nDuring the 2018-2020 Mid-Term Management Plan, we made a high level of investment, such as for large-scale refurbishment of domestic facilities and overseas growth investment. These investments were financed within the aggregate amount of operating cash flow and asset compression and while maintaining the financial position in terms of the D/E ratio of around 0.7 times, thereby exercising financially-disciplined cash flow management. Given a significant change in the business environment\n\nduring the plan period, operating cash flow undershot the initial forecast. We therefore  made an additional asset compression of approximately \u00a5420 billion and increased own funds, while reducing capital expenditures by over \u00a5300 billion so as to maintain financial soundness.\n\nOur cash flow management going forward focuses on maintaining financial stability while making investment for growth and the challenge of realizing zero-carbon steel.\n\n## FY2018-2020 cash flow results vs. plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Capital expenditures\n\nInvested \u00a51,400 billion during the three-year period, which was reduced by over \u00a5300 billion from the initial plan.

Even for the overall capital expenditures, including refurbishment of aging facilities, we manage to secure an internal rate of return (IRR) that\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nMany of our steelworks were built during Japan's high-growth era and are passing a 50-year milestone. Since construction, the facilities have been appropriately maintained and refurbished and are in good condition but some facilities are in an extremely long refurbishment cycle, as is the case for coke ovens and infrastructure equipment, which are approaching refurbishment time. Due to the concentration of refurbishment investment for these equipment and facilities, capital expenditures will be at a high level for the near term.\n\nGiven the assumptions for the future steel market in and out of Japan, we have decided to suspend less-competitive facilities and consolidate production to competitive ones via the production facility structural measures (pp. 21-26). In addition to curbing investment in facilities to be shut down, we are making strategic selective investment in the remaining facilities. We also seek to efficiently inject capital based on the long-term refurbishment plan, aiming for reduction in overall capital expenditures.\n\nexceeds the cost of capital.\n\nAs for business investment, we set a hurdle rate for the IRR that exceeds the cost of capital, even with consideration of diverse risks and with running a PDCA system, which enables us to track the execution status and make judgment on restructuring, withdrawal, and other options if needed.\n\nWe are concurrently making investment to capture demand in growth areas in the context of changes in social and industrial structure.\n\nWe initially planned to implement domestic capital expenditures of about \u00a51,700 billion over three years during the 2018 - 2020 Mid-Term Management Plan but have reduced the amount by more than \u00a5300 billion to less than \u00a51,400 billion, mainly by taking the above measures.\n\nOver the next five years to fiscal 2025, we plan to make capital expenditures of about \u00a52,400 billion for improving the capacity and quality of strategy products, increasing higher value added products, and reducing costs, while making maintenance/renewal investment only in needed facilities, in light of the production facility structural measures. For determining capital expenditures, we set a hurdle rate, designed at such a level that the internal rate of return (IRR) of overall capital expenditures exceeds the cost of capital.\n\n## Capital expenditures and depreciation expense (consolidated basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The amounts of capital expenditures are construction based (about a 2-year time lag from decision-making basis).\n- The scope of investments and depreciation has expanded since fiscal 2018 due to a change in the financial accounting system.\n- The method of depreciation was changed from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method in FY2020.\n\nWe invested approximately \u00a5600 billion for M&As and establishment of new overseas manufacturing bases over the three-year term (fiscal 2018 - 2020). In fiscal 2018, we invested around \u00a560 billion in restructuring the special steel business by acquiring Ovako AB in Sweden and making Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. a subsidiary. In fiscal 2019, together with ArcelorMittal, we invested about \u00a5310 billion (including approximately \u00a5103 billion in equity investment) in acquisition of Essar Steel India Limited, the fourth largest steelmaker in India.\n\nWe set the business investment budget of \u00a5600 billion for\n\nfive years up to fiscal 2025 in order to promote business expansion of AM/NS India and get prepared for potential acquisition or equity investment opportunities in integrated steelworks in China or ASEAN.\n\nIn terms of increasing overseas businesses' profit and reallocation of management resources, we have thoroughly examined past investments and have almost completed asset sale of and withdrawal from businesses that could not move into the black, businesses that had completed their roles, and businesses that lost synergies. We intend to continue improving our asset portfolio.\n\n## Business investment management system\n\nNippon Steel has embedded in its business investment procedures a management system with a clearly-defined PDCA cycle, in order to (1) make appropriate decisions on business investments, such as for founding and equity investing in companies in Japan and overseas, as well as for M&A deals, (2) identify early and solve promptly issues during the stage of execution of those deals, and (3) share and preserve such know-how within the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1 Discussion and decision making\n\nProposed projects are considered in terms of significance to business strategy, market growth, competitive landscape, and individual risks (country, partner, foreign exchange, and other risks). In the case of M&A deals, based on due diligence, their risks are to be understood and appropriately hedged. After such a procedure and given consideration to risk scenarios, the certainty of generating return that matches investment is confirmed.\n\n## Investment and Loan Committee\n\nThe Investment and Loan Committee discusses projects from a professional perspective of each corporate unit and division. The business investment projects are submitted to the Corporate Policy Committee after being discussed at the Investment and Loan Committee.\n\nVery important projects are then submitted to the Board of Directors.\n\n## 2 Execution evaluation\n\n## Start-up and progress following\n\nFor about three years since start-up, KPIs for operation, production, shipment, financials, and other items are set up for each project, and the corporate division follows its performance relative to the plan once every three months, and reports to the Investment and Loan Committee and the Corporate Policy Committee. The status of particularly important projects is reported to the Board of Directors once a year.\n\n## Achievement report\n\nAbout three years from the start-up, the entire processes from decision making to full-scale operation are reviewed and reported to the Investment and Loan Committee and the Corporate Policy Committee.\n\n## Evaluation of soundness\n\nAll Group companies in which Nippon Steel has made direct investment are evaluated in terms of financial soundness, based on their financial data, and the results are reported at the Corporate Policy Committee every half year. Those companies in which Nippon Steel has made indirect investment are similarly evaluated but only once a year. They are also reported to the Board of Directors once a year.\n\n## Decision on exit or restructuring\n\nConcerning group companies that are determined not contributing to raise the company's corporate value in terms of financial soundness based on quantitative standards (future cash flow, financial position) and qualitative standards (sustainability, compliance, etc.), the Investment and Loan Committee discusses whether to continue business and the status of particularly important project are to be approved by, or reported to, the Corporate Policy Committee to determine whether to exit (or be reorganized) or restructure.",

Rather, we have established overseas group companies, constructed new manufacturing bases, and extended our capacity in technology, sales and marketing, and management methods, which have been nurtured in Japan, to other countries, to support our Japanese\n\ncustomers' overseas expansion and meet overseas demand. In the future, while maintaining the current supply system, we will expand our integrated production system to capture overall local demand and move to the next stage of full-scale overseas operations to secure higher added value.\n\n## Becoming an insider in a most-suited way by region and product type\n\nAnywhere in the world, steel demand increases in line with economic development and is initially satisfied by imports. With further economic progress, fostering of the nation's own steel industry becomes a national policy as steel is a basic material of all industries. Steel demand then is filled by domestic production. As a result of this process, steelmakers tend to develop on a country-by-country basis, making global shares of top-tier makers less concentrated compared to other industries. The steel industry therefore can be described as a 'gigantic compound local industry.'\n\n## ASEAN Downstream bases\n\nIn the ASEAN region which is geographically close to Japan and where many of our Japanese customers have production bases, we have built a framework to locally provide similar high-grade steel products to customers as we do in Japan. We have invested substantial capital to establish local bases for downstream production processes which directly link to quality assurance and reliable delivery to customers, while providing semi-finished products from our steel mills in Japan to those local production bases where they are processed to finished products.\n\nJapanese customers'\n\nentry to the local market\n\nModerate favoring of domestic production\n\n(Supply of original sheets from Japan is\n\npossible.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvested by local majors and established a structure to manufacture from original sheets supplied from Japan and provide equally high-quality products to customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is therefore crucial to become an 'insider' of a target country or region for Nippon Steel to respond to overseas demand growth and meet quality requirements.\n\nWe have been ahead of peers in becoming an insider in various regions in an optimal way by product type or region, by accurately assessing 1) steel market size and growth potential; 2) Japanese customers' expansion in a region; 3) needs of local customers; 4) level of difficulty to enter a market via export ('favoring of domestic production'); 5) level of systematic difficulty to enter a market, etc.\n\n## North America and China Downstream bases\n\nIn areas such as North America and China, we have made alliances with major local partners, such as ArcelorMittal and Baowu Steel, to develop local bases for downstream production processes by joint ventures. Those joint ventures supply high-grade steel products by Nippon Steel's technical assistance, using semi-products provided by the partner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## India Integrated steelwork\n\nIndia is anticipating steel demand growth but tends to have a protectionism trend. The steel market is difficult to enter via exports or by building a new steel mill. This is especially the case when by foreign capital. In December 2019, Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal jointly acquired Essar Steel India Limited, one of India's four major steelmakers, and entered the Indian\n\nmarket as an integrated steelmaker, to be engaged in the full range of activities, from raw materials procurement to upstream and downstream processes, under a new company name, AM/ NS India. Going forward, we plan to extend capacity by extending the existing steel mill of AM/NS India and building the second steel mill.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe intend to continue expanding overseas markets with a focus on 'markets where we see assurance of demand growth potential' and 'areas where our technology and product capacity can be used.'",

We also appropriately analyze actual accidents and promptly make known effective examples of accident-preventive measures. As a result of continuing efforts, our safety performance in 2020 shows that the number of accidents accompanied by lost work time was 3 for company, 16 for our cooperating companies (including fatal cases of zero for the company and 2 for cooperating companies), the comprehensive accident frequency rate was 0.09 (vs. the domestic steel industry average of 0.87), and the intensity ratio was 0.08 (vs. the same\n\n## Acquisition of third-party certification\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Nippon Steel adopted a plan for all of our steelworks and offices to obtain the ISO (JIS Q) 45001 Health and Safety certification (published in March 2018) by the end of fiscal 2021, and they have been acquiring it one by one.\n\n## Safety management structure\n\naverage of 0.14).

To curb emissions of soot and dust, we install dust collectors, windbreak net, and sprinklers and prevent scattering of particles, based on air pollution risk analysis through scientific simulation. We also conduct constant monitoring and regular patrols.\n\n## Soil risk management\n\n## Management of discharged chemical substances\n\nWe are taking appropriate measures in compliance with the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act, guidelines issued by the Ministry of the Environment, local government ordinances, and so on. We report to the local government when performing landform modification work such as excavation which is required to be reported. We conduct pollution surveys when needed.\n\n## Environment management structure\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n(receive reports)\n\nCorporate Policy Committee\n\n(deliberate important issues)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Efforts on disaster prevention\n\nTrust and co-existence with customers, communities and society are of utmost importance to Nippon Steel, and it is important for the sustainability of the Company to avoid accidents that undermine the trust. We have therefore established a system and\n\n## ESG Materiality 1-(3) Disaster prevention\n\nstructure for autonomous and continuous disaster prevention activities. We implement measures to reduce the risk of accidents, while proactively preventing them with the aim of enhancing disaster management.\n\nWe appropriately manage the production, handling, and discharge or disposal of chemical substances in accordance with the laws concerning the management of chemical substances and the voluntary control manual developed by the Japan Iron and Steel Federation (JISF) and ourselves. We developed a voluntary reduction plan of hazardous air pollutants specified in the environmental standard, such as benzene and volatile organic compounds (VOC). As a result of our undertaking, we have already reached the targets and have maintained the target levels. We also took the lead to promote use of alternatives to steelmaking materials and equipment that contain hazardous materials such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and mercury.\n\nWe use approximately 6 billion m 3 of freshwater a year at all of our steelworks and factories combined. Approximately 90% of this is recycled or reused to reduce wastewater discharge. We have also installed devices such as automatic detectors, wastewater shut-off gate, and made emergency water storage pits. Our operational bases in Japan are evaluated by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct to confirm that we are not prone to high-level water stress.",

Information on quality-related examples is promptly shared across the Group and at appropriate times measures are launched to resolve\n\nissues through standardization, systemization, automatization, and other action. These measures are then implemented to enhance identification management of actual products and to improve reliability of testing and inspection. In addition, the five newly defined basic rules of quality behavior have been made known to all employees, with a focus on improving the awareness in quality compliance and preventing quality problems to occur.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Broad-based customer base\n\nIn terms of Nippon Steel's sales by industry, the manufacturing sector represents 60-70%, of which roughly 30% is the automotive sector, and the civil engineering and construction sector occupies the remaining 30-40%.\n\nThe sales contracts to the manufacturing sector tend to have a higher portion of tied (long-term contract) sales contracts, based on our long-term business relationships with customers. We carry out R&D activities jointly with these customers, develop and manufacture steel products with high functionality, and make proposals for solutions and improvements, such as relating to component design and manufacturing method, in addition to supply of materials, responding to their needs. Moreover, we have established an overseas supply network of steel products, to satisfy needs arising from the customers' global expansion. We have thus strived hard to be a partner contributing to these customers' value creation.\n\nThe high-grade steel product technology and solution proposal capacity of Nippon Steel have been developed by responding to needs of internationally-competitive manufacturers in Japan. Together with our global production framework, which supports the customers' global development, they have become a part of Nippon Steel's strength.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COLUMN\n\n## Sales contracts of steel products\n\n- Tied (long-term contract) sales contract Contract that a steelmaker produces steel products according to a customer's specified order (price, volume, specifications, etc.) and sells them to the customer via an intermediary trading firm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## High presence in growing Asian region\n\n## Retail sale\n\n- Contract that a steelmaker sells steel products to retailers and trading firms without end users being specified.

In such an environment, what can Nippon Steel do? As the expert in steel, we strongly believe in the infinite potential of steel and will continue to make innovations.\n\nWe aim to contribute to the development of next-generation automobiles and all aspects of the future surrounding automobiles.\n\nNippon Steel is accelerating efforts in research and development aimed at capturing automakers' growing needs for the reduction of car body weight and collision safety, as well as the mega-trends in the auto-motive industry - the spread of electrification vehicles(EVs), such as electric vehicles, and automatic driving. We have established the next-generation steel car concept 'NSafe TM -AutoConcept' (NSAC), with mass equivalent to that of all-aluminum vehicles and enhanced collision performance. We will continue to make improvements to further enhance the performance of the NSAC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntwo fields: EVs and next-generation mobility. By taking full advantage of the Group's comprehensive strengths, we are making extensive efforts in the areas of material development, structural and functional design, process development, and performance evaluation in the fields of\n\nEVs and next-generation mobility as part of the development and manufacture of nextgeneration vehicles.\n\nIn this context, we have expanded our solution concept in\n\n## Concept for steel solutions for electrification vehicles 'NSafe TM -AutoConcept xEV'\n\nThe NSafe TM -AutoConcept xEV has been developed as a steel solution concept for EVs, which are becoming increasingly popular worldwide in line with growing needs for zero carbon. We have realized the 'safety, performance, and cost balance' proposal in the field of body structure and the motor field, including the battery and the battery box, which are the main components of EVs. The application of this solution will help not only performance, but also shorter and lower-cost development by customers, thereby contributing to the earlier realization of electrification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Die-less production solution concept befitting smaller-lot production for next generation mobility 'NSafe TM -AutoFrameConcept'\n\nCASE and MaaS have diversified the needs of end users regarding the automotive structure. Greater variety of models leads to the need for smaller-lot production, but it will be inefficient to prepare production facilities for each model.\n\nWe have established the 'NSafe TM -AutoFrameConcept', a die-less production solution concept that enables production with no need or less need for molds.

HRX19 TM , the world's first high-pressure hydrogen stainless steel developed by Nippon Steel, has been adopted by approximately 60% of hydrogen stations in Japan, and has\n\nwon many awards for technology and social contribution, as it has overcome hydrogen brittleness, which occurs in the high-pressure hydrogen gas environment, and as it has high strength and weldability. This sole material adapted to high-pressure hydrogen environments will greatly expand the potential of tomorrow's hydrogen-oriented society and contribute to the further spread of clean energy.\n\n## Features of HRX19 TM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commercial-use hydrogen station\n\n## Adoption of HRX19 TM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApprox.\n\n%\n\n(Approx.\n\n80\n\nstations)\n\n## Over 90% in the stations constructed in FY2019\n\n## Commercial-use hydrogen station\n\n## 161\n\n## Aa of May 2021\n\nAriake Hydrogen Station of Iwatani Corporation Photo courtesy of Iwatani Corporation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n900\n\n(to serve\n\n0.8\n\nmillion FCVs)\n\nBy FY 2030 (plan-based)\n\nChugoku\n\nand Shikoku\n\n10\n\n(2)\n\nKinki\n\n22\n\n(1)\n\nHokkaido\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKyushu\n\n14\n\n(1)\n\nChubu\n\n51\n\n(7)\n\nPlanned stations in parenthesis\n\nSource: Fuel Cell Commercialization Conference of Japan website\n\nTohoku\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\nKanto\n\n58\n\n(4)",

Construction of new and added facilities and measures against the aging or declining performance of existing facilities are in urgent need. In addition to responding quickly to disaster recovery and support, it is now necessary to meet the demands of a broader range of resilience in preparation for the digital transformation era. Among 169 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations is included a goal to 'develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure.'\n\nThe Japanese Government is also taking up 'Sustainable and Resilient Land Use, Promoting Quality Infrastructure' as one of issues. The Government has promoted a 'three-year emergency response plan for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience' budgeted at around \u00a57 trillion since fiscal 2018. This was followed by a launch of the 'five-year accelerating measures for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience' budged at around \u00a515 trillion starting in fiscal 2021. Further, taking into account the repeated heavy rainfall disasters, accelerated water control measures concerning 121 river basins across Japan has been announced as a 'basin-wide flood disaster prevention project.'\n\nThe Nippon Steel Group is committed to providing various solutions for national resilience, making use of its diverse manufacturing methods, product development capacity, abundant achievements in technology proposals, and nationwide product supply capacity.\n\n## Measures against natural disasters, triggered by climate change, etc.\n\nRisks that require solutions\n\nPerformance required to steel products\n\nHigh strength Toughness Lightweight\n\nApplication areas of steel products\n\nTsunamis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact resistance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nippon Steel's solution examples for national resilience\n\nStorms and typhoons; control of sediment and landslide\n\n## Non-frame method\n\nPreserve the natural environment and landscape and prevent disasters on the slope at the same time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-frame method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStorms and typhoons; buildings and structures\n\n## L145 TM high-strength roof\n\nEnhanced windstorm measures of roofs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEarthquakes\n\nStorms and typhoons\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWind resistance Toughness\n\nRestoration (emergency and permanent)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShort construction time, Rapid installation\n\nCorrosion resistance Variability\n\nAging\n\ninfrastructure\n\n(extended use)\n\nOutcomes to be achieved\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEarthquakes and tsunamis; road and railway; buildings and structures\n\n## NS ECO-PILE TM method\n\nConstruction with no waste soil, and high pull-out strength\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Eco products TM (What we produce is 'Eco-friendly')\n\n## Nippon Steel's eco-friendly products help reduce environmental burden.\n\nOur products have advanced or highly specialized functions and reliability, that are based on our technological capabilities, and are widely used in diverse areas of society.

Under these circumstances, we recorded a business loss of \u00a5106.5 billion in the first half but returned into business profit of \u00a5216.5 billion in the second half. Non-consolidated operating profit, which represents the profits of our main domestic steelmaking business, turned into a surplus in the second half, for the first time in 4.5 years. Full-year business profit of\n\n\u00a5110 billion exceeded that of the previous fiscal year (\u00a576.5 billion, excluding the effects of impairment losses, etc.), despite the lower levels in production and shipments.\n\nThe return to a non-consolidated operating surplus in the adverse environment resulted from a drastically improved breakeven point, achieved through our efforts at cost reduction. The strategic selections and concentration of overseas businesses resulted in generating overseas business profits, which significantly contributed to the overall consolidated business profits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nF: Forecast\n\n## Business profit variance\n\n| (\u00a5 billion)                                             |   FY2019 Excl. impairment loss  76.5 FY2020 110 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Increase (decrease) in  consolidated business profits   |                                            33.5 |\n| Increase (decrease) in  production shipment volume      |                                          -249   |\n| Sales prices, product mix and  raw material prices      |                                            -5   |\n| Cost reduction                                          |                                           165   |\n| Inventory valuation difference  (incl.

We intend to take advantage of the current high export margins, stemming from a sharp rise in the overseas steel market, stabilize our operations and facilities, and maximize marginal profit through stable production and shipment. We will also seek to reduce variable costs by further improving full-potential operations.\n\nEfforts to improve long-term contract prices are another area of focus. In order to ensure stable supply of materials (and longterm supply capability), and to develop and invest in high-quality products required by customers, we are asking customers to adjust long-term contract pricing and to allow us to secure\n\nMMT/Y Nippon Steel's crude steel production (non-consol.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business environment comparison to FY2014\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nappropriate margin internationally by proportionately passing along the impact of cost increases of main raw materials and commodity raw materials, and from the perspective of the value provided by our products and solutions.\n\nThe highest profit we recorded since the integration of former Nippon Steel and former Sumikin was \u00a5471.3 billion (including profit from the former Nisshin Steel, which was merged in fiscal 2017) in fiscal 2014. Compared to that year, our production shipment level in fiscal 2021 will be about 20% less due to the deteriorated business environment, which is mainly represented by 1) declining domestic demand, 2) deteriorating OCTG business, caused by weak crude oil prices, and 3) soaring iron ore prices. Nevertheless, we are anticipating to realize profit, which substantially surpasses the level in fiscal 2014, owing very much to our structural efforts.\n\nDespite the current favorable environment, our assumption that domestic demand will decrease and export will be difficult over the medium to long term remains unchanged, and we are committed to continue steady implementation of production facility structural measures.\n\n## Business profit (consol.)\n\n<!-- image -->",

In fiscal 2020, demand for steel products, particularly in the manufacturing sector, decreased significantly due to the spread of the COVID-19 infection. In the first half, demand was around 25 million tons, down nearly 20% y-o-y. In the second half, demand slightly recovered to around 28 million tons, which was still down 5% y-o-y. We are expecting that demand will continue to stay roughly at the same level in fiscal 2021.\n\nOverseas steel demand also decreased in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 impacts but demand increased in China, where the economy picked up earlier than other countries from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the global demand was nearly\n\nas high as in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2021, each region is seeing a y-o-y recovery in demand and the global demand is likely to increase by around 5.8%, although the impact of re-emergence of COVID-19 infections makes the outlook a little uncertain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steel product prices and raw material prices\n\nIn the global steel market, a peculiar situation of 'high raw material prices and low steel product prices' prevailed in fiscal 2019 but the situation began improving in fiscal 2020. In the first half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 effects led to sharp decline in demand and sharp drop in the steel market but since the second half, the supply and demand balance has tightened due to the economic recovery. Iron ore prices have still soared to a high level, but steel prices have also turned and are on an uptrend.\n\nThese favorable developments are derived from the trend in China, which accounts for 60% of the world's steel supply and demand. China's steel demand continues to be high due to the government's infrastructure investment.

In fiscal 2021 in the midst of a recovery in global steel demand, the Chinese government announced policies, including 'crude steel production cut in fiscal 2021,' 'strict prohibition of increase in new steel production capacity,' and 'curbing of steel exports and promoting of imports.' These reinforce the expectation for tighter global steel demand for the foreseeable future.\n\nUnder such tight supply and demand conditions, overseas steel markets have risen substantially, and the Japanese steel market, although lagging, is also expected to rise.\n\n## Actions taken in fiscal 2020\n\n## Prompt response to the rapid decline and subsequent recovery in demand, caused by the COVID-19 impact\n\nIn response to a sharp drop in demand in the first half of fiscal 2020, we promptly put 6 out of 15 blast furnaces into banking mode (temporarily stop blast furnace production in a condition that enables production to restart), thereby rapidly reducing production. Then in the second half, responding to a recovery in demand, we restored operation of blast furnaces in banking\n\none by one and secured proper production volume.\n\nAs we had announced the production facility structural measures in February 2020, and had decided on policy for our future facility structure, we were able to quickly determine and implement banking of blast furnaces and resume their operation in the most optimal manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Blast furnace operation status   | Blast furnace operation status   | Blast furnace operation status   | FY2020     | FY2020        | FY2020                       | FY2021                       |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Muroran                          | 2BF                              | Blowing-out ahead of schedule    |            | Refurbishment | Blowing-in                   |                              |\n| Kashima                          | 1BF                              | Suspension                       | Resumption | Resumption    | Resumption                   | Resumption                   |\n| Kashima                          | 3BF                              | Suspension                       | Suspension | Suspension    | Resumption                   |                              |\n| Kimitsu                          | 2BF 4BF                          |                                  |            |               |                              |                              |\n| Nagoya                           | 1BF 3BF                          |                                  |            |               |                              |                              |\n| Wakayama                         | 1BF 2BF                          | Suspension                       |            |               |                              | Shutdown (already disclosed) |\n| Kure                             | 1BF 2BF                          | Suspension                       |            |               |                              | Shutdown (already disclosed) |\n| Yawata                           | 4BF                              |                                  |            |               | Shutdown (already disclosed) |                              |\n| (Kokura)                         | 2BF                              |                                  | Suspension |               |                              |                              |\n\n## Drastic improvement of breakeven point\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we planned to drastically reduce costs and improve our earnings structure in fiscal 2020. Then the COVID-19 infections significantly affected our operations but we proceeded with cost reduction measures without deviating from the original policy and achieved more results than initially planned. Variable costs improved by \u00a555 billion, which exceeded the level of improvement in other years, despite a decline in production volume. Fixed costs, which were stuck at a high level in the past few years, decreased by \u00a5110 billion, as we scheduled repair costs in line with the production facility structural measures released in February 2020, used advanced IT for inspections so as to better manage equipment, and reorganized steelworks into smaller groups for improving efficiency. Depreciation expenditures decreased by \u00a5120 billion per year due to change in the depreciation method from the fixed-rate method to the\n\nstraight-line method and the recording of impairment loss of some steelworks in fiscal 2019. In total, we have reduced costs by an unusually high scale of \u00a5285 billion per year.\n\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic led to low production and prompted us to make emergency cost reduction efforts. This has almost absorbed the negative impact of the deterioration in operating costs associated with production reduction.\n\nEven though the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worsened business environment for our customers, we have not decelerated efforts on improving long-term contract prices and have been making steady progress.\n\nAs a result, the breakeven point was significantly reduced compared to fiscal 2019, and while production and shipping volumes were still at low levels, we made an about-face and turned in a non-consolidated operating profit in the second half of fiscal 2019.\n\n## Breakeven point\n\n<!-- image -->",

In December 2019, we acquired Essar Steel, one of India's major four steelmakers, jointly with ArcelorMittal, and began operating it as AM/NS India under the equal partnership of both Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal as its parent companies. AM/NS India became an equity-method affiliate in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and has contributed more profits than expected since the first year, despite a decrease in volume due to the COVID-19 impact. In recent years, we have also been withdrawing from\n\nbusinesses that have finished their roles, or have weak synergies, and have been in deficit. In fiscal 2020, we sold a seamless steel tube & pipe business in Brazil and a tin business in China.\n\nAs a result of the dual tactics of 'selection and concentration,' overall overseas business has improved its profitability and generated record-high business profit in the second half of 2020. In fiscal 2021, our operations in India, U.S.A, Brazil are strong and the overall overseas business is expected to record even higher profit and to contribute significantly to consolidated business profit.\n\n## Contribution of overseas business to business profit (consolidated)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-steel segment\n\n| (\u00a5 billion)                                    |   FY2019A |   FY2020A | FY2021F   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-steel segment Consolidated business profit |      55.3 |      49.2 | Around 43 |\n| Engineering and Construction                   |      10.7 |      17.7 | Around 4  |\n| Chemicals and Materials                        |      18.4 |       7.6 | Around 14 |\n| System Solutions                               |      26.1 |      23.9 | Around 25 |\n\nA: Actual results  F: Forecasts\n\n## Engineering and Construction Business\n\nThe steelmaking plant sector increased revenues y-o-y due to the completion of blast furnace refurbishment projects and the steady implementation and management of large-scale projects. The environment and energy sector decreased revenues mainly due to a decrease in the scale of an electric power project but progress is made in the offshore gas field development project in Thailand. The urban infrastructure sector increased revenues as a result of the continuing strong environment for order-taking, particularly for large-scale logistics warehouses, and steady project management.\n\n## Engineering and construction Business: consolidated revenue\n\n| (\u00a5 billion)                   |   FY2019A |   FY2020A | FY2021F   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Engineering and  construction |     340.4 |     324.4 | 280       |\n| Steelmaking plant             |      55   |      56.3 |           |\n| Environment and  energy       |     214.9 |     193.1 |           |\n| Urban  infrastructure         |      73.9 |      76.1 |           |\n| Other and  adjustments        |      -3.5 |      -1.1 |           |\n\nA: Actual results  F: Forecasts\n\n## Chemicals and Materials Business\n\nThe Chemicals and Materials Business Segment experienced severe profit conditions in the first half of fiscal 2020, amid the global economic slowdown caused by the spread of COVID-19. In the second half, however, the business environment improved, and partly due to efforts to improve profitability, such as cost reduction and changes in the retirement benefit system, the segment managed to record a profit for the full year.\n\nThe Coal Chemical business decreased revenues as demand for needle coke used in graphite electrodes continued to be sluggish. In the Chemicals business, the market for styrene monomer and bisphenol A, which had been weak since the beginning of 2020, recovered in the second half but the sector decreased revenues for the full year. Contrary to this, the Functional Materials business increased revenues: sales of semiconductor-related materials and LCD materials remained strong throughout the fiscal year, and sales of smartphone materials, which had been sluggish at the beginning of the fiscal year, started to recover. The Composite Materials\n\n## System solutions business\n\nNS Solutions Corporation has provided digital workplace solutions and other services for IT needs to accommodate new workstyles amid harsh economic activities caused by the spread of COVID-19. In order to support customers' promotion of DX, the company has made efforts to provide digital innovation co-creation programs and promote local 5G and IoX solutions, with those efforts centered on the manufacturing and energy industries. However, the System Solutions segment recorded a decline in revenue mainly due to a decrease relative to the booking of a large-scale infrastructure project in fiscal 2019. In addition to an increase in projects that regulations required the financial sector to undertake, the Business Solutions business was strong mainly for retail and transportation in the industrial, distribution, and service sectors. However, this business decreased revenues due to a tough comparison to the previous year when there were contributions by a large-\n\nbusiness has flattish revenues compared to fiscal 2019.

        "page_content": "## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors of Nippon Steel is comprised of eighteen (18) members, of whom eleven (11) are Directors (excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members) and seven (7) are Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members, and is chaired by the Representative Director and President. Independent Outside Directors account for more than one-third (7 out of 18, including one female Director) of all members of the Company's Board of Directors.\n\nBy all Directors appropriately fulfilling their respective roles and responsibilities, prompt decision-making is achieved corresponding to changes in the management environment, and multifaceted deliberations and objective and transparent decision-making by the Board of Directors are secured. In addition, Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members have voting rights on the Board of Directors regarding decisions on proposals for the election and dismissal of Directors as well as on election and dismissal of Representative Directors, and other decisions in general regarding business execution (excluding decisions that have been delegated to Directors). The Audit & Supervisory Committee has the authority to give its opinions at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the election, compensation, etc. of Directors, excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members. This structure strengthens the supervisory function of the Board of Directors over management.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors delegates part of the decisions regarding execution of important operations (excluding matters listed in each item of Article 399-13, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act) to the Representative Director and Chairman and Representative Director and President, thereby expediting management decision-making, while enhancing discussions by the Board of Directors relating to matters, such as the formulation of management policies and strategies, important business strategic issues, safety, environmental issues, disaster prevention, and quality assurance.\n\n## Audit & Supervisory Committee\n\nThe Audit & Supervisory Committee acts with the obligation of contributing to the establishment of a high-quality corporate governance system that enables sound and sustainable growth of Nippon Steel and its Group companies, by supervising the performance of responsibilities by Directors and acting as part of the Company's oversight function, as an independent organ fulfilling its roles and responsibilities that are recently expected, in response to the delegation of responsibilities by the shareholders, and social trust.\n\n## Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee has been established to conduct discussions and deliberations on a wide range of topics relating to the nomination and compensation of the Directors in general, including the compositions of the entire Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Committee, the system and levels of the Directors' compensation, and other topics. The Committee comprises six members: the Representative Director and Chairman, Kosei Shindo, the Representative Director and President, Eiji Hashimoto, and Outside Directors Noriko Iki, Tetsuro Tomita, Masato Kitera and Hiroshi Obayashi. The Representative Director and President serves as the chairman of the Committee. The Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee, as a general rule, is held twice a year.

        "page_content": "## Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a Whole\n\nAt Nippon Steel, the office of the Board of Directors (General Administration Division) conducts quantitative analysis through comparison of the number of the agenda items submitted for deliberation or reported to the Board of Directors and the number of hours of deliberation, as well as the attendance rate and the number of opinions expressed by attendees at meetings of the Board of Directors with these of prior years; and the Board of Directors, taking into account selfassessments and opinions of each member of the Board of Directors on the operation of the Board of Directors obtained through individual interviews with them, annually analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of the entire Board of Directors and utilizes such analysis and evaluation to improve the future operation and administration of the Board of Directors. In fiscal 2020, Nippon Steel decided to take the opportunity of the transition to a Company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee to establish the Rules of the Board of Directors, enhance discussions by the Board of Directors on matters such as the formulation of management policies and strategies, strengthen the supervisory function of the Board of Directors over management, and devise and improve operation of meetings so as to  contribute to these efforts.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held in June 2021, analyzed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Board of\n\n## Training Policy for Directors\n\nNippon Steel, via relevant officers, explains its corporate philosophy and the Group business lineups, among others, to each Outside Director individually once they assume their positions. In addition, after the assumption, Nippon Steel proactively provides opportunities for them to visit steelworks, research laboratories, and to have dialogue with the Chairman, the President, and the Vice Presidents. Nippon Steel also explains anew to Executive Directors and Directors\n\nDirectors for fiscal 2020, confirming that the Board of Directors functions effectively based on a comprehensive judgment. It also confirmed that Board meetings were attended by more than a majority of Directors, which is needed for making resolutions, and that all of the matters submitted for deliberation or reported to the Board of Directors pursuant to the Companies Act or Nippon Steel's rules were resolved or confirmed. At each of Board meetings, attended by almost all Directors, all matters on the agenda with relevant information being provided in advance were resolved after questions and answers and discussion among Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members from diverse perspectives, in light of the perspective of improving Nippon Steel's corporate value in the mid- to long-term or other various perspectives.\n\nFrom the standpoint of further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors,  NIPPON STEEL will expand opportunities for progress reports on major items submitted and reported to the Board of Directors such as the Mediumto Long-Term Management Plan, and enhance discussions with Outside Directors regarding the status of initiatives and so forth in each line of business, including opportunities outside of Board of Directors meetings, based on the opinions voiced by each Director in the effectiveness evaluation for fiscal year 2020.\n\nwho are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members, both of whom were employees of Nippon Steel, their responsibilities under important applicable laws and regulations such as the Companies Act, and Nippon Steel's rules, upon the assumption of their positions. Moreover, Nippon Steel provides opportunities for Directors to attend exchanges of opinions with outside experts and executives of other companies, as well as lectures and seminars.\n\n## Significance of having listed subsidiaries\n\nNippon Steel and its Group companies share business strategies and manage the Group as a whole, while taking into account the business characteristics of each Group company. With respect to control of the Group companies, Nippon Steel sets forth basic rules in the Rules for Control of Group companies, and ensures their appropriate application, while each Group company builds and maintains its internal control system based on autonomous internal controls, and seeks to improve measures relating to internal controls based on support, guidance, and advice from Nippon Steel. In order to ensure the independence of listed subsidiaries, each listed subsidiary confirms that the terms and conditions of transactions between the parent company and the\n\nsubsidiary are reasonably determined on the basis of general contract terms and conditions with other customers, market prices or other reasonable criteria and that the interests of the subsidiary are not harmed. Nippon Steel also recognizes that its listed subsidiaries ensure independent decisionmaking and carry out autonomous management.\n\nNippon Steel currently has five listed subsidiaries. (NS Solutions Corporation, Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd., Osaka Steel Co., Ltd., Krosaki Harima Corporation, Geostr Corporation) .Significance of having the listed subsidiaries is stated in the Corporate Governance Report, '5. Other Special Circumstances which may have Material Impact on Corporate Governance.'\n\n## Strategic Shareholdings\n\n## Policy on Strategic Shareholdings\n\nNippon Steel, from the standpoint of sustainable growth and improvement of its corporate value in the mid- to long-term, believes that it is extremely important to maintain and develop the relationships of trust and alliance with its extensive range of business partners and alliance partners both in Japan and overseas, which have been cultivated through its business activities over the years. Accordingly, Nippon Steel shall continue to hold strategic shareholdings which are judged to contribute to maintaining and strengthening its business foundation such as the business relationships and alliance relationships between Nippon Steel and the investees, enhancing the profitability of both parties, and thereby improving the corporate value of Nippon Steel and the Group. Regarding companies for which Nippon Steel confirms, after sufficient dialogues, to be able to achieve the objectives described above without holding their shares, the Company intends to proceeds   with the sale of shares in such companies.\n\n## Examination of the Appropriateness of the Strategic Shareholdings\n\nNippon Steel confirms the appropriateness of its strategic shareholdings by specifically examining all shareholdings to determine, among others, whether the purpose of each shareholding is appropriate and whether the benefit and risk associated with each shareholding is commensurate with the cost of capital. Of these shareholdings, each shareholding with the market value exceeding a certain threshold is examined each year at the Board of Directors. The total market value of the shareholdings examined at the Board of Directors accounts\n\nfor approximately 90% of the total market value of the strategic shareholdings held by Nippon Steel on a consolidated basis (as of March 31, 2021).\n\nThe number of stocks held as strategic shareholdings by Nippon Steel on a non-consolidated basis was 495, as of October 1, 2012, when Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation was founded, while 301 stocks were held as of March 31, 2021 (the total value on the balance sheet was \u00a5262.6 billion). (Despite an increase due to the merger with Nippon Steel Nisshin Co., Ltd. on April 1, 2020, the number of stocks held decreased by 7 from March 31, 2020, and the total value on the balance sheet increased by 24.7 billion yen partly due to rises in stock prices.)\n\n## Basic Policy on Exercise of Voting Rights Concerning Strategic Shareholdings\n\nRegarding the voting rights concerning each strategic shareholding, Nippon Steel exercises its voting rights upon comprehensively evaluating whether the agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders of the investee company contributes to the improvement of the respective corporate values of Nippon Steel and the investee company.\n\nSpecifically, Nippon Steel formulates criteria for the exercise of voting rights which set forth guidelines for judgment according to the type of agenda items such as the appropriation of surplus, the election of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, etc., and exercises its voting rights based on these criteria together with the results of the examination of the appropriateness of the strategic shareholdings mentioned above.\n\n## Policy for Dialogues with Shareholders and Investors\n\nWith a view to achieving sustainable growth and improvement of Nippon Steel's corporate value in the mid- to long-term, Nippon Steel takes various measures to enhance constructive dialogues with the shareholders. The dialogues with the shareholders and investors are generally supervised by the Director responsible for General Administration and the Director responsible for Accounting and Finance, and the General Administration Division and the Accounting & Finance Division work in conjunction with other divisions of Nippon Steel to enhance the measures. Opinions and other\n\ncomments received from the shareholders and investors are reported and fed back to the Board of Directors and others responsible for the dialogues with the shareholders and investors on a regular basis.\n\n'Nippon Steel Corporate Disclosure and Dialogue Policy'\n\nNippon Steel's website\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.nipponsteel.com/en/ir/ management/disclosure.html\n\nPlease see details on corporate governance in Nippon Steel's Corporate Governance Report and Securities Report.\n\nCorporate Governance Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.nipponsteel.com/csr/governance/pdf/cg\\_report.pdf\n\nSecurities Report\n\nhttps://www.nipponsteel.com/ir/pdf/nipponsteel\\_jp\\_br\\_2020\\_all.pdf",

I have long been involved in various administration policy issues concerning personnel and labor affairs, and also have an experience of being at the forefront of diplomacy in an ASEAN member country. I have therefore been grateful that I can make use of my experiences and share my diverse perspectives and values in discussions at Nippon Steel's Board of Directors meetings. I have encouraged Nippon Steel to make aggressive efforts mainly to pursue safety, which is the most important management issue for the steel industry, and to promote diversity and inclusion (D&I), including the extensive participation in our labor force of women and men from outside Japan. The development of overseas business operations and its global management issues are other areas of great interest to me. I also strived to clearly express my opinions on a wide range of topics, by acting as a bridge between the Company and its shareholders and other stakeholders. In this regard, I am pleased to see that what I suggested has materialized, including the nationwide development of a safety and health management system based on the ISO standards, and the strengthening of D&I efforts.\n\nNippon Steel faces a very harsh business environment.\n\nOverseas we have to develop strategic developments in line with the global trend of 'local production and local consumption' in which each country intends to produce major goods in its own country. In Japan, we need to further strengthen competitiveness through efficient production of top-class products. In these contexts, I have been involved in the decision-making of various efforts to strengthen the long-term earnings base, such as the large-scale acquisition project of an integrated steelmaker in India with ArcelorMittal, and the structural reform of domestic production facilities including the suspension of operation of some blast furnaces, and reorganization of steel plants. Throughout discussions at the Board of Directors meetings, I confirmed strong commitment to the thorough preparation and realization of the projects of those working in the executive departments. I have been so impressed with Nippon Steel's resilience in the face of adverse conditions.\n\nAs for corporate governance, I believe that Nippon Steel as a whole is moving in the right direction. While the above-mentioned\n\nDiversity and Inclusion (D&I) is one of our important elements in achieving sustainable growth toward becoming 'the best steelmaker with world-leading capabilities' Director\n\nI am engaged in audit work in the hope of contributing to the cycle of operational improvement, including safety and disaster prevention.\n\nNoriko Iki\n\nrestructuring of the steelworks and the reduction of directors are leading to a slimmer management system, the transition to a Company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee has driven the Board of Directors to carry out more active discussions. With regard to the management of the Board of Directors, efforts are being made to enhance prior explanation of the agenda items and reduce the time taken for explanation at the Board meetings. At the beginning of each meeting, the President presents management topics of the times and share his views on the global situation in his own words. This is very useful for us to understand the background of the agenda issues submitted.\n\nAs stated in the Medium- to Long-term Management Plan released in March 2021, the Challenge to Zero-Carbon Steel in 2050 is one of the biggest management issues going forward. This will require extremely high levels of innovation and a large amount of R&D costs. And this must be implemented while undertaking the structural reforms we have planned. While it would be important to ask for support to the government and to work toward developing various national projects, in my view, more than anything, the key to our medium-to-long term future will be how to secure and nurture excellent human resources who will lead development efforts and generate profits through the advancement of business. Openness to welcoming diverse human resources, as well as inclusion to prevent them from leaving the company, increase their engagement, and maximize their capabilities, are indispensable elements. This is also true for achieving the Medium- to Long-term Management Plan of sustainable growth with the aim of becoming 'the best steelmaker with world-leading capabilities.'\n\nI highly appreciate Nippon Steel's recent decision to address D&I head-on as a management issue, but I must say that this was a relatively slow start. KPIs such as the number of female managers are quite ambitious relative to the current situation, but I am hoping that efforts will continue to be made with more extended goals, in order to gain appeal to working for our Company. Above all, I think it is important to communicate these efforts and their progress to employees and outside the Company.\n\nLastly, I would like to continue to make every effort possible as an outside director to ensure that this outstanding company can work with all stakeholders to increase its corporate value.\n\nDirector (Audit & Supervisory Advisory Committee Member) Hiroshi Obayashi\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI was appointed as Outside Director and Audit & Supervisory Advisory Committee Member of Nippon Steel in 2020, after serving as its Outside Audit & Supervisory Advisory Board Member. My main assignment concerning audits covers a wide range of items, including safety, disaster prevention, quality assurance, environment, compliance, information security, and financial reporting.\n\nimprove the performance of self-defense fire defense units, 4) more active risk assessment activities based on company-wide guidelines, and 5) evaluation by third parties.\n\nNippon Steel places top priority in safety and disaster prevention at steelworks and other manufacturing sites, based on its Management Principles which state 'We provide products and services that benefit society, and grow in partnership with our customers.'\n\nThis is what I and other Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Advisory Committee Members place utmost importance on. During our field surveys, we change into work clothes, wear long boots, and on occasion climb up a narrow ladder to a high workplace, and listen to explanation by workers, as a part of efforts to understand the situation. Let me now offer a few comments about audits concerning safety and disaster prevention.\n\nAt Nippon Steel's manufacturing sites nationwide, every day starts with the greeting 'Go-anzen ni!' (Stay safe), by executives and employees alike. The main steelmaking process is to extract iron from iron ore, a main raw material, in a blast furnace, heat and cool the steel that was made from it, and then use large hot strip mills to roll and cut it into products of various shapes. Melted iron reaches 1,600\u00b0C and semifinished products may weigh tons. They are moved around huge worksites and there is always a risk of serious accidents.\n\nThat is why numerous measures for safety and disaster prevention have been implemented. Safety measures include 1) development of a mechanical safety system that restricts access to operating plants, 2) reduction of manual work through automation and remote control, 3) on-site instruction and training by experts, and 4) training at a risk-experiencing facility utilizing virtual reality (VR) IT tools. Fire and other disaster prevention measures include 1) first-action training following nine scenarios, 2) training at the Disaster Prevention Learning Center in order not to lose memories of accidents, 3) training to\n\nAs a result of experiencing field surveys and other opportunities, I have come to highly evaluate the level of safety and disaster prevention measures and responses of Nippon Steel. The accident cause reports are a good example. These reports use cross-sectional maps and formulas to confirm the possibility of an accident, and identify the cause of an accident. They are highly reliable and I would even think they could be used for an appraisal that would be submitted to the court as such. I heard that these valuable materials are promptly shared by other workplaces and used in education and training, which I believe will bring the benefit of great outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, there was also an unfortunate regrettable incidence. A veteran of more than a decade of experience, who was in a position to teach young employees, encountered an unexpected sudden shutdown of a large facility. He entered the danger zone for inspection although he was aware of the basic rules not to do so, and suffered an injury. This has made me realize once again the need to more deeply consider human psychology and behavior in an emergency situation and add measures to prevent recurrence.\n\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Advisory Committee Members strive to express candid opinions in dialogue with the executives in workplaces during the field surveys. We also share with the management what we have learned and felt concerning the management during the field surveys. We sincerely hope to contribute to the cycle of operational improvement, including safety and disaster prevention, through audits.\n\nI hope that everyone at our worksites will be aware that accidents can occur no matter how much they implement the preventive measures, and will further refine their sensitivity and awareness of hazards and improve their ability to do so. We will continue to fulfill the duties of auditing with our wishes to be of help.",
