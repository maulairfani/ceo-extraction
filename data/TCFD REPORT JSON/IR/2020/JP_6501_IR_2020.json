From the perspective of sustainability, activities targeting climate change and human rights have quickly emerged as the most urgent issues worldwide, including in Japan.\n\nAfter the disruption of the past year, even capitalism itself is seeing a transformation from the long-practiced 'shareholder capitalism' to 'stakeholder capitalism,' which prioritizes long-term value creation for a wide range of stakeholders. In addition to economic value, in the context of corporate activities, a greater emphasis is now being placed on environmental value and social value. Last year's Integrated Report demonstrated how the environmental changes brought on by the pandemic provided an opportunity to achieve things that we could not have achieved in the past. In keeping with emerging global demands, the Social Innovation Business has worked to offer remote, contactless, and automated solutions. By responding to these changes in the business environment, Hitachi posted an adjusted operating income ratio in fiscal 2020 of 6.5% in its five sectors-IT, Energy, Industry, Mobility, and Smart Life-all despite the negative effects of COVID-19. Although this figure represents a decline of two percentage points compared with the previous year, it exceeded the initial forecast of 5.3%. Though our response has allowed for an ideal V-shaped recovery following the decline into negative profits in fiscal 2008, Hitachi has continued to change. By embracing social innovation, Hitachi has been able to target structural reforms that allow it to better generate social innovations and create a solid profit\n\n## Stakeholder capitalism\n\nThe notion that a company creates long-term value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, local communities, and shareholders.\n\n## Social Innovation Business\n\nBusiness that resolves a variety of issues faced by society and customers in a broad range of fields, especially social infrastructure, through the use of information technology (IT) and co-creation with diverse partners.",

Furthermore, by strengthening cash management, we have increased operating cash flow by approximately \u00a5230 billion year over year and established a strong business base poised for sustainable growth in the future.\n\nThese results are entirely due to the efforts of our employees. By making the health and safety of our employees, their families, customers, and business partners our top priority last fiscal year, we established a strong remote work environment that allowed us to focus our efforts on supporting customers and maintaining social infrastructures. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the employees who adapted themselves to the new normal and bravely continued to perform their duties in keeping with the changing needs of customers and society as a whole.\n\n## Fiscal 2020 saw progress in expanding the Lumada business and strengthening the business portfolio\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Hitachi's Lumada business continued to grow despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Lumada has expanded steadily since it was first offered in 2016, and in November of last year, we started the Lumada Alliance Program, which was followed by the opening of the Lumada Innovation Hub Tokyo in April of this year. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of GlobalLogic, a leading U.S.-based digital engineering services company, which will enable us to further strengthen our global rollout and increase sales from 1.1 trillion yen in fiscal 2020 to 1.6 trillion yen in fiscal 2021, with the goal of accelerating this to 3 trillion yen by fiscal 2025.\n\nUntil now, we have strengthened the business portfolio with a focus on becoming a company with business that can compete as a leader in the global market. Securing competitiveness is an essential condition in achieving digital solutions that will bring about social innovations that generate new value.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we made substantial progress in strengthening our five sectors and reorganizing our business portfolio with a focus on readjusting capital relationships with listed subsidiaries. In addition to the sell-off of Hitachi Chemical in April 2020, in May of that year, we converted Hitachi High-Tech Corporation into a full subsidiary. Hitachi High-Tech boasts top of the line measurement and analysis technologies and undertakes business involving in-vitro diagnostics as well as semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In July 2020, we acquired ABB's power grids business, which has the top level market share and advanced technologies. This acquisition, which brought with it more than 15,000 customers in about 90 countries worldwide and welcomed approximately 36,000 outstanding employees into the Hitachi Group, contributed to the strengthening of our management base, which is essential to accelerating the rollout of Hitachi's Social Innovation Business on a global scale. Specifically, to effectively utilize the global operations of Hitachi ABB Power Grids throughout the entire organization, we are currently promoting the construction of common ERP systems and global shared services. From this, we expect to achieve cumulative cost reductions of 70 billion yen and 100 billion yen in these two fields, respectively, by fiscal 2025. In January 2021, we launched Hitachi Astemo through the integration of Hitachi Automotive Systems with three Honda affiliates: Keihin Corporation, Showa Corporation, and Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd. These integrations will streamline the development of core parts and solutions in the shift toward electric power, which represents the key to developing the next-generation of automobiles, while securing a leading position and creating mobility solutions for the future. In April 2021, a decision was made to sell off Hitachi Metals by the end of this fiscal year. Moving forward, Hitachi Metals will strengthen its competitiveness and recover profitability under an ownership group led by the Bain Capital Consortium.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we decided to pull out of business operations on the Horizon project, the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the United Kingdom. In the nuclear power business, Hitachi will focus on the decommissioning and reactivation of power plants in Japan, a task of great social significance to society. Hitachi has been involved in the nuclear power business for 50 years, and we look forward to fulfilling our responsibilities through this business in the future as well, in line with the Japanese government's energy policies.\n\nThe strength of our global business portfolio, which was built through a comprehensive process of business selection and concentration, was demonstrated throughout COVID-19. Even as we maintain the competitiveness of each individual business, we will further refine those strengths to demonstrate comprehensive capabilities in the context of digital solutions.\n\n## Lumada business\n\nBusiness that realizes social innovations through solutions and services that apply Hitachi's advanced digital technologies.\n\nP.12\n\n## Lumada Alliance Program\n\nA program that builds ecosystems through an open innovation community based on matching with diverse partners to resolve social issues that cannot easily be overcome by a single company alone and accelerate social innovations that create value.\n\n## Lumada Innovation Hub Tokyo\n\nThe flagship location for the Lumada Innovation Hub, which serves as a hub for cocreation activities, connecting customers and partners to create innovations and creating new value by combining their respective knowledge and ideas.",

Involved in the construction of production lines and logistic systems using industrial robots for customers in the automotive, aerospace, e-commerce, and medical device industries, mainly in North America.\n\n## Hitachi ABB Power Grids\n\nBegan operations in July 2020, following the acquisition of the power grids business from ABB, a major heavy electrical equipment company headquartered in Switzerland. Provides the world's most advanced power transmission and distribution systems, products, and services, including micro-grids that achieve highly reliable electric power supply, and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission systems that enable large-scale energy transmission over long distances. In October 2021, the company's name was changed to Hitachi Energy, to show a strengthened commitment to sustainable energy in the future.\n\n## In /fiscal 2021, we will complete the transition to a 'growth mode'\n\nFiscal 2021 is the final year of the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, in which we declared that Hitachi would become a global leader in the Social Innovation Business.\n\nOur first area of focus will be to accelerate the global rollout of the Lumada business with the acquisition of GlobalLogic. GlobalLogic develops software for customers in fields such as healthcare, telecommunications, manufacturing, and the automotive sector, leveraging the strength of some 21,000 digital specialists and eight co-creation bases worldwide. Based on dialogues with customers, GlobalLogic provides solutions that resolve issues from a customer perspective, and we feel that this business demonstrates a high affinity with Hitachi's Lumada platform. Boasting strong trust relationships with customers and a customer retention rate of more than 90%, one of GlobalLogic's most attractive features in terms of technical capabilities is the scope of 'Chip-to-Cloud' development, which enables collaborations ranging from frontline data and micro-programs in devices to cloud environments. By making GlobalLogic part of the Hitachi Group, we will strengthen co-creation with customers on a global scale. At the same time, we will combine GlobalLogic's engineering capabilities with Hitachi's system development capabilities to strengthen the development and provision of globally scalable applications and services, thereby accelerating DX in social infrastructure throughout the world.\n\nWe have established the major framework for future growth by acquiring powerful assets in a range of business domains, including JR Automation in 2019, Hitachi High-Tech and Hitachi ABB Power Grids in 2020, and Hitachi Astemo in 2021. Moving forward, we will leverage these assets to demonstrate synergy with digital technologies in each region and create an even more robust Hitachi.\n\nIn the past, Hitachi Astemo operated in the Smart Life sector, but starting from fiscal 2021, Hitachi Astemo will operate as an independent segment (the Automotive Systems Segment), as we aim to accelerate business growth in six segments. Although the effects of COVID-19 still linger, we will secure an adjusted operating income ratio of 8% in fiscal 2021, and in fiscal 2022, the first year of the new Mid-term Management Plan, we will bring this figure above 10%. We will position fiscal 2021 as the year in which we complete the transition to a growth mode, as we work to further strengthen profitability.\n\n## Becoming a platform provider that brings about DX for society\n\nEver since its establishment in 1910, Hitachi has taken a 'product out' approach, bringing about innovations and responding to customer needs through product development and the leveraging of outstanding technical capabilities. Since the beginning of the 2000s, however, we have shifted our mindset from a product-oriented to a customer-oriented approach, as we strive to transform into a company that provides social innovations. The most significant change in direction toward customer-oriented co-creation took place in 2016, when we launched the Lumada business amid the rapid proliferation of digital technologies.\n\nIn this context, 'customer-oriented' refers to an approach built on collaborating to discover and resolve the issues faced by customers. For example, if a customer in the manufacturing industry that owns several plants needs to reduce lead-time and increase quality, we share those management issues and work together to devise the ideal solution.\n\nIn recent years, the social issues that dominate our headlines have become increasingly complex and diverse, as can be seen throughout the world in the context of climate change, aging populations, natural disasters, and the resulting fragmentation of supply chains. We are seeing a growing demand to resolve these social issues not through an extension of existing solutions, but by using 'value' as a starting point, with a view toward future society and the value that should be provided to make that society a reality. There are limits, however, to the issues that Hitachi can resolve on its own. To bring about social innovations that will create value in people's lives, it is essential that we undertake co-creation with a range of diverse stakeholders, including customers and partners. We believe that this presents an ideal opportunity to apply the strength of open approaches, one of the unique features of Lumada. By leveraging this strength, we have made Lumada an open platform that welcomes many stakeholders, and we have kicked off the Lumada Alliance Program to build an ecosystem that enables us to provide approaches and solutions to",

        "page_content": "social problems together with those stakeholders. Through the open innovation community that Hitachi provides, we will combine the diverse knowledge and expertise of our partners and create new solutions to social issues that would have been difficult to resolve alone. The solutions created through this process are registered in the Lumada Solution Hub where they can be further used by a variety of customers and partners to achieve a chain of value creation and continuous innovation. The Lumada Alliance Program already includes dozens of customer and partner companies. It is important to continue creating innovation through products and promoting business from a customer perspective, but we expect to see an increasing number of social issues that cannot be resolved without close collaboration and activities involving multiple companies. We are aware that as the public face of the Lumada business, Hitachi will be required to demonstrate strong leadership while exemplifying the social values we hope to advance.\n\nFurthermore, to resolve the issues unique to countries and regions throughout the world, we must provide a venue for co-creation, designed to promote discussion and increase awareness of customers' issues while developing solutions. With this in mind, Hitachi has established 11 co-creation bases around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Thailand, and China. This year, we added eight co-creation bases run by GlobalLogic, mainly in Europe and the Americas. The Lumada Innovation Hub Tokyo opened this spring to gather DX specialists and to promote practical co-creation using real-world data. All co-creation bases are connected virtually to form a venue for embodying ideas to promote the development and provision of solutions more efficiently. We will continue to promote co-creation from a medium- to long-term perspective using the Ky \u014d s \u014d -no-Mori  innovation base, as well as through collaboration and cocreation with research agencies in Japan and around the world.\n\nI have personally been conducting outreach activities to raise broader awareness of Hitachi as a company that promotes DX in social infrastructures on a global scale, and I am extremely pleased to see that recently we have received an increasing number of positive reactions from outside the company.\n\nFor example, Hitachi is recognized as a Leader based on its' completeness of  vision and ability to execution in the '2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms report' which evaluates providers of industrial IoT platforms*. In addition, in June of this year, Hitachi was recognized for promoting the DX business using Lumada, as well as for its in-house digital applications, receiving the Grand Prix in the DX Stocks 2021 awards from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lumada Solution Hub\n\nA platform that gathers and catalogs new solutions developed through co-creation and enables those solutions to be built and introduced quickly and easily in cloud environments.\n\n- * Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms, Eric Goodness, et al.,19 October 2020\n\n## Gartner Disclaimer\n\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.

        "page_content": "## OT \u00d7 IT \u00d7 Products\n\nHitachi offers operational technology (OT) cultivated mainly in the social infrastructure field, along with advanced information technology (IT) and products. Hitachi's strength is in its ability to realize DX for customers and society by combining these three elements.\n\n## Focusing on three /fields: the Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety\n\nHitachi has always strived to improve people's quality of life and increase value for partner companies by making maximum use of its strengths in 'OT x IT x Products' and offering consumer-centric digital solutions that use the Lumada platform, based on ideas from the customer's perspective. When thinking about the future from a value perspective, we need to create an ideal vision of people's lives at a certain point in the future-for example, in 2050and then back track from that vision to determine what we should do now and what we should prepare. Thinking from that perspective, there are three fields in which Hitachi can create new value for society through the Social Innovation Business, and in which Hitachi can grow: the Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety.\n\nI would like to talk for a moment about Hitachi's vision for this future society and people's lives in the context of these three fields. In the environmental field, we will contribute to achieving a decarbonized, resource-efficient society. Hitachi will contribute to building a new society, mainly through the power grids business, which supports the transition to renewable energy; the automotive systems business, which promotes the transition to electric vehicles and other forms of electric power to achieve a decarbonized society; and the railway systems business, which accelerates green mobility.\n\nFor example, the society of the future will use electric power supplied by wind power generation. However, the locations where wind power generators can be installed are limited, so achieving this goal will require technologies that can supply energy efficiently across long distances. We will respond to these needs by developing solutions that incorporate direct current power transmission, transformer stations, and transformer devices. Replacing gasoline with electricity is one solution for achieving a society in which people are able to use carbon-free, next-generation automobiles. Rather than creating these solutions as an extension of existing technologies and businesses, we need to back track from this future vision and study issues such as power generation and energy storage before deciding how best to move forward.\n\nOur goal in the second key field of resilience is to achieve a society that can withstand the fragmentation of public services and social systems arising as a result of natural disasters and insufficient resources. We need to build a resilient society that can recover quickly and protect people's lifestyles even in the face of disaster. Countries around the world are confronting aging infrastructure while also investing in digitization against the backdrop of rapid urbanization and population increases. Governments and companies must face the possibility of a decreasing labor force due to an aging population, as well as a resulting decline in economic activity. In the industrial world, amid continuing globalization and digitalization, and with the backdrop of insufficient resources, there is a growing demand for management systems that provide support to global supply chains and these systems could become a source of competitive superiority for other companies. In response to these issues, we will support sustainable public services and corporate activities by providing platforms for digital services that target public institutions and the financial industry; robotics SI and other innovative digital solutions as well as logistics services that link various parts of the supply chain, such as manufacturing, warehouses, and distribution; along with cybersecurity that protects all of these component elements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Finally, in the security & safety field, as we enter an era in which it is said that people will live for 100 years, we will strive for a society in which everyone can live active lives, enjoying health in both body and mind. To help achieve this, Hitachi will develop and provide the mobility and building services and connected appliances required to build cities and support safe and healthy lifestyles from childhood to old age. In addition, Hitachi will spearhead the development of healthcare solutions that support healthy lifestyles for everyone throughout their entire lives. In creating the next generation of healthcare solutions, we must go beyond simply testing and treatment, we need to support healthy living through the entire life cycle, from prevention of illnesses through to the senior years, when long-term care is needed. We must also provide individualized healthcare and build healthcare systems that meet the diverse needs of different individuals and regions. In addition to contributing to testing and treatment through in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) technologies, particle therapy systems and pharmaceutical manufacturing solutions, we will improve people's quality of life by providing new healthcare services using data obtained from those systems and devices.\n\n## The environment: An urgent issue Aiming for carbon neutrality\n\nAmong the three fields mentioned above, there is no doubt that environmental issues are the most urgent. Earlier, I mentioned how Hitachi's businesses contribute to a decarbonized, resource-efficient society, but Hitachi's in-house corporate activities are also working toward this goal.\n\nHitachi declared its intention to achieve carbon neutrality at in-house business offices and production bases by fiscal 2030, and in December 2020, we were certified under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for these activities. In January 2020, Hitachi's Omika Works became the first factory operated by a Japanese company to be listed in the World Economic Forum Lighthouse under the 'most advanced factory' category. The efficiency-boosting activities undertaken at Omika Works will be expanded throughout the entire value chain. Hitachi aims to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire value chain together with our customers by fiscal 2050. In April of this year, we appointed Executive Vice President Alistair Dormer as Chief Environmental Officer to accelerate these activities. We also incorporated environmental value into the compensation structure for executives as a KPI starting from April 2021 to promote a greater awareness of reducing CO2 emissions in the context of day-to-day operations. We will accelerate the formulation and execution of environmental strategies as a leading company in the creation of environmental value, on par with the activities of leading environmentally-oriented companies.\n\n## Fostering human resources with the ability to empathize with society\n\nThe value of human resources is an important element of Hitachi's sustainable growth. As I mentioned last year, in our efforts to promote the Social Innovation Business, it is essential that each Hitachi employee see social issues as relevant to their own lives. Each individual must take on the challenges faced by customers, markets, and regions throughout the world, and offer solutions. To do this, we will need to make a transition to job-based HR management, in which the right people are assigned to the appropriate positions according to their own goals and abilities.\n\nIn the work culture that we are aiming to create, employees announce the social issues that they want to take on. The company can contribute to these efforts by recognizing employees for their determination to take on these issues. In last year's Integrated Report, I gave an example of an assignment where I personally felt a strong motivation and sense of satisfaction, when I was in charge of introducing the Autonomous decentralized Transport Operation control System (ATOS)-a transport management system for the Tokyo area-in collaboration with East Japan Railway Company about 25 years ago. A real sense that you are contributing to society and words of appreciation from the customers are the driving force that creates a sense of autonomy\n\n## Particle therapy system for cancer treatment\n\nA treatment system that projects a particle beam (e.g., proton beam or carbon beam) to destroy or kill cancer cells.

I want to transform this positive force into motivational energy for the growth of Hitachi as a whole. We are putting in place an environment to support autonomy, including the 'Make a difference!' in-house idea contest that began in 2015, and the Future Investment Division, an organization established directly under the president four years ago. In addition, Hitachi has conducted studies of new business creation and fields to be strengthened in the medium and long term based on trends in next-generation technologies and changes in the world at large.\n\n## '\u7a7a\u2f30\u552f\u76e1\u5b5a\u8aa0' - Feel empathy with heart empty and contribute to people with sincerity: The empathetic mind\n\nHitachi is driven by people with empathetic minds. This has been true throughout Hitachi's history. Hitachi was founded as a venture company by Namihei Odaira in 1910. Ever since its establishment, based on the corporate philosophy of 'Contributing to society through the development of superior, original technology and products,' Hitachi has put forward the founding concepts of harmony, sincerity, and a pioneering spirit, and has placed great value on a venture spirit. At the entrance to the Hitachi Central Research Laboratory, you will find the words of Kumeo Baba, one of Hitachi's founders, who said: 'Empty your mind, and devote yourself to sincerity.' One of the Chinese characters he uses is ' \u5b5a ,' which is said to represent a mother bird protecting her eggs. Similarly, when we interact with customers, it is important that we adopt the stance of expressing empathy, putting aside our ego, and devoting ourselves to sincerity, transcending self-interest. I have personally taken the words 'Feel empathy with heart empty and contribute to people with sincerity' as a personal motto, and I strongly believe this is the mindset that should be adopted by every employee involved in the Social Innovation Business as well as the next generation of leaders who will drive that business. Empathy brings greater happiness than self-interest. We will focus our efforts on fostering employees who see social issues as their own, involve those around them with passion, and strive to achieve goals together.\n\n## The role of the CEO and the essential attributes of next-generation leaders\n\nI believe that the role of the CEO is to present a vision, lay out a path toward realizing that vision, and communicate this to others. I often say to future leaders, 'Leaders must always see things from the perspectives of time, regions, and value, and pick up on trends.' If you think about the values in each region, which change over time, then what needs to be done now will become clear, in the context of social, environmental, and economic value. Based on this view, the quality demanded of a leader is the ability to present a vision of how Hitachi's assets should be used to achieve a richer society, lay out a road map for realizing that vision, and communicate that road map to society.\n\nWhen thinking about the company's vision, the important thing is how we define a rich society and people's happiness. I believe that society must enable each individual to freely pursue and realize his or her own form of happiness. We can make society more comfortable and convenient through the evolution of digital technologies and progress in robotics and AI, but humans ultimately control these technologies, so the central assumption is that people are able to use AI, robotics, and other technologies. This year, Hitachi established principles guiding the ethical use of AI, and in the context of ethics training for engineers as well, we will continue to communicate the importance of human-centric innovations.",

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are top priorities in corporate management and it is understood as responsibilities to society. To further merge business and sustainability, Hitachi established the Executive Sustainability Committee, comprised of members of the Senior Executive Committee (where I serve as Chairman) along with CEOs from the various business units and General Managers from the various Head Office divisions, to discuss and decide on important policies and initiatives.\n\nRegarding human resources, we will increase engagement with employees and the effective use of human resources on a global scale, and at the same time promote diversity and inclusion, with the goal of increasing the ratio of both female and non-Japanese executives and corporate officers to 30% by fiscal 2030. Hitachi will also strengthen its response to issues related to human rights that have come to light recently by conducting partner audits and building a human rights risk management structure. With regard to corporate governance, even looking at the composition of the Board of Directors, it is clear that we have built a structure that emphasizes independence and diversity with independent directors accounting for 10 out of 13 board members, six of whom are non-Japanese. We have also recently introduced environmental indexes into the evaluation of executive compensation, and we are strengthening risk management as well, for example, in terms of compliance, crisis, and business risks.\n\nAfter making clear to all shareholders our policies regarding the allocation of management resources, we will ensure a stable increase in dividends, while at the same time considering the possibility of conducting share buybacks at the appropriate time, as part of efforts to share the fruits of growth with stakeholders.\n\nHitachi's ideal image as a global leader in the Social Innovation Business is directly in line with its public perception as a next-generation leader. We will continue our efforts to gain the trust of those around us by emphasizing openness and transparency while involving others with an empathetic attitude. At Hitachi, we believe that a true leader is not someone who stands at the head of the line and leads the way. Instead, a true leader looks toward the future with great perspective, gained from encountering new ideas while working tirelessly to implement policies that result in the best possible future for everyone. I will take every necessary step to bring Hitachi closer to this ideal image of a global leader. I look forward to your continued support as we continue this work together.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nP.42",

The name 'Lumada' is a coined word that combines the words 'illuminate' and 'data.' It expresses Hitachi's desire to create value through digital technologies, respond to the needs of customers and society, and help in addressing issues and growing businesses.\n\n## Components of Lumada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital innovation platform\n\nLumada's digital innovation platform gathers advanced digital technologies such as AI and analytics. To create a better society through digital transformation, it is important to adopt cyber physical systems that leverage IoT;\n\nin other words, create a cycle of feedback in which AI and other technologies established in the cloud (in cyberspace) are used to visualize and analyze data gathered from the real world, and from that solutions are returned to the real world in real time.\n\nThrough this cycle, the real world is transformed into a place where new value is constantly being created to keep up with change. The digital innovation platform creates and accelerates this chain of value creation. The thing that makes this platform unique is that it adopts an open architecture that connects not only Hitachi's original technologies but also other companies' products and platforms to provide a combination of multiple digital technologies, products, and platforms.\n\n2\n\n## Knowledge of industries and business\n\nHitachi has knowledge and expertise in a wide range of industries and businesses, including electric power, railways, manufacturing, and finance, as well as digital solutions where value has been verified through co-creation with customers. Universal solutions and customer cases applied as models have been accumulated through Lumada to enable the rapid rollout and use of these solutions and expertise. The number and scope of fields is growing with each passing year, and the number of customer cases has already exceeded 1,000. Hitachi is utilizing the expertise amassed through Lumada to quickly propose and provide solutions to the issues faced by customers and society.\n\nIn one example, Lumada is used by an American truck leasing company in its maintenance operations. The company uses data to monitor the status of its trucks, and then, through AI, the system analyzes and forecasts which parts might break down, and when, suggesting replacements before those failures occur. This enables efficient maintenance and prevents lost opportunities that might arise due to mechanical failures. We will continue to create a library of solutions and customer cases in a variety of industries and businesses, resolving issues by applying Lumada's AI and analytics technologies.\n\nHitachi Integrated Report 2021\n\n12 Hitachi Integrated Report 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe future is unpredictable, and a variety of social issues are coming to light. Amid these trends, there is growing demand throughout the world for digital transformation (DX) toward a better society that makes effective use of digital technologies. Hitachi sees the rapidly increasing volumes of data made accessible through the Internet of Things (IoT) as a source of value. Using data to pick up on signs of change, we will create new value with customers for the next stage of society, as part of our efforts to achieve social innovations that increase corporate value for customers and the quality of life (QoL) for people everywhere. This is the essence of Lumada.\n\n## Customers and business partners\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Co-creation with customers and partners\n\nHitachi has prepared numerous co-creation methods for creating new value with customers and partners.\n\n## NEXPERIENCE\n\nNEXPERIENCE is a methodology for creating new businesses and services through collaboration with partners. It enables us to create social innovation and navigate solutions for customers in three main steps: 1) discovering issues, 2) proposing solutions, and 3) verifying value. We will promote co-creation by proposing appropriate methods and content to customers through NEXPERIENCE and applying those methods and content in keeping with the unique characteristics of the themes in question and the status of studies, from the discovery of an issue-seeking out new business themes based on societal trends-to creating and verifying ideas that transform data into value and formulating strategies for new business development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lumada Innovation Hub: Combining and connecting knowledge and ideas\n\nLumada Innovation Hub serves as a hub for co-creation activities, connecting customers and partners to innovate and generate new value by combining their respective knowledge and ideas.\n\nThe Lumada Innovation Hub Tokyo, which opened in April 2021 as a flagship site that links stakeholders virtually and physically and transcends the boundaries of industries, such as customers, partners, and start-up companies, with diverse talent and co-creation facilities on the front lines of the digital transformation, such as Hitachi's 'Ky \u014d s \u014d -no-Mori' (literally translated as 'forest of collaborative innovation') and Omika Works, which was selected in the World Economic Forum Lighthouse as a most advanced factory. By bringing various people together and combining diverse digital knowledge and technologies, we will create new value for society.\n\n## Lumada Alliance Program: Connecting partners\n\nThe Lumada Alliance Program offers an open innovation community that resolves social issues which cannot be overcome by a single company alone and accelerates social innovations that create value. This program builds ecosystems which partners can contribute to their respective fields of specialization.\n\nHitachi has put forward a vision of 'mutually utilizing technologies, know-how, and ideas, and creating new value from data, to contribute to improving people's quality of life and to the sustainable development of society and economies; then, reinvesting this value in a positive cycle that promotes growth for all the parties involved.' The Lumada Alliance Program welcomes partners that support this vision, to work together in taking on the challenges of various societal matters and regional issues that could not be resolved by a single company alone. To resolve these issues, Hitachi matches diverse partners that demonstrate various strengthsfor example, digital solutions, global delivery, and technical support capabilities-to bring about a wave of 'N-to-N' co-creation and accelerate the creation of social innovation.\n\n## Lumada Solution Hub: Connecting solutions and technologies\n\nThe Lumada Solution Hub is a platform that gathers and catalogs new solutions developed through co-creation and enables customers to build and deploy those solutions quickly and easily on the cloud.\n\nSolutions that have been proven effective by Hitachi and its partners are listed on the Lumada Solution Hub portal site. Customers can search for solutions according to their relevant conditions, such as industry, themes, and approaches, and then refer to detailed information of each solution, including lead time, costs, and other related information.\n\nIn this way, they can quickly and accurately find the solutions and digital technologies that they need. The Lumada Solution Hub also provides a framework for building the chosen solutions in the customer's own cloud environment. By selecting and building optimum solutions quickly and easily, these customers can dramatically reduce the time and cost required in comparison to conventional processes. After system construction is complete, Hitachi offers a variety of shared services to support system operation and management-for example, service status monitoring and system operation proxy services-to facilitate the transition from proof of concept (PoC) to full-scale operating environments and rapid rollout to multiple bases. Hitachi and its partners use the Lumada Solution Hub to achieve n-fold scaling of solutions with a track record of generating value and to further expand that value.\n\nThrough Lumada, Hitachi has enhanced the three elements that are essential to digital transformations: digital technology platforms for social innovation, the accumulation of diverse and generalized knowledge of industries and businesses, and co-creation methods that quickly connect these platforms and knowledge with solutions and provide a framework for establishing and expanding the cycle of value creation. By effectively utilizing advanced digital technologies and proven solutions, and by maximizing the value of co-creation, Hitachi will work with customers and partners to achieve social innovations that create new value in the lives of people everywhere.\n\nGover\n\nnance\n\nData",

The rebuilding of the automotive systems business, the withdrawal from the internal manufacturing of flat-panel TV business, and the transfer of the HDD business all served to improve profitability, allowing Hitachi to concentrate on the Social Innovation Business that so effectively leverages the Company's strengths.\n\nIn fiscal 2012, Hitachi consolidated operations into six strong groups and worked to speed up management through an integration of operations. Hitachi's operating income ratio in fiscal 2012, the final year of the Mid-term Management Plan, fell short of the 5% target due to a write-off associated with a sharp drop in material prices, as well as the booking of structural reform costs and reduced capacity utilization amid the economic slowdown in China and Europe.\n\nHowever, it improved to 4.7% thanks to cost structure reforms in line with the Hitachi Smart Transformation Project. In addition, after dropping to 11.2% in fiscal 2008, the stockholders' equity ratio recovered to 21.2% in fiscal 2012, while the D/E ratio narrowed to 0.75x over the same period, indicating a clear improvement in Hitachi's financial position as the Company worked toward the establishment of a stable earnings base.\n\n## Challenges Ahead\n\n- \u00b7 Further improvements in business profitability\n- \u00b7 Strengthening the service businesses\n- \u00b7 Global business development and establishing a management base that makes that possible\n\nBuilding a Foundation for Growth\n\n## The Swapping Out of Businesses\n\n## Looking Back\n\nHitachi during the period covered by the 2015 Mid-term Management Plan substantially revised its business portfolio as it sought to build a foundation for growth. The Company acquired Pentaho, which develops and markets big data analytics software, as part of its aim to strengthen and expand the global value chain in big data utilization, while also removing from consolidation its thermal power, air-conditioning, and batteries businesses. In addition, Hitachi moved its rail business headquarters to the U.K. as part of its effort to promote the globalization of the Company, appointing Alistair Dormer, currently serving as executive vice president, as the global CEO of the Company's rail business. In personnel evaluation systems, Hitachi introduced 'Global Performance Management' as a mechanism under which compensation directly reflects personal performance assessments as well as the global common standards for job roles.\n\nIn fiscal 2015, the last year in the mid-term plan, the target was not achieved due to a delayed response to changing market conditions, including in the telecommunication and networks business, as well as losses due to insufficient management at a large overseas project. Another factor contributing to underperformance was the greater-than-expected increase in structural reform costs due to an acceleration in structural reforms following a deterioration in the market environment for the infrastructure systems, power distribution, and construction machinery businesses. However, operating income reached 600 billion yen, with the operating income ratio at 6%, signaling stability in profitability and an improved ability to generate cash.\n\n## Challenges Ahead\n\n- \u00b7 Accelerate management's speed to more quickly respond to changes in the market environment\n- \u00b7 Strengthen project management\n- \u00b7 Take action regarding unprofitable businesses\n\n## 2018 Mid-term Management Plan\n\nFY2016-2018\n\nAchieving Growth in Social Innovation\n\n## Utilizing Digital Technologies\n\n## Looking Back\n\nWith the goal of strengthening front-line functions, including the number of sales, system engineers, and consultants, and creating a system of collaborative cooperation with our customers, Hitachi from fiscal 2016 moved from a product-specific company system to a three-level system, composed of front-line, platform, and product tiers. With the three-level system, Hitachi bolstered the management speed. Specifically, business units (BUs), which had been subdivided from the former in-house companies to develop and provide services closely to the customer, and group companies, including listed subsidiaries, were positioned to each level. We also strengthened project management and worked to improve profitability at individual businesses. With the aim of enhancing on a global basis the front-line functions central to the Social Innovation Business, we acquired 100% stakes in Ansaldo STS, which supplies signal equipment and control systems to 30 or more countries and regions, and Sullair, which manufactures, sells, and services air compressors to about 4,000 customers, mainly in North America. In December 2018, we signed an agreement for the acquisition of ABB's power grids business. The goal of each of these is the acquisition of a robust global sales network and the expansion of the Social Innovation Business.\n\nTo add to this, we launched Lumada in May 2016. Lumada takes the essential technologies for delivering advanced solutions, including AI, analytics, security, robotics and control technologies distributed across the Company and applies them to a common platform, creating a system that comprehensively and organically leverages the resources of the entire Hitachi Group to quickly and flexibly create new innovations. Thanks to a steady increase in customer collaborations, Lumada business revenues are trending as planned and have already exceeded 1 trillion yen.\n\nMoreover, in addition to reorganizing our business portfolio, including selling off listed subsidiaries with little connection to the core Social Innovation Business, we continued to reform our cost structure, which contributed to the adjusted operating income ratio meeting our Mid-term Management Plan target and reaching a record level.\n\n## Challenges Ahead\n\n- \u00b7 Aggressive investment in key areas of focus\n- \u00b7 Improved capital efficiency\n- \u00b7 Accelerated innovation and active use of digital technologies with a focus on Lumada\n\nV",

To achieve this goal, we will focus on three fields-the Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety-as we contribute to resolving social and corporate management issues, and strive to improve value for customer companies and quality of life for people everywhere.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Performance\n\n|                                                       | FY2019 results           | FY2020 results           | FY2021 forecast*         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Revenues                                              | 8,767.2 billion yen      | 8,729.1 billion yen      | 9,500.0 billion yen      |\n| Adjusted operating income / ratio                     | 661.8 billion yen / 7.5% | 495.1 billion yen / 5.7% | 740.0 billion yen / 7.8% |\n| EBIT / EBIT ratio                                     | 183.6 billion yen / 2.1% | 850.2 billion yen / 9.7% | 820.0 billion yen / 8.6% |\n| Net income attributable to Hitachi, Ltd. stockholders | 87.5 billion yen         | 501.6 billion yen        | 550.0 billion yen        |\n| Overseas revenues ratio                               | 48 %                     | 52 %                     | -

        "page_content": "## Creating a Growth Story for the Next 10 Years with the Lumada Business at the Core\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ\n\nYou were appointed President and COO in June of this year. Can you tell us about your aspirations for this position?\n\nFor about 10 years following the financial crisis that began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, successive management teams implemented drastic structural reforms to transform Hitachi into a global company. They took a number of steps to accomplish this, one of the most prominent examples was the restructuring of the company's business portfolio. Now that these structural reforms have had time to take effect and serve as the foundation for growth, we are approaching a business portfolio that is wellequipped for future success. My mission is to create a path for Hitachi's continued growth over the next 10 years based on this foundation. This is very satisfying and meaningful work.\n\nBack when I was serving as CTO, Mr. Nakanishi, the former Executive Chairman, communicated a strong message to me when he told me that 'the Social Innovation Business is Hitachi's core.' This stuck with me and ever since I have worked to execute reforms at research laboratories worldwide to strengthen Hitachi's innovation capabilities. First, I undertook a major change in direction as I prioritized creating an R&D structure close to society and the customers. Specifically, rather than using the conventional approach of creating products as an extension of fundamental research and elemental technologies, I encouraged an approach of identifying social issues and back-casting from future forecasts to define our key research themes. Ever since we began the Lumada business in 2016, we have invested immense energy into expanding this business. Since my first encounter with database research, I have been confident that data was an immensely valuable resource which would be a driving force that could change the world. Now that we are approaching the final form of the business portfolio, we will create and follow a path in which the Lumada business serves as a driver for Hitachi to achieve the next stage of growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease tell us about the direction and key initiatives driving the creation of the next Mid-term Management Plan.\n\nTo guide future growth, we must tie the assets acquired through large-scale M&As into a comprehensive plan to steadily increase corporate value. The key words in this regard are simplicity, digitalization, and globalization of management.",

        "page_content": "Hitachi's business can be separated into three main categories: IT, projects, and design/manufacturing. Management must be simple to ensure the efficient use of assets characterized by different risks and growth mechanisms. Acting with speed is also crucial in achieving continued growth that keeps pace with changes in the world at large. Finally, the effective use of digital technologies in management is key to increasing speed.\n\nThe structural reforms that Hitachi has implemented have been executed to achieve global growth. We are promoting integration with overseas companies that have recently joined the Hitachi Group, including Hitachi ABB Power Grids and GlobalLogic, and we are making a full-scale shift toward management from a global perspective. We are building an operational structure that will enable us to demonstrate effective Group synergies, while at the same time preserving the speed and culture of a top global company. To do this, even as we press forward with the globalization of existing Head Office functions, we will further accelerate growth by establishing smaller global corporate functions in each region to complement those Head Office functions.\n\nQ\n\n## You said that the Lumada business holds the key to growth. How much progress do you think has been made toward realizing the future vision for this business?\n\nTo me, the starting point for Lumada is co-creation with customers aimed at resolving social issues. When we began Lumada, we said that researchers would share social issues with customers and undertake co-creation to resolve those issues, and then transfer the insight gained from these frameworks and systems to the business side, to provide them in the form of the Social Innovation Business. Up to now, we have expanded co-creation-style SI with a particular focus on the IT sector and have used this approach to vigorously promote the Lumada business. The IT sector has grown to the point where it currently generates about half of Hitachi's income, but it only accounts for about 20% of sales. Our next management goal is to accelerate the digitalization of project and design/manufacturing assets, which account for most of the Hitachi Group's sales. Digitalization is moving forward in businesses that demonstrate a strong affinity with the Lumada business, such as the Building Systems Business Unit. However, from this point onward we will go one step further, placing all of Hitachi's businesses on the Lumada platform to accelerate growth. In addition, we need to promote full-scale globalization, mainly through Hitachi Vantara, which drives the Lumada business on a global scale. In that sense, I would say that right now, we have achieved 30% or 40% of our 'aspirations.'\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids, which we acquired last year, is positioned not as a business in the Energy sector but rather as a core business that supports the environment, one of\n\nthe three fields where we can demonstrate growth through Lumada. As we move forward toward our goal of carbon neutrality for the Hitachi Group as a whole, Hitachi ABB Power Grids has an important role to play as a crosscutting business that creates synergies with all sectors. GlobalLogic is similar in that its business demonstrates great value and synergies with all sectors. We will link these newly secured resources with all our businesses while working to accelerate global expansion and growth in the Lumada business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Moving forward, what are the main markets and /fields where you expect to see the most growth in the Lumada business?\n\nThe markets where I expect to see the most growth are North America and India. North America-particularly the United States-is investing aggressively in infrastructure, and various domestic industries are seeing a recovery, so I see this as a growth market with huge potential. India, which has become the world's largest source of digital talent, is also a key area that we approach alongside North America as we work to expand the Lumada business. Japan also has many companies that create outstanding products, so I think this market has great potential as well.\n\nThe sectors that demonstrate the greatest growth potential include the Industry sector and the Smart Life sector, especially the field of genetic engineering, which includes regenerative medicine and iPS cells.\n\nQ\n\n## In closing, please tell us President Kojima's guiding principles, and give us a message for stakeholders.\n\nHitachi's core principle of contributing to society through the power of technology remains unchanged. With that in mind, I will continue my unwavering efforts to maintain a bird's-eye view of all technological innovation as it unfolds-not only Hitachi's technologies but also technologies in completely different fields-and to constantly monitor those trends. This approach has been shaped by my own pride as a researcher.\n\nI can declare without fear that we will undoubtedly achieve our goal of recording '10 years of growth' moving forward, and I will embody in my actions the motto 'Always follow through on your promises,' which I once saw displayed at the Central Research Laboratory and which has become a central part of my philosophy. During this coming decade of growth, one major theme will be to enhance returns to all stakeholders, including shareholders, investors and employees. My goal is to gain people's understanding and support by communicating my own thoughts on matters such as growth strategies and to comment on the progress of those strategies in a transparent and easy-to-understand way.",

This is the essence of Lumada. Leveraging the strengths of Operational Technology (OT) \u00d7 Information Technology (IT) \u00d7 Products that Hitachi has cultivated over many years, we will accelerate the Social Innovation Business using Lumada on a global scale.\n\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19, the global business community faced a major turning point, and a variety of hidden social issues came to light. Digital solutions that take full advantage of digital technologies such as AI and IoT are essential in this era of the new normal. By building new partnerships that transcend the boundaries of various industries, we will provide even greater value to society.\n\n## Grow Highly Pro/fitable Businesses with Digital Technology\n\n## Achieve Robust Growth in the Lumada Business\n\nThe Lumada business has a high adjusted operating income ratio (more than 10%), and revenues are increasing. We posted revenues of 1.11 trillion yen in fiscal 2020 and expect 1.58 trillion yen in fiscal 2021. Moving forward, through integration with GlobalLogic, for which the acquisition was completed in July 2021, we will strive to capture growth in the rapidly expanding global market for digital transformation to achieve both high business growth and profitability with revenues of 3 trillion yen and adjusted operating income of 500 billion yen in fiscal 2025.\n\nIn the Lumada business, we leverage the expertise that Hitachi has accumulated in the fields of OT (operation and control technologies), IT (including AI and analytics) and products (including industrial devices, rolling stock, and elevators, etc.) to provide digital solutions that resolve customers' issues and increase social, environmental and economic value.\n\nThe Lumada business comprises the Lumada core business and Lumada related businesses. The 'Lumada core business' is a digital solutions business that solves management and business issues by converting customer data into value using\n\n## Lumada Business Revenues\n\n13%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAI and other digital technologies. 'Lumada related businesses' are defined as advanced products and systems businesses, centered on OT and products that have prospects for synergies with the Lumada core business.\n\nIn the railway systems business, for example, OT and product data are collected through sensors installed in rolling stock, signaling systems, and other elements positioned as Lumada related businesses, and these data are analyzed using the digital solutions that represent the Lumada core business to detect signs of failure. This enables efficient maintenance to prevent failures before they occur and to increase operating rates. In this way, digital solutions enable a shift toward highvalue-added, high-profit operations in the related OT and Product businesses.\n\nBy undertaking both the Lumada core business and Lumada related businesses while using the domain knowledge and assets cultivated through the five sectors and at Hitachi Astemo, we will deepen the integration of OT \u00d7 IT \u00d7 Products and expand these businesses.\n\nIn April 2021, Hitachi was authorized by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry as a 'DX-certified operator.' In June 2021, we received the DX Grand Prix 2021 award in 'Digital Transformation Brand 2021,' which is selected by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This award recognizes that Lumada has been used to support the acceleration of DX for customers and society,\n\nand that it has already tied into the rollout of global business, demonstrating that DX is an engine for changing entire companies. We see this as the most significant recognition yet that Hitachi itself continues to undergo a transformation through the Lumada business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLumada is used in a wide range of operational\n\nfields at Hitachi, including sales, procurement, production, maintenance, and management. In fiscal 2020, there was a cumulative total of 257 examples of applications related to inhouse IT services, more than twice the number in fiscal 2018.",

        "page_content": "## Further Acceleration of Global Rollout\n\nUp to now, Hitachi has acquired industry expertise and OT assets through M&As, as part of efforts to build a strong global business portfolio. In July 2020, we completed the acquisition of ABB's power grids business and established Hitachi ABB Power Grids. In May 2020, Hitachi High-Tech, which has outstanding measurement and analysis technologies, was converted into a full subsidiary, and in January 2021, we launched Hitachi Astemo through the integration of Hitachi Automotive Systems with three Honda affiliates: Keihin Corporation, Showa Corporation, and Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd. In the overseas home appliance business, we established a joint venture with the Turkish company Ar\u00e7elik in July 2021.\n\nIn terms of the framework for promoting Lumada, the new Hitachi Vantara (formed in January 2020 through the integration of the American subsidiary Hitachi Vantara with Hitachi Consulting Corporation) has driven the growth of business and the creation of global strategies for the Lumada business, in collaboration with the Hitachi Group as a whole.\n\nFurther accelerating the growth of Hitachi's Lumada business requires talent to undertake co-creation with customers throughout the world and digital engineering capabilities to further accelerate development. The American company GlobalLogic, which was acquired in July 2021, is a leading company in the rapidly growing digital engineering service market. It has more than 21,000 employees in 14 countries around the world who develop and provide solutions with an emphasis on co-creation with customers at 30 development bases, along with eight co-creation bases mainly in Europe and the Americas. It demonstrates advanced and broad ranging\n\n'Chip-to-Cloud' engineering capabilities, from the chips that gather frontline data and offer control functions to the extraction and analysis of data in cloud environments. GlobalLogic has a track record of providing solutions to more than 400 customer companies in industries including healthcare, telecommunications, manufacturing and automobiles.\n\nMoving forward, Hitachi and GlobalLogic will target the customer bases of both companies, starting with the crossselling of services that leverage their respective strengths and then utilizing the software assets accumulated through the Lumada business. By utilizing Lumada's existing assets, GlobalLogic will not only apply its current business model, in which unit prices are based on worker hours, but also undertake the broad rollout of business based on the use of software assets. We will use GlobalLogic's digital engineering capabilities to increase the added value of Hitachi's broad ranging products and will strive to develop new Lumada solutions by combining these products with software created through co-creation with customers. There is a substantial market for these solutions, and we plan to promote them in Europe and North America, where Hitachi has already established a track record. GlobalLogic will undertake these activities in collaboration with Hitachi ABB Power Grids, Hitachi Rail, JR Automation and other Hitachi entities.\n\n## Delivering Digital Value on a Larger Canvas, Hitachi Delivering Digital Value on a Larger Canvas, Hitachi\n\nGlobalLogic has partnered with some of the world's top brands, including many of 'Fortune 500' companies. As our customers and partners, they have leveraged our digital engineering expertise to create innovative products, new platforms, and amazing experiences. Together we have been able to create innovations with greater added value through our design and digital engineering-helping clients see the world not as it is, but as it should be.\n\nWe are delighted to join Hitachi, one of the most trusted engineering brands in the world. Hitachi and GlobalLogic understand IoT and digital technologies well and are using them to innovate digital solutions that benefit society. In addition, Lumada's basic concept of 'developing a platform and building an ecosystem that maximizes the value of design, engineering, and data application technologies' is actually the very same approach as we take when we build solutions for our clients.\n\nShashank Samant CEO, GlobalLogic, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI am convinced that the coming together of these two companies, which share the same purpose, passion, and vision, will be a very powerful combination that will bring innovation to society through digital technology.\n\nFurthermore, while our strength lies in engagement systems in areas close to consumers, Hitachi has a large customer base around the world, especially in the industrial sector.\n\nTherefore, we ourselves can contribute to the Lumada customer cases, and we believe that we can leverage Lumada in the future.\n\nBy joining together with Hitachi, we have expanded our canvas to a more global scale and Hitachi will enable us to realize our vision for the next five to seven years ahead of schedule, and through these synergies with Hitachi, we will provide new value to society.",

We also use our broad-ranging product lineup to gather data from physical\n\nspace into cyberspace (the cloud) and to analyze the data gathered through GlobalLogic's digital engineering capabilities. Furthermore, controlling physical space in real time based on the results of data analyses requires mission-critical SI skills and expertise. Hitachi will leverage these strengths to accelerate the digital transformation for social infrastructures.\n\n## Expanding company-wide Lumada business by providing total solutions ranging from products to DX applications which digitally optimize social infrastructure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Chain of Value Creation and Expansion to Ecosystems That Initiate Cycles\n\nHitachi has undertaken three initiatives to expand Lumada's co-creation activities and the use of digital solutions, and to promote a chain of value creation and ecosystems that initiate positive cycles: the Lumada Solution Hub, which connects solutions and technologies; the Lumada Alliance Program, which connects partners; and Lumada Innovation Hub, which connects knowledge and ideas.\n\nThere are more than 100 solutions currently registered in the Lumada Solution Hub, which was kicked off in April 2019. The Lumada Alliance Program, which started in November 2020, already has more than 40 member companies that support the vision of 'Contributing to the continuous development of societies and economies and to improving people's quality of life by creating new value from data through the mutual use of alliance members' technologies, expertise, and ideas, and then creating a cycle of value that results in mutual growth for all parties involved.' In April 2021, the Lumada Innovation Hub Tokyo opened as a venue for new open innovations, further contributing to these applications.\n\nHitachi promotes the use of existing assets including advanced digital technologies and customer cases cultivated up to now, applying and enhancing these assets in the form of Lumada solutions for a variety of fields. At the same time, through open innovations with partners transcending the boundaries of industries, we are building and expanding an ecosystem\n\nthat resolves a variety of social issues and generates a chain of value creation.\n\n## Strengthening and Developing the Talent to Drive the Social Innovation Business\n\nDiverse global talent is essential in responding to increasingly diverse social issues in the Social Innovation Business. We are accelerating Diversity & Inclusion activities to enable every Hitachi employee to demonstrate that value and to support Hitachi's growth. We also actively promote activities aimed at strengthening and developing the digital talent that drives DX, so that they can handle the core digital solutions that combine OT and IT, and accelerate the Social Innovation Business on a global scale.\n\nHitachi has built new training systems for digital talent, including front-office staff and data scientists, and offers human resource development through programs that combine classroom courses and on-the-job training (OJT). Starting with new graduate hiring in fiscal 2021, we have enhanced our ability to secure outstanding manpower through a 'digital talent recruiting course' targeting R&D positions and data scientists in the digital field, which allows compensation to be set individually in accordance with an individual's skills and experience.\n\nOur digital talent plan called for an increase from 30,000 persons in fiscal 2019 to more than 37,000 by the end of fiscal 2021, and the number had already reached 35,000 at the",

With the digitalization of social infrastructures, payment methods are also changing, as cashless payments are rapidly gaining popularity, for example, in the form of credit cards and QR codes. There are high expectations for the provision of systems that ensure safe and secure handling of important paymentrelated data and which are resilient even in the face of natural disasters or failures, as well as the creation of services based on that payment information which offer even greater convenience for users. The IoT Payment Platform Service offered by Hitachi combines knowledge of finances and settlements with IT and OT, creating payment services that adapt to changes in user lifestyles. Hitachi also offers support to vendors in the use of data related to applications and operations, as well as consultations when services are introduced. These are solutions that Hitachi is uniquely equipped to provide, based on its extensive experience with products and systems that support people's lives, including financial systems and social infrastructures. These solutions also support the realization of smart cities and Mobility as a Service (MaaS).\n\nServices using these platforms are already being tested and applied throughout the world.\n\nIn proof-of-concept tests conducted jointly with the Italian public transportation operator Trentino Trasporti S.p.A.,\n\nHitachi installed communication terminals in rolling stock and buses, as well as at train stations and bus stops, exchanging positional information via apps installed in the passengers' smartphones. In this way, we established a framework for automatically calculating and collecting the passengers' fares. Passengers enjoy more comfortable transportation because they no longer need to carry paper tickets or IC cards or stop to pay fares before or after their ride. Public transportation companies can cut down on facilities such as ticket machines and ticket gates, thereby reducing initial investments and maintenance costs. Trentino Trasporti has decided to put these services into operation from 2021.\n\nIn Japan, Hitachi is collaborating with ZENRIN CO., LTD., which has data and expertise related to map information, in the development of MaaS for tourism. Together, we developed an application for seamless operations on a smartphone, from searches for tourist routes to purchasing and payments for transportation and tourism tickets based on positional information. This service supports comfortable and convenient tourism activities, as users can receive information that is useful for both travel and tourism on a map, in keeping with their current location and movement. The effects of this service will be verified through proof-of-concept tests scheduled to be conducted by ZENRIN in Nagasaki City in 2021. Together, we are working to build and provide service platforms that are ideally suited to the needs of each individual tourist.\n\n## Create a new payment method with OT \u00d7 IT \u00d7 Finance\n\n## Deliver innovative payment as a service to improve financial safety, security and resilience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nData",

In this field, Hitachi has constructed a platform for the integrated management of cell and tracing information throughout the entire value chain.\n\nRegenerative medicine products are unique in that cells collected from patients or cell donors are incubated and then injected to other patients. The safe and secure management and distribution of cell and tracing information required the construction of a new and unprecedented supply chain structure.\n\nHitachi has focused on the issues involved in the development of regenerative medicine products in the healthcare field and has developed and constructed these platforms through cocreation with various partners, including Alfresa Corporation, a Japanese ethical pharmaceutical wholesaler, as well as other pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions. Specialized knowledge from Alfresa is used in the transport and storage of patients' cells and regenerative medicine products; from consigned manufacturers in the development of\n\nmanufacturing methods and the manufacture of experimental drugs and regenerative medicine products; and from pharmaceutical companies and bio ventures in all processes and information tracing from the collection of patients' cells to the administration of regenerative medicine products. To ensure applicability, we strived for specifications that can be used as a standard by a broad range of stakeholders; for example, we conducted studies referring to actual operations and incorporated the opinions of healthcare professionals into the development of user interfaces.\n\nIn addition, we use Hitachi's digital twin solution, a Lumada solution, as an information platform for extracting, using, and analyzing OT data, such as information on equipment operation status and quality, and IT data, including planning and inventory management. By connecting the workplace data and IT data in a digital space, it becomes easier to conduct continuous and timely AI-based analyses and simulations, so it is possible to provide and support in keeping with customer needs, even in the case of services for increasing efficiency and productivity through analyses and simulations with a view toward all processes, from cell collection to drug administration.\n\n## Overview of the regenerative medicine products value chain integrated management platform\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCase\n\n3\n\n## Enhance Lumada Solutions in Combination with Hitachi ABB Power Grids' Operation Management Solutions\n\nThe operation, analysis, and optimization of asset management and field service management are important issues for customers in every industry. Hitachi ABB Power Grids has supported inspections, testing, and maintenance, as well as appropriate capital investments, to enable advanced asset management and sustainable operations by providing Digital Enterprise, a suite of operational management solutions for electric power companies and the manufacturing and mining industries. Hitachi ABB Power Grids collaborated with Hitachi Vantara to increase system scalability and enable more advanced and broad ranging data analyses by combining Digital Enterprise, which is already used by many customers, with Lumada's various technologies and solutions for data application and optimization. In addition to asset and work\n\nmanagement, Lumada solutions support customers' corporate management and operations. Hitachi will maximize the value of these solutions by providing them not only to traditional customers but also to customers and partners in Hitachi's five sectors, as well as those of Hitachi Astemo.\n\nHitachi ABB Power Grids' Digital Enterprise joins Lumada ecosystem\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The Strength of Hitachi's R&D\n\n## World-leading technology platforms and a value creation cycle \uff11\n\nThe strength of Hitachi's R&D is derived from the integration of the Hitachi Group's technology platforms and expertise in OT\u00d7IT\u00d7Products, technology development through co-creation with customers and partners, and an established value creation cycle that accumulates know-how from these processes. While adapting to changes in the business portfolio, the Hitachi Group is enhancing technology platforms in future growth areas. We integrated businesses in robotics system integration (SI), energy, and automotive parts into the Hitachi Group through the acquisition of JR Automation and the establishment of Hitachi ABB Power Grids and Hitachi Astemo to create innovations through synergies with Hitachi's assets.\n\nFor example, by combining Hitachi ABB Power Grids' worldleading grid automation, high-voltage direct current (HVDC), and power transmission and distribution product technologies with Hitachi's technology platforms, including security, 5G, and artificial intelligence (AI), the Lumada platform will be effectively used to foster businesses that contribute to the environment, such as 100% renewable energy-based power supply services, electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen stations, and data center solutions. In areas undertaken by Hitachi Astemo, such as AD/ADAS, xEV, and advanced chassis, we will leverage Hitachi's R&D capabilities in areas such as cybersecurity, AI, and over-the-air (OTA) software updates to become a global leader driving the era of CASE (connected, automated, shared, and electric).\n\nWe are also reinforcing R&D in areas such as robotics and electric motorization to further advance and innovate core products such as high-speed railways, elevators and escalators, particle beam cancer treatment systems, biochemical immuno-assay systems, inverters, and air compressors, as well as to establish the world-leading technologies that leverage our strengths in OT\u00d7IT\u00d7Products. Moving forward to the next stage of growth, we will strengthen core Lumada technologies, including 5G and AI, as well as accelerate R&D in quantum computers and regenerative medicine with a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\n## Incorporating external knowledge through co-creation 2\n\nSocial issues are becoming increasingly complex on a global scale, as in the case of climate change, urbanization, and increasing senior populations. In this backdrop, cocreation with various partners is essential to quickly creating social, environmental, and economic values. As part of its Group-wide co-creation activities, in April 2019, Hitachi launched Ky \u014d s \u014d -no-Mori, an R&D initiative to accelerate the creation of innovations, from its research base at the Central Research Laboratory in Japan. Since the launch, we have sought new business opportunities through events such as ideathons and hackathons, sharing a vision\n\naimed at resolving societal issues together with customers and partners around the globe. To promote collaboration between the co-creation centers located worldwide, the R&D network is being expanded to include the U.S. West Coast, Beijing and Guangzhou in China, and London, U.K. We are also preparing to open a base in West Sydney, Australia, in 2023.\n\n## Communicating a vision to resolve challenges faced by society through industry-government-academia collaboration\n\nThrough global industry-government-academia collaborations, we will gain insights into future social issues, create a new vision for achieving both solutions and economic growth, and strengthen activities aimed at communicating this vision to the world. In 2016, we established joint laboratories with the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Hokkaido University to accelerate activities that pick up on changes in customers and society. In 2021, forums were held to communicate a scenario created by the Hitachi-U Tokyo Laboratory to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, and the Hitachi Kyoto University Lab published BEYOND SMART LIFE, a book that summarizes social issues in 2050 along with social value proposals to resolve those issues by universities and companies. Similarly, outside of Japan, we are promoting activities to contribute to human-centric cities, for example, through a digital city project being undertaken jointly with the prestigious Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, and innovations in the medical field promoted jointly with the city of Liverpool in Australia. Through such joint activities, we are promoting innovations by backcasting from visions of the future.\n\n## Collaboration with start-ups\n\nWe are also actively investing in and collaborating with start-ups. The Corporate Venturing Office is actively involved in global innovation ecosystems to exercise open innovation and prepare for the next stage of growth, strengthening activities that pursue both disruptive technologies and business models. Through collaborations with nine start-ups in which Hitachi has invested (as of July 2021), including the health-tech company SOPHiA GENETICS SA, which agreed to a collaboration in March 2021, we are accelerating the creation of new value in fields such as life science, nextgeneration trust platforms, and computing.\n\nHappiness Planet, Ltd., was established in July 2020 as Hitachi's first inside-out initiative, with the objective of creating new industries in happiness and well-being amid COVID-19. An app business is being developed to create organizations where, using wearable devices and smartphones to measure people's sense of wellbeing and quantify the level of activity in an organization, employees can take positive action toward achieving",

This achievement was made possible by the development of a double-sided direct water-cooled power module with outstanding insulated heat dissipation characteristics, offering both high-withstand voltage and cooling performance, which enabled us to increase the inverter's voltage even while reducing its size and increasing output. In this way, we increased the electric vehicle system voltage to 800 V from past levels of around 400 V. For industrial applications, we developed an amorphous motor based on IE5 standards for energy conservation with a magnet that does not use rare earth metals and incorporated it into a scroll-type compressor, creating a highly efficient, quiet, and compact industrial air compressor that contributes to reducing CO2 emissions in industrial devices. This product was awarded the 52nd Ichimura Prize in Industry against Global Warming, Achievement Award and the 66th Okochi Memorial Production\n\n*MaaS: Mobility as a Service\n\nPrize for technologies related to high-speed railway rolling stock. We will continue our efforts to further increase the efficiency of electric drive systems. Hitachi has also produced TED-MOS \u00ae , an original SiC power device that offers both durability and low power consumption characteristics. In addition to maximizing drive efficiency in electric drive systems and achieving carbon neutrality in fiscal 2030 in Hitachi's in-house production, we will support reduction in power consumption and CO2 emissions in a variety of societal infrastructures, including electric vehicles, railways, power systems, and data centers, contributing to the realization of a carbon-free society.\n\n## Activities in the field of energy\n\nIn the energy field, Hitachi is focusing on digitalization, providing power system control and energy management systems that accommodate the growing introduction of renewable energy to contribute to a decarbonized society. We are conducting performance tests using simulations to realize high-volume systems and stable operations in renewable energy based on the world's first risk prediction type online grid control that combines normal operation and emergency measures. In demandside energy management, we will increase the efficiency of energy operations at offices and plants, using Lumada to conduct integrated analyses of real-time forecasting and historical data in Hitachi ABB Power Grids' e-mesh TM EMS solution, which optimizes operational settings for distributed and renewable energy power sources.",

Smart meters were added to various facilities at user sites, and blockchain technology was used to manage the electric power source by facility unit. This will enable digital certification of 100% renewable energy use by product or service. We have already begun operation of a Powered by Renewable Energy system verifying that renewable energy accounts for 100% of the electric power used in the 'Ky \u014d s \u014d -t \u014d ' facility of Ky \u014d s \u014d -no-Mori. Moving forward, we will contribute to realizing a decarbonized society by expanding these operations to include all aspects of the supply chain, including authentication in green procurement and the product usage and disposal stages, in collaboration with partner companies in various industries.\n\n## Initiatives for hydrogen energy\n\nIn hydrogen production and usage systems, we are developing systems and material technologies that will contribute to a sustainable hydrogen value chain. Regarding hydrogen systems, we are working with Denyo Kosan and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) to increase the efficiency of hydrogen-light oil mixed combustion power generation systems in Fukushima prefecture. In relation to changing compositions of diverse fuel types, we are applying AI control technology to increase efficiency. In large-scale blue hydrogen production systems, we have reduced water resource usage volumes by 30% compared to the past using Hitachi's original shift catalysts, which are structurally controlled to the molecular level. We are conducting verification tests on the Osaki CoolGen Project with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to achieve high-volume, low-cost, sustainable hydrogen manufacturing.\n\n## Resilience\n\nHitachi is also promoting R&D that contributes to improving customers' business resilience in response to changes in society and the environment, as well as the resilience of societal infrastructures that use digital technologies to support rapid recovery from natural disasters, pandemics, and cyberattacks.\n\nIn 2020, Hitachi's Omika Works became the first factory operated by a Japanese company to be listed in the World Economic Forum Lighthouse as a most advanced factory. To realize value chain optimization that flexibly adapts to the business environment, the high-efficiency production model and other systems from Omika Works are being deployed through co-creation in automotive, chemical, and other industries. Our goal for the future is to provide Lumada solutions that embody an N-fold expansion of industrial digital solutions that achieve overall optimization, such as planning optimization services that digitalize tacit knowledge and increase the visibility of frontline operations.\n\nIn the security field, we are promoting R&D aimed at improving resilience for human activities both in the cyber and physical worlds. In October 2020, using Hitachi's original Public Biometric Infrastructure (PBI) technologies, we began providing the 'Biometric Integrated Infrastructure Service,' a cloud service for secure biometric authentication. By combining PBI with settlement functions or access management at commercial facilities, it becomes possible to offer hands-free personal authentication. Using PBI, biometric information such as finger vein, face, or iris can be encrypted and registered in the cloud in a format that cannot be decrypted, enabling safe personal authentication and cashless settlements. This system was awarded the 2020 (63rd) Best 10 New Products Award (Masuda Prize) sponsored by the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun. Increased security is provided by using AI image analysis of people and luggage to improve the visibility of people flow and movement in public areas such as train stations and airports. Solutions such as 'high-speed human detection and tracking solutions' are being developed as COVID-19 infection prevention measures with due consideration to individual privacy.\n\n## Security & Safety\n\nHitachi strives to achieve a safe and secure society that increases quality of life through advanced R&D based on insights into the new challenges in the future brought about by climate change, COVID-19, the aging society, and digital economies.\n\n## Initiatives in medical/pharmacy for Security & Safety\n\nIn the medical and pharmacy fields, synergies are being exerted with Hitachi High-Tech, now a fully owned subsidiary. By applying image processing technologies that use machine learning to biochemical immune-assay systems in which Hitachi holds the top share, we have increased the accuracy and processing capacity of specimen analysis to accommodate COVID-19 antigen testing and antibody measurement. In diagnostic and treatment systems, the Hospital of University of Navarra in Spain received delivery of Europe's first particle beam cancer treatment system, equipped with a spot scanning technology that projects a particle beam adjusted to the shape of the cancer and a moving tissue tracking system that accurately projects the proton beam onto tumors that change position due to respiration or other bodily movement. Treatments using this system began in April 2020. In the field of regenerative medicine, Kyoto University conducted the world's first physician-initiated clinical trials for Parkinson's disease using iPS cells. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma produced the treatment cells for these trials using Hitachi's automated cell culturing system. The first clinical application of a commercial cell production system based on industryacademia collaborations represents an important first step toward the proliferation of regenerative medicine.",

Checklists in line with these principles are already being applied to actual projects at the Lumada Data Science Lab. To further enhance AI technology capabilities, we are actively participating in international AI competitions and have received top class evaluations in the fields of image and language processing. The technologies cultivated through such activities will also be applied to Lumadarelated solutions, including high-speed human detection and tracking.\n\n## Initiatives in Intellectual Properties (IPs)\n\nTo achieve SDGs and business growth, Hitachi has formulated and implemented intellectual property (IP) strategies that consists of three pillars: 'IP strategy for competitiveness,' 'IP strategy for collaboration' in the product and digital solutions fields, and 'IP for society,' in which we strive to resolve social issues through the Social Innovation Business.\n\nThe IP strategy for competitiveness is centered on acquiring and utilizing patents and other IP rights. 'IP Master Plans' customized for the nature of each business are formulated and implemented to enforce competitiveness.\n\nIn our IP strategy for collaboration, as opportunities for cocreation with our customers and partners increase through the Lumada business, we have expanded the scope of our IP activities to include not only copyrights, patents, and trade secrets but also information assets such as data and information, and we are using IP to promote partnerships and build ecosystems. For example, in the case of IP derived from a co-creation process using AI, it is important to be flexible when entering contracts with customers regarding the handling of those IP assets. Hitachi's IP division is involved in 200-300 co-creation contracts each year and supports the building of win-win relationships between Hitachi and its customers. It also supports the enhancement and expansion of the digital solutions business, promoting activities that ensure smooth responses even in the case of new regulations or new technologies such as AI, robotics, and automatic driving. These activities resulted in Hitachi, Ltd., being awarded the Intellectual Property Achievement Award within the Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry Awards in Japan for the first time in June 2020.\n\nRegarding beyond-5G/6G communications technologies, 5G testing environments have been established at our North American Silicon Valley site and Ky \u014d s \u014d -no-Mori to accelerate the development of 5G solutions. We are also accelerating R&D targeting the creation of secure, real-time control systems in 5G environments, including telepresence remote work support solutions that utilize AR glasses.\n\nIn the field of quantum computers, Hitachi is promoting R&D for silicon quantum computers with outstanding scalability through industry-government-academia collaboration. In 2020, we successfully created a prototype of the basic structure for a two-dimensional electron dot array using a silicon semiconductor and achieved the large-scale integration that is essential for industrial applications. We will continue to accelerate R&D aimed at the early application of quantum computers through collaborations in this industrygovernment-academia ecosystem.\n\nOur activities, which are rooted in Hitachi's 'IP for society' concept, work to promote the use of IP to maintain and evolve social norms. We are aggressively promoting the openness of intellectual property in certain highly public domains, contributing to solutions for global social issues. In the case of environmental issues, in fiscal 2021, we newly established the Environmental IP Enhancement Center within the Intellectual Property Division. With that, we have begun considering policies (e.g., solution creation contributing to environmental value realization, construction of IP libraries) aimed at improving environmental value from the perspective of intellectual property. Hitachi has registered the technology for the desalination of seawater to resolve water-related issues as well as the technology for a type of ink that detects changes in temperature and then changes color to help tackle food waste issues, with WIPO GREEN as a platform for environmental technology operated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). With regard to contributions to resolve social issues, Hitachi has announced to open its IP concerning the Mother & Child Health Survey in cooperation with Hokkaido University, the City of Iwamizawa, and Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd. Looking forward, we will continue to consider ways we can contribute to the resolution of social issues utilizing our IP.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Hitachi ABB Power Grids and Hitachi Astemo newly joined the Hitachi Group, dramatically expanding the IP portfolio as it relates to energy platforms, xEV, AD/ADAS, and advanced chassis. Moving forward, we will further promote the enhancement of IP globally and in the solutions field.",

Hitachi is stepping up efforts to secure and train global human resources by evolving its training, evaluation, compensation and hiring systems based on a core strategy of effecting changes in human capital management in a bid to spur innovation and create new value in the global and digital era. We are also striving to cultivate a common Hitachi Group Identity in all employees worldwide, along with the values of Harmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit that comprise the Hitachi Founding Spirit, so that we can work as One Hitachi across countries, regions, and divisions to contribute to society.\n\n## Global Human Capital Management Strategy\n\nIt is none other than the 350,000 employees of the Hitachi Group who bring about innovations and support the company's growth. In order to become a world leader in the Social Innovation Business, Hitachi has implemented a global human capital management strategy to ensure that its diverse workforce can work with a high level of engagement across countries, regions and companies, and that individuals and organizations can demonstrate their full potential. At the same time, to further grow the Social Innovation Business on a global scale, it is important to secure, assign and train optimum human resources, regardless of nationality, gender, age or other attributes, so that global-scale projects can be executed as One Hitachi. If we are to propose innovative solutions to customers and society, it is essential that each and every employee sees social issues as his or her own, and that these employees have the personal drive to bring about change. As such, cultivating a corporate culture that supports this approach is a key issue in talent management.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion\n\nHitachi is keen to create companies where employees with diverse cultural backgrounds, experiences and ways of thinking can work together. The 'Statement on Diversity and Inclusion' was created to demonstrate our commitment.\n\nDiversity is the wellspring of our innovation and our growth engine. Hitachi regards personal differences such as gender, nationality, race, religion, background, age, abled or disabled status, and sexual orientation as well as other differences, as facets of people's individuality. By respecting our employees' individualities and positioning them as an advantage, Hitachi frames its diversity and inclusion as conducive to both the individual's and the company's sustainable growth. With a diverse workforce, strong teamwork and broad experience in the global market, we will meet our customers' needs.\n\nIn 2010, Hitachi made a major change in its management directions, aiming for global growth through the Social Innovation Business. Since then, we have invested efforts into re-examining and executing talent strategies to support that growth. As of the end of March 2021, the number of Hitachi employees working overseas reached 190,000, and as the scale of overseas business increased, so too did the ratio of overseas business as part of Hitachi overall. With a view toward these changes in the company, in our HR strategies, we have promoted global human resource management that uses unified performance evaluation criteria and offers a common leadership development program for employees around the world.\n\nBy building workplaces for diverse workforce with diverse values while responding to changes in the company and in society, and by putting in place frameworks that enable each individual employee to demonstrate their value to the fullest, we are accelerating the creation of value on a global scale through the Social Innovation Business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "To further accelerate activities at the global level, we have incorporated 'Diversity and Inclusion' into our business strategies. These initiatives are led by Lorena Dellagiovanna, Hitachi's first female Vice President and Executive Officer, who serves in the capacity of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO). We believe it is important to recognize diverse values and share opinions if we are to provide optimal solutions based on an accurate understanding of the complex issues confronting society and our customers. With the goal of having members with different values on the same team sharing the same goals, we are working not only to secure and train a diverse workforce but also to create a workplace where each of these individuals can work to the best of their abilities, and bring great value to business and society.\n\nTo further progress diversity and inclusion throughout the Hitachi Group as a whole, we have included D&I as a theme\n\n## Target and Actions for Diversity & Inclusion\n\nAs part of activities aimed at achieving these goals, in fiscal 2020, we analyzed current conditions and conducted a gap analysis using external evaluation data, and also conducted interviews with business division staff. Based on the results, in April 2021, we created a Diversity & Inclusion strategy that lays out medium- and long-term goals. This strategy includes Diversity & Inclusion goals set for individual business divisions, corporate divisions, and Group companies. When setting these goals, we conducted one-on-one meetings with the CDIO and division managers to discuss how Diversity & Inclusion relate to issues in Hitachi's various business divisions, which undertake business in diverse markets and industries.\n\nIn the past, Hitachi set numerical targets (KPIs) of 10% for the ratio of both women and non-Japanese among top executives (Executive Officers and Corporate Officers), and the appointment of 800 women to management positions, to promote participation by people with different backgrounds in management decision-making, and to place more female employees in leadership roles.\n\nIn terms of empowering female employees, we have put in place structures that enable participation by more women in management decision-making. For example, we appointed one female executive level corporate officer in April 2015, and Lorena Dellagiovanna was appointed Vice President and Executive Officer in April 2021, becoming Hitachi's first female executive officer. As a result, in April 2021, there were seven female executives, meeting our target of 10%. Furthermore, in October 2020, we reached our goal of appointing 800 female managers by fiscal 2020, doubling the number compared to fiscal 2012, forming a substantial population of female candidates for executive leadership in the future.\n\nIn terms of promoting active participation by non-Japanese, six out of 13 current board directors are non-Japanese, and April 2021 saw the appointment of three new non-Japanese\n\nat the Sustainability Strategy Meeting (the Diversity and Inclusion session), where members discuss sustainability from a management perspective. We have also established a Hitachi Group Diversity and Inclusion Council, which meets once each year to discuss issues related to diversity. The Sustainability Strategy Meeting focuses on creating policies along with the management team, defining priorities on initiatives and investments, and sharing learnings from various activities, while the main goal of the Diversity and Inclusion Council is to ensure alignment with global strategies and discuss specific actions in partnership with HR Divisions at Hitachi Group companies. In addition, Group companies are also advancing diversity management in accordance with their respective challenges and circumstances at the global level. With Group companies around the world, we are working together to accelerate implementation.\n\nto the executive officer structure: Lorena Dellagiovanna as Vice President and Executive Officer, Claudio Facchin as Senior Vice President and Executive Officer and Wolfgang Mueller as Corporate Officer. There are now eight non-Japanese among Hitachi's executive level, once again reaching our goal of 10%. To further accelerate Diversity & Inclusion, in April 2021, we set a new target of 30% for the ratio of both women and non-Japanese among top executives (Executive Officers and Corporate Officers) to be reached by fiscal 2030* 1 , with a milestone of 15% to be reached by fiscal 2024. We have also set targets for diversity and gender (female managers) at the decision-making level, for business units, corporate functions, and Group companies, respectively. By promoting Diversity & Inclusion, we will continue to reflect diverse, global perspectives in management and strengthen management supervision functions.\n\nDiversity and inclusion at Hitachi matters, not just with respect to women and non-Japanese nationals, but embracing all aspects of diversity as stated in our 'Statement on Diversity and Inclusion.' For example, to promote generational diversity, the CDIO has participated in the Talent Committee and is mentoring emerging talent in addition to ad hoc programs, and the Hitachi Group has joined 'The Valuable 500,' a global movement for disability inclusion. We will continuously work to create an inclusive environment where all employees can fulfill their potential.\n\n*1 FY2030 includes personnel changes effective April 1, 2031",

        "page_content": "sustainable growth. Starting with a common human resources system for the global group companies, Hitachi aims to assign the right personnel to the right positions, allocating the best human resources to key positions on a global basis. To achieve this goal, Hitachi clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each position, as well as reporting lines, to find a common approach to human capital management globally. With this shared understanding, we endeavor to nurture an organizational culture that respects diversity while centering on individual capabilities and build a global business structure based on this culture.\n\nHitachi has introduced measures, including the Hitachi Global Grade and Global Performance Management systems, to create a human capital management platform shared globally across the entire group.\n\nHitachi launched the full-scale operation of the human capital management integrated platform in 2015, centralizing processes and measures enacted to date, with a broad range of information about its human resources, including the skills\n\n## Building Workplaces that Offer Job Satisfaction\n\nThe source of Hitachi's growth is found in building comfortable workplaces that offer job satisfaction, where Hitachi's diverse employees can work with enthusiasm and demonstrate strong performance.\n\nHitachi uses the term 'employee engagement' to refer to employees' understanding of the company's strategies and policies, as well as their job satisfaction and desire to take actions on their own initiative to bring about results. We conduct an annual global employee survey called Hitachi Insights as a way of measuring employee engagement. Top executives and managers in each workplace share the results of this survey with members of their own organizations and incorporate those results into concrete improvement measures, which in turn ties into a PDCA cycle for building workplaces that offer job satisfaction. Specifically, factors such as understanding of management policies, the status of work-style reforms, labor environments, learning opportunities and motivation for growth are presented in a clear numerical form. In this way, these elements can be prioritized and applied in the context of reexamining work-styles and improving productivity in individual workplaces, as well as HR initiatives throughout Hitachi as a whole. This annual survey also enables evaluations and reviews of specific activities, and can be tied directly into operational and workplace improvements and the measurement of impact. In 2020, we conducted the eighth annual survey, targeting approximately 200,000 employees worldwide, in 14 languages. The survey participation rate was 90%, the highest since the\n\nand career ambitions of individual employees. This platform is utilized in optimally allocating personnel around the world, discovering and grooming candidates for future leadership and management positions, and communications between managers and employees.\n\nEmployees clarify their ideal careers, and companies identify the necessary work skills and experiences. We are shifting toward job-based human resource management, whereby the best people are optimally assigned to positions in accordance with each employee's abilities and ambitions, without regard to factors such as age. More specifically, we visualize job functions by preparing job descriptions that describe the job content as well as desired skills and experiences. Several managers gather to discuss the strengths and career goals of their subordinates and conduct talent review sessions to explore options for job training and assignments. By introducing this framework, Hitachi is accelerating the switchover to the jobbased management of human resources that clarifies the work and roles of each employee as well as performance expected and achieved.\n\nsurvey was first conducted in 2013, and scores continue to increase in all categories. The overall positive evaluation rate was 64% (up 3% from last year, and up 10% vs. 2013), and the engagement index was 62% (up 2% from last year, and up 9% vs. 2013).\n\nIn addition, as part of efforts to build more comfortable workplaces, Hitachi has evolved the concept of work life balance, which strives for harmony between work and private life, promoting 'work life management,' in which each individual employee improves the quality of his or her own work and private life.\n\nIn 2020, COVID-19 had a huge impact on the work-styles of employees throughout the world. Hitachi will continue to promote working from home, along with other new and diverse work-styles, so that the diverse workforce can demonstrate their full potential in their respective environments, and also to enable recovery and continuity of corporate activities even after a natural disaster or other disruptive event. We are making improvements to remote working environments and security services that make these work-styles possible, and we will support diverse work-styles by putting in place IT environments that allow employees to work as comfortably and efficiently as they would in an office environment.",

through the Standardization of Global Operations\n\nHitachi is strengthening the Company-wide management base through a digital transformation that leverages the platforms of Hitachi ABB Power Grids, which are based on global operational know-how. We will further strengthen synergies while reducing costs, by fostering shared ERP, introducing global shared services, and building Group-wide CRM. Construction and studies are ongoing through fiscal 2021, with plans to gradually introduce these platforms from fiscal 2022 onward. In this way, we expect to achieve a cumulative cost-reduction impact of 170 billion yen by fiscal 2025.\n\n## Standardization of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems\n\nHitachi is consolidating and standardizing the ERP system applications that have been used separately at individual Hitachi Group companies. In the context of these activities, Group companies will adopt ERP templates that are based on Hitachi ABB Power Grids' global operations. By increasing the efficiency of application operations, we will shift resources, including both human resources and assets, to business competition fields, and enable a rapid response to business reorganizations. Companies targeted for early introduction are scheduled to begin operations based on these ERP templates in 2022, with integration and consolidation according to industry type to be completed by 2027.\n\n## Expanding Shared Services\n\nHitachi is expanding services that allow Company-wide management division operations to be used throughout the Group as Global Business Services (GBS). We are building global operation platforms and applying this GBS approach to optimize the operation of shared IT assets, as well as the global uniformity and operating efficiency of services and operations. Moving forward, we will use Hitachi ABB Power Grids' core\n\nbusiness systems and infrastructure service platforms to promote standardization within the Group to achieve an IT operation platform that supports global business activities and to provide this platform as a global shared service.\n\n## Building Customer Relation Management (CRM) Systems\n\nHitachi will accelerate the creation of value for customers by centralizing information on the Hitachi Group's global customers in multiple industries through shared Companywide CRM. Up to now, individual business units and Group companies managed customer information using their own respective systems, approaching customers from a front-office perspective. Now, by also centralizing information from Hitachi ABB Power Grids, which has a customer channel comprising more than 15,000 companies, we will promote collaborations that transcend business divisions and strengthen approaches to customers. Furthermore, by linking management-related data lakes, we will accelerate not only the analysis and management of customer information but also decisionmaking. System construction is scheduled for completion by fiscal 2022, and the scope of operations will be expanded gradually after that.",

Regarding listed subsidiaries, in April 2020, Hitachi sold shareholdings in Hitachi Chemical to Showa Denko, and in May 2020, Hitachi acquired the remaining shares in Hitachi HighTech, turning that company into a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd. Hitachi Metals is scheduled to be sold off before the end of fiscal 2021. This leaves Hitachi Construction Machinery as the last remaining listed subsidiary, and Hitachi continues to review its capital policy regarding this company. We will also continue to study and execute the sell-off of non-core businesses and measures targeting low-margin businesses.\n\nEnsuring the stability of the financial base is an important management issue. For this reason, we will continue our financial discipline policy of maintaining an A rating on issued instruments and a D/E ratio of less than 0.5 times. At the same time, we will ensure a return of profits with an awareness of shareholder returns, for example, through growth investments and continued increases in dividends. Our ability to generate cash is increasing steadily, and our ratings are as shown in the table below.\n\n| Rating company                                 | Long-term   | Short-term      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| S&P Global Ratings Japan  Inc.                 | A           | A-1             |\n| Moody's Japan K.K.

In fiscal 2020, despite the harsh business environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the profit ratio stayed above 5%.\n- \u00b7  As a result of strengthened cash management, in fiscal 2020, cash flows from operating activities reached approximately 800 billion yen, exceeding adjusted operating income. The operating cash flow margin was the highest ever, at 9.1%.\n- \u00b7  As a result of M&A aimed at building the business portfolio, interest-bearing debt increased, resulting in a D/E ratio of 0.54x. We will reduce interest-bearing debt and quickly improve the D/E ratio by increasing operating cash flows and selling off assets.\n- \u00b7  The payout ratio has remained between 20% and 30%, and the total of dividend payments has increased.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total Shareholder Return (TSR)\n\nThe following illustrates Hitachi's TSR, with fluctuations in dividends and stock price reflected. While continuing to improve profitability and distribute a stable dividend, Hitachi is making concerted efforts to increase shareholder value through management that is aware of its share price, based on business and financial strategies designed to improve TSR in excess of the cost of shareholders' equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                     | Past 1  Year   | Past 3 Years   | Past 3 Years                                       | Past 5 Years   | Past 5 Years   | Past 10 Years   | Past 10 Years   |\n|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                     | TSR            | TSR            | Annual  TSR                                        | TSR            | Annual  TSR    | TSR             | Annual  TSR     |\n| Hitachi share price |                |                | +62.6% +37.4% +11.2% +106.4% +15.6% +163.1% +10.2% |                |                |                 |                 |\n| TOPIX               |                | +42.1% +22.1%  | +6.9% +62.3% +10.2% +179.4% +10.8%                 |                |                |                 |                 |\n\nNote: The graph and table above show return on investment for investments made from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, taking into account dividends and stock prices as of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.

Leveraging the experience he gained at Harvard Business School and the World Bank, he has played a key role as CSO (Chief Strategy Officer) since 2018 and has driven structural reforms and the design of the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan.

In fiscal 2020, however, the D/E ratio reached 0.54x at the end of March 2021 because we used loans to procure part of the capital to acquire ABB's power grids business. We plan to quickly get that ratio back down below 0.5x, eliminating debt by allocating profits from the sell-off of assets, as well as operating cash flow, which will increase through business growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Please tell us about your approach to M&A.\n\nI have held a concurrent position as the head of the Investment Strategy Division since April of this year, and I'm able to look at investments and loans, so the financing and allocation of capital for acquisitions has been going even more smoothly than in the past. For example, we needed about one trillion yen for the acquisition of GlobalLogic, and we were able to move quickly in investigating capital financing procurement methods and simulations of the short- and medium-term impact of the acquisition on financial and management performance KPIs.\n\nIn general, when you announce that you are going to undertake an M&A project, there is a tendency for share price volatility to increase in the short term. If you want to control that volatility, it's important to clearly communicate a medium- and long-term equity story to the capital markets. In post-merger integration (PMI), the integration into consolidated management systems is completed in a comparatively short period of just a few months, but PMI takes two or three years after that to impact performance. We focus our efforts on garnering synergies in the medium to long term, as we amortize the intangible assets involved in the acquisition.\n\nIn terms of the impact of integration at Hitachi ABB Power Grids, we expect to see cost-reduction effects on a scale of about 100 billion yen by 2025, through the use of shared service\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First, please give us your thoughts on your /first year since being appointed CFO.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out in 2020, is unprecedented in the history of modern management in that this infection, representing a unique external variable, has infiltrated the economic system creating a huge impact. The thing that I emphasized first amid this crisis was returning to the basics of financial management, that is, cash flow management. We strengthened cash flow management with overall coordination of elements such as working capital, R&D investments, capital investments, and fixed costs and, as a result, in the fiscal 2020, despite a decrease in revenues and profit, the cash flow margin from operating activities was 9.1%, the highest in Hitachi's history.\n\nWe have been applying ROIC management since the first year of the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan. In addition to using online meetings worldwide, we entrench this approach within Hitachi by conducting regular training to encourage a deeper understanding of ROIC and weighted average cost of capital (WACC). I feel that by increasing the awareness of all employees through these types of day-to-day activities, the ROIC tree is tied directly into concrete actions in the various workplaces. We disclose ROIC for each sector to outside parties as well, and within Hitachi, we can monitor each business in even greater detail. ROIC is included in all inhouse budget and settlement-related materials so that we can conduct discussions based on this. Even amid the COVID-19 crisis, we are enhancing ROIC management on a deeper level; for example, we see businesses with a negative ROIC spread (the difference between ROIC and capital costs) as causing damage to enterprise value, so we reexamine our business strategies in those cases.\n\nIn addition to taking out loans with financial institutions, Hitachi issues corporate bonds and commercial paper.

We are also promoting cross-selling and synergies with Lumada in each business sector and, in some cases, the impact has already become apparent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Please tell us your thoughts on capital allocation.\n\nIn capital allocation, we have no immediate plans for largescale loans or capital increases, but we will continue to increase operating cash flow through growth investments and secure funding by constantly switching out assets. We consider returns to shareholders to be an important theme. Our intent is to allocate about one-third of capital to each of three areas: returns to shareholders and repayment of loans, growth investments, and capital investments. We will also further enhance R&D investments, targeting cumulative investments of about 1.5 trillion yen over the three years from fiscal 2022.\n\nGrowth investments are growth drivers that increase enterprise value. There are two ways of achieving our goals for growth investments: 'organic growth,' where we increase the added value of Hitachi's own killer technologies, as in the case of particle beam therapy systems, and 'inorganic growth,' which is achieved by incorporating businesses from outside, like when we acquired ABB's power grids business. Capital growth strategies comprise regional strategies and sector strategies with a three-dimensional approach, considering the timeline for investment efficiency.\n\nIn regional strategies, we monitor the status of marginal income (increased profits in line with additional invested resources) for both the domestic and overseas business, and we are shifting the focus toward businesses with higher marginal income (overseas business in many cases). Moving forward, it will become increasingly important to factor in our global strategies and design optimum strategies specific to each region. There are two important elements to the sector strategies: the perspective of market positioning for Hitachi's products and services (positioning strategy), and resourcebased strategies, which leverage Hitachi's technical superiority and other resources. In addition, we will back-cast from an ideal form of the future and study capital allocation taking into account R&D investments, M&A targets, and the economic and management viability of those initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are your basic policies for returns to shareholders?\n\nWe will aim for returns to shareholders on three levels: not only dividends and share buybacks but also increasing stock prices (capital gains). We will monitor dividend yield levels in other businesses as well and aim for a stable increase in dividends based on business growth. We will consider and undertake share buybacks while conducting a variety of simulations, keeping in mind business growth, the sell-off of assets, and stock price levels.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to increase shareholder value through intensive engagement with the capital markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In closing, please give us your thoughts on non-/financial KPI information and disclosure of that information.\n\nThere are four important non-financial KPIs: governance, climate change measures, the value of human resources, and the happiness of human society.\n\nGovernance can be very difficult to present in the form of a KPI, but in addition to the diverse background and experience of the people who make up the Board of Directors, my goal is to be able to explain to outside parties how these directors engage in exchanges of constructive criticism with the executive side, as well as discussions related to ethical behavior at board meetings.\n\nIn climate change measures, Hitachi has set a target KPI of achieving carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2030, and we are accelerating these activities. We need to look at this problem from a broader perspective, however, so I believe we must show an aggressive stance and involvement in activities targeting this problem, while introducing how Hitachi will reduce CO2 emissions in an economic society and how we can contribute to the global environment, presenting actual examples of R&D activities and specific contributions through business.\n\nIn terms of the value of human resources, first, it is important to explain clearly how we encourage diversity and inclusion within Hitachi. I can say with confidence that by fostering and training our people worldwide through day-to-day corporate activities in which we cultivate our technical strengths, we support the international competitiveness of Japan as a whole. I would like to set this as a kind of KPI, as a means of communicating Hitachi's contributions.\n\nFinally, and I think that this is the most important perspective, there is the question of whether our corporate activities help to improve the public welfare; in other words, whether people's lives are more culturally oriented, healthier, and richer because of our corporate activities. This is the starting point for all corporate activities, so I want to keep this in mind as a corporate citizen and ensure that we continue to ask these questions of ourselves.\n\nMy approach to non-financial KPIs is to maintain a focus on these four perspectives and use these as key indexes for management as we undertake activities that tie into increased corporate value.",

Global digital transformation (DX) investments are also expected to expand\n\n## Progress on the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan\n\n## Strengthening support for customers' digital transformation (DX) and expanding the global business\n\nIn the IT sector, for some time now, we have striven to transform Hitachi into a global leader and promoted the global rollout of the Lumada business, mainly through our U.S. subsidiary, Hitachi Vantara, taking advantage of the track record we have built in Japan. We will accelerate this transformation by accurately identifying needs in regions throughout the world, based on our management policies of strengthening support for customers' digital transformation (DX) and expanding the global business. The acquisition of GlobalLogic in the United States, which was completed on schedule in July 2021, was one of the concrete measures for achieving this goal. GlobalLogic is a leading company that uses digital technologies to innovate customers' business through advanced digital engineering and experience design capabilities. It has a customer base comprising more than 400 companies worldwide and has many outstanding digital technology specialists at its eight co-creation design centers and 30 delivery bases. When providing digital transformation support to customers, it is essential to first identify the customer's management issues and to propose and offer appropriate solutions. Co-creation with customers, backed up by innovative digital engineering capabilities, is critical to the success of this approach. Highly reliable SI capabilities are also required to integrate those solutions with the customer's existing operating systems. In the IT sector, we will accelerate growth in the digital transformation market, which is expanding on a global scale, by combining the strengths of Hitachi and GlobalLogic.\n\nSpecifically, we will expand the global business not only through cross-selling but also by working with GlobalLogic to promote business that applies software assets scaled through the Lumada Solution Hub, based on more than 1,000 Lumada customer cases already accumulated by Hitachi. We will also increase the added value of Hitachi's products through GlobalLogic's digital engineering capabilities and tie this into the development of new Lumada solutions that bring about digital transformations in social infrastructures. In this way, we will utilize the business footprint of companies such as Hitachi ABB Power Grids, Hitachi Rail, and JR Automation in North America and Europe, the world's largest IT markets, and rapidly expand the global rollout of the Lumada business.\n\nrapidly in all industries, with the average annual growth rate predicted to reach 15% by 2024. Meanwhile, in Japan, even as traditional IT investments remain flat, DX investments are expected to continue growing, due to the shift to the cloud and the use of AI, mainly in public services and financial institutions.\n\n## N-fold expansion of the Lumada business\n\nTo expand the Lumada business, we are promoting the N-fold expansion of solutions and services provided to customers (Scale of Digital). For example, using Hitachi's original annealing-based quantum computer 'CMOS annealing' (combination optimization processing technology), known as quantum-inspired computers that do not make use of quantum effects, and by working with customers in a wide range of industries, including Sompo Japan Insurance, the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and KDDI Research, we conduct tests, develop and improve solutions to solve a variety of combination optimization problems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCMOS annealing\n\nWith the 'Biometrics Integrated Infrastructure Service' that is based on Hitachi's proprietary Public Biometric Infrastructure (PBI) technology, we have achieved contactless personal authentication and cashless settlements using finger vein authentication, and we are expanding co-creation with multiple customers. Scale of Digital is evolving steadily in a variety of fields-for example, 'Materials Development Solutions,' which apply materials informatics to develop and evaluate new materials using AI, data analysis, and other digital technologies-and has been adopted by around 40 companies, and 'Risk Simulator for Insurance,' a medical big data analysis solution that uses predictive models to simulate future risk of hospitalization, is being applied in a growing\n\nContactless personal authentication and cashless settlements using finger vein authentication\n\n<!-- image -->",

They have been offered as a solution for optimizing equipments monitoring and productivity in the manufacturing industry. Up to now, Lumada Manufacturing Insights have been provided to customers involved in the Vehicles, Industrial Products, Metals, Mining, and Food & Beverage and other industries in North America and in the APAC and EMEA regions, and we have begun offering these services through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace as well.\n\nLumada Manufacturing Insights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contributing to the Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety\n\nHitachi provides customers with social, environmental and economic value with a focus on three fields: the Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety. In this way, we strive to contribute to realizing a sustainable society. The IT sector in particular leads the Hitachi Group as a whole toward achieving its goals through the power of digital technologies.\n\n## Environment \uff5c Promoting the use of renewable energy by optimizing the power supply/demand balance\n\nOne of the key issues in the expansion of renewable energy is fluctuations in demand for electric power depending on the weather. In this context, measures for increasing system stability will become increasingly important in maintaining the balance of supply and demand.\n\nIn May 2021, Hitachi was selected as a system vendor for a 'Demand Response Demonstration Project' targeting the optimization of power supply and demand balance in Thailand. The project is being undertaken by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, based on the Smart Grid Development Master Plan, a comprehensive energy initiative led by the Thai government. On this project, Hitachi will provide integrated management systems that will enable multiple distributed power sources, including renewable energy, to be managed as a single Virtual Power Plant (VPP).\n\nThrough the efficient operation of Thailand's power transmission and distribution facilities, we will contribute to building a smart grid system that expands the capacity of renewable energy systems.\n\n## Resilience \uff5c Supporting DX in mission-critical backbone systems\n\nThe '2025 Digital Cliff' refers to the many issues likely to arise in legacy systems from 2025 onward in various industries in Japan, as those systems become increasingly complex, obsolete, or more like black boxes. Hitachi responds to these issues by promoting a shift to digital technologies in backbone systems. As an example, for financial institutions, we worked with The Shizuoka Bank in the joint development of a next-generation core banking system that operates on an open platform, yet still offers the reliability and robustness of a mainframe system. That system began operations in January 2021. We now offer the system as a packaged solution, which is being introduced at other financial institutions as well.\n\nIn September 2020, the system was officially adopted by the Shiga Bank. By applying open technologies in these missioncritical systems, it becomes possible to link and utilize FinTech and other new financial services along with data application services quickly and flexibly, enabling even more advanced banking operations.\n\nIn this way, we contribute to expanding business, especially for regional financial institutions, and to the revitalization of regional economies.\n\n## Security & Safety \uff5c Contributing to a secure, safe society through social infrastructure maintenance services\n\nIn social infrastructure maintenance, it is increasingly difficult to maintain both costs and service levels from a previous era, due to a decline in maintenance staff resulting from social issues such as the aging population and the deterioration of existing facilities.\n\nIn response, Hitachi offers a variety of services and solutions as a social infrastructure maintenance platform, for example, to conduct efficient inspections using various digital technologies such as AI, drones, ground penetrating radar, and water leak sensors. By providing this platform to a wide range of customers, including local municipalities, infrastructure providers and manufacturers, we contribute to minimizing accidents, reducing maintenance costs, and rapid recovery in the event of a natural disaster.\n\nSocial infrastructure maintenance services\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are also promoting the use of Hitachi ABB Power Grids' marketing presence, global footprint, and management base, which encompasses 115 plants and 200 offices in 90 countries around the world, within the Hitachi Group. We will undertake\n\na major change in direction toward the expansion of global business and support Hitachi's management base by strengthening end-toend customer relations and establishing an IT operation platform through the creation of Global Business Services (GBS) that utilize core business process systems.\n\nClaudio Facchin\n\nSenior Vice President and Executive Officer of Hitachi, CEO of Hitachi ABB Power Grids\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Power Grids Business\n\n## Becoming an energy platform provider that resolves issues in the fields of the Environment, Resilience, and Security & Safety\n\nHitachi's power grids business provides products, systems, services, and software that are essential to the stable supply of electric power based on advanced engineering capabilities and to enable more efficient power transmission and distribution. The Power Grids BU is focused on high growth market segments, including high-voltage direct current (HVDC), EV charging systems, data centers, and micro-grids, contributing to a more resilient, smarter, cleaner energy supply throughout the world.\n\nIn the HVDC field, in February 2021, we received an order for a Voltage-Sourced Converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) system for the Dogger Bank Wind Farm, the largest of its kind in the world, located in the North Sea about 130 km off the coast of the United Kingdom. The system will connect the offshore wind farm with power transmission networks in the United Kingdom, supporting decarbonization in that country. In Japan, in March 2021, the operation of the Hida frequency converter station was started. It is linked to Tokyo and strengthens electric power ties between East and West Japan, which have different frequencies, and improves the stability of the electric power supply. Hitachi's HVDC system has been adopted in this converter station.\n\nIn the industry field, we launched the 'Grid-eMotion TM Fleet,' an EV charging system for electric buses and commercial vehicles, in July 2020, and EconiQ TM , a product/service/ solution package that supports the realization of carbon neutrality, in April 2021. EconiQ TM contributes to the transition to green energy with a superior environmentally efficient portfolio that emphasizes sustainability, for example, with highvoltage switchgears that use no sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gases and that have been proven to reduce relative CO2 emissions by more than 50% throughout the entire life cycle, along with related maintenance services. We provide solutions that support decarbonization and increased resilience throughout the world; for example, in June 2021, we began offering power transmission and distribution systems for floating offshore wind farms.\n\nThe operation management solutions provided by Hitachi ABB Power Grids to electric power vendors and to manufacturing, mining, and other industries were integrated into the Lumada",

In this new normal, in addition to securing employees' safety and increasing productivity via automation, contactless, and remote operations, the issue of 'boundaries' has come to light in the context of business continuity when supply chains are disrupted.\n\n## Total Seamless Solutions that Resolve 'Boundary' Issues\n\nIn this market environment, value that can be provided through seamless connections is increasingly important. Using Lumada, we provide venues for connecting the vertical 'boundaries' between management and workplaces; connecting the horizontal 'boundaries' between supply chains; and connecting the 'boundaries' between different industries. In this way, the total seamless solutions that are unique to Hitachi, resolving the issue of 'boundaries' and maximizing total profit for customers, will come to represent a major factor that differentiates Hitachi from the competition.\n\nIn the Industry sector, we will strive to expand and strengthen total seamless solutions through co-creation with customers. To this end, we will leverage Hitachi's strengths in AI, mathematical optimization technologies, and other advanced technologies; advanced manufacturing (monozukuri) capabilities cultivated through our extensive track record in manufacturing, workplace experience, and other forms of domain knowledge; and customer relations built on our broad customer base.\n\n## Vision of the Industry Sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCo-creation with two companies in the Nichirei Group provides an example of using digital technologies to connect the vertical 'boundaries' between management and workplaces. In production and staff planning for Nichirei Foods' manufacturing and processing plants, the company introduced Hitachi's original systems that combine AI and mathematical optimization technologies. In this way, we were able to automatically create optimum solutions based on up to 16 trillion production and staffing plans for each plant, thereby reducing planning time to approximately 1/10th of previous levels. We also provided\n\nsolutions that combined the Hitachi Group's technologies to increase operating and maintenance efficiency for freezer facilities operated by the Nichirei Logistics Group. The HX series of industrial controllers for IoT applications offered by Hitachi Industrial Equipment Systems was used to gather field data, and those data were then compiled on a cloud service platform based on EMilia, an integrated Energy & Equipment Management Service, to conduct operational and failure prediction diagnostics. In this way, we contribute to reducing environmental impact and establishing a resilient production system that enables the Nichirei Group to respond quickly to changes in demand.\n\n## Example of Connecting Vertical 'Boundaries' through Co-creation with the Nichirei Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCo-creation with Seiyu and Workman provides examples of using digital technologies to connect horizontal 'boundaries' in the supply chain, for example, between suppliers, manufacturing, distribution, and the market.

We apply advanced technologies and services to increase efficiency in facilities operations and related processes; for example, in April 2021, we added new functions that leverage the power of AI in facilities diagnostics, water quality forecasting, and operational support.\n\n## Accelerating Global Business with a Focus on North America\n\nIn 2017, we strengthened the North American product business through the acquisition of Sullair, an American air compressor manufacturer, and in 2019, we acquired JR Automation in the United States and KEC in Japan as part of efforts to build a platform for the robotic SI business, which is expected to see rapid growth amid labor shortages and rapidly increasing labor costs. In fiscal 2020, despite the impact that COVID-19 had\n\non the economy, we successfully grew and expanded these businesses by steadily executing post-merger integration (PMI) at those two newly acquired companies. Sullair has demonstrated steady growth through improvement measures targeting resilient structures, including a steadily growing new customer base, flexible production systems, and increased cost competitiveness in products. Meanwhile, JR Automation has expanded its business domain from its original business portfolio, which focused mainly on the automotive industry, to include the e-commerce and medical markets, which are expected to grow in the future, thereby dramatically increasing both new orders and revenues.\n\nIn April 2021, we acquired Kyoto Robotics, a Japanese startup that develops intelligent robot systems, to further strengthen robotic SI functions. The robot systems offered by Kyoto Robotics boast world-class 3-D vision systems, featuring a 3-D recognition rate of 99.99%, masterless object recognition, and the industry-leading depalletizing capability. All these strengths make Kyoto Robotics a powerful ally in strengthening business\n\nin the logistics and factory automation fields.\n\nIn April 2020, we established Hitachi Industrial Holdings Americas, a supervisory company for the North American region, to fortify the business base in that region.\n\nKyoto Robotics' intelligent robot system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rapidly Merging the Robotic SI Business and Digital Technologies\n\nWe are rapidly merging the robotic SI business, which has been fortified mainly in North America, with Hitachi's outstanding digital technologies. For example, in the manufacturing of aircraft parts in North America, JR Automation is involved in the automation of large-scale robotics and transport/manufacturing facilities, using digital technologies tied into enterprise resource planning (ERP; integrated backbone operating systems) and manufacturing execution systems (MESs). Moving forward, Hitachi will strengthen unified activities with JR Automation, KEC, and Kyoto Robotics transcending the boundaries of regions, and based on that business platform, will expand the merging of the robotic SI business and digital technologies from North America to include Europe, Japan, and ASEAN countries. Furthermore, in collaboration with GlobalLogic, for which Hitachi's acquisition was completed in July 2021, we will further expand the business to encompass E2E digital solutions that use digital technologies to connect management with workplaces.\n\n## Targeting Further Growth in the Industry Sector\n\nTo achieve even further growth in the Industry sector, we will strengthen and expand total seamless solutions and accelerate our global expansion through co-creation with customers, while at the same time using highly efficient products and digital technologies to create sustainable environmental value.",

From fiscal 2021 onward, we expect to see a gradual recovery in other regions as well, so our overall outlook is for steady market growth. In China, we expect to enjoy stable growth in new installation demand in the future, and we also expect growth in the service business, which includes maintenance and modernization for E&E products already installed. We have seen growing demand for new E&E installations in many countries, including India, which is the most promising market after China, and countries in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, in Japan, which is a mature market, the effects of COVID-19 have given rise to demand for new high added value in buildings and offices, and we expect to see a further increase in demand for digital solutions at the core of smart buildings. Demand for digitalization in buildings-for example, in the context of facility management, energy management, security, and signage-is expected to see rapid growth on a scale of approximately 15% per year from 2019 through 2024.\n\n## Railway Systems Business Unit\n\nCOVID-19 created challenges during fiscal 2020. For instance, our rail factories in the U.K. and Italy were closed for several weeks, which impacted revenues for the year. The other big challenge of COVID-19 was some of our large turnkey projects, where we often rely on our engineers being able to travel internationally to work closely with our customers. This year, travel restrictions meant it was harder to get our engineering teams onto sites.\n\nThe good news is our business was still profitable, even in this challenging year. Although adjusted operating income was down year on year, our EBIT was above the target we set, generating good returns for shareholders.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we expanded our railway systems business from Europe, making major inroads in the North American market by winning new projects in San Francisco and\n\n## Progress in the 2021 Mid-term Management Plan\n\n## Building Systems Business Unit\n\nUntil now, in the Building Systems Business Unit, we have strived to achieve business growth and increase profitability mainly in Japan, China, and other Asian markets, both through the manufacturing and sales of E&E, and through building services, which include the maintenance and modernization\n\nWashington, D.C., as well as our new monorail project in Panama.\n\nThe long-term impacts of the pandemic are still not fully understood. However, the latest rail market forecasts by UNIFE, a European industry body, are largely optimistic.\n\nIn the past year, our customers experienced a severe shock due to the downturn in travel, which had a major financial impact on them. Two things will help them recover: governments stimulating the economy by investing in new infrastructure, and finding new ways of operating, enabled by digital technologies and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) business models.\n\nOverall, strong environmental momentum exists that should support the rail sector in the long term. Globally, governments have declared their raised emission targets, and over time we believe they will continue to invest in rail to reduce emissions. For example, we are seeing agreements among some European rail operators and airlines to displace some shorthaul flights with rail travel.\n\nAccelerating the decarbonization of the rail industry itself is also important. We announced new collaborations in fiscal 2020 to develop battery and hydrogen trains to help us tackle environmental challenges. Further in the future, an alternative to airline travel will be Hyperloop, and this year we started collaboration with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies to make use of our rail experience in a new sector with exciting potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof those products, along with building solutions.

        "page_content": "## Activities specific to global markets\n\nIn Japan, although there have been some delays in new installations and modernizations of E&E due to the effects of COVID-19, we have introduced products and services one after another in response to needs in the era of the new normal-for example, solutions aimed at reducing the risk of infection through touchless elevator operations and air cleaning in elevator cars, and a new standard elevator model released in April 2021-to quickly meet new customer needs. In China, the world's largest market, Hitachi maintains the top share in the number of new E&E units ordered, based on the strengths of its outstanding product competitiveness. In fiscal 2020, we set a record for the number of new installations in the backdrop of a rapid recovery in demand post-COVID-19. In addition to the increase in new installations, the service business continues to expand, including maintenance and modernization. In October 2020, we acquired a majority of the shares in Yungtay Engineering Co., Ltd., Taiwan's largest E&E company, making it a part of the Hitachi Group. Moving forward, we will accelerate the business integration with Yungtay Engineering, enhance the E&E product lineup, and strengthen cost competitiveness,\n\nthereby strengthening our response to demand in third-tier and fourth-tier cities in China, where growth is expected, while at the same time leveraging the  merits  of  scale  in the  Chinese  business to expand business in other promising markets, including Asia.\n\nStandard Elevator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aiming to be a market leader in building solutions\n\nIn the Building Systems business, we have been utilizing cutting-edge digital technologies ahead of other business fields. For example, we have adopted the approach of analyzing and utilizing E&E operational data gathered using IoT technologies to develop and provide highly reliable products as well as high-quality remote monitoring and maintenance services using AI. The Lumada business accounts for nearly 20% of revenues in the Building Systems business, and moving forward, we will gather and aggregate various types of data, including operational data from building facilities, as a means of contributing to the realization of smart buildings. We will do this, for example, by offering an IoT solution for buildings that increases the efficiency and quality of building management, and a solution for office workers that provides workers with useful apps on a smart phone, for example, to share information or reserve building facilities. Our goal is to accelerate the digitalization of business and maximize the\n\nvalue provided throughout the entire value chain, from new E&E installation to maintenance, modernization, and building solutions, in order to achieve our target revenues of \u00a51 trillion and an adjusted operating income ratio of 12% in fiscal 2025, and to become a market leader in this field.\n\n## Railway Systems Business Unit\n\n## Delivering environmental and social value\n\nOne of our most important priorities is to deliver environmental and social value through our core business. By delivering new projects, we are providing higher-quality, safer infrastructure and connecting people to new opportunities. In this way, we are delivering social value.\n\nOne project that achieves this aim is Line 2 of the Lima Metro in Peru. We are providing both rolling stock and the systems for train signaling and control on this line. The project in Lima is a good example of social value because until recently this huge global city and growing economy had very little public transportation. Rail access can offer major value to the people who live in Lima, as it provides access to future jobs and economic opportunity. By displacing cars, rail can improve air quality and reduce CO2 emissions and traffic congestion.\n\nOn the environmental side, we support governments investing in rail as an environmentally friendly alternative to both aviation (through high-speed rail) and use of private cars in congested cities (through metro and light rail systems). Through our investments and partnerships in developing battery and hydrogen trains, we are also helping to decarbonize the railway itself.\n\nOur railway systems business is also working to decarbonize itself. From 2018 to 2020, the railway systems business's nonJapanese entities reported a reduction in carbon emissions of nearly 15% per hour worked.\n\n## Promoting our digital strategy\n\nIn fiscal 2020, 20% of the Rail business revenues derived from Lumada, and this figure is expected to grow. We are focusing in particular on MaaS, an area where we can harness digital capabilities that complement our current core business. These could be passenger-facing, such as digital ticketing services, or technologies that connect the entire railway to improve overall performance.\n\nA good example of this in fiscal 2020 is our acquisition of Perpetuum, a U.K. company. Perpetuum uses self-powering wireless sensors on trains to understand when safety-critical parts are deteriorating. This helps to optimize maintenance cycles and reduces industrial waste.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company aims to enhance its software capability to meet the need for the software-defined vehicles of the future.\n\nUtilizing the software human resources of the Hitachi Group, the company set up the Software Business Division in April 2019 to focus on the enhancement of software development capability. In addition, Hitachi Astemo acquired seneos, a German automotive device software developer, in April 2020 to enhance front engineering capability for precise and efficient software development in line with the latest common standard software architecture and software development process framework.\n\nThe company will also be able to capitalize on synergies leveraging GlobalLogic engineering and software capabilities as vehicles become defined by software.\n\n## Transformations to Maximize the Value of Hitachi Astemo\n\nSince the business integration, achieving savings through cost synergies has been a challenge. Hitachi Astemo is addressing this challenge, however, and by 2025 the company expects to achieve cost synergies worth 60 billion yen and aims to maximize value by more thoroughly integrating the personnel and corporate cultures from previously separate companies, promoting digital transformation, and improving its product portfolio and operations.",

Hitachi monitors and analyzes the business environments, and based on factors such as social issues, management resources, and our competitive superiority, undertakes risk management from the perspective of both further growth opportunities and responding to the risks that Hitachi should prepare for, controlling risks while creating pro/fit opportunities. Hitachi established the Investment Strategy Division in /fiscal 2017 and the post of Chief Risk Management Of/ficer (CRMO) in April 2020 to better identify the risks and opportunities that could potentially affect Hitachi's business and to strengthen risk management.\n\nFrom /fiscal 2017, as part of efforts to achieve a sustainable society, the Executive Sustainability Committee was established to discuss relations between Hitachi's business and social/environmental issues and to de/fine the issues that Hitachi should target as business opportunities, the negative impact that business could have on society and the environment, and necessary countermeasures.\n\n## Transforming Hitachi into a Globally Competitive Organization by Strengthening Risk Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kohei Kodama\n\nVice President and Executive Officer, CLO, General Counsel, CRMO (Chief Risk Management Officer), and Officer in charge of Audit\n\n## Profile\n\nJoined Hitachi, Ltd.'s Legal Affairs Division in 1987; in 1993, moved to the United States and obtained qualifications as a lawyer in the State of New York. Served as in-house lawyer at Hitachi America in Silicon Valley for 14 years starting in 1997, gaining experience in the front lines for M&As and legal affairs. Returned to Japan in 2011. Leads legal affairs and risk management reforms on a global level.\n\nQ\n\nPlease tell us about the way of managing risks that will be required in the future and the role of the CRMO.\n\nToday's world is often described using the term VUCA, which refers to volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. A variety of risks and compliance issues are coming to light, for example, in the context of environmental issues and human rights issues. Amid deepening discussions about stakeholder capitalism, it has become extremely important to coordinate the interests that arise among shareholders and other stakeholders. In this context, to operate business and compete in the global arena, we need to put in place frameworks that enable us to identify risks and to respond to those risks. I believe that to increase the effectiveness of risk management in the context of corporate management, it is important to strengthen risk management from three perspectives: compliance, which is related to violations of laws and regulations; business risk management, which is directly related to the operations of each business unit; and crisis management, which is examined from a company-wide perspective, including human rights and geopolitical risks.\n\nBased on my experience working in the United States, I got a very real sense that legal affairs, risk management, and auditing functions are central to business and that promoting not only risk hedging but also appropriate risk-taking means competing in the global arena based on global standards. I feel that my role is to leverage this experience in transforming Hitachi's past approaches to risk management and leading in the creation of appropriate risk management frameworks.",

Report\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/download/index.html\n\n*Information security governance supports corporate governance by building and implementing an organization's internal control mechanisms related to information security\n\nQ\n\n## What is your goal as CRMO?\n\nMy ultimate goal is to create a risk management structure that will contribute to transforming Hitachi into a true global leader. In terms of compliance, in October 2020, David Karas, who is from the United States, was appointed to the position of Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), which I held from 2018. In that capacity, he promotes strategic changes in compliance throughout the Hitachi Group as a whole. In fiscal 2020, we launched The One Hitachi Compliance Project in earnest to unify compliance programs within the Group, and we introduced a uniform compliance program at about 900 consolidated subsidiaries worldwide. We conducted compliance training with uniform content in more than a dozen languages, and in terms of internal reporting system, we created a central Group-wide reporting system using a third-party vendor that can handle reporting in 80 languages. Starting from fiscal 2021, we are verifying whether this program has been implemented accordingly and whether the program works in practice. CCO David Karas and I have been working together in developing this concept over many years, and we are now steadily putting it into practice.\n\nAs the next step, I am currently supervising activities aimed at building a full-scale enterprise risk management (ERM) structure. Hitachi is involved in a wide range of businesses, so we need to establish a systematic processes in each business unit to identify the risks that prevent Hitachi from achieving its business objectives, evaluate the impact of those risks, and plan and execute appropriate risk responses. The global standard practices applied at companies such as Hitachi ABB\n\nPower Grids serve as a valuable reference in that process. From the perspective of crisis management, we monitor risk exposure for Hitachi's various businesses in each country and region, identifying the risk factors in those countries and regions, including geopolitical risks, human rights issues, religion, culture, and public order. We pick up on signs of potential crises and study and inspect countermeasures. This represents a huge transformation, but we are promoting the transition to a global standard ERM structure with a view toward the next Mid-term Management Plan. ERM has no 'final form.' Business itself changes every day. Even after you have put a structure in place, you need to constantly refine ERM frameworks and structures in line with business conditions.",

In addition, regarding important matters to be deliberated by the Senior Executive Committee, prior to deliberations, discussions are held with the Investment Strategy Committee* 1 advisory body to confirm and review not only the perspective of economic value in terms of cash flow and the profitability of projects but also the impact on social\n\n- *  Investment  Strategy  Committee:  Consists  of  13  members  from  the  finance department and other relevant corporate divisions (as of May 31, 2021), including the Executive Officers in charge of Investment Strategy and Management Strategy as chairman and vice chairman.\n\n## Investment Execution Flowchart\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Quantitative Understanding of Risks\n\nHitachi calculates the maximum risk (Value at Risk) assumed by statistical methods according to the type of assets held on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nConsidering total consolidated net assets and other factors, we visualize the surplus capacity of growth investments to monitor growth opportunities and ensure that risks are not\n\nvalue and environmental value. The findings, including pros and cons, are reported to Senior Executive Committee members, including the President.\n\nAfter making an investment, Hitachi regularly monitors the business objectives and achievement status of the project, considering changes in the external environment. In principle, each business unit ensures flexibility, but the Headquarters is also involved depending on the level of importance. Also, regarding changes in business plans and the disposal or reorganization of important investment targets, discussions are held by the Senior Executive Committee as in the execution stage. For investment targets of which business is not progressing as planned, Hitachi established a framework to deliberate on the pros and cons of continuing business, including withdrawal, to improve capital efficiency.\n\n## Post-Investment Flowchart\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough the above process, Hitachi will further strengthen asset profitability and risk tolerance while ascertaining risks before and after investments are made.\n\nexcessively unbalanced compared to Hitachi's consolidated management strength.\n\nIn addition, by analyzing risk conditions in each region and sector and the outlook for future trends, Hitachi gains a quantitative understanding of risk concentrations in specific regions and sectors in comparison with profitability.\n\n## Responding to Increasingly Complex and Challenging Risks\n\nHitachi conducts business activities in a variety of industries throughout the world and therefore needs to take a multifaceted approach to managing the business risks that prevent the organization from achieving its business objectives. To systematically identify, evaluate, and manage risks, while taking into account the effects of reorganizing the business portfolio, Hitachi is rebuilding Group-wide risk management frameworks and putting in place more systematic processes, using global standard practices at Hitachi ABB Power Grids as a reference.\n\nBy further enhancing risk management, we will strengthen our capability of responding to different risks in each business and at the same time gain a comprehensive and integrated understanding of those risks and put in place measures in advance to better achieve the organization's goals.\n\nFollowing is an outline of the main risks and opportunities. This list assumes that the content was reasonable at the time this report was issued.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the Annual Securities Report (The 152nd Business Term).",

The TCFD calls for disclosures sought by investors, such as how businesses assess climate-related issues, the short-, medium-, and long-term impact of climate change on corporate value, the identi/fication of climate-related risks and opportunities, the metrics and targets to assess progress, and how the results of these assessments are re/flected in corporate management.\n\n## Governance\n\nHitachi sees climate change and other environmental issues as important management issues. Reports on Environmental Innovation 2050 (Hitachi's long-term environmental targets, which include targets for reducing CO2 emissions) were published after being reported to the Board of Directors: when the targets were formulated in fiscal 2016 and when the targets were revised in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the executive chairman and CEO and staffed by heads of corporate\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe are responding to climate change by fulfilling our responsibilities as a global company by helping to achieve a decarbonized society. Taking note of the CO2 reductions required throughout the world, we established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 under our Environmental Vision.\n\nMoreover, in fiscal 2020 we revised our targets to even more ambitious levels: To help limit the global temperature increase to within 1.5\u00b0C, we declared that we would achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi factories and offices by fiscal 2030, and in fiscal 2021 we revised our target again to achieve carbon neutrality in our value chain by fiscal 2050.\n\n## Climate-related Risks\n\nAs for climate-related business risks, we have followed the TCFD's classification in considering (1) risks related to the\n\ndivisions and business units, meets twice a year to discuss and reach decisions on important environment-related policies and measures including those in response to climate change, and it sets the stage for implementing those measures. In addition, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-related operations once a year and receives reports on important climate-related issues from the directors in charge of those items.\n\ntransition to a decarbonized economy arising mainly in the development of the 1.5\u00b0C scenario* (changed from the previous 2\u00b0C scenario due to the importance of achieving a decarbonized society) and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change arising in the event of the 4\u00b0C scenario,* which assumes that efforts to reduce global CO2 emissions have failed. Our assessments of climate change risks and opportunities are also categorized according to time span, namely, short term (three years from fiscal 2019 to 2021), medium term (through fiscal 2030), and long term (through fiscal 2050).\n\n*Our assessments are based on the temperature increase scenarios contained in the Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2014 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Special 1.5\u00b0C Report published in 2018. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario assumes that the increase in global average temperatures from preindustrial levels is kept below 1.5\u00b0C at the end of the 21st century. The 4\u00b0C scenario sees global temperatures rising by approximately 4\u00b0C compared to preindustrial levels.\n\n| 1.

Under the current 2021 Environmental Action Plan (covering fiscal 2019-2021), we set and monitor progress for annual target reduction rates of CO2 emissions per unit compared with fiscal 2010 for each business unit and Group company.\n\nAs part of Hitachi's climate change countermeasures, to\n\nchecked at Sustainability Promotion Meetings. Those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the Group as a whole are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the Executive Chairman and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nadvance CO2 reductions during the use of sold products and services, we set targets and monitor the progress of reducing CO2 emissions per unit. In other words, we focus on setting metrics that provide customers and society with products and services that emit less CO2. At the same time, we will try to not only reduce per unit emissions but also total CO2 emissions from our business sites (factories and offices).\n\nItems for 'Climate-related Information Disclosure (Based on TCFD Recommendations)' are included in their entirety in Hitachi Sustainability Report 2021.

        "page_content": "## Promoting Information Security\n\nSee page 180 of our Sustainability Report for detailed information. https://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/download/index.html\n\nHitachi considers information security governance as one of our top management priorities. Information security governance minimizes the risk of business disruption, including information leaks and operational stoppages, due to cyberattacks. As such, we take a dual approach to cybersecurity: value creation and risk management. We outline Information Security Policy from the perspective of cybersecurity risk management and have established the Information Security Committee, which is headed by our Chief Information Security Of/ficer (CISO). This committee outlines policy and leads initiatives related to information security and personal information protection.\n\n## Information Security Management\n\nHitachi has created the Global Information Security Administration Rules, which conform to the international ISO/IEC 27001 standard, and is promoting compliance with the regulations in Special Publication 800-171 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce in the United States. These rules are implemented globally from the headquarters of Hitachi, Ltd., and other Group companies. We are also actively promoting the use of shared security services and related support for information security provided by regional headquarters. Policies and procedures determined by the Information Security Committee are then reinforced by the Information Security Promotion Council and other bodies to ensure adoption in the workplace. As Hitachi promoted new work styles based on telecommuting, vulnerabilities associated with employee security awareness become a greater risk in fiscal 2020. In addition to IT-based security measures, we are taking an employee-centered approach to raise security awareness among our employees.\n\nOur Security Operation Center (SOC) monitors security on a round-the-clock basis so that global-scale cyberattacks can be detected and countermeasures initiated right away. To counter this risk, in fiscal 2020 we began building a cyber monitoring environment that always uses the latest technology.\n\n## Preventing Information Leaks\n\nHitachi takes the following IT steps to prevent information leaks: encrypting devices; using thin clients; employing electronic document access control and expiration processing software; maintaining ID management and access control by building an authentication infrastructure; and filtering e-mails and websites. We are also enhancing various IT measures, such as incorporating an in-depth defense strategy, in response to the recent spate of phishing and other cyberattacks. To prevent leaks from our suppliers, we review and confirm supplier information security measures based on information security requirements outlined by Hitachi. We also provide suppliers with tools and security education materials for checking business information on supplier-side devices. In addition, we require suppliers to check and remove business information from personal computers.\n\n## Education on Information Security\n\nHitachi holds e-learning programs on information security and personal information protection for all executive officers and employees every year. We offer a variety of courses that have different goals and are tailored to different target audiences. We also implement simulation training to educate employees about phishing and other cyberattacks. Employees are sent deceptive e-mail as phishing simulation to heighten their awareness of security through direct experience.\n\n## Thorough Information Security Audits and Inspections\n\nThe Hitachi Group has developed its approach to security based on the 'Plan-Do-Check-Act' (PDCA) cycle for its information security management system. We conduct annual information security and personal information protection audits at all Group companies and business units. The president of Hitachi, Ltd., appoints audit supervisors to conduct independent audits, and we ensure the fairness and objectivity of auditors. There are 153 Hitachi Group companies in Japan, including Hitachi, Ltd., that conduct audits in the same way as Hitachi, Ltd., and all results are subject to confirmation. For Hitachi Group companies outside Japan, we use a common global self-check approach to ensure Group-wide auditing and inspections. All business units conduct annual self-checks using Confirmation of Personal Information Protection and Information Security Management. We also conduct monthly Confirmation of Personal Information Protection Management at the 733 operations (as of March 2021) that handle important personal information.",

Employees work together to create healthy, safe, and secure work environments that aim to be accident free. We share the belief that all work-related accidents can be prevented and that we are responsible for our own health. We engage in practices to protect our health and safety and endeavor to build a culture that promotes mutual awareness.\n\n## Establishing the Occupational Health and Safety Management System\n\nThe Health and Safety Officer Meeting is held and attended by health and safety officers from each Group company and representatives from each division. The members set plans and objectives for Group-wide safety strategies, review ongoing measures to improve occupational health and safety management systems, and share the clear commitment from top management to make protecting the health and safety of employees their top priority. The Audit Committee audits the results of Group health and safety activities, plans, and policies every year. For critical health and safety issues, the status of occupational health and safety management is reported at least once a year to the Senior Executive Committee and at meetings of Group company presidents. In fiscal 2020, the Hitachi Group advanced infrastructure development that included information gathering toward the creation of a global health and safety management system. We also increased the frequency of global accident statistics reporting from once every six months to once a month. We expanded initiatives directly undertaken by the Safety and Health Management Division toward improving health and safety activities at sites outside Japan where serious accidents have occurred.\n\n## Initiatives for Preventing Work-related Accidents\n\nWe have set goals of zero fatal accidents and halving lost-time accidents across Group sites worldwide compared to 2018 by 2021. To achieve these goals, we hold the Health and Safety Officer Meeting and conduct interviews with the departments in charge of safety. We also conduct training and analyze the causes of accidents. In addition, we implemented various measures in fiscal 2020 based on our Action Plan. Hitachi sets and applies internal safety standards to be observed globally at manufacturing sites with a high risk of work-related accidents. We also advance health and safety measures tailored to the operations of individual companies. During business restructuring, we share the details of the health and safety management frameworks and initiatives of the organizations to be merged in advance. While maintaining mutual respect for the organizational cultures of each party, we ensure safety as part of a smooth business launch. Hitachi conducts safety training specific to each job title and, in fiscal 2020, we created new safety training for executives.\n\nAlthough the total number of work-related accidents is declining, globally there were still three accidents resulting in death in 2020. Recognizing the need to improve workplace environments posing accident risks and the need for a safety management system that also applies to contractors, in fiscal 2021 we are working to improve our responses and implement corrections for high-risk work and facilities. This work will be\n\ncompleted by the end of the fiscal year.\n\n## Initiatives to Improve Employee Health\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we expanded our efforts to address the mental health of employees in each global region and the concerns of employees who faced an elongated need for telecommuting due to COVID-19. For example, in Japan we provided remote healthcare counseling, offered tips on staying healthy while working from home, supported foreign employees seeking medical services in Japan, and ensured the human rights of infected employees. In fiscal 2021, we have been working to increase the support we provide the group-global employees through more proactive measures, based on organizational integration with the safety department.\n\n## Measures to Prevent Infectious Disease\n\nWe have been vaccinating employees against hepatitis A, tetanus, cholera, etc. to support infectious disease prevention during business travel outside Japan. In fiscal 2020, we ask employees to always stay home if they have a fever or feel unwell. We have also maintained a work-at-home ratio of 70% during the state of emergency declarations in Japan. For employees working on jobs required to maintain social infrastructure, we implement infection prevention measures appropriate for each job, including distributing disinfectant spray and masks. In the event of an employee infection, we implement measures to avoid the further spread of infection based on guidance from administrative authorities.\n\nHitachi Group Global Safety Statistics (rate of occurrence *1 )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYear\n\n| Region         |   2016 |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| North America  |  27.65 |  24.33 |  27.96 |  20.76 |  18.98 |\n| Latin America  |   2.33 |   1.62 |   0.44 |   0.57 |   2.12 |\n| Europe         |  10.7  |  10.82 |   6.08 |   4.78 |   3.09 |\n| India          |   2.07 |   1.44 |   1.44 |   1.63 |   1.07 |\n| China          |   1.59 |   1.53 |   1.46 |   1.17 |   1.12 |\n| Asia           |   5.43 |   4.41 |   3.34 |   2.63 |   1.55 |\n| Oceania        |  39.07 |  24.41 |  21.94 |  29.07 |  12.95 |\n| Africa         |  17.26 |   9.93 |  11.76 |   9.72 |  25.37 |\n| Overseas total |   7.76 |   7.42 |   7.43 |   5.78 |   4.9  |\n| Japan          |   1.57 |   1.85 |   1.64 |   1.53 |   1.34 |\n| Global total   |   3.95 |   4.22 |   4.2  |   3.45 |   2.89 |\n\n- *1 Occurrence rate is the rate of workplace accidents per 1,000 directly contracted employees (including cases without lost workdays)",

        "page_content": "## Value Chain Responsibilities\n\nThe Hitachi Group attaches great importance to the sustainability of our value chain, and we work with our suppliers to promote initiatives toward increasing social, environmental and economic value. To ensure the stable supply of products and services, whenever possible we engage in preemptive measures toward ascertaining and reducing risks.\n\n## Procurement BCP and Promotion Framework\n\nOur procurement divisions work to enhance our Group/Global business continuity plan (BCP) to ensure incidents that do occur do not result in the suspension of operations or do not have a great impact on society.\n\n## Sustainable Procurement Management Framework\n\nHitachi instituted the Hitachi Group Global Procurement Code. This Code calls on Group companies and suppliers to give due consideration to human rights, labor practices, safety, ethics, quality, and security throughout the supply chain.\n\nWe also distribute the Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guidelines to our approximately 30,000 suppliers around the world, engage in enlightenment activities, and require documentation that suppliers have confirmed and understood these Guidelines. We reviewed the guidelines in fiscal 2021 and produced a revision retitled the Hitachi Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines. Accompanying these guidelines, we also distribute the Green Procurement Guidelines as part of our efforts toward increasing environmental value.\n\nTo strengthen our sustainable procurement management framework, in fiscal 2020 we redefined our management functions and established a new Sustainable Procurement Council in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Strengthening Global Partnerships for Sustainable Procurement\n\nWe have appointed regional procurement officers to oversee local procurement activities in China, the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. These officers carry out activities such as supplier CSR audits and CSR monitoring (self-checks) and hold CSR Seminar for Suppliers in their respective regions to strengthen our responses for sustainable procurement.\n\n## Status of CSR Procurement Measures\n\n|                               |   FY 2016 |   FY 2017 |   FY 2018 |   FY 2019 |   FY 2020 | Period  total   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|\n| CSR Monitoring (Self-Checks)  |       316 |       131 |       345 |       291 |       271 | 2,072* 2        |\n| CSR Audits                    |        20 |        18 |        24 |        19 |        27 | 176* 3          |\n| CSR Seminar  for Suppliers* 1 |        29 |        65 |       126 |        59 |       450 | 741* 4          |\n\n- *1 In fiscal 2020, CSR Seminar for Suppliers were held by webinar and e-learning instead of face-to-face\n- *2 Cumulative total for fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2020\n- *3 Cumulative total for fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2020\n- *4 Cumulative total for fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2020\n\n## Human Rights Due Diligence\n\nIn the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy, we outline the Hitachi approach to Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) and require appropriate education and training for employees. The Hitachi Group has established the position of Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer (CDIO). We also created a project team at the Hitachi, Ltd., headquarters to promote HRDD. This team is composed of members from the relevant divisions and oversees the preparation of manuals and other documents needed for the evaluation and implementation of HRDD measures. The team also works to create a structure for strengthening human rights risk management.\n\n## Addressing Child Labor and Forced Labor\n\nIn the Hitachi Group Code of Conduct, we clearly express our firm stance against the use of child labor or forced labor either in Group companies or along our supply chain, and we work to reinforce awareness among our suppliers. In March 2020, a report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute indicated that one of Hitachi's suppliers might be using Uyghur forced labor in China. We conducted a social compliance review via a third party based on international standards to review the supplier's management system, specifically looking at how employees were managed, given the allegations stated in the report. As a result, there were no findings to support the forced labor. Through various forms of engagement, the Hitachi Group will continue efforts to respect the human rights of its workers, including those employed by suppliers.\n\n## Ensuring Responsible Mineral Procurement\n\nHitachi works to ensure responsible mineral procurement. To address the expansion of corporate responsibilities, in fiscal 2021 we revised and renamed our Hitachi Group Conflict Minerals Procurement Policy as the Hitachi Group's policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals.\n\n## Response to Technical Intern Training Program Issues\n\nIn 2018, the Hitachi Group received a warning from the Organization for Technical Intern Training to correct violations concerning the use of the Technical Intern Training Program. In 2019, Hitachi also received orders from the Immigration Services Agency and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare to make improvements regarding intern training. We submitted a report to the Organization for Technical Intern Training regarding the completion of improvements in October 2019. In March 2020, we established Group-wide policies and guidelines, and created a system of checks applied to technical intern training. In November, we began conducting internal audits and other measures to prevent the reoccurrence of any violations.\n\nNote: The Hitachi Group positions suppliers as partners with whom we engage equally toward business development. We use the term 'procurement partners' when referring to our suppliers. To promote ease of searchability, as an exception we refer to our procurement partners as 'suppliers' within the Integrated Report",

        "page_content": "## Quality Assurance\n\nSee page 137 of our Sustainability Report for detailed information. https://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/download/index.html\n\nAs we outline in the Hitachi Group Code of Conduct, being able to provide customers peace of mind in the use of our products and services and being able to ful/fill the speci/fication and quality requirements of our customers are two of the things valued most by all of us at Hitachi. Hitachi believes in prioritizing quality and reliability above all else. To embody this belief, we engage in activities toward strengthening quality assurance for all processes and from multiple perspectives: organization and management, technology, and human resources.\n\n## Basic Principles on Quality Assurance\n\nEmbracing the Hitachi Founding Spirit of 'Harmony, Sincerity, and Pioneering Spirit,' we adhere to 'basics and ethics' and 'put right and wrong before profit and loss.' In our quality assurance activities, we value a commitment to sincerity. Our unique practice of OCHIBO-HIROI, which means 'gleaning' in English, involves analyzing and learning from our failures to further develop our technologies. When an incident occurs, we not only investigate the technical causes but also thoroughly discuss the process, framework, and motivational causes leading up to the occurrence, along with ways to prevent reoccurrences, to improve our product reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\n## Framework for Quality Assurance\n\nTo ensure full control over quality governance, Hitachi has separated the quality assurance division from the manufacturing division in every business unit and Group company, creating a framework for operations that prioritize customer safety and trust above all. We also make quality assurance divisions independent of business divisions and enhance the structure for reporting to the Quality Assurance Division at our head office. This ensures a framework for close information sharing between all parties.\n\n## Quality Assurance Activities\n\nHitachi distributes product regulations worldwide and shares information on amendment trends and enforcement dates among Hitachi Group companies. We promote legal compliance and make continuous improvements to this process by clarifying product-specific laws (product-specific laws map) and implementing our product compliance management system. The Hitachi Group globally applies our basic principles of quality assurance and Quality Assurance Standards. We receive accident reports from overseas Group companies based on a reporting structure that is independent of the business divisions, similar to the structure that is used in Japan, and we promote the same principles of OCHIBOHIROI. Through these activities, we promote the establishment of the global quality assurance framework.\n\n## Accident prevention activities\n\nHitachi believes that accident prevention is one of the true goals of quality assurance. Based on this belief, we go beyond accident reoccurrence prevention to promote activities that prevent accidents before they occur. With the expanded use of software by our products division (embedded software development division), we are applying the software development skills and reliability improvement know-how of the solutions division to integrate software into the products division that helps prevent accidents before they occur. We are also building and enhancing a framework for sharing information on quality activities and issues related to the growing services business.\n\n## Reinforcing risk assessment\n\nWe engage in product development by prioritizing the safety of life, health, and property as the top priority from the design stage. We verify safety at every step, from development and production to sales and maintenance. We work to ensure safety by increasing risk communication with customers through our Guide for Preparing User Instruction Manuals, and by reducing risks through design (fundamental safety design), protective measures (safeguards), and usage information (such as user instruction manuals).\n\n## Responding to Product Incidents\n\nWhen a product incident occurs, the division responsible acts swiftly to resolve the problem. In the case of a severe incident, we promptly report to management and government agencies in line with legal requirements and disclose the incident information to customers on our website and through other communication channels. We have established a structure for ensuring fast and appropriate action at all companies across the Hitachi Group. In cases where we determine that retroactive action is necessary, we notify customers via newspaper advertising or via our website to carry out the necessary repairs or replacement program.\n\n## Quality and Reliability Education\n\nWe conduct field-specific technical lectures for engineers at a range of levels from basic to expert. We provide technical training courses for manufacturing, quality assurance, and maintenance.",

We work to ensure awareness and enforcement throughout our Group. With the interpretation of regulations and laws constantly evolving, we regularly validate and reform internal regulations to ensure our appropriate response to the demands of society.\n\n## Basic Policy\n\nHitachi, Ltd., has formulated the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct, which all executive officers and employees across the Group pledge to uphold. The Codes of Conduct is translated from Japanese into 14 languages, including English and Chinese, and through e-learning is shared with more than 300,000 Hitachi Group executive officers and employees around the world. In April 2020, we established the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance. This code supplements the Codes of Conduct to clarify the approach to corporate ethics and compliance that must be shared across the entire Hitachi Group. Based on the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct and the Hitachi Group Code of Ethics and Compliance, we established the Hitachi Group Compliance Program (HGCP), which consists of regulations and guidelines for various matters such as compliance with the Anti-Monopoly Act, preventing transactions with antisocial forces and money laundering, and preventing bribery and corruption.\n\n## Compliance Reporting System\n\nHitachi has adopted a compliance reporting system that can be used anonymously, not only by Hitachi Group employees but also by temporary staff and business partners such as suppliers and distributors. In fiscal 2020, we received 639 reports from all Group companies worldwide. We also established what we call the Channel to the Board of Directors. This system allows all Hitachi, Ltd., employees to report problems anonymously or under their real names directly to Hitachi directors if they discover illegal or significantly inappropriate activities in business conducted by division heads, executive officers, or other management personnel. In fiscal 2020, to further strengthen the Group's governance and compliance, we integrated internal reporting systems within the Group into a Group-wide system called the Hitachi Global Compliance Hotline. The harassment consultation service previously under the management of the human capital division and the internal reporting systems independently maintained by Group companies were integrated into the new system.\n\n## Major Initiatives\n\n## Policies for preventing bribery and corrupt practices\n\nAs part of the HGCP, Hitachi established the Hitachi Group Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and related regulations. The provision or acceptance of entertainment or gifts, donations, or provision of political capital (political contributions) by executive officers and employees must not exceed the scope permitted by anti-bribery laws and regulations and must comply with Hitachi's internal rules. In addition to outlining specific spending limits on monetary value and frequency of\n\nentertainment, gifts, and other arrangements to be provided to public officials, these regulations ban facilitation payments and require due diligence procedures for business partners.\n\n## Anti-monopoly act compliance policy\n\nThe HGCP includes the Hitachi Group Fair Competition Policy. To promote global awareness and compliance throughout the Group, we have created international versions of standards concerning contact with competitors to ensure awareness of points of caution related to business practices. We also clarified the involvement of compliance departments in existing cartel prevention monitoring and other activities (vertical relationships with customers, channel partners, suppliers, and others).\n\n## Export controls\n\nHitachi's basic policy is to comply with global import/export laws and ensure appropriate management. To reinforce this basic policy, Hitachi, Ltd., has established the Corporate Regulations concerning Security Export Control. We carry out strict export control practices in line with relevant laws and regulations, including screening all goods and technologies intended for export against such factors as destination countries and regions, as well as intended end use and end users. Hitachi Group companies also implement export control in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\n## Hitachi's tax compliance approach\n\nHitachi ensures appropriate tax governance for the entire Hitachi Group. We have established regulations governing all tax-related matters and work to ensure awareness among all employees involved in tax management (filing and paying taxes, handling tax audits, and tax risk management). We manage transfer pricing in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the transfer pricing regulations of the countries and regions in which our Group companies are located. We also assess the applicability of the Anti-Tax Haven System. When applicable, we ensure appropriate tax payments based on the application of this system.\n\n## Violations of Laws and Regulation\n\nIn fiscal 2020, there were no incidents in which Hitachi was prosecuted or penalized by the authorities. Furthermore, Hitachi had no significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for noncompliance with tax laws and regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi Group companies maintain good relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, and we recognize that these relationships make up an important portion of our overall corporate value. Accordingly, we are striving to establish a system that will facilitate the maintenance of these relationships and improve our corporate value primarily through the implementation of measures focused on promoting constructive dialogue. To advance these efforts effectively, we are working to improve our corporate governance by ensuring thorough separation between the oversight and execution of management, establishing a swift business execution system, and striving to achieve highly transparent management.\n\n## History of Hitachi's Corporate Governance Reform\n\n| 1999   | I ntroduction of Objective Perspective                                                                                    | 2012   | Development of Guidelines for Strengthening  Governance                                   |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|        | Management Advisory Committees Practical advice from experts in Japan and overseas                                        |        | Development of Corporate Governance Guidelines                                            |\n| 2003   | Demarcation of Management Oversight and Execution                                                                         | 2014   | Development of Stewardship Code                                                           |\n|        | Shifted to a company with committees (currently a company  with nominating committee, etc.)                               |        |                                                                                           |\n|        | To increase management speed and improve  management transparency                                                         | 2015   | Start of Application of Corporate Governance Code                                         |\n| 2006   | Enforcement of Companies Act                                                                                              | 2016   | Enhancement of Dissemination of Information about Medium- to Long-term Sustainable Growth |\n|        |                                                                                                                           |        | Publication of an integrated report                                                       |\n| 2010   | Enhancement of Interactions with Capital Markets Hitachi IR Day (briefing on business strategy by division) was  launched | 2019   | Acceleration of the Social Innovation Business across 5  Growth Fields                    |\n|        | Clarification of commitment of top management of the                                                                      |        | Executive vice presidents were placed in 5 sectors                                        |\n|        | business units to the capital markets                                                                                     |        | ESG briefing session held                                                                 |\n| 2012   | Acceleration of Global Management                                                                                         |        | An independent director (chair of the Audit Committee)  and the CEO shared their remarks  |\n|        | Independent directors including foreign directors were  increased                                                         |        |                                                                                           |\n|        | Independent directors composed the majority of directors                                                                  |        |                                                                                           |\n\n## Implementing All the Principles of the Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe are implementing all the principles of the Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Director Composition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors with Abundant Experience\n\nThe Board of Directors applies their abundant experience and knowledge related to the management of global companies, legal affairs, accounting, capital markets, government agencies, and the field of digital technology to facilitate discussions informed by a wide variety of perspectives.\n\nIn June 2021, Helmuth Ludwig joined the Audit Committee and Joe Harlan joined the Compensation Committee, enabling even more diverse discussions.",

The basic management policy includes the Mid-term Management Plan and annual budget compilation. The Board of Directors focuses on strategic issues related to the basic management policy, as well as other items to be resolved that are provided in laws, regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Board of Directors Regulations.\n\nWithin the Board of Directors, there are three statutory committees-the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Compensation Committee-with independent directors accounting for the majority of members of each committee. The Board of Directors meetings were held on nine days during fiscal 2020, and the attendance rate of directors at these meetings was 100%. The attendance rates for each independent director were as shown in the table below. To assist with the duties of the Board of Directors and each committee, staff who are not subject to orders and instructions from executive officers are assigned.\n\n## Attendance at the Board of Directors Meetings Held in Fiscal 2020\n\nAttendance/Number of days on which the meetings were held*\n\n| Name               | Board of Directors   | Nominating Committee   | Audit Committee   | Compensation Committee   |\n|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| Katsumi Ihara      | 100%                 | -                      | 100%              | 100%                     |\n| Ravi Venkatesan    | 100%                 | -                      | -                 | -                        |\n| Cynthia Carroll    | 100%                 | 100%                   | -                 | -                        |\n| Joe Harlan         | 100%                 | -                      | -                 | -                        |\n| George Buckley     | 100%                 | -                      | -                 | -                        |\n| Louise Pentland    | 100%                 | -                      | -                 | -                        |\n| Harufumi Mochizuki | \u25ce 100%               | \u25ce 100%                 | 100%              | \u25ce 100%                   |\n| Takatoshi Yamamoto | 100%                 | -                      | 100%              | 100%                     |\n| Hiroaki Yoshihara  | 100%                 | 100%                   | \u25ce 100%            | -                        |\n| Helmuth Ludwig     | 100%                 | -                      | -                 | -                        |\n\n- *Number of days during term of office on which the Board of Directors meetings were held: 9; Mr. Venkatesan and Dr. Ludwig: 6\n- Number of days during term of office on which Nominating Committee meetings were held: 8\n- Number of days during term of office on which Audit Committee meetings were held: 17\n- Number of days during term of office on which Compensation Committee meetings were held: 4\n- \u25ce Indicates role as a board or committee chairperson\n\n## Description of the Three Committees' Activities\n\n## Nominating Committee\n\nThe Nominating Committee has the authority to determine proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of directors. The Nominating Committee consists of four directors, three of whom are independent directors.\n\n- It determines director candidates and holds preliminary hearings concerning the appointment and dismissal of executive officers, including the CEO. In fiscal 2020, the Nominating Committee held meetings on eight days.\n\n## Primary Activities\n\nIn addition to deciding upon the contents of the proposal made concerning director appointments at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Nominating Committee set an upper limit on the total term of office for independent directors and reviewed and confirmed the executive officer system implemented in fiscal 2021. In addition, it promoted committee-related activities including discussions and individual interviews aimed at developing candidates for future management and leadership positions.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee has the authority to audit the execution of duties of directors and executive officers and to decide on proposals submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for the election and dismissal of accounting auditors. The Audit Committee currently consists of six directors, including five independent directors and one standing Audit Committee member.\n\nHiroaki Yoshihara, the chairman of the Audit Committee, has been involved in accounting and other business practices at the KPMG Group for many years and possesses a considerable breadth of knowledge concerning finance and accounting.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Audit Committee held meetings on 17 days.\n\n## Primary Activities\n\nThe Audit Committee conducted activities that were focused on its priority matters for consideration, which included the strengthening of collaboration and the facilitation of information sharing under a 'Tripartite Audit' (audit by the Audit Committee, internal audit and audit by accounting auditors), and auditing of the establishment and operation of internal control systems from the perspective of risk management and validity of execution of duties. In addition, a standing committee member worked to obtain information as needed in a timely and accurate manner, mainly by collaborating with the Internal Auditing Office, among other departments, and attending important internal meetings such as the Senior Executive Committee, and facilitated information sharing with other committee members.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to determine remuneration policies for directors and executive officers and remuneration for individuals (including amounts of remuneration) based on them. Currently composed of five directors, including four independent directors, the committee strives to ensure objectivity, transparency, and fairness in the remuneration determination process.\n\nIn addition, the Compensation Committee verifies and reviews details of the process used for determining remuneration for individuals, including assessments concerning basic remuneration amounts, evaluations of progress made toward individual targets, and performance appraisals that are tied to short-term incentive compensation.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee held meetings on four days.\n\n## Primary Activities\n\nThe Compensation Committee determined remuneration amounts for individual directors and executive officers in accordance with established policies while verifying and reviewing the processes and results of appraisals for performance and individual targets tied to shortterm incentive compensation for executive officers. In addition, the committee reviewed the executive compensation system while giving due consideration to compensation granted to managers at global companies and the goal of sharing value with shareholders, and decided upon policies covering remuneration for directors and executive officers in fiscal 2021.",

Specifically, it plays an important role in securing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors' management supervision and decisionmaking functions by deciding on the content of agenda items for submission at the General Meeting of Shareholders concerning the appointment and dismissal of executive officers and submitting proposals to the Board of Directors on appointments and dismissals to the position of CEO and on the makeup of the Nominating, Compensation, and Audit committees. It also selects and trains CEO successor candidates. Since 2016, independent directors have served as the committee chairman, and the Nominating Committee has comprised three independent directors and one executive officer, with non-Japanese and female members included to ensure diversity.\n\n## A Board of Directors Rich in Diversity\n\nHitachi became a company with committees (currently a company with a nominating committee, etc.) in 2003, and in 2012 the number of independent directors increased, including non-Japanese directors, as part of efforts to build a globally competitive management structure. A backdrop to these changes was a desire to transform Hitachi into a true global leader, with overseas business accounting for more than half of the Group's business. Deciding on director candidates is an important mission of the Nominating Committee, and it chooses people who are qualified to sit on a Board of Directors that is in line with global standards. Currently, 10 of 13 directors are independent directors, combining global knowledge and experience in a variety of fields, making this board ideally suited to lead in Hitachi's diverse management operations. People with experience in a global corporation demonstrate not only outstanding character but also a broad range of knowledge and experience in management. In selecting these candidates, regardless of nationality, we conducted interviews where we asked about their management philosophy and perspectives on corporate management, including aspects of culture. At Hitachi's actual Board of Directors meetings, we sometimes spend more than an hour discussing a single topic in detail, and you can see lively discussions where each of the participants has spent time studying these topics in advance, from their own unique perspective.\n\n## Fostering Management Leaders, including the Next CEO and Successor Candidates\n\nAnother mission of the Nominating Committee is appointing the CEO. Hitachi is a huge organization, so in addition to selecting the CEO, creating management leaders of the future is extremely important in terms of supporting Hitachi's continued global growth. I have served as chairman of the Nominating Committee since fiscal 2016, and in addition to further strengthening selection and training activities, I have worked to secure objectivity and transparency in these processes. We recently appointed Dr. Kojima as president & COO, but this selection process began from the moment that his predecessor, Dr. Higashihara, was appointed president & CEO. On the executive side, we have identified and trained about 400 people who have the potential to take on corporate management positions. The Nominating Committee also participates by narrowing down candidates from the perspective of one's track record and potential. When they are first selected, none of these individuals has all the elements required to be a leader. Non-Japanese can also be appointed to top positions, but they need to have a deep understanding of Japanese culture and business practices. We provide these candidates with opportunities to give presentations to the Nominating Committee, engage in discussions, and participate in one-on-one meetings with committee members. We focus on developing the qualities of these candidates, reinforcing the most essential elements, and at the same time fostering these individuals through a process of tough assignments. Directors outside of the Nominating Committee also conduct one-onone meetings with the candidates to foster a multifaceted perspective.\n\n## Fostering Next-Generation Leaders\n\nBecause fostering talent takes time, it's important to select and foster these candidates for the future early on. For this reason, the Nominating Committee focuses on developing 'Future 50' members, who are young leader candidates, while switching out candidate members every year. We actively work to strengthen these candidates, for example, by giving lectures and conducting debates on various themes. Hitachi's management, including the Board of Directors, increases its capacity to respond while referring to global standards, for example, through strict governance of various themes, and diversity that is not limited by attributes such as gender and nationality. By expanding these types of management-level awareness reforms to include young leader candidates, we enhance and improve next-generation leaders for Hitachi as a whole, to include a broader and deeper talent pool.",

        "page_content": "## Establishing Attractive, Global Compensation Structures in Line with the Viewpoint of Stakeholders\n\n## Harufumi Mochizuki\n\nIndependent Director\n\n## The Role of the Compensation Committee\n\nI have been a member of Hitachi's Board of Directors since 2012, and I have been deeply involved with the Compensation Committee since 2014 in the capacity of chairman. During this time, I feel that the role of the committee has evolved in terms of its responsibility for Hitachi's governance. Of course, the basic form of the committee's activities is to guarantee objectivity, transparency, and fairness in processes related to deciding director compensation. The goal, however, is to ensure a good balance in the distribution of corporate profits among shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nDuring the time that I have been here, Hitachi has shifted the focus of its strategic bases even more from Japan to other countries, implementing management strategies aimed at transforming the company into a global leader. By ensuring that the compensation structure is aligned with standards appropriate to a global corporation, we have adopted a basic policy of securing management talent with the qualities that will increase corporate value in the global market.\n\n## Building a Compensation Structure that Is Attractive Even from a Global Perspective\n\nEvery country has different compensation frameworks and different taxation systems regarding stock options. When we designed our compensation system, we started by introducing basic compensation, performance-based compensation as a short-term incentive, and a stock option system as a medium- to long-term incentive. This includes individual evaluations tied to performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe CEO assigns roles to the various executives, and after multiple meetings individual goals are set through a mutual consensus based on the job description. The Compensation Committee conducts fair and strict evaluations through a process of interim and year-end reviews, and then the CEO decides on the final evaluation. We referenced the component ratios for management compensation at major global corporations and decided on a 1:1:1 balance of basic compensation, short-term incentives, and medium- to long-term incentives. This compensation design has been in place in its current form since 2019.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, we introduced the shares of restricted stock system to replace the conventional stock options as medium- to long-term incentive compensation. By having directors own stock from the time that they are appointed, we have built a framework that develops a deeper sense of shared values with shareholders and gives directors the incentive to continuously increase corporate value and undertake management from a medium- to longterm perspective. In the case of non-Japanese directors, given that systems differ in each country, we conducted careful and extensive studies and eventually introduced a performance-based compensation system as a shortterm incentive; then, in fiscal 2020, we decided to apply the restricted share compensation unit system as a medium- to long-term incentive.\n\nMoving forward, by incorporating opinions from diverse perspectives, we will further increase effectiveness in terms of operating the compensation system, including performance evaluations. As part of these efforts, Joe Harlan joined the Compensation Committee in June 2021, bringing with him extensive knowledge and experience with global corporations.\n\n## Introducing an Evaluation System that Increases Environmental Value\n\nWhen Hitachi presented 'environmental value' as a new core element of management strategies, we decided to add environmental value as a clear element of performance evaluations for executive officer compensation. We set targets for each executive officer's evaluation based on indexes like those in Hitachi's Mid-term Management Plan. We will continue to flexibly examine and evolve this system, for example, by enhancing evaluation indexes.",

The Audit Committee identifies, evaluates, and processes risks and issues that the company is facing on a global scale, with a particular focus on large-scale M&As, mid-term management plans, investment strategies, and other items in matters that bear substantial risks. At the same time, we monitor the progress of post-merger integration processes and company-wide digital transformations and exchange opinions on improvement measures as they become necessary. In fiscal 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we followed the Hitachi Group's safety and health policy of placing top priority on protecting safety and health. We used web conferences and other IT tools to hold Audit Committee meetings and conducted remote audits. Overseas, we conducted remote audits and effectively utilized auditing talent from overseas regional supervisory companies.\n\n## Tripartite Audits and the Triangular Pyramid Monitoring Structure\n\nHitachi's Audit Committee and internal audit section collaborate and communicate closely with accounting auditors in a process called 'Tripartite Audits,' which aims to increase transparency and the effectiveness of internal controls while ensuring appropriate tensions and information sharing on matters such as audit plans, progress, risks, and respective response measures. Key auditing matters (KAMs) are also an important part of Tripartite Audits. We collaborate with accounting auditors and conduct ongoing discussions from the creation of the auditing plan and throughout the auditing process. One unique feature of Hitachi's Tripartite Audits is that Audit Committee members conduct preliminary audit visits at key locations prior to internal audits by the Head Office Internal Audit Section. Another feature is that, to further improve Tripartite Audits, the three parties in question conduct mutual performance evaluations with the Finance Division, constantly working to improve by sharing feedback from those evaluations. Furthermore, we study and actively encourage the introduction of digital tools to further increase the efficiency of Tripartite Audits. To strengthen the auditing structure and functions, in addition to the existing tripartite auditing structure, which combines the Audit Committee, the internal audit section, and accounting auditors, we collaborate with the Head Office management divisions to provide supervision and support in identifying, evaluating, and resolving important risks and issues. In this way, we continuously\n\nwork to improve the Triangular Pyramid Monitoring structure that has the Audit Committee at the top. We are working to increase the effectiveness of the auditing structure by building a similar Triangular Pyramid Monitoring structure that focuses not only on the Head Office side but also on the sector corporate auditor system introduced in each sector in 2019. The sector structure comprises corporate management divisions in the business units, internal audit sections within each sector, and accounting auditors responsible for those sectors.\n\nAmid an accelerating global rollout, we identify, evaluate, and process a wide range of risks throughout the Hitachi Group as a whole, including 871 consolidated subsidiaries (as of the end of March 2021). The Head Office and sectors offer mutual support and closely share information to respond rapidly to risks and issues and to share knowledge throughout the entire company.\n\n## Triangular Pyramid Monitoring Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further Improving the Effectiveness of the Audit Committee\n\nTo strengthen support for Audit Committee activities, in August 2020, Hitachi established an Audit Committee Center to provide support that would contribute to continuous improvements in Tripartite Audits, for example, by updating and following up on important risk and issue lists and coordinating with sector corporate auditors and the internal audit sections. In June 2021, independent director Helmuth Ludwig was welcomed as a new Audit Committee member, adding to the diversity of committee members and accelerating the globalization of debates.\n\nHitachi's Audit Committee was able to smoothly improve effectiveness as a direct result of top management's strong awareness and deep determination regarding governance. With this backdrop, we ensure easy access to the persons and information required in auditing operations and enable regular follow-up on all items pointed out during audits, either through committee meetings, business review meetings, or audit visits, or else through the Audit Committee Center. In addition, the status of progress on important items, and items where improvements were requested, are reported at meetings of the Board of Directors.",

Decisions regarding the appointment or dismissal of executive officers are based on proposals from the Nominating Committee. As stipulated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our basic policy concerning the CEO requires that individuals serving in the position of CEO have extensive experience and achievements in the field of company management. They must also be considered optimally suited for conducting management aimed at achieving Hitachi's goals of continuously raising its corporate value and further serving the common interests of its shareholders. Decisions regarding the appointment or dismissal of the CEO shall be made based on prior deliberations and proposals by the Nominating Committee.\n\nRegarding our CEO Succession Plan, as the speed of change in the management environment accelerates, we are striving to build a system that enables us to appropriately and promptly secure and develop (both internally and globally) necessary management personnel who will provide leadership\n\nSTEP 1\n\nDesignate important positions\n\nSTEP 2\n\nDefine the roles and personnel requirements associated with important positions\n\nSTEP 3\n\nSelect candidates for important positions\n\nthat will allow us to realize our growth strategies. Accordingly, we are also concentrating on providing training for selected employees while targeting the early development of candidates for future management positions. Moreover, we are developing next-generation leaders capable of acting authoritatively and resolutely by establishing forums where participants can discuss what is necessary for Hitachi's future growth and make recommendations to management.\n\nIn addition, we have identified a group of about 50 employees from around the Hitachi Group with next-generation development potential. People in this 'Future 50' group are selected on merit, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. They are given challenges to help expand their horizons and build their perspectives through tough assignments including different types of work and internal and external training opportunities. The Future 50 group members receive one-on-one mentoring opportunities with independent directors to benefit directly from their extensive business experience and global perspectives. Our aim is to change mindsets so that we can develop people for important positions in the future.\n\nSTEP 4\n\nEvaluate candidates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Director and Executive Of/ficer Compensation\n\n- \u00b7 Compensation shall be such that it enables the Company to attract necessary personnel to achieve an improvement in corporate value through global business growth.\n- \u00b7 Compensation shall be commensurate with the roles and responsibilities of each Director and Executive Officer.\n- \u00b7 Compensation for Directors shall be such that it enables them to exercise the functions of supervision of management effectively.\n- \u00b7 Compensation for Executive Officers shall be such that it enables them to contribute to sustained improvement in corporate value through the execution of business and employs an appropriate balance between short-term performance and medium- and long-term performance.\n- \u00b7 The level of compensation shall be determined considering compensation levels at other companies as well as economic and market trends.\n- \u00b7 The Compensation Committee utilizes external experts to gain expert advice and an objective viewpoint, if necessary, for considering the details and amounts of compensation.\n\n## Compensation Structure\n\n## (1) Directors\n\nCompensation for Directors is basic remuneration as fixed pay. The amount of basic remuneration is decided by adjusting a basic amount to reflect fulltime or part-time status, committee membership and position, and travel from place of residence, etc. A Director concurrently serving as an Executive Officer is not paid compensation as a Director.\n\n## (2) Executive Officers\n\nCompensation for Executive Officers consists of basic remuneration as fixed pay and short-term incentive compensation and medium- and long-term incentive compensation as variable pay.\n\nThe basic amount of basic remuneration, short-term incentive compensation and medium- and long-term incentive compensation is set based on the ratio of 1:1:1 as the standard, taking into account the composition of\n\nexecutive compensation for major global companies, in order to improve corporate value through the growth of global businesses.\n\nThe higher position an Executive Officer holds, the higher the proportion of variable pay is set to the total annual compensation.\n\nAs part of efforts to achieve carbon neutrality at Hitachi business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030, in fiscal 2021, an evaluation system that considers environmental value was introduced into short-term incentive compensation for executive officers. Specifically, targets are set for environmental strategies and solutions to environmental issues based on the divisions and operations handled by each executive officer, and performance is evaluated according to the degree of target achievement.\n\nIf it is found that an executive officer has been engaged in misconduct during his/her term of office, compensation for such Executive Officer that has been already paid shall be returned to the Company (clawback provision).\n\nPlease refer to Compensation to Directors and Executive Officers on page 101 of the Annual Securities Report (The 152nd Business Term). https://www.hitachi.com/IR-e/library/stock/hit\\_sr\\_fy2020\\_4\\_en.pdf\n\n## Basic Policy",

        "page_content": "## Building a More Effective and Ef/ficient Auditing System\n\nOur Audit Committee formulates audit plans in accordance with its risk-based approaches and conducts audits for each consolidated business unit. Audit Committee members meet directly with business unit heads before the internal audit section's audits are carried out. Then, these members inform the internal audit section about concerns and issues related to the implementation of business strategies aimed at achieving sustainable growth that require attention. At that time, the committee also verifies matters that carry high levels of risk in terms of quality, measuring these risks through employee awareness surveys and thorough implementation of business strategies.\n\nHitachi's internal audit section performs regular internal audits at each business site and location. This section reports directly to the President and is independent from organizations that are subject to its audits. The internal audit section also formulates audit plans based on past audit records and the most recent business circumstances. In addition, this section performs audits upon receiving direction from the Audit Committee, ensuring their effectiveness. The internal audit section at Hitachi is responsible for confirming the legality and appropriateness of all business operations, including those related to accounting, production management, sales, purchasing, IT systems, compliance, and human resources. Furthermore, acting on behalf of our management team, the internal audit section confirms whether the employees are well versed in the ideas and policies of our management, and their operations are being carried out based on these ideas and policies and if business strategies are being implemented in a way that will efficiently lead to sustainable growth.\n\nTo further raise audit effectiveness, we implemented a 'chief auditor system' in each of our five sectors (IT, Energy, Industry, Mobility, Smart Life) in April 2019. Through this action, we built an internal control system spearheaded by chief auditors and enhanced collaboration with the executive vice presidents who manage each sector and with the Audit Committee.\n\nAlthough these chief auditors do not act as legal agents under the Companies Act, they still assume responsibility for governance in each sector. Statutory auditors, which function as legal agents at Hitachi subsidiaries under the Companies Act, also report to these chief auditors and work to improve the effectiveness of Hitachi's internal control systems.\n\nWhen conducting business audits, we use IT systems to expeditiously search for reference information contained within materials submitted prior to audit in an attempt to improve efficiency. We are currently enhancing a system that will allow our internal audit section to share information with professional accounting auditors using a data lake. When reading audit reports submitted to the President by the internal audit section, the President must be able to quickly understand the issues identified by these reports and make prompt judgments concerning whether immediate action is required. In the future, our internal audit section will continue to maintain its transparency and independence while working to improve audit efficiency as one member of our Tripartite Audit system.\n\nOur accounting auditors perform audits that focus on the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements. First, they adopt a risk-based approach in response to the Group's overall financial status. Applying this approach, they then determine the scope and methods of the audit, formulate an audit plan, and share opinions with the Audit Committee. Next, based on the audit plan, they perform audits on each of the five sectors and the business units that comprise them, enabling effective and efficient understanding of data related to Hitachi's finance department and each of its business segments. If, during the auditing process, our accounting auditors discover a degree of risk that could impact future financial statements significantly or issues that, even if monetarily small, could have a large qualitative effect, they share related information regarding these risks and issues and the progress on a response from the related divisions with the Audit Committee and internal audit section. They also work to improve and raise the effectiveness of audits by submitting 'management letters' containing points of concern and improvement suggestions through the finance department. Recently, they have also been working to raise the efficiency of checks on the accuracy of numerical figures by using some IT systems to investigate all cases rather than performing test-checking through sampling.",

Hitachi will continue to promote active dialogues with stakeholders and work to increase social and environmental value by applying knowledge from this event in corporate management activities.\n\n|

During this time, the world has entered an era that is more unpredictable than ever before, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over these past six years, Hitachi has made substantial changes to its business structures, further clarifying directions for the creation of value with a focus on digitalization and the environment, while making continuous improvements to the Integrated Report so that its content will better communicate Hitachi's value creation story. In the creation of this report, we engaged in extensive studies to ensure that it was presented in an easy-to-understand format from multiple perspectives so that readers can understand the business model centered on Lumada, which combines Hitachi's strengths, and the value creation process based on that business model. Back-casting from a vision of society and Hitachi's ideal future in 2030, we have summarized the themes that should be prioritized as Strategic Focus Area, along with measures to be implemented in those areas.\n\nFor this report, we undertook a fundamental reexamination of the production structure. We started the Information Disclosure Working Group, which serves as a unified planning and production team for the Annual Securities Report, the\n\nSustainability Report, and the Integrated Report, to enable production based on organic collaborations and sincere discussions among related divisions. This report has also been produced amid studies targeting the creation of the next Midterm Management Plan. In that sense, I feel that this report can also be used as a bridging media between Hitachi's past evolution and the path toward coming long-term growth. As the executive officer responsible for the production of this report, I can say with confidence that this production process is fair and that the content presented herein is accurate.\n\nI hope that you will take the time to read this report and ask that you send us your impressions and unreserved opinions with regard to Hitachi's management. I further hope that this Hitachi Integrated Report 2021 will assist readers in gaining a deeper understanding of Hitachi's value creation story and provide opportunities for the co-creation of new value with all stakeholders.\n\nSeptember 2021\n\n## Hidenobu Nakahata\n\nSenior Vice President and Executive Officer Head of Corporate Communications and Audit\n\n## Independent Assurance of Social and Environmental Data\n\nTo ensure the reliability of the data disclosed we have received independent assurance of key social and environmental performance indicators by KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. in the Hitachi Sustainability Report 2021.\n\nIndicators Subject to Independent Assurance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Website Information\n\n## About Hitachi Group\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/corporate/about/ (English)\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.co.jp/about/corporate/ (Japanese)\n\nHitachi Group Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nRatio of female managers, Number of CSR audits, CO2 emissions at business sites Ratio of non-Japanese executives, Ratio of female executives, Ratio of female managers\n\n## Investor Relations\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/IR-e/ (English)\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.co.jp/IR/ (Japanese)\n\n## Sustainability\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/sustainability/ (English)\n\nhttps://www.hitachi.co.jp/sustainability/ (Japanese)\n\nV",
