We are certainly continuing to set ourselves consistently ambitious goals and this is also necessary - those who fail to do so will sooner or later fall into mediocrity. We cannot and will not allow that to happen.\n\nLet us briefly look back on 2020, which was a special year in many respects: The year marked the end of our EnBW 2020 strategy phase. Eight years ago, we set ourselves very ambitious and measurable goals for 2020. We have achieved nearly all of them and even exceeded some ahead of schedule. In particular, we were able to improve our operating result for the fourth year in a row.\n\nAll of us were also left facing some major social challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. We had to protect our employees, secure the energy supply and nevertheless achieve our earnings targets. We achieved all of this and EnBW remains in a stable position.\n\nAnd we now have our sights set on the future: While the EnBW 2020 strategy focused on the transformation of the company, we want to use the updated EnBW 2025 strategy to develop into a sustainable and innovative partner for energy and infrastructure. In addition, we have further refined our sustainability targets during the past year. We firmly believe that a company without a clear and ambitious sustainability agenda will not be viable in the future. In the last few years, we have invested heavily in, for example, renewable energies, electricity grids and electromobility. We will now take another major step forward: We aim to become a climateneutral company by 2035.\n\nThe protection of the environment, the climate and natural resources is an important aspect of sustainability but it's not the only one. People - both inside and outside of EnBW - lie at the heart of our thoughts and actions. We understand that we have a social responsibility and we try to live up to it every single day.\n\nThe achievement of economic targets is a core focus for every company and naturally this is also true at EnBW. But sustainability and economic success do not have to stand in contradiction in our eyes - quite the opposite. Alongside all of the questions and challenges we are facing during this fundamental process of change - one which not only EnBW finds itself in - above all we see the huge business opportunities it offers.\n\nBest regards,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrank Mastiaux\n\nChairman of the Board of Management",

And we have set ourselves an ambitious goal in this regard: We want to become climate neutral with respect to our own emissions across the whole company by 2035. We aim to already reduce the CO\u2082 emissions at EnBW by 50% by 2030, based on the reference year of 2018. The path to climate neutrality will require the rigorous phasing out of coal-fired generation. According to the Coal Phase-out Act approved by the German Bundestag in 2020, this process must be completed by 2038. EnBW had already phased out 40% of its particularly carbon-intensive electricity generation before this act was passed. A further 2.5 GW will be removed from operation by 2030 and the phase-out process will be fully completed by 2035. To this end, the fuel switch options will be examined. The fuel switch will take place in two stages: firstly from coal to more climate-friendly gas and then in the medium term to climate-neutral gas (biogas or hydrogen). Switching raw materials in this way will not only contribute to maintaining a reliable energy supply but will also help to preserve existing power plant sites.\n\n4. 6 GW\n\nAs has been the case in its previous restructuring activities, EnBW will take the interests of all employees into account during the changes associated with the phasing out of coal. It is our aim to give our employees new perspectives by offering them alternative jobs in growth areas of the company and opportunities for furthering their personal development. We are facing up to the challenges associated with our sustainable corporate strategy using a human resources strategy that places the focus on people.\n\n## Climate neutrality by 2035\n\nThe main focus of our activities for protecting the climate and environment is the phasing out of electricity generation using fossil fuels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe expansion of renewable energies was already well underway at EnBW in the reference year.\n\nIn just under ten years, we aim to cut our CO 2 emissions in half.\n\nEnBW wants to be climate neutral before the target year set in the Coal Phase-out Act.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rather, they can exist in a symbiotic relationship with one\n\nWe are transforming ourselves in/t\\_o a sus/t\\_ainable infrastructure partner through consistent investment.\n\nanother. In the past few years, we have invested a huge amount in renewable energies and the expansion of the grids. As part of our EnBW 2025 strategy, we will grow beyond our core area of energy and transform ourselves into a sustainable infrastructure partner. We will expand our business fields renewable energies, electricity grids, e-mobility and broadband, and supplement our activities to include new areas such as the development and operation of entire city districts.\n\nThese business activities will require significant investment - a total of around \u20ac12 billion by 2025. We also expect to generate significantly higher earnings by 2025 with an adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac3.2 billion.\n\n## Social sustainability: People as the main focus\n\nThe third pillar depicts the social dimension of sustainability, in which the main focus is placed on people. Alongside quantitative parameters in human resources development, emphasis is being placed on the personal development of employees and maintaining their employability. For example, retraining and further qualification measures were implemented at an early stage in the area of conventional generation at EnBW, in which around 3,400 people are currently employed. Some employees who used to work in a conventional power plant are already applying their technical expertise to, for example, the operation of the company's offshore power plants. In addition, EnBW started a training program for migrants and refugees in 2016. 59 people are currently completing a technical apprenticeship. A record number of apprentices and students also began their first year of training at the company in 2021 and more than 1,000 young professionals are now currently working at EnBW.\n\nSustainability is frequently perceived as an abstract concept, but it also explicitly begins with every single person and their individual living and working environments. Our employees are the shapers of a sustainable future - both that of the company and also their own. And sustainability starts with what seem to be small steps. That is why we generate awareness for the responsibility employees have in their own personal working environment and motivate employees to get involved: This includes, for example, the goal of reducing paper consumption by up to 90% by 2025 and planning business trips based on considerations relating to carbon emissions, through to a sustainable procurement strategy and sustainable company restaurants.\n\nFurthermore, the expansion of electromobility at EnBW is being accompanied by an offer extended to all 14,000 employees in selected companies in the EnBW Group to lease, at low rates, an electric vehicle, which they can charge at all EnBW sites.\n\nMoreover, EnBW takes its social responsibility seriously in a diverse range of ways. For example, we provide funding and sponsorship to many organizations across Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with a focus on education, popular sports and supporting young people.",

In the 2020 reporting year, we were able to successfully conclude some major and significant projects - and also start developing some others.\n\nWe completed one major project shortly after the start of 2020: After placing EnBW Hohe See our first wind farm on the high seas, located 100 km from the German North Sea coast - into operation in the previous year, we were also able to connect its small neighbor EnBW Albatros to the grid. The joint total of 87 wind turbines with an installed capacity of around 640 MW at Germany's largest wind farm have been generating electricity since then.\n\nOne project ends, another begins: EnBW and its British partner bp had their bid for two high-quality sites in the Irish Sea accepted in February 2021. We want to jointly construct two offshore wind farms with a total output of 3 GW on these sites by 2028. EnBW set another German record on land\n\nat the end of 2020: We were able to construct the Weesow-Willmersdorf solar park with a capacity of 187 MW p . and place it partially into operation. It is the largest solar park of this type in Germany with around 465,000 solar modules on an area covering more than 160 hectares. And this is only the beginning: We are already planning to build two more power plants of this size in the region.\n\nThe Nezzy \u00b2 pilot project for the development of a floating wind power plant points to the energy world of the future. The advantage of this design is that it will allow the construction of wind power plants in waters that are too deep for conventional turbines. A prototype on a scale of 1:10 has already braved storms and waves in the Bay of Greifswald. The next step is to test the full-scale design off the coast of China.\n\n## Green bonds for sustainable projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe expansion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources requires a huge amount of investment. We are committed to ensuring that this financing complies with strict sustainability criteria. We issued our first green bond in 2018 - mainly to finance EnBW Hohe See and Albatros. Others have since followed, with the latest being a green subordinated bond with a volume of \u20ac500 million in 2020. The total volume of these types of securities issued to date by EnBW is \u20ac2 billion. We will also utilize sustainable financing instruments in future for investments in our ambitious sustainability targets.",

Therefore, this is not just a phrase that we use lightly, we truly mean it when we say: We place the main focus on people - both inside and outside of the company.\n\n## What does this mean with respect to the current transformation processes at EnBW?\n\nMaria Knill: When you look at what this transformation means, it quickly becomes clear that our employees will play a central role. The change taking place at EnBW can only succeed if it is also consciously supported, shaped and ultimately implemented in practice by our employees. Our fields of activity will also change fundamentally as part of this transformation. A good example of this is the change to our generation strategy. Some jobs will be lost but new ones will be created at the same time. This is why, on the one hand, we are focusing on the further development of our employees to open up new perspectives and opportunities for them in and with the company. And because we want to grow further as a company, we are also looking, on the other hand, for qualified employees or are training them ourselves. We currently have more than 1,000 apprentices and students on dual study programs at the company. And we plan to take on just as many new young professionals in 2021 as in 2020. All of this will push forward the entire organization and also all of our employees.\n\n## Is the human resources strategy thus mainly focused on further training and growth?\n\nMaria Knill: These aspects are only part of the strategy in my view. Alongside the professional development of our employees, the aim is to shape the future together with them. There are two essential questions that need to be answered in this context: What will we be doing tomorrow and the day after tomorrow? And how will we be doing it? The coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated to us how quickly and fundamentally the framework conditions can change. At the same time, it has pushed forward the transformation process immensely. There will be no return to the status quo ante after the pandemic: We will work much more digitally and flexibly in future. We are preparing our employees for this and providing them with the required skills. In addition, we are creating structures and conditions in which they can organize their work according to their own individual needs. We have all recognized during the pandemic that this is possible, we can do it and it can bring added value.\n\n## This is all taking place within EnBW. You also mentioned people outside of the company \u2026\n\nMaria Knill: Naturally, we also keep other people in mind. EnBW is a large company, but it is not an island - and certainly not its own planet. We are part of society as a whole and want to be a good neighbor and partner. And we gladly accept responsibility as a strong and capable member of society. This is why we promote and support numerous charitable projects and initiatives - from the protection of the environment and nature, education and social integration through to youth and popular sports.",

Many people are working towards this joint, ambitious goal in all kinds of different areas. Here, we introduce you to four of them.\n\nFrank Brech, Head of Business Field Development at the EnBW Full Kritis Service\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI believe that change always offers us an opportunity to create something new. Transformation processes open up new business fields and models. Knowledge and skills don't just become worthless overnight - quite the contrary. For example, we utilize the IT knowledge that our employees have acquired in various areas of EnBW and its companies in the very sensitive area of nuclear energy. The task of the Full Kritis Service as a provider of cyber security solutions is to improve information security for infrastructures, cities, local authorities and the economy. The fundamental transformation process in which we find ourselves requires us to become quicker and more agile. We are operating almost like a start-up within the Group and developing new solu  tions and projects to tackle new challenges.\n\nBritta Lupo, Head of Company Restaurants, EnBW Seminar Houses and Holiday Homes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the very beginning of our journey towards achieving more sustainability in the EnBW company restaurants, we asked our colleagues to complete a voluntary survey. The high level of participation demonstrated how important the subject of 'food' is. The results showed that we can forget about old clich\u00e9s: Whether old or young, in a technical or office job - sustainable and healthy nutrition generates a great deal of interest from everybody. That's why we believe our decision to use an increasing amount of regional and sustainably produced food in our kitchens is the right choice. These are criteria that are fully met by our absolute bestseller: lentils with sp\u00e4tzle, either vegetarian or served the traditional way with sausages.",

And we can save resources on a daily basis with the aim of making our own small contribution to the climate target of EnBW. One building block on the way to achieving this goal was to set ourselves a bold target: We want to reduce paper consumption at EnBW by up to 90% by 2025. This requires both a change in attitude and also fundamental changes to many processes and habits. We are all reluctant to break with established and triedand-tested processes. This is why we can't simply take something away without being able to offer a good alternative. In our case, those are digital tools and digitalized processes as an alternative to paper-based processes. As dramatic as the coronavirus pandemic has been, it has pushed forward digitalization that much further: Everybody is working more flexibly and finding that they can do without printouts and manage with a lot less paper.\n\n## EnBW is not an island\n\nWe are following our path towards economic, ecological and social sustainability together with our suppliers and partners.\n\nKarsten Doll, Key Account Manager Schneider Electric SE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a supplier and partner, we work very closely at Schneider Electric with the EnBW subsidiary Netze BW. Due to this relationship, we are closely integrated into the corporate strategy at EnBW. It is a matter of course and totally normal for us to document and communicate our sustainability, for example from an ecological and social perspective, in an ongoing process and to operate using fully digital business processes. At the moment, we are developing a new generation of medium-voltage transformers in various pilot projects together that do\n\nnot require the isolation gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ), which is harmful to the climate, but can function using the ambient air that we all breath.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is usually no problem accessing a fast Internet connection in urban areas. But NetCom BW has also set its sights on rural regions with poorer infrastructure and lower populations. These areas should also be wellconnected. One thing has become abundantly clear, most recently during the coronavirus pandemic: The way we work and collaborate, live and learn has radically changed for the long term. We are taking account of these changes at NetCom BW and laying the foundations for the data world and living environment of tomorrow with our broadband infrastructure and services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Smart and climate neutral\n\nThe Energiewende has shifted the emphasis within the world of the grids: Electricity from the renewable energies of the sun and wind is being generated decentrally and fed in at the distribution grid level. This requires the expansion and restructuring of the grids to create 'smart grids.' Smart grids allow us to better coordinate feed-ins and electricity flows to consumers. The EnBW subsidiary Netze BW is the largest distribution grid operator in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Alongside all of the activities and investments required by  the Energiewende, our subsidiary is following its own ambitious sustainability strategy. This is already bearing fruit: In 2021, Netze BW aims to become one of the first climate-neutral grid operators in Germany. Furthermore, the company is, for example, recultivating areas to create bee meadows and using bio-oil in its transformers.",

We have now arrived at this target point: We have /finished fundamentally transforming our portfolio, implemented our e/fficiency agenda and further developed our corporate culture. We have achieved or exceeded almost all of our /financial, strategic and non-/financial targets that we set ourselves back in early 2013. This makes 2020 a very special year for EnBW. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank everyone involved, our employees and associates, our shareholders, employee representatives and investors, for their tremendous support over the past few years. The EnBW we see today - with its new, forward-looking structure and the business results we are able to present for 2020 - is a collective success.\n\n## A successful 2020 financial year\n\nIn the 2020 /financial year, we achieved an operating result of \u20ac2.8 billion, which meant we were able to increase the adjusted EBITDA for the fourth year in a row. The main drivers of this success were the grids, gas business and our two new wind farms EnBW Hohe See and Albatros. In the Sales segment, we are making huge strides in the expansion of our quick-charging network for e-mobility. Currently, we already operate the largest quick-charging network in Germany. In the telecommunications and broadband business, our subsidiaries responsible for the expansion of these networks laid more than 45,000 km of cable in 2020. In the ULTRANET project, our transmission system operator TransnetBW laid the foundation stone for the converter in Philippsburg in September. The converter marks the end point of the direct current line from northern Germany, from which green electricity will be distributed across the local region. In our 'EnBW connects' participation model, 132 local authorities have now invested in our distribution grid subsidiary Netze BW, shaping the future of the electricity and gas grids together with us. In the area of renewable energies, solar energy has become the third pillar of our expansion strategy alongside onshore and o/ffshore wind power. We placed the largest solar park in Germany without state funding into operation in 2020 and also started construction of two other parks in Brandenburg. The EnBW Hohe See and Albatros o/ffshore wind farms have been connected to the grid and the EnBW He Dreiht wind farm is due to follow",

        "page_content": "in 2025. In addition, we had our joint bid with bp for two large sites in the Irish Sea accepted in February 2021, where we aim to build two o/ffshore wind farms with a total capacity of 3 GW. In the Generation and Trading segment, we are investigating the possibility of switching over from coal to climate-friendlier gases. As you can see, 2020 was not just a year in which we achieved our targets, it also marks the dawn of a new era.\n\n## A clear focus on health protection and supply reliability during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nEnBW has so far been able to successfully overcome the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. We formed a task force at an early stage with representatives from the most important areas of the company. Naturally, our main focus was and is to protect our employees against infection, while at the same time guaranteeing the smooth operation of the grids and power plants. Meanwhile, we supported the health care authorities, for example, by providing them with protective equipment. The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on EnBW has been limited. However, it certainly required us to be more /flexible - 90% of employees who were able to work from home have been doing so for many months. This has placed a personal strain on people, especially families with children. In a campaign initiated by employees, more than 4,500 unused vacation days were donated to colleagues who found themselves in a particularly di/fficult situation due to the closure of nurseries or schools - a perfect example of the team spirit at EnBW. On the other hand, it was very impressive how relatively smooth and e/fficient many of the work processes have been on a digital basis. This will allow us to draw inspiration for new ways to organize our work. The pandemic has also made it abundantly clear how important infrastructure is for the economy and society. And it has underscored the importance of supply reliability. There cannot be any compromises made when it comes to the generation of energy or its transmission and distribution. That is what we stand for!\n\n## Growth and climate neutrality\n\nThe year 2020 is also extremely signi/ficant for us because it is the starting point for the new strategy period up to 2025. Since the beginning of 2021, EnBW has been divided into three new segments that focus on infrastructure: 'Smart infrastructure for customers' is dedicated, for example, to the expansion of quick-charging infrastructure, the telecommunications and broadband business and other areas dealing with urban infrastructure. The main focus of the 'System critical infrastructure' segment is the transmission and distribution grids for electricity and gas. And 'Sustainable generation infrastructure' is pushing forward with, above all, the utilization of wind and solar energy. The EnBW 2025 strategy also comprises new, digital business models and selective internationalization in the area of renewable energies. The aim is to make EnBW even more pro/fitable and stable by 2025 than it is today, while being more agile and sustainable at the same time.\n\nThere is also something else that makes 2020 a milestone in the development of our company: In order to take the sustainability measures that we have been following for many years another step forward, we set ourselves the target in 2020 of making the company climate neutral with respect to our own emissions by 2035. In the process, we want to halve our CO 2 emissions by 2030, based on the reference year of 2018, and also reduce our coal-based generation capacity by around 2.5 GW. Coal-based energy generation will be fully phased out by the end of 2035. Our path to climate neutrality will be accompanied by a comprehensive sustainability program and an HR strategy that is designed to take our employees with us on this journey. It is no longer conceivable for us to pursue business success without making a credible contribution to safeguarding the livelihoods of future generations.\n\n## Next planning horizon: 2025\n\nEnBW is now setting course for 2025. We want to increase the operating result of our company to \u20ac3.2 billion by then. In the process, we will keep on diversifying our business portfolio, using renewable energies and the grids as a stable basis. We believe that there are opportunities to be found, for example, in the development of CO2-e/fficient energy solutions, e-mobility, telecommunications and security infrastructure. EnBW has a robust business model that is viable for the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank Mastiaux\n\nChairman of the Board of Management\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## About this report\n\n## Integrated reporting\n\nWe have been publishing an Integrated Annual Report based on the recommendations of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) since 2014, which combines the traditional contents of a /financial report with a sustainability report. We do this in order to provide our most important target groups (shareholders and the capital market, employees, society and business partners) with a holistic representation of the performance of the company. This also ensures that the dimensions of ecology, economy and social aspects are /firmly embedded in the EnBW 2025 strategy, re/flecting the highly integrated nature of our management system. An important element is measuring the achievement of our goals using key performance indicators. More about integrated reporting at EnBW can be found at www.enbw.com/integrated-reporting .\n\n## Important aspects of reporting\n\nAgainst the background of the EU Green Deal (Glossary, from p.138) and the tightening of the emissions reduction targets, we are acutely aware of our corporate responsibility. Therefore, we have already decided this year to expand our integrated reporting to disclose some of the information that will be obligatory in future according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Accordingly, we are publishing details that will be required in future on revenue, capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenses (opex) from environmentally sustainable activities based on the Taxonomy Regulation in the version from 22 June 2020 and the technical screening criteria in the dra/f\\_t delegated act for the Taxonomy Regulation for the environmental objective of climate protection of 20 November 2020, as well as additional information on adjusted EBITDA. We have already been active in the past in supporting further developments in reporting, for example, within the framework of the IIRC and in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). An overview of where contents relevant to the TCFD recommendations are presented in the report can be found on p. 122.\n\nIn the reporting period for the 2020 /financial year, we took account of information up to 8 March 2021. The identi/fication of key themes for our reporting is anchored in the materiality analysis process (p.  45 f.). All topics that are material from a\n\nstrategic and sustainability perspective, as well as those that are discussed internally in the management bodies and covered in our external communication, have been accounted for in the Integrated Annual Report.\n\nThe reporting of sustainability issues has been based, since the 2017 /financial year, on the GRI standards, including the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement. This report was created in accordance with the GRI standards - 'Core' option. An audit will be carried out in the second quarter of 2021 as part of the GRI content index service. Further information on the GRI content index can be found at www.enbw.com/gri-index . Our sustainability reporting also complies with the Communication on Progress requirements for the UN Global Compact and is based to an increasing extent on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (www.enbw.com/green-bond) . These two framework  standards, as well as the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development, have been used as the basis for the non-/financial  declaration.\n\n## Presentation and auditing\n\nThe information about the net assets, /financial position and results of operations of the EnBW Group is based on the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and,  where  applicable,  German  commercial  law  (HGB)  and German accounting standards (GAS). On the basis of our integrated reporting, the non-/financial declaration pursuant to sections 315 b and 289 b HGB is fully integrated into the combined management report of the EnBW Group and EnBW AG and was audited with reasonable assurance and thus subjected to a complete  audit  by  Ernst  &  Young  GmbH  Wirtscha/f\\_tspr\u00fcfungs-gesellscha/f\\_t. An overview of the information associated with the non-/financial declaration can be found on p.  121 . Any di/fferences between statements made for the EnBW Group and for EnBW AG are clearly identi/fied in the text.\n\nThe full set of /financial statements of the EnBW Group 2020 including  the  combined  management  report  of  the  EnBW Group and EnBW AG, as well as the unquali/fied audit opinion issued by the auditor, are accessible to the public on the website of EnBW Energie Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg AG as the Integrated Annual Report 2020 - Extended Version at www.enbw.com/ report2020-downloads .",

Sustainability is an important element of our business model and acts as a compass for our strategic alignment.\n\nThe EnBW 2025 strategy will place the focus increasingly on the aspect of infrastructure within our existing business /fields and also encompass growth potential outside of the energy sector\n\nand in selected foreign markets. For the 2020 /financial year, we are reporting for the last time in the four segments Sales, Grids, Renewable Energies and Generation and Trading. For the 2021 /financial year, we are restructuring our segment reporting due to the transformation of our business portfolio: The Sales segment and the new infrastructure businesses - also outside of the energy sector - will become the new strategic business /field 'Smart infrastructure for customers,' while the Grids segment will become the business /field 'System critical infrastructure.'",

        "page_content": "Finally,  the  strategic  business  /field  'Sustainable  generation infrastructure' will be formed from the existing Renewable Energies and Generation and Trading segments. The aim is to develop a balanced business portfolio that has diverse potential for growth, a high proportion of stable, regulated business and an attractive risk-return pro/file. You can /find more about the further development of the EnBW strategy in the chapter 'Strategy, goals and performance management system' from p. 34 .\n\nThe political and social debate on sustainability and climate change continued in 2020. We have set ourselves the goal of continuing to develop our business model in line with sustainability criteria. As an energy company, we can make a particularly e/ffective contribution to climate protection. We as a Group aspire to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and by the  end  of  2035  at  the  latest  become  climate  neutral  with respect to our own emissions (Scope 1 and 2) (p.  36) . We will measure decisions and investments against sustainability criteria in future and create a solid foundation for our planned growth as a sustainable and innovative infrastructure partner.\n\nOur company's business model proved itself to be robust and /flexible in the face of a crisis in 2020 - a year that was characterized by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact and, in these di/fficult times, our integrated approach proved its worth and helped maintain stability. The reliable supply of electricity, gas, water and heating to our customers was not at risk at any time (p. 78 f.) . We also quickly implemented e/ffective measures to protect our employees (p. 86 and 89) and we took our social responsibility seriously by providing regional support for the health care authorities and social institutions (p. 47 f.) . The pandemic did not have any signi/ficant negative e/ffect on the Group operating result in 2020 (p. 65) . Further information on our coronavirus measures can be found on the rear cover pages.\n\nAn important component of the further development of our business portfolio is digitalization, which delivered tangible bene/fits during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. We are pushing forward numerous digitalization initiatives along the entire value added chain and, in 2020, we focused on anchoring digitalization even more comprehensively within the company. For this purpose, we have established the position of Digital O/fficer in all of our business areas and relevant functional units at EnBW AG who is responsible for digitalization in their area. The Digital O/fficers will be supported by the innovation and digitalization experts from the Digital O/ffice, IT and Innovation Management. New digital initiatives have thus been established within EnBW AG and already existing projects have been pushed forward considerably (p. 54, 60, 67 ff., 76, 79 and 86 ff.) .\n\n## Assessment of the robustness of our business model in terms of climate protection\n\nWe have been analyzing the robustness of our business model for many years - with an increasing focus on the recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (Glossary, from p. 138) in the last few years. As we have been integrating the TCFD recommendations, we have pushed forward the integration of environmental and climate protection targets and performance indicators (alongside social sustainability criteria) into the Group-wide investment approval process at a governance level. This has been based on the revision of our investment guidelines that was already completed in 2018. In the 2020 /financial year, we evaluated our planned investments in the areas of generation, grids and sales based on sustainability criteria as part of a comprehensive pilot project. Alongside economic factors, this type of sustainability rating will become a /fixed component of the approval process used by the EnBW investment committee from the 2021 /financial year onwards, providing additional information relevant for the evaluation. In the area of corporate governance, our aim to become climate neutral by 2035 will also guide our future decisions so that the importance of making our contribution to climate protection becomes uncompromisingly anchored within the company. We take account of the special requirements of the Energiewende and its e/ffect on the expansion of renewable energies, supply reliability, electricity consumption, grid stability and the supply of heating in our strategic considerations. In particular, we examine the climate protection requirements and their impact on the business model. Accordingly, evaluating the di/fferent ways in which the Energiewende could possibly develop, including the opportunities and risks for our business over the coming years, will be a main focus of our market analyses (p. 104) .\n\nThe future development of the European electricity and gas markets plays a major role here. We draw up consistent future scenarios based on all of the di/fferent aspects of the Energiewende mentioned above. Major drivers of these scenarios are how much economic growth there will be in the long term and the political and corporate ambitions for protecting the climate in the energy markets. The various opportunities and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy are re/flected within the scenarios. Relevant parameters include estimates on the development of demand, changes to the power plant portfolio, the development of the transmission grids, and prices and price structures for fuel - as well as other relevant market trends such as in the areas of renewable energies and electromobility. On this basis, possible future paths for the long-term development of, among other things, the wholesale market prices for electricity and gas as well as CO 2 prices are derived for the scenarios through simulated calculations using computer models. The simulations also take into account physical risks such as uncertainties about meteorological in/fluences on the electricity market in the future due to the availability of wind and sunlight.",

We associate the concept of sustainable economic development with our aspiration to conduct all of our business activities in a responsible way. Information on the interdependencies between the key performance indicators can be found on p. 40 f .\n\n## Value added statement\n\nThe value added statement indicates the degree to which we contribute to the continuing economic development of the company and our stakeholders using our /financial resources. Further information on the dialog with our stakeholders is summarized in the chapter 'In dialog with our stakeholders' (p. 45 ff.) .\n\nWe de/fine value added as our cash-relevant business performance in the past /financial year less cash-relevant expenses. The value added is derived from the cash /flow statement and corrected based on the use of funds. In the reporting year, we generated value added of 24.1% (previous year restated: 22.0%). As well as being used in the form of wages, salaries and pension payments for active and former employees, a further share is dedicated to payments to the state in the form of income taxes and electricity and energy taxes. A/f\\_ter consideration of all stakeholder groups, the retained cash /flow is available to the company for future investments without the need to raise additional debt (p. 72) .\n\nClimate protection is an important variable in the development of our scenarios. The main focus is placed here on the consistent transformation of the electricity industry in line with international climate protection goals, a rapid implementation of the  phasing  out  of  coal-/fired  power  generation  including strengthening green technologies and the continued and ambitious expansion of renewable energies. Another possible factor would be the failure to fully implement climate protection goals, which has been considered to varying degrees using alternative approaches. Here, climate protection e/fforts have been intensi/fied  but  issues  surrounding  technical  feasibility  and  social hurdles have been taken into account di/fferently. We use the various assumptions on economic growth to derive the opportunities and risks for our business model.\n\n## Value added\n\n## Value added for EnBW and its stakeholders\n\nThe aim of our corporate activities is to add value in the short, medium and long term.

We have been resolutely repositioning our company in accordance with measurable targets since 2013 and aligning it to meet the requirements of the Energiewende in Germany. Our EnBW 2020 strategy that was guided by the principle of 'Energiewende. Safe. Hands on.' was based on sustainability criteria from the very beginning. Comprehensive investment in renewable energies, electricity grids and electromobility, the creation of new jobs and apprenticeships and intensive dialog with citizens, the public and non-government organizations (NGOs) characterized this phase of the transformation of the portfolio. This was accompanied by signi/ficant improvements in e/fficiency and the /first targeted growth initiatives. To implement our strategy, we planned total investment of \u20ac14.1 billion and divestitures of \u20ac5.1 billion by 2020 (reference year of 2012). We realized total investments of \u20ac17.2 billion, exceeding our investment target, and divestitures of \u20ac5.8 billion since 2012. A/f\\_ter the conclusion of the 2020 reporting year - the strategy horizon - the following is now clear: We have successfully implemented the repositioning of our company, increased our earnings to \u20ac2.8 billion, which is above both our earnings target of between \u20ac2.3 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion and the level before the Energiewende, and achieved or exceeded almost all the other targets in our EnBW 2020 strategy, reaching many of them earlier than planned (p. 37) .\n\n## The next step: EnBW 2025 strategy\n\nThe EnBW 2025 strategy is based - just like the EnBW 2020 strategy - on a holistic approach to stakeholders. It de/fines speci/fic /financial and non-/financial targets that take account of the economic, ecological and social dimensions of sustainability. We carried out a project at the Board of Management level during the coronavirus pandemic that closely examined the question of what opportunities and risks the pandemic could hold for our 2025 strategy. Under the motto 'Making and shaping the infrastructure world of tomorrow,' the EnBW 2025 strategy will increasingly place the company's focus onto the infrastructure aspects of existing business /fields - for example, networking small, decentralized power plants to form virtual power plants (Glossary, from p. 138) or networking the energy sector (Glossary, from p. 138) with neighboring sectors such as transport or communications. Furthermore, we will exploit new growth opportunities above and beyond the energy sector that are aligned with our core expertise. Our core expertise - what we do well and do better than many others - lies in the safe and reliable construction, operation and management of critical infrastructure in the energy sector, such as the supply of energy or the distribution of energy by our grid subsidiaries. This welldeveloped expertise can be transferred to other infrastructure sectors in which we have already made signi/ficant progress, such as the broadband business (Glossary,  from  p.  138) , the\n\nexpansion  of  quick-charging  infrastructure (Glossary,  from p. 138) and the area of urban infrastructure. Urban infrastructure, as we understand it, involves smart networking of the energy supply, heating, telecommunications, mobility, tra/ffic management and parking space management, as well as security in the public sphere. Performance, creativity, freedom for independent action,  quick  decision-making  processes  that  are  as  closely aligned to the business as possible and a resolute focus on the needs of our customers are de/fining the requirements for the future.\n\n## Sustainable and innovative infrastructure partner\n\nUsing the EnBW 2025 strategy, we aim to transform our company into a sustainable and innovative infrastructure partner for our customers and other stakeholders. We will combine our business portfolio within three strategic business /fields from 2021:\n\n- \u203a In the business /field Smart infrastructure for customers , we will transfer our core skills to new, o/f\\_ten digital business models. In the next few years, our investment will mainly focus on the areas of electromobility, telecommunications and broadband, as well as on photovoltaics and energy storage systems. We want to further expand our quick-charging infrastructure to promote electromobility and thus maintain our position as the market leader in this sector. In the telecommunications and broadband business, we will expand our infrastructure, increase our range of services and aim to secure a strong position on the German market. On the German home electricity storage market for solar electricity, we aim to join the leading group of suppliers with SENEC. And in the area of B2B sales for electricity and gas, we will continue to rely on digitalization and improvements in cost e/fficiency.\n- \u203a In the business /field System critical infrastructure , our grid subsidiaries for electricity and gas will further expand the transmission grids into an important cornerstone of our earnings alongside the distribution grids. In addition, our grid subsidiaries will upgrade the electricity distribution grids so that they are ready to meet the requirements of the future  and  ensure  they  are  optimally  prepared  for  the demands that will be placed on them by electromobility and electric heating. We will continue our participation model for local authorities to participate in the distribution grids. As part of the decarbonization of the gas sector, our grid companies are preparing their grid infrastructure for the use of climate-neutral gas in the future.\n- \u203a Renewable energies will dominant in the business /field Sustainable generation infrastructure. This also includes further selective internationalization and projects without state funding. The generation capacity of our wind power plants is due to increase to 4.0 GW by 2025 and our portfolio of photovoltaic projects to 1.2 GW. In addition, EnBW and BP have entered into an equal partnership to build two o/ffshore wind farms with a total capacity of 3.0 GW o/ff the coast of Great Britain and place them into operation from 2028. At the same time, we will further strengthen our strong position",

The last nuclear power plants operated by EnBW will be decommissioned by the end of 2022 at the latest. We will adapt our trading activities to the changes in our generation portfolio and the energy markets.\n\nThe central goal of the EnBW 2025 strategy is to increase adjusted EBITDA to \u20ac3.2 billion. All three strategic business /fields will make a signi/ficant contribution to this increase in earnings - which represents an increase of more than 30% compared to the strategic target value for 2020.\n\nEnBW is planning to invest around \u20ac12 billion in total between 2021 and 2025. The main focus of this investment will be the expansion of the grids, especially the central SuedLink and ULTRANET projects of our grid subsidiary TransnetBW for the future energy supply in Germany, the expansion of renewable energies, such as the planned realization of the EnBW He Dreiht o/ffshore wind farm, and the further development of smart infrastructure for customers, for example, in the areas of broadband, telecommunications and electromobility. In accordance with the EnBW 2025 growth strategy, 80% of our overall investment will be accounted for by growth projects. We will use sustainability criteria as the benchmark for our future decisions and investments even more resolutely than before and align our growth accordingly.\n\n## EnBW sustainability program\n\n## 25-point sustainability program 1\n\n## Management processes\n\n- \u00bb Climate neutrality by 2035\n- \u00bb Integration of sustainability assessment in investment decisions\n- \u00bb Evaluation of the EnBW portfolio based on EU taxonomy\n- \u00bb Transparency with regard to party donations and lobbying\n- \u00bb Introduction of a plan of measures and progress report for non-financial targets\n- \u00bb Integration of sustainability and climate protection into the Board of Management's remuneration\n- \u00bb Expansion of sustainable finance activities\n- \u00bb Systematic examination of sustainability risks and opportunities\n- \u00bb Human resources work focused on sustainability\n\n## Core processes\n\n## Sustainable generation infrastructure\n\n- \u00bb Boost sustainability in the area of trading\n- \u00bb Increase responsible raw material procurement\n- \u00bb Paris-compliant phase-out of coal\n- \u00bb Introduce climate-neutral gases\n- \u00bb Targets for harmful emissions and greenhouse gases\n- \u00bb Measures for efficient water consumption/extraction\n\n## System critical infrastructure\n\n- \u00bb Development of sustainable grid companies\n- \u00bb Boost sustainable product portfolio at Netze BW\n\n## Smart infrastructure for customers\n\n- \u00bb Sustainable sales\n- \u00bb Extend climate-friendly product portfolio\n\n## Realignment and growth\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA in \u20ac billion\n\nEnBW 2020 strategy: four segments\n\nEnBW 2025 strategy: three strategic business fields\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The terms used here deviate in some cases from the sustainability program published at www.enbw.com/sustainability.",

Sustainability will also be a key principle behind our business activities in our EnBW 2025 strategy in continuity with the goal system that we have been following since 2013. Our long-term business success will be oriented - in accordance with our understanding of sustainability - around economic, ecological and social goals.\n\nWe  launched  a  comprehensive  sustainability  program  in autumn 2020 that comprises 25 measures across these three dimensions. This 25-point sustainability program covers all areas of the Group from higher level management processes and key operating processes through to supporting processes in the business and functional units.\n\n## Long-term goal: Climate neutrality by 2035\n\n## Climate-neutral EnBW 2035\n\n## October 2020\n\nCommunication of climate-neutral EnBW 2035\n\n2020\n\n2035\n\n## 2020 - 2030\n\n- \u00bb Some Group companies already climate neutral\n- \u00bb Energiedienst (since early 2020)\n- \u00bb Netze BW (2021)\n- \u00bb Switch to more climate-friendly fuels, use of green electricity, etc.\n- \u00bb Decommissioning of approx. 2,500 MW of coal power\n\n## 2035\n\n- \u00bb Climate neutrality goal achieved in line with the requirements and targets of the Paris Agreement\n- \u00bb Reduction before offsetting\n- \u00bb Offsetting remaining residual emissions to achieve net zero emissions\n- \u00bb Increased use of CO 2-free gases (e.g., hydrogen in power plants)\n- 1 The EnBW climate neutrality target refers to our own emissions (Scope 1 and 2). Scope 3 is mainly influenced by the gas consumption of our customers and would require the use of climate-neutral gases in the future. The target refers to CO 2 eq (CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O and SF 6 ). The reference year is 2018.\n- 2 Includes in part the offsetting of remaining residual emissions due to the acquisition of recognized compensation certificates.\n\nA central goal of our 25-point sustainability program is to achieve climate neutrality. As an integrated energy company with its own comprehensive generation portfolio, we can make an important contribution to safeguarding the livelihoods of future generations. We have thus set ourselves the ambitious aim of achieving climate neutrality by 2035 across the entire company with respect to our own emissions (Scope 1 and 2). Our Scope 3 emissions are mainly due to the gas consumption by our customers (p. 82 ) . We anticipate that it will only be possible to reduce Scope 3 emissions by switching to climate-neutral gases, which will probably not be available in su/fficient quantities until the middle of the 2030s. An important milestone in our climate neutrality strategy will be halving our CO 2 emissions by 2030, based on the reference year of 2018. To this end, we will reduce our coal-based generation capacity of 4.6 GW (reference year of 2018) by around 2.5 GW. In parallel, we will examine the possibility of a fuel switch from coal to more climate-friendly gas and then in a second stage to climate neutral gases such as biogas or hydrogen. Coal-based energy generation will be fully phased out by the end of 2035. We are planning to use green electricity to compensate for grid losses in the energy system. Unavoidable residual emissions will be o/ffset by acquiring recognized compensation certi/ficates. Our\n\nsubsidiary  Energiedienst  is  already  climate  neutral  and Netze BW aims to achieve this goal in 2021. In 2020, the nongovernmental organization CDP awarded us the best possible 'A' grade rating for our climate protection activities (p. 47) for the /first time.\n\nThe EnBW approach to achieving climate neutrality by 2035, based on electricity generation and supply of heating, is in harmony with the requirements and targets of the Paris Agreement. It should also create a balance between the di/fferent expectations of our stakeholders, with whom we remain in constant dialog. Since 2013, even before the Coal Phase-out Act, we had already phased out around 40% of our particularly carbon-intensive generation capacity for ecological and economic reasons. In the social dimension, we will strive to ensure that there will be no additional job losses due to the transition to climate neutrality. EnBW currently has 3,400 employees in the area of conventional generation. We have already implemented suitable human resources measures such as further training and forward-looking human resources planning. Some employees from the area of conventional generation are already bringing their technical expertise to other areas of the company, such as our o/ffshore wind turbines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimateneutral EnBW\n\n2030\n\n-50%\n\nCO 2 emissions \u00b9\n\n## 2030\n\n## 2030 - 2035\n\n- \u00bb Gradual phasing out of coal\n- \u00bb Achievement of 'H 2 readiness': preparing/ switching over gas power plants to the use of hydrogen\n- \u00bb Continuation of other measures\n\n2035\n\n-100%\n\nCO 2 emissions \u00b9 , 2",

        "page_content": "## Goals and performance management system\n\n## Performance management system\n\nThe management of the company comprises /financial, strategic and non-/financial goals and, as well as the /finance and strategy goal dimensions, includes the dimensions customers and society, environment and employees. The centerpiece of this integrated corporate management is the performance management system (PMS). The most important /financial and non-/financial Group goals have been broken down into target agreements, insofar as they are considered a sensible performance indicator for the respective area. In the quarterly performance reviews conducted at a Board of Management level, the value drivers for the most important operating performance indicators that contribute to the achievement of targets for the key performance indicators (/finance, strategy and environment goal dimensions) are reported. In terms of external communication, the PMS feeds into the integrated reporting of the /financial and non/financial performance of the company based on the reporting framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). This Integrated Annual Report 2020 incorporates the /financial and non-/financial aspects of our business activities. The  key  performance  indicators  enable  us  to  measure  the degree to which goals are achieved and to manage our company.\n\n## Achievement of the 2020 strategy targets\n\nWe have achieved or exceeded the /financial and non-/financial targets de/fined in the EnBW 2020 strategy almost in full and in many cases ahead of plan. We view this as an outstanding success because the majority of the strategy targets were already de/fined in 2013 - eight years ago - and we have worked to achieve them in a resolute and disciplined manner, with huge commitment from all involved.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n- \u203a The adjusted EBITDA for the 2020 /financial year stood at \u20ac2.8 billion and thus exceeded the target value of between \u20ac2.3 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion. The Grids and Renewable Energies segments were important earnings generators in the strategy period.\n- \u203a Internal /financing capability: The adjusted retained cash /flow reached the forecasted range of \u20ac1.9 billion to \u20ac2.0 billion in 2020 so that the target value for internal /financing capability of \u2265100% was slightly exceeded. We were also able to achieve our target of an internal /financing capability of around 100% for the period 2017 to 2020 with 99.2%.\n- \u203a ROCE (return on capital employed): ROCE reached 6.3% in 2020 and did not reach the target range of 8.5% to 11%. The main reason for this was the fall in capital market returns as a result of the low-interest phase.\n- \u203a Share of the adjusted EBITDA accounted for by the segments : The regulated grid business and renewable energies accounted together for 78% of the operating earnings in 2020. The target here was at least 70%. We have realized the planned transformation of the business portfolio and thus signi/ficantly improved the risk-return pro/file of EnBW.\n\n## Non-financial key performance indicators\n\n- \u203a Reputation Index: We slightly exceeded our target with a value of 56 index points, which was mainly due to the fact that our stakeholders appreciate our reliable business performance and our commitment to sustainability and climate protection.\n- \u203a The Customer Satisfaction Index for the EnBW brand stood at 132 points in 2020 and thus narrowly missed the strategic target de/fined in 2013 of >136. The Customer Satisfaction Index for the Yello brand of 159 points in 2020 virtually achieved the target value of >159. While customer satisfaction with the Yello brand is signi/ficantly in/fluenced by brand image, price and service quality, the Customer Satisfaction Index for the EnBW brand is also impacted by social aspects. This is because it is a Group brand that has its own electricity generation capacities, which makes it more strongly recognizable to the public. This includes, for example, how the energy-industry activities of EnBW are perceived and the position it takes on current energy policy issues, the e/ffects of which are di/fficult to predict in the long term.\n- \u203a SAIDI: Due to our ongoing investment and maintenance programs, SAIDI remained at a good, stable level of 15 min.  /  year. We were thus able to achieve our target value of <25 min.  /  year.\n- \u203a Installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of  the  generation  capacity  accounted  for  by  RE: The installed output of RE reached 4.9 GW in 2020 and we thus almost achieved our target of 5.0 GW. The share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE stood at 39%, which was only slightly below the target value of >40%. That means we have largely realized our strategic plans for the expansion of electricity generation from renewable energies.\n- \u203a CO2 intensity: The CO 2 intensity of own generation of electricity in 2020 was 372 g  /  kWh. The target was to reduce the value from 2015 of 606 g  /  kWh by between 15% and 20%. We were able to clearly exceed this target with a reduction of 39%. The reasons for the over-attainment of this target were despite the increased utilization of our power plants for redispatch by the transmission system operators in 2020 the decommissioning of fossil fuel power plant capacities, which were mainly transferred to the grid reserve due to their system relevance, market-driven developments and the e/ffect of the coronavirus pandemic.\n- \u203a PEI: The  key  performance  indicator  People  Engagement Index (PEI) was only introduced in 2020 and there was thus no strategic target value de/fined for 2020. The Employee Commitment Index (ECI) was not compiled in 2020 but we had already exceeded the 2020 target value for this indicator in 2019.\n- \u203a LTIF: In comparison to the previous year, the LTIF for companies controlled by the Group remained at a good, stable level and we were thus able to achieve our target. There was no target value de/fined for LTIF overall for the 2020 /financial year as we only reported on this performance indicator for the /first time in 2019.",

potential from 2021 onwards. To achieve the unchanged goal of maintaining a solid investment-grade rating, EnBW regularly checks the 2025 target value for the debt repayment potential for managing its financial profile. This was stated in the Integrated Annual Report 2019 as > 14 % . The adjusted target of > 12% will allow the company to take advantage of opportunities for growth while simultaneously maintaining its solid investment-grade rating.

The target figures for the expansion of RE were adjusted due to slowed approval processes and grid connection and feed-in forecasts.

This system strengthens integrated thinking in our company. At the same time, it underpins our comprehensive and transparent focus on performance and stakeholders. Our goal system comprises the /five dimensions of /finance, strategy, customers and society, environment and employees. A number of speci/fic targets have been de/fined in each goal dimension, whose achievement is continuously measured using key performance indicators. Linked with this goal system and the centerpiece of our corporate management is the performance management system (PMS). Quantitative target values are currently set for the key performance indicators for the 2025 strategy horizon. The key performance indicators for the 2020 /financial year were unchanged in comparison with the previous year with one exception: The People Engagement Index (PEI) has replaced the Employee Commitment Index (ECI).\n\nThe /financial and strategic key performance indicators within the PMS are the adjusted EBITDA, the shares of the adjusted EBITDA accounted for by the segments, the internal /financing capability and ROCE:\n\n- \u203a The adjusted EBITDA is the earnings before the investment and /financial results, income taxes and amortization and adjusted for non-operating e/ffects. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance indicator for the /finance goal dimension, while the key performance indicators for the strategy goal dimension,  which  describe  the shares  of  adjusted  EBITDA accounted for by the segments , are derived directly from it (p.65 and 97) .\n- \u203a The internal /financing capability is the key performance indicator for the Group's ability to /finance its activities internally: It describes the adjusted retained cash /flow in relation to the adjusted net (cash) investment (p. 73 and 96). A/f\\_ter covering ongoing costs and dividend payments, the adjusted retained cash /flow is available to the company for net investment without the need to raise additional debt. Since the 2017 /financial year, we have adjusted the retained cash /flow to take account of the extraordinary e/ffect of the reimbursement of the nuclear fuel rod tax (Glossary,  from  p.  138) (adjusted retained cash /flow) and since the 2019 /financial year we have also adjusted the net (cash) investment to take into account the accelerated growth investment used for the acquisitions of Valeco and Plusnet that already contribute to the EnBW 2025 growth strategy. As it will not be possible to exclusively /finance this growth phase using funds from our internal /financing capability, we will manage the /financial pro/file  from  2021  using  the debt  repayment  potential (retained cash /flow in relation to the net debt) .\n- \u203a ROCE (return on capital employed) is the ratio of adjusted EBIT including the adjusted investment result to the average capital employed. It should exceed capital costs and is used for determining the value added, re/flecting the development of the company's value from a /financial point of view (p. 74 f. and 97 f.) .\n\nOther explanations of our /financial key performance indicators can be found in the Glossary, from p. 138 .\n\nIn addition to the /financial key performance indicators, the PMS also includes non-/financial key performance indicators:\n\nThe customers and society goal dimension comprises the Reputation Index, the Customer Satisfaction Index and the SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index):\n\n- \u203a In order to calculate the Reputation Index, a total of around 5,000 people - from the stakeholder groups relevant for the EnBW brand of customers, the wider public, industrial companies, opinion leaders and investors - are asked about their impressions  of  the  EnBW  brand  by  an  external  market research institute. Results are collected for each stakeholder group  about  the  distinctiveness  of  the  brand  and  their assessment of the competence of and emotional attitude towards the EnBW brand. These are merged together to form a  Reputation  Index.  The  individual  reputation  indices for each stakeholder group are weighted equally to form a consolidated and reported Reputation Index (p. 76 and 98) .\n- \u203a The key performance indicator Customer Satisfaction Index assesses the average satisfaction of private end consumers of electricity over the year, which is directly linked to customer loyalty. The information is compiled using customer surveys about the two brands EnBW and Yello conducted by an external service provider. The Customer Satisfaction Index allows us to draw conclusions about how well we are meeting the needs and wishes of the surveyed customers (p. 76 f. and 98) .\n- \u203a SAIDI serves as the key performance indicator of supply reliability. It speci/fies the average length of supply interruption in the electricity distribution grid experienced annually by each connected customer. SAIDI includes all unscheduled interruptions to supply that last more than three minutes for the end consumer. The de/finition and calculation of this performance indicator is based on the guidelines issued by the Network Technology  /  Network Operation Forum (FNN) of the VDE (German Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information Technologies) (p. 78 f. and 98) . The reliability of the supply in the grid areas operated by our grid subsidiaries builds on our comprehensive investment in grids and facilities as well as our system expertise.\n\nThe  key  performance  indicators  in  the  environment  goal dimension are the installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE and CO 2 intensity:\n\n- \u203a The installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE are measures of the expansion of renewable energies and refer to the installed output of the power plants and not to their weather-dependent contribution to electricity generation (p. 81 and 98) .\n- \u203a The emissions of CO 2 from own generation of electricity for the Group, as well as the volume of electricity generated by the Group without the contribution made by the nuclear power plants, form the basis for the calculation of the key performance indicator CO2 intensity . This performance indicator is calculated as the ratio between the emissions and the generated  volume  of  electricity  and  thus  speci/fically describes the amount of CO 2 released per kilowatt hour. By discounting  the  electricity  generated  by  nuclear  power",

        "page_content": "provide an analysis of interdependencies between them. By linking  together  the  various  goal  dimensions,  we  want  to demonstrate an important element of our integrated reporting. Interlinking /financial and non-/financial aspects encourages a holistic corporate management approach within EnBW. In order to illustrate these interdependencies, the key performance indicators for the goal and performance management system are used. We take as a basis the fact that a change in one key performance indicator can also o/f\\_ten lead to a change in one or more other key performance indicators. Reciprocal relationships thus exist between the key performance indicators - in the most extreme case, all of the key performance indicators can even in/fluence all the others.\n\nIn order to illustrate the interdependencies in 2020, we have selected two themes: climate neutrality by 2035 and Sustainable Netze BW. Both themes represent measures in the EnBW sustainability program (p. 35 f.) . Using the long-term goal of  climate neutrality as a component of the 25-point sustainability program, we demonstrate the direct positive e/ffect on the key performance indicators in the environment goal dimension. The activities of our subsidiary Netze BW that focus on a sustainable Energiewende and mobility transition have a direct e/ffect on the key performance indicator 'share of adjusted EBITDA accounted for by Grids' in the strategy goal dimension. In addition, we anticipate that there will be a direct or potential impact on other key performance indicators in both cases.\n\nThe key performance indicators that are directly in/fluenced are positioned in the center of the diagram and should essentially be directly measurable. The interdependencies between the /financial  and  strategy  key  performance  indicators  are  also essentially  directly  measurable  and  are  represented  in  the example diagrams by orange arrows. The interdependencies with the other non-/financial key performance indicators are dif/ficult to measure and generally tend to be potential or long term in nature. They are represented by gray arrows. In the 2020 /financial year, these interdependencies were not measured individually. They are presented based on the results of an exchange of information with experts from the relevant departments. The upward pointing arrows show a positive in/fluence on the key performance indicator, while the downward pointing arrows show a negative in/fluence.\n\nplants, the performance indicator will not be in/fluenced by the phasing out of nuclear energy in the coming years (p. 83 and 99 f.).\n\nThe People Engagement Index (PEI) and LTIF (Lost Time Injury Frequency)  are  utilized  as  performance  indicators  in  the employees goal dimension:\n\n- \u203a The PEI expresses how engaged employees are in their work at EnBW and was measured and reported as a key performance indicator for the /first time in 2020. It is compiled at all companies with more than 100 employees (except for the Independent Transmission Operators [ITOs]) (Glossary, from p. 138) as part of an employee survey carried out by an external, independent service provider. It is determined based on the /first question of the standardized list of questions 'How happy are you working for the EnBW Group and the companies in the Group?' It is a question that uses a rating scale from 1 (I do not agree at all) to 5 (I agree completely). The value determined is then converted to a scale of 0 to 100 (p. 86 and 99) . The Employee Commitment Index (ECI) was compiled up until 2019 and expressed the degree to which employees identi/fied with EnBW.\n- \u203a LTIF is calculated on the basis of LTI (Lost Time Injuries), which denotes the number of accidents during working hours which have occurred exclusively because of a work assignment from the company and result in at least one day of absence. LTIF indicates how many LTI occurred per one million working hours performed. The calculation of the LTIF overall generally includes all companies with more than 100 employees. For the calculation of the LTIF for companies controlled by the Group, those companies engaged in the area of waste management are excluded because the number of accidents deviates signi/ficantly from that in the core business in the energy industry. External agency workers and contractors are not taken into account in either performance indicator (p. 89 and 99) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /#TOP Interdependencies between the goal dimensions, targets and key performance indicators\n\nIn order to give a comprehensive portrayal of the company, we are convinced that it is not only necessary to present the economic, ecological and social aspects, but also to illustrate and",

Further information on the Annual General Meeting is available at http://hv.enbw.com .\n\nShares of EnBW AG are listed on the General Standard segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. A stake of 46.75% of the share capital in EnBW AG is owned by each of both the Federal State of  Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg  -  via  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary NECKARPRI GmbH and, in turn, via its wholly owned subsidiary NECKARPRI-Beteiligungsgesellscha/f\\_t mbH - and by Zweckverband Oberschw\u00e4bische Elektrizit\u00e4tswerke (Zweckverband OEW) via its wholly owned subsidiary OEW Energie-Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\nOverall, the shareholder structure is unchanged as of 31 December 2020 when compared to the previous year.\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, the Annual General Meeting was postponed from 8 May until 17 July 2020 and was held exclusively as a virtual event. As a result of the postponement, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of EnBW AG agreed to pay out an advance dividend from retained earnings of \u20ac0.35 per share to shareholders. The advance dividend was paid to shareholders on 14 May 2020. The total amount paid to the 270,855,027 shares entitled to dividends was almost \u20ac95 million. The other half of the dividend was paid on 22 July 2020.\n\nDue to the fact that the coronavirus pandemic was still ongoing at the end of 2020, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board decided, using section 1 (1), (2) and (6) of the German law on COVID-19 measures as a basis, to also hold the ordinary Annual General Meeting 2021 in virtual form to ensure that\n\nresolutions and deadlines can be handled smoothly.

Our compliance management systems (CMS) and functions are individually designed: They are based on company and sector-speci/fic priorities and risks, the size of the company and other factors. They are designed to support each company - and thus the whole Group - in avoiding risks, liability claims and damage to reputation.\n\nDepending on the type of corporate control over a company, the compliance-relevant  companies  with  employees  are  either directly or indirectly integrated into the compliance management system of EnBW.\n\nThe CMS is continuously examined and updated internally as part of the audit or by the compliance organization itself. It covers the directly controlled companies. The department's activities focus on the prevention, detection and sanctioning of corruption, the prevention of violations against competition and antitrust laws, the prevention of money laundering and data protection which falls under the area of compliance and data protection at EnBW AG. In the reporting year, there were 30 companies directly integrated into the CMS from a compliance perspective.\n\nCompanies indirectly integrated into the CMS of EnBW also have their own CMS. Relevant participating interests held by these companies are also integrated into their CMS. Two companies in the ED Group were integrated into the CMS at Energiedienst (ED). Seven companies with employees were integrated into the CMS at  Pra\u017esk\u00e1  energetika  (PRE),  three  at  Stadtwerke  D\u00fcsseldorf (SWD), one at ZEAG and twenty at the VNG Group.\n\nWe aim to safeguard our commercial success by combating compliance risks - especially corruption and bribery. Preventative risk assessment methods, advisory services and training concepts have been set up at EnBW, the compliance-relevant companies and the ITOs (Independent Transmission Operator) (Glossary, from p. 138) .",

        "page_content": "The advisory services o/ffered by the EnBW compliance department are available to companies directly integrated into the CMS and represent another key element of prevention. They were also highly utilized in 2020. These services include a compliance hotline, which can be reached in person, either by e-mail or telephone. In 2020, the hotline received around 1,240 inquiries relating to the key issues of sponsoring, donations and gi/f\\_ts. Advice was also provided on topics such as con/flicts of interest and the auditing of business partners. Regular and recurring audits of business partners are being carried out and are becoming increasingly important. The advisory services dealing with compliance themes at the indirectly integrated companies have also been used to good e/ffect.\n\nMeetings  continue  to  be  held  and  information  exchanged across all specialist areas even while employees are currently working from home. This network plays an important role in compliance work and it has been possible to keep the network intact even during times with limited in-person meetings.\n\n## Compliance breaches\n\nEnBW AG and the directly integrated companies have established reporting channels via which internal, and also external, whistleblowers can report suspected cases while remaining anonymous. Alongside EnBW AG, the companies ED, PRE, SWD and TransnetBW have also established a whistleblower system.\n\nIn the reporting year, there were three breaches at directly integrated companies, of which one was a material breach where allegations of corruption were con/firmed. There was one compliance breach each at SWD and PRE in the reporting year. No cases of corruption were reported.\n\nWe faced neither antitrust law penalty procedures nor third-party antitrust lawsuits in the 2020 /financial year. Law enforcement agency investigations of individual employees and former members of corporate bodies relating to the so-called Russian business deals and the sales tax carousel in CO 2 allowance trading (Glossary, from p. 138) were also ongoing in 2020. It is not possible to say at the present time when these proceedings will end.\n\n## Data protection\n\nThe need for consulting and advice on data protection has remained high due to the ongoing sensitive nature of issues relating to data protection. This was noticeable, for example, in the considerable increase in the number of requests for information from our customers. Activities to bring more and more digitalization  to  all  levels  of  the  company  are  also  being closely accompanied by the data protection department. Furthermore, o/fficial rulings and legal judgments at a national and European level have an in/fluence on the advice we provide. In the reporting year, the data protection management system at Netze BW GmbH was audited by the Group auditing department. Since 2020, employees are now obligated to complete the e-training course on data protection every two years. In addition, we further expanded the range of e-training courses for sensitive areas.\n\n## Activities this year\n\nWe held training courses in relevant areas in 2020. These training courses were mainly held Group-wide in the Operations and Sales business units and focused on the topics of data protection and compliance. It was still possible to hold in-person training courses up to March 2020. We continued to o/ffer training courses in sensitive areas in an online format for the rest of the year. New employees at EnBW are obligated to complete an e-learning course on corruption prevention and data protection. All of the indirectly integrated companies held training courses to increase awareness among employees. The companies used either in-person or online training courses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 At EnBW AG and directly integrated companies.\n- 2 In-person training courses and live online training courses from March 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEnBW holds a compliance day every year. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the event was held for the /first time in virtual form on 7 October 2020. We were still able to o/ffer the 167 participants a varied program online including motivational talks and workshops. In line with the motto of '#eskommtaufDichan' (it's up to YOU), we emphasized the role played by every individual employee in compliance at the company and held lively discussions. The event was also covered via the company's internal communication platforms, giving all employees the opportunity to participate in the discussions.\n\nThe annual compliance risk assessments at EnBW investigate the corruption, antitrust, fraud and data protection risks and form the basis for all work relating to compliance and data protection. In 2020, they were carried out at those companies directly and closely integrated into the CMS. Such risks are also systematically analyzed and identi/fied in the indirectly integrated companies and the ITOs.",

        "page_content": "## In dialog with our stakeholders\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\nContinuous and systematic dialog with our internal and external  stakeholders  is  an  important  element  for  determining future key issues as part of our business activities. The most important stakeholder groups include (in alphabetical order) customers, employees and job applicants, environmental initiatives and associations, local authorities and municipal utilities, the political community and the media, shareholders and the capital market, society, and suppliers and business partners. A fundamental aspect of our dialog with stakeholders is the identi/fication and prioritization of stakeholder groups relevant to strategically signi/ficant and current issues, such as with regards to the Energiewende/mobility transition and developments in the areas of sustainability and innovation.\n\nWe use a variety of communication channels for this dialog -from (online) conferences to social media platforms . In dialog with our stakeholders, we listen to their interests and their expectations of EnBW. This information is taken into account in the strategic positioning of the company and when making business decisions. At the same time, we inform all stakeholders about the company's needs and the necessary prerequisites for providing e/fficient, reliable and sustainable infrastructure. As part of this dialog, it is also important for us to listen to critical opinions such as those expressed at events held by our Energy & Climate Protection Foundation (www.energie-klimaschutz.de) . It is our belief that mutual understanding, social acceptance and trust are increased further through this purposeful exchange of insights and perspectives. In addition, it can also help us to identify central developments and key topics at an early stage.\n\n## Materiality analysis\n\nWe have continuously expanded our processes over the last few years for identifying material topics and linking them with the development of the company's strategy. Material aspects are determined via the framework provided by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), as well as in accordance with standards for sustainability reporting issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In addition, current developments /flow into the determination of future key issues, such as the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (Glossary, from p. 138) on climate-related risk reporting.\n\nWe consider topics to be material if they have a signi/ficant in/fluence on long-term value added and thus the performance and future viability of our company. Contributions to the strategic orientation as a sustainable and innovative infrastructure partner are of particular importance in this context. Furthermore, aspects re/flecting any important economic, environmental and\n\nsocial impacts our company may have and that signi/ficantly in/fluence the perception of stakeholders are also taken into account.\n\nMaterial themes are continuously implemented in the functional and business units, as well as in the individual companies of EnBW. In addition, the /findings from the materiality analysis /flow into, for example, the strategy process and stakeholder management.\n\nThe materiality analysis process comprises three steps: the creation of an overview of the themes relevant to strategy and communication, the development of a list of themes relevant from the perspective of sustainability and the derivation of material themes from the reputation analysis. During each step of the process, the themes identi/fied are regularly compared to the key themes that were dealt with by the Supervisory Board in the reporting year. Every step leads to a prioritization of the themes and ultimately to a /final list of the top themes that can be allocated to the categories of transformation of the portfolio, growth and sustainability.\n\nThe transformation of the portfolio is shaped by the following themes:\n\n- \u203a Expansion of renewable energies: In January 2020, we completed the EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farm with a total output of 118 MW and placed it into operation (p. 81 f.) . In addition, we constructed the Weesow-Willmersdorf solar park in Brandenburg with an installed capacity of 187 Mwp p and partially placed it into operation - we have thus realized the /first major solar project without EEG funding (p. 81). Furthermore, we constructed and acquired onshore wind farms with a total output of 82 MW in Germany (e.g., in Brandenburg  and  Saxony-Anhalt)  and  also  pushed  forward  the expansion of onshore wind power in France and Sweden (p. 81 f.).\n- \u203a Reliability and security of supply: The grid subsidiaries of EnBW will continue to guarantee a high level of supply reliability in their grid areas and for their customers through the gradual modernization of the distribution grids for electricity (p. 78 f.). In addition, we started construction of the gas turbine power plant in Marbach as special technical equipment for grids (p. 71).\n- \u203a Infrastructure provider: We are continuously expanding electromobility through the further development of the charging infrastructure (Glossary, from p. 138), also together with national and international cooperation partners (p. 77) .\n- \u203a Dismantling of nuclear power plants: The environmentally friendly dismantling of the nuclear power plants is gradually being implemented. The cooling towers at the Philippsburg nuclear power plant that was decommissioned in December 2019 were demolished in May 2020 (p. 62) .",

        "page_content": "- \u203a Coal phase-out: We have set ourselves the ambitious goal of achieving climate neutrality with respect to our own CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2035. As part of the phasing out of coal power, we will already have removed 2.5 GW of coal-based generation capacity from operation by 2030 (p. 36 and 58) .\n\nThe following themes are material in the three strategic business /fields in the growth category:\n\n## \u203a Smart infrastructure for customers:\n\n- \u203a In the area of broadband (Glossary, from p. 138) , we are continuing to develop our growth initiatives from 2019 with our subsidiaries NetCom BW and Plusnet. This strategic future business /field also includes the activities of Netze BW, which was able to secure a number of contracts in invitations to tender for the expansion of broadband this year (p. 78) .\n- \u203a With our digital district platform, we are expanding our engagement in modern and digital infrastructure. We are planning to construct the 'new St\u00f6ckach' (p. 48) - a sustainable, modern and lively city district on one of our former sites in the east of Stuttgart.\n- \u203a The State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and EnBW are working together on cybersecurity, above all on combating cybercrime and protecting critical infrastructure (p. 78) .\n- \u203a We have expanded our gas business with the acquisition of Gas-Union (p. 71) .\n\n## \u203a System critical infrastructure:\n\n- \u203a The expansion and upgrading of the distribution grid for the integration of renewable energies and to support electromobility are for us and our grid subsidiaries key aspects for the success of the Energiewende (p. 78) .\n- \u203a Our grid subsidiary TransnetBW is making a fundamental contribution to the restructuring of the energy system by expanding the transmission grid to transfer electricity generated in the windy north to the south of Germany (p. 60) .\n- \u203a We were able to take advantage of a strategic growth opportunity by acquiring Gas-Union Transport (p. 71) .\n\n## \u203a Sustainable generation infrastructure:\n\n- \u203a We have taken the investment decision for the two solar parks Gottesgabe and Alttrebbin in Brandenburg, each with a capacity of around 150 MW (p. 96) .\n- \u203a Internationalization: Our Danish subsidiary CWS received two major contracts for the maintenance of onshore wind turbines in Denmark and France (p. 32) .\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our corporate strategy . Since 2013, we have consistently focused on sustainability criteria and completed a fundamental transformation of the portfolio with the EnBW 2020 strategy. The EnBW 2025 strategy that aims to transform the company into a sustainable and innovative infrastructure partner will continue to follow this sustainable path (p. 34 f.) . Furthermore, we have also developed an additional, comprehensive sustainability program comprising 25 measures. These measures focus on management, core and supporting processes (p. 35 f.) . The following measures were and will continue to be important themes with respect to sustainability in the 2020 /financial year and beyond:\n\n## \u203a Management processes:\n\n- \u203a We are aiming to achieve 'climate neutrality throughout the entire Group by 2035.' While taking into account economic, ecological and social aspects, we want to become climate neutral with respect to our own CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by this year or even signi/ficantly earlier in some areas (p. 36 and 40 f.) .\n- \u203a 'Integration of sustainability evaluation into portfolio and investment decisions' this will help us to more consistently benchmark our future decisions and investments against sustainability criteria and align our growth accordingly (p. 72) .\n- \u203a 'Evaluation of the EnBW portfolio based on EU taxonomy' we will be publishing key /figures that conform to the EU taxonomy for our business activities in the Integrated Annual Report (p. 79 ff.) .\n- \u203a 'Sustainability as a focus within human resource work (focusing on people)'  we want to integrate sustainability aspects into all human resource work and strengthen the attractiveness of the company as an employer for current and future employees (p. 86) .\n- \u203a Strengthening the theme of sustainable /finance -the main focus of this measure will be taking account of sustainable /finance aspects in /financial instruments and transactions at EnBW (p. 68 f.) .\n\n## \u203a Core processes:\n\n- \u203a As part of the measure 'sustainable sales,' we will analyze important economic, ecological and social impacts within the sales organization. The resulting information will be used  to  derive  and  implement  sustainability-related initiatives (p. 77 f.) .\n- \u203a 'Sustainable Netze BW and roll-out to further grid companies': Relevant areas of action for improving the sustainability performance of the individual grid companies along the value added chain will be identi/fied and implemented (p. 34 and 40 f.) .\n- \u203a We aim to phase out coal-/fired generation in conformity with the Paris Agreement. The required measures will make a contribution to achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2035 (p. 36 and 58) .\n- \u203a In the measure 'responsible procurement of raw materials (including gas/LNG),' we will further strengthen ecological and social aspects in the procurement process (p. 54 ff.) .\n\n## \u203a Supporting processes:\n\n- \u203a 'Paper reduction and recycling': We have set ourselves the goal of signi/ficantly reducing paper consumption. Central purchasing at EnBW AG has switched over to recycling paper certi/fied with the Blue Angel environmental label for any paper consumption that is currently still required (p. 54) .\n- \u203a 'Sustainable  procurement' stands for the consistent consideration of sustainability aspects in procurement. We will carry out a comprehensive range of analyses for this purpose - with the aim of, among other things, identifying  potential  and  de/fining  speci/fic  approaches  for integrating sustainability criteria into the procurement processes (p. 53 f.) .\n- \u203a As part of the measure 'sustainable property management (new and existing buildings)', we want to signi/ficantly reduce the CO 2 emissions from buildings. Numerous initiatives will make a contribution to achieving this aim (p. 85) .",

In the selection of agencies, the main focus is placed on, among other things, transparent and plausible evaluations and e/fficient working processes between the rating agencies, companies, investors and sustainability analysts. We strive to continuously improve our ratings from recognized agencies in the area of sustainability. We thus aim to strengthen our position as a responsible and sustainable company and also want to address those /financial investors whose investment decisions are based wholly or\n\npartially on sustainability criteria. In 2020, we were able to largely maintain or improve our above-average results within the energy sector in important sustainability ratings, which are shown in the following table. For example, we received the best rating of A (leadership status) from the renowned non-government organization CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which was only achieved by 16 companies from all industries across Germany. The main reasons for receiving this 'A' grade rating were the greater integration of climate protection into the corporate strategy, sustainable business activities and internal initiatives, as well as advances in the area of risk management.\n\n## Latest sustainability ratings\n\n|                   | CDP                                                               | ISS ESG                                                                     | MSCI                                                      |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Result            | A / Leadership (2020)                                             | B\u00ad / Prime (2020)                                                            | A / Average (2021)                                        |\n| Scale             | A to D\u00ad                                                            | A+ to D\u00ad                                                                     | AAA to CCC                                                |\n| Relative position | 'Electric Utilities' sector worldwide:  EnBW rated in the top 7%. | 'Utilities / Multi Utilities' sector  worldwide: EnBW rated in the top 10%. | 'Utilities' sector worldwide:  EnBW rated in the top 47%. |\n| Rating focus      | Climate protection                                                | Social, governance and environmental  aspects                               | Social, governance and environmental  aspects             |\n\nThe methodology used for the Sustainalytics sustainability ratings was changed in 2020. The previous ESG Report has been replaced by the ESG Risk Rating Report. Our rating changed as a result from a score of 77 (scale of 0-100) with an 'Outperformer' rating and a place in the top 14% of the 'Utilities' sector worldwide in 2019 to a score of 32.3 (scale 0-100) and the rating 'High Risk' in 2021 (January 2021). According to the new rating methodology, we are ranked among the best 24% in the 'Electric Utilities' sector worldwide (January 2021).\n\nFurther information on the sustainability ratings is available at www.enbw.com/sustainability . Further details on non-/financial performance indicators are presented on p. 76 ff ., while information on the /financial ratings from the rating agencies Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch can be found on p. 67 f.\n\n## Social engagement\n\nOur commitment to addressing the concerns and interests of society focuses on the target groups of end customers, business partners and local authorities within our primary business sphere of in/fluence in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Support for superordinate social issues is concentrated on the core areas of popular sport, education, social issues, the environment and art and culture.\n\nThe Group guidelines on corporate sponsoring, memberships, donations and involvement with universities govern the goals, responsibilities, standards, principles and processes for all companies in which EnBW AG holds a majority of either the shares or voting rights. Donations are documented on a yearly basis in  the  donation  report  that  is  presented  to  the  Board  of Management. In 2020, donations made by the EnBW Group came to \u20ac3.1 million, following \u20ac3.6 million in the previous year.\n\nDonations worth \u20ac1.0 million (2019: \u20ac1.8 million) were attributable to EnBW AG. This decrease both at EnBW AG and the Group was mainly due to one-o/ff donations to foundations in the previous year. In contrast, signi/ficant donations were made in 2020 by both EnBW AG and the other Group companies to aid measures related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, Pra\u017esk\u00e1 energetika (PRE) supported the Charta 77 Foundation - Barriers Account, the Dagmar and V\u00e1clav Havel Foundation  VIZE  97  and  other  charitable  organizations. Stadtwerke D\u00fcsseldorf (SWD) has helped schools with the task of guiding young people towards a career for many years. In addition, SWD makes a Christmas donation to four charitable associations in D\u00fcsseldorf that are selected each year. Through the VNG Foundation, VNG supports the 'Network of Warmth' charitable network that promotes charitable work in Germany. More than 20 associations were provided with support during the pandemic via a Corona Aid Fund in 2020. The VNG subsidiary ONTRAS Gastransport has supported charitable projects from associations and initiatives via its 'ONTRAS.Stadtbekannt' program since 2015 and has participated in the 'Foundation for volunteering  and  civic  involvement  in  Mecklenburg-West Pomerania' since 2018. Around 55 projects in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania were supported in 2020.\n\nThe EnBW Board of Management decided a number of years ago not to send Christmas gi/f\\_ts to business partners but instead to make donations to social projects in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. As part of the Christmas donations in 2020, a total of \u20ac32,000 was given to eight charitable campaigns or campaigns initiated by readers of regional newspapers in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Due to the fact that all internal Christmas parties at EnBW were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, we donated a total of \u20ac150,000 to the 'Tafel' charities in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the Kinderland Foundation Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg and the German",

        "page_content": "There were also limitations in 2020 to our dialog with the public with respect to the dismantling of the nuclear power plants that we operate. It was not possible to hold many of the planned measures, such as the ongoing information days and an information event for the public in Philippsburg about the demolition of the cooling towers at the site. For the demolition of the cooling towers in Philippsburg in particular, we used several di/fferent measures as a replacement in order to maintain dialog with the public. These measures included numerous telephone conferences with stakeholders and media representatives, the distribution of information material to the people in the local region, the creation of a comprehensive project website with explanatory videos and the setting up of a digital contact channel, which proved very popular. Furthermore, those responsible discussed and answered questions on all topics using the various formats available in 2020.\n\nWe plan, construct and operate wind farms and photovoltaic power plants in direct partnership with or with the participation of local authorities and citizens. Local citizens are able to use a citizen participation platform to participate /financially in regional renewable energy projects. This platform was overhauled in 2020 as part of the digital transformation across the Group. The signing process has now been fully digitalized.\n\nIn the area of urban infrastructure, we plan, realize, operate and /finance holistic, sustainable and digital districts (Glossary, from p. 138) in partnership with cities and local authorities, public utilities and project developers, as well as with the participation of citizens. We concluded project contracts in 2020 for supplying districts with around 4,000 residential units and their associated local supply structures. Three projects entered the realization phase or are already in operation. Another example is the St\u00f6ckach site in the east of Stuttgart that is being developed as a joint project with the corporate infrastructure department. 'New  St\u00f6ckach' (www.der-neue-stoeckach.de) will  comprise about 800 apartments with a total of around 60,000 m\u00b2 of living space, up to 40% of which will be subsidized housing. We plan to integrate opportunities for social interaction, leisure, local supply structures, health, energy supplies and mobility into the project. The participation of citizens will play a central role and we have also promoted this intensively during the coronavirus pandemic in the form of various digital events.\n\nfoundation for the protection of children H\u00e4nsel+Gretel. Under the motto of 'We're making it happen together,' we had already donated a total of \u20ac150,000 to the 'Tafel' charities in BadenW\u00fcrttemberg in the /first half of 2020. In addition, the EnBW Food Truck has been providing food to those in need, as well as to medical and care personnel at hospitals, sanatoriums and children's villages. Furthermore, many private campaigns such as 'Christmas wishes in care homes' or private donations for the Doctors Without Borders organization were initiated by the workforce via an online platform. We support social or charitable projects with the 'Making it happen bus.' Further information on this subject can be found at www.enbw.com/macherbus . Netzte BW has been requesting that customers submit their electricity meter readings electronically rather than by post since 2018. The postage saved was also donated to numerous charitable organizations in the respective communities in 2020.\n\nWe have been o/ffering a multi-stage career integration program to refugees and migrants since 2016, in which 59 people are currently serving a technical apprenticeship. A/f\\_ter successfully completing the program, the refugees and migrants have good prospects of receiving a permanent contract. We will continue this program in the next few years - both as a social initiative and also increasingly as an additional tool for recruiting young talent.\n\nWe support the 'Let's Volunteer' initiative launched by our employees by giving two employees who volunteer in their local communities \u20ac1,000 to donate to a charitable association each month.\n\nWe also refer you to the details provided in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 103) .\n\n## Dialog with citizens\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, it was impossible to hold many visits, tours and events as planned in 2020. In order to nevertheless remain in dialog with citizens, digital formats were introduced. For example, it was possible to take virtual tours of the EnBW generation plants. Instead of the planned tour of the construction site in Herbertingen, Netze BW presented the most important stages of the grid expansion project in a video. In the summer and autumn, it was possible to hold some public information events on a small scale and in compliance with existing hygiene rules in Welzheim, Aitrach and Pl\u00fcderhausen.",

        "page_content": "## Research, development and innovation\n\n## Research and development: Goals, guidelines and processes\n\nThe goal of our research and development is to identify technological trends at an early stage, assess their economic potential and build up expertise in the business units. For this purpose, we carry out pilot and demonstration projects together with partners or customers directly at the site of their subsequent application.  This  ensures  that  successful  research  projects deliver innovations for our company.\n\nResearch, development and innovation also lead in many cases to  inventions  and  patents.  The  portfolio  of  patents  shrank slightly by 20 patents (previous year: +36) in 2020; the EnBW Group thus held 224 patents (previous year: 244) at the end of the year. The patents held by EnBW focus mainly on the areas of generation and electromobility.\n\n## Research and development: Selected activities\n\nWind energy: O/ffshore wind power plants with /fixed foundations are limited to shallow waters with water depths of up to around 50 meters. Floating platforms could be used to install wind turbines in deeper waters. In cooperation with partners, we are investigating several di/fferent concepts for /floating o/ffshore wind farm projects that would be suitable for opening up new international o/ffshore wind energy regions. In cooperation with the engineering company aerodyn from northern Germany, we tested a 1:10 scale model of a new design for /floating wind turbines called Nezzy\u00b2 in 2020. Tests carried out on a gravel  pit  lake  in  northern  Germany  and  in  the  Baltic  Sea demonstrated that the platform concept worked even in stormy winds. Scaled up to the later true size of the system, the wave and wind conditions were equivalent to a category 4 to 5 hurricane with waves reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Nezzy\u00b2 will now be tested under real conditions at sea. The test using a 1:1 scale model is due to be carried out in China at the end of 2021 or beginning of 2022. We also concluded a cooperation agreement with other European companies at the end of 2020 to construct a pilot plant in the Irish Sea. We want to use the two demonstration projects to identify which type of /floating platform is the best solution.\n\nPhotovoltaics: The University of Stuttgart has developed a laser process that enables the inexpensive production of non-toxic silicon solar cells with a high level of e/fficiency. We have been participating in this research project funded by the federal government since August 2017 and founded our subsidiary EnPV in December 2017 to prepare for the commercialization of the results. The EnPV team was strengthened in 2020 to help clarify\n\nimportant issues relating to individual steps of the patented process and create the conditions for a pilot production process on an industrial scale.\n\nGeothermal energy: In addition to the production of electricity, geothermal energy has the potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels in heating networks. We support our business partners, such as local authorities, in decarbonizing their heating networks using geothermal energy. A project in Bruchsal has now come to fruition: By the end of the 2019  /  2020 heating season, the Bruchsal geothermal power plant had supplied more heating to the nearby police station than planned. In August 2020, EnBW and MVV had their bid to carry out further explorations to the south of Mannheim accepted. We gained our experience in the provision of heating from geothermal energy through partnerships, in which we and our partners planned and constructed the geothermal power plants in Bruchsal (since 2012) and Soultz, France, (since 2016) and still operate them today.\n\nHydrogen from renewable energies: We also want to provide our customers with carbon neutral gaseous energy sources in the long term. The experience gained from various pilot and demonstration  projects  will  help  us  achieve  this.  This  also includes the alkaline hydrogen electrolysis plant with an electrical output of 1 MW in Wyhlen, which was built in 2018 by our subsidiary Energiedienst (ED) with funding from the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and is operated using electricity generated from hydropower. In 2019, ED had its bid to expand the plant by 5 MW accepted as part of the 'Reallabore' tender process from the German Federal Ministry for Economic A/ffairs and Energy (BMWi), with the aim of supplying a district, as well as industry and customers in the mobility sector, with hydrogen produced from green electricity. The concept for the project was fundamentally revised in 2020 so that it will be possible to continue operating the plant economically a/f\\_ter the project has /finished. A/f\\_ter receiving funding approval in December 2020, the project started in January 2021 with the largest power-to-gas plant in southern Germany at the time. We are thus acquiring the skills required to construct and operate other hydrogen generation plants in the future.\n\nHydrogen in the gas grid: The EnBW subsidiary Netze BW started a pilot project called the 'Hydrogen Island \u00d6hringen' in 2020 in the City of \u00d6hringen in the Hohenlohe district that is unique across Germany. A section of the existing natural gas grid will be disconnected and supplied independently. A natural gas mix with a hydrogen content of up to 30% will be used in the island grid. The hydrogen will be produced with the aid of an electrolyzer on the premises of Netze BW that uses electricity generated from renewable energy sources. This multi-year project aims to demonstrate that the existing natural gas infrastructure can already deliver a climate-friendly energy supply today and is an important component of the Energiewende.",

        "page_content": "Internal carbon pricing: Internal CO 2 pricing is an emerging method for reducing a company's own emissions. A corresponding model for EnBW has been under development since 2018 as part of a dissertation at the Sustainability Center Freiburg. Case studies  from  suitable  areas  of  the  company  are  being  used  to develop internal options for improving the carbon footprint that go above and beyond a consideration of just direct emissions. The leverage e/ffect of various measures for buildings, travel and other areas speci/fically tailored for EnBW will then be assessed.\n\nAugmented reality in renewable energy planning: Augmented reality can support the planning processes for wind and PV power plants on-site and improve acceptance for new projects. A team at EnBW has developed an app with the support of an international IT company that can create a photographically realistic representation on a mobile end device. The app can create  both  prede/fined  views  of  the  power  plants  for  the approval process also images from any freely selected perspective. It can thus be used to show how a power plant will be perceived within a private or public environment. A beta version was developed and tested in summer 2020 that can detect the horizon even in hilly regions. The process for handing over the so/f\\_tware to the planning teams in the branch o/ffices began in February 2021.\n\nE-mobility charging infrastructure for apartment buildings:\n\nAs a result of the reform of the German Apartment Building Modernization Act (WEMoG) at the end of 2020, it is now much easier for residents in apartment buildings to install charging infrastructure in shared underground garages. This and other statutory measures should contribute to the ramping up of electromobility, especially in apartment buildings. Netze BW is investigating what sort of grid connection will be required in a residential complex when in future 58 e-cars are being charged in a shared underground garage and what impact this will have on the electricity grid in the 'E-Mobility-Carr\u00e9' project in Tamm near Ludwigsburg. The project is being carried out in a modern residential complex under real grid operating conditions.\n\nE-mobility charging infrastructure in a rural setting: More and more people in rural regions will also start using electric cars in the future. This represents a major challenge for the electricity grid because the individual electricity circuits in these regions are signi/ficantly longer than in urban areas. The longer the power line, the more the voltage can vary. If a lot of electric cars are being charged on these electricity circuits in the future, it will exacerbate the problem. In order to /find out what impact electromobility will have on rural electricity grids in the next few years, Netze BW is carrying out a test under real conditions in Kusterdingen (T\u00fcbingen District) in the 'E-Mobility-Chaussee' project.\n\nSmart charging at home: The power required by electric vehicles, especially if they are being charged simultaneously, which happens above all in the evening, will place a high demand on the electricity grid. Using a load management system for the grid, it is possible to smooth out peak loads and thus reduce the burden on the electricity grid. Using the smart metering system in combination with a control box o/ffers great potential for developing a uniform solution for managing charging facilities.\n\nThis prospective management system is being developed in consecutive stages by Netze BW and tested in various locations under real conditions.\n\nInductive charging: An electric bus operated by EnBW will connect the EnBW site at the Port of Karlsruhe to the public transport system during the course of 2021. The special feature of this electric bus is that the batteries will be charged inductively during the journey. This charging technology involves inductive coils being embedded in the road surface. As soon as the vehicle drives over them, the receiver coils /fitted on the underbody are activated. Electrical energy is generated in the coils via a magnetic /field and is stored in the vehicle's battery. This enables the vehicle to cover long distances without the need to stop to recharge. The EnBW research project is thus testing inductive charging of the electric bus during everyday use. The Israeli start-up ElectReon is supplying the technology for the test route.\n\nSustainable extraction of lithium: In cooperation with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and other /firms and institutes from the world of science, we are investigating a process to sustainably extract lithium from thermal water as part of a research project. In December 2020, we received funding approval  for  the  four-year  project.  At  existing  geothermal plants - such as in Bruchsal - special adsorbents will be used to speci/fically extract lithium from the rest of the thermal water. A/f\\_ter successfully testing the process in the laboratory, the next challenge is to transfer the process to an operating geothermal plant.\n\n## Innovation management: Goals, guidelines and processes\n\nEnBW Innovation has been a /fixed component of EnBW since the middle of 2014 and is one of the leading corporate innovation labs in Germany. Together with employees, entrepreneurs, external partners and start-ups, we develop new business models in the strategic areas of connected home, digital utility, urban infrastructure and connected mobility. The innovation strategy focuses on two main approaches: the generation and scaling up of new business models and investments in external start-ups by EnBW New Ventures.\n\nAlongside the development of new business models and supporting early-stage teams during the incubation phase, EnBW Innovation also accompanies more mature projects with the Company Builder. In the reporting year, the focus was placed on professionalizing processes and scaling up existing projects. In order to e/fficiently support the teams and their growth, the Company Builder provides start-ups with additional skills in the form of controlling, sales and marketing experts. For our expertise in the scaling up of start-ups, we were presented with the Digital Lab Award for the third year in a row by the specialist jury from the business magazine Capital and the management consultancy /firm Infront in 2020. In addition, we have been supporting external teams on the journey from an innovation project through to a stable, value-generating company with start-up grants since 2020.",

We anticipate that the company will triple its sales in the next three years with this business model. LIV-T is the /first EnBW start-up that has also been successful internationally.\n\nBen Fleet Services was founded in January 2019 by EnBW Innovation and the company builder Bridgemaker based in Berlin. It acquired another investor in the latest round of /financing in the form of the globally active insurance group Baloise. It is thus the /first EnBW start-up with an external investor. EnBW still holds a majority stake in Ben Fleet Services. The company o/ffers /fleet managers and /fleet operators a comprehensive range of /flexibly bookable services for their /fleets. The special feature is that the range of services can be directly integrated into the customer's existing system via a digital interface to improve the operational readiness and availability of their vehicles. The range of services includes on-site cleaning, refueling and charging, maintenance, repair and the relocation of vehicles - for individual vehicles or entire vehicle groups, for e-cars, transport vehicles, buses and trains, bicycles and scooters. This start-up based in Berlin now has around 100 employees at eight sites across Germany and its customers include traditional corporate /fleets as well as leading providers of new mobility services. Ben Fleet Services plans to expand further in 2021 - also outside of Germany. The company will use the new capital to establish new sites in Germany and further develop the technology behind its service platform. It aims to secure its /first customers in other European countries in 2021.\n\n## Expenditure and personnel\n\nWe spent \u20ac70.6 million (previous year: \u20ac54.4 million) on research, development and innovation in the 2020 /financial year. The increase was primarily due to higher expenditure for the grids and the growth in innovation management. Sales in the area of innovation management increased to \u20ac13.4 million (previous year: \u20ac11.1 million). We received government research grants of \u20ac1.0 million (previous year: \u20ac0.9 million). There were 93 employees (previous year: 81) in the areas of research, development and innovation in 2020. 185 employees (previous year: 236 employees) were involved in research and development projects as part of their operational work. A further 248 employees (previous year: 130) were involved in innovation projects.\n\nEnBW New Ventures invests in start-ups that develop digital solutions for infrastructures. The aim is to use the total available investment volume of \u20ac100 million to secure minority shareholdings of between 10% and 30% in up to 20 start-ups, with an investment period of four to eight years in each case. EnBW  New  Ventures  plays  the  role  of  an  active  investor, supports the start-ups as a business coach or kind of 'sparring partner'  and  is  represented  on  their  boards.  The  start-ups receive access to professional investor expertise via EnBW New Ventures. In addition, commercial cooperation with the operating units at EnBW is also possible.\n\n## Innovation: Selected activities\n\nIn 2020, the spin-o/ff WTT CampusONE that was founded in 2017 was the /first EnBW start-up to generate positive earnings. The company based in Ludwigsburg provides learning platforms and tools for digital workplace training. The training covers themes such as energy, administration and legal requirements such  as  occupational  safety  and  data  protection.  Standard e-learning courses can be acquired individually via a license or as a /flat-rate service. Customized e-training courses are also o/ffered. As its second pillar, WTT CampusONE also o/ffers solutions for digital human resources development. The tools and modules can be assembled according to the customer's needs and are primarily used in the human resources sector. The combination of learning content and complementary tools o/ffered by WTT CampusONE is unique on the market. The team of around 40 employees is considered one of the leading specialist providers of digital training in Germany.\n\nLIV-T was founded in October 2017 by EnBW Innovation and the company builder mantro that is based in Munich. The company aims to optimize the ordering processes and supply chains for energy sources such as heating oil and pellets. Industrial and end customers have had to keep a close eye on their tank /fill levels themselves up to now. The LIV-T so/f\\_tware enables repeat orders to be initiated based on data. The so/f\\_tware updates stock levels in real time and can interact with tank users and provide recommendations for action. As a result, the 30-person team has become the European market leader in the area of tank /fill level management within three years. LIV-T is currently distributing its smart eco-system via 100 partner companies in seven\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its goal is to ensure the supply of materials and services at the best possible quality  /  cost ratio and thus strengthen the competitiveness of the company. We place great emphasis on the e/fficient design of our procurement processes for achieving cost-e/ffective purchasing results, as well as on sustainable procurement taking into account the requirements of national laws, EU law and the Group's internal guidelines. In order to manage the procurement processes, a system using various di/fferent performance indicators is used. It continually delivers a realistic picture of the current situation in purchasing and enables a comparison of the target and actual situation, as well as the prompt implementation of control measures.\n\nThe procurement volume of the EnBW Group in 2020 (without ITOs) (Glossary, from p. 138) amounted to around \u20ac3.2 billion (previous year: around \u20ac2.8 billion).\n\n## Procurement volumes of the EnBW Group by segment in % 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The figures do not add up to 100% due to rounding differences.\n\nA large number of suppliers and service providers play an important role in our e/fforts to achieve a leading position on the energy market. Supplier management promotes successful cooperation with our suppliers because it makes the performance of the suppliers transparent and also makes continuous optimization in partnership possible. The careful selection of our business partners is a part of our risk management system and supports the observance of legal regulations and internally de/fined quality standards. Especially with regard to the selective internationalization  of  the  business,  central  purchasing  at EnBW AG is also developing an integrated supply chain management system in close cooperation with the business and functional units.\n\nSustainable procurement begins with the careful selection of business partners. Central purchasing at EnBW AG uses a standardized prequali/fication process for this purpose. Suppliers are required to provide a self-assessment via our supplier portal on whether they have sustainable measures in place in the areas of environmental management, occupational health and safety, the respect for human rights, the /fight against corruption, data protection and quality management. This self-assessment was completed by almost 90% of our suppliers by the end of 2020 (measured by procurement volume).\n\n## Supplier management process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic had a signi/ficant impact worldwide on supply and demand along the supply chain in 2020. This resulted in some cases in legal and economic consequences that made having an e/ffective supplier management system crucial. As an energy company and operator of critical infrastructure we are acutely aware of the responsibility we have - not only during this crisis. In order to assess the impact the coronavirus pandemic will have in the future, we work with various, in some cases extreme, scenarios. Purchasing has used these to identify critical operating resources and any supply risks have been largely excluded due to our multiple supplier strategy and strategic stockpiling of the majority of these critical operating resources. We anticipate that any potential delays to supply will continue to have only a minor impact even in the future.\n\nRespecting human rights and protecting the environment are key pillars of our culture. In cooperation with our business partners, we aim to improve the situation with respect to sustainability across the entire supply chain. We are thus planning to make our procurement process more sustainable in the future - especially with respect to social and ecological aspects.

Nevertheless, hard coal will still play a fundamental role for EnBW as a source of energy over the next few years to ensure a reliable and economic supply of electricity. Coal deliveries to our power plants have fallen continuously over the last /five years from 4.24 million t of coal in 2016 to 1.80 million t in 2020 (previous year: 3.16 million t of coal). This sharp fall in comparison to 2019 is mainly due to the lower demand for electricity as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the mild winter weather in the /first quarter and the cheap price of  gas.  The  deliveries  represent  a  procurement  volume  of \u20ac79 million (previous year: \u20ac170 million).\n\n## Origin of coal supplies to EnBW power plants\n\nin million t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRussia was able to further strengthen its leading position on the generally declining market in Western Europe due to its geographical proximity to the shipping ports. Colombian coal does not play a role in Western Europe at the moment because Colombian mining companies have signi/ficantly reduced their production levels and have been able to secure higher prices for their coal in America, Asia and the Mediterranean region. Due to these general market developments, we sourced the majority of our coal from Russia and a small proportion from the USA.\n\nIt is important for us to know the origins of our coal. Some 83% of our coal requirements are thus covered by contracts for which the producers are already known when the contract is concluded. The remainder is sourced from contracts concluded with trade intermediaries which usually de/fine a quality standard but not the source of the coal. In addition, we maintain close contacts with other potential producers and traders to avoid any dependency on one single producer.\n\nThe Russian coal was sourced from the mining region of the Kuznetsk Basin (Kuzbass) and was primarily mined by the producers SUEK and Kuzbassrazrezugol (KRU). The American coal was sourced from underground mines in the Illinois Basin and the northern Appalachians by the producers Murray Energy and Consol Energy. We did not source any coal from Colombia or South Africa in 2020.\n\nof Conduct (SCoC) has been developed. It will be introduced in 2021 as a shared set of values and an important criterion for the selection and development of our suppliers. The aim is to integrate it into the procurement process for all goods and services in order to supplement the minimum requirements in the prequali/fication process with sustainability aspects. We will be able to identify and reduce social and ecological risks in this way.\n\nSwitching over to use recycled paper certi/fied with the Blue Angel environmental label for any paper that is required internally or for customers is part of the measure 'Paper reduction and recycling' in the EnBW sustainability program (p. 35 f.) . Central purchasing at EnBW AG made this switch in 2020.\n\nVarious automation and digitalization initiatives have been introduced in central purchasing at EnBW AG with the aim of simplifying our processes even further and, in particular, ensuring that any recurring procurement activities are carried out with the minimal amount of e/ffort. This will allow us to concentrate on valuable and future-oriented strategic growth themes in the Group, such as the expansion of renewable energies and broadband (Glossary, from p. 138) .\n\nOur subsidiaries that are not overseen by central purchasing at EnBW AG address non-/financial aspects in purchasing using their own mechanisms.\n\nEnergiedienst Holding (ED) works together closely with central purchasing at EnBW AG to procure important product groups using joint invitations to tender and framework contracts, as well as in the associated prequali/fication processes. In addition, orders are placed largely with regional suppliers from Germany, Switzerland or neighboring EU countries.\n\nPurchasing  at  the  companies  of Pra\u017esk\u00e1  energetika  (PRE) ensures that suppliers observe practices such as the payment of social security contributions, the settlement of tax liabilities and the prevention of money laundering. Potential suppliers must verify their compliance with these aspects by either submitting a sworn declaration or by presenting corresponding certi/ficates when bidding for invitations to tender. The ful/fillment of these obligations is also stipulated in supplier contracts.\n\nAt Stadtwerke D\u00fcsseldorf (SWD) , sustainability aspects are anchored in the compliance guidelines, environmental management system manuals and process descriptions. In the area of procurement, SWD pays particular attention to the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable products. It also uses clauses in its supplier contracts as a way to reinforce the /fight against corruption and bribery and to ensure observance of labor and social laws.\n\nThe fundamental principles for procurement at VNG are regulated by a code of conduct, the management handbook and Group guidelines. Aspects such as the prevention of corruption - which is embedded in the compliance management system - and environmental protection are /fixed components of procurement processes.\n\nWe also refer you to the details provided in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 103) .",

The opportunities and risks in relation to coal procurement can be found in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 103) .\n\n## Positioning, overarching concepts and due diligence for the protection of human rights\n\nIn accordance with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights of the United Nations, we strive to procure coal responsibly. The EnBW coal supplier portfolio acts as the basis for our activities and it is updated on an annual basis. The sustainability performance of current and potential coal suppliers to EnBW is examined and evaluated on the basis of the EnBW rules of conduct governing the responsible procurement of hard coal and other raw materials (www.enbw.com/verhaltenskodex) . We determine any future action based on the supplier evaluations, such as requesting further speci/fic information from selected suppliers. In addition, we pay close attention to the latest studies from competitors and international initiatives, as well as speci/fic information and contributions from civil society organizations.\n\nWe have been a member of the corporate initiative Bettercoal since July 2020 (www.bettercoal.org) . The independent audits carried out by Bettercoal also /flow into our process for auditing business partners. We are active in the Russian and Colombian working groups because the large coal producers come from these countries. In addition, we use Bettercoal as a platform for exchanging information with our producers and above all with other stakeholders from civil society, as well as with experts on individual countries and human rights.\n\nOur rules of conduct in combination with internal implementation guidelines act as the foundation for our business activities. In the sustainability clause that is part of all of our contracts with coal producers, we obligate our business partners to observe these rules of conduct. In addition to regular auditing of the sustainability performance of coal suppliers, a multistage auditing process will come into force in the event of suspected breaches of the rules, which can lead to the termination of the business relationship or exclusion from our procurement process. When new contracts are due to be concluded, the results of the analyses in the sustainability index are regularly presented to an internal committee for the responsible procurement of hard coal and other raw materials (AVB) with participation from all relevant specialist areas. If any deviations from the minimum standards are identi/fied for existing supply contracts, corrective measures are initially developed in cooperation with the producers and their implementation is monitored. In 2020, this committee held several meetings to discuss, in particular, the sustainability performance of the Russian coal producers, as well as current issues related to the import of raw materials.\n\n## Current developments\n\nWe have used extended measures to focus particularly on the coal producers from Russia in the reporting year.\n\n## Russia\n\nDue to the continuous increase in coal imports from Russia, we have also intensi/fied our e/fforts to ful/fill our human rights responsibilities with respect to the Russian coal suppliers. In the process, we are able to call on our experience from and the approaches we took in our engagement in Colombia.\n\nIt was necessary to cancel the planned trip to our main coal producer KRU in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, we held video and telephone conferences to discuss our requirements for occupational safety and compliance and, in particular, environmental protection, resettlement and compensation issues.\n\nTo check the local working and living conditions, we asked our coal producers to provide concrete proof of important occupational health and safety guidelines and adherence to them. This information was provided to us and personally discussed in detail. Furthermore, we have now received detailed sustainability reports from our producers SUEK and KRU for the /first time that include transparent information on their sustainability activities.\n\nWe received further information on the situation in Kuzbass via Bettercoal and have been able to determine potential for improving the local situation and for improvements that could be made by the operators of the mines. This information will be used as the basis for discussions with our producers to improve their sustainability performance. In addition, we held discussions with other stakeholders in Russia on the situation in the coal mining regions.\n\n## Colombia\n\nWe did not source any coal from Colombia in 2020. Nevertheless, we remained in contact with the main producers and kept ourselves informed about the local situation in the mines, especially in light of the more di/fficult conditions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Although we have not sourced any coal from the producer Cerrej\u00f3n in Colombia for a few years, we have obtained further information on the current conditions for workers in the mines and on the miners' strike directly from Cerrej\u00f3n in relation to the stakeholder inquiries in order to gain a better picture of the local situation and the controversial positions. In addition, we have presented both the producers and the unions with our minimum requirements for responsible coal procurement. On the one hand, our minimum requirements are a /fixed component of our contracts with producers in the form of a sustainability clause, while on the other hand, we have also personally discussed them with representatives of the unions on earlier trips to Colombia.",

        "page_content": "business partners using a clearly de/fined process. We already carried out the /first business partner audits of our gas producers in 2020. This includes an audit with respect to both compliance  and  sustainability.  The  main  focus  is  placed  on the observance of international sustainability standards, compliance  with  guidelines  on  environmental  protection  and human rights, dialog with stakeholders and disclosure of the extraction methods. In the future, we will also reevaluate existing suppliers from a sustainability perspective every one to three years, depending on a risk assessment, as part of our recurring audits, insofar as there are no reasons to carry out an audit sooner.\n\n## Methane emissions\n\nThe  monitoring  of  methane  emissions  from  natural  gas  is becoming increasingly important due to the growing procurement volumes.  It is very di/fficult to collect exact data on methane emissions particularly in the upstream gas supply chain due to the di/fferent calculation models used. We are currently working with a general emissions factor of 29 g CO 2 eq  /  kWh  natural gas for the upstream supply chain for our gas procurement. This /figure includes the methane emissions. For the combustion of the gas, we use an emissions factor (including methane) of 201 g CO 2 eq  /  kWh natural gas based on data from the German Environment Agency (UBA) and the German Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt). Despite these low amounts, we are continuously working to further reduce methane emissions with the aim of achieving a climate-neutral gas supply in the future. This includes measures for smart grid management to avoid blowouts, systematic integrity evaluations of the grid, eliminating any weaknesses and the continuous modernization of grid technology, as well as the application of special technical equipment and systems to avoid methane emissions from our lines during maintenance and repair work.\n\n## Responsible raw materials procurement in the gas sector\n\n## Natural gas as a transition technology\n\nIn order to achieve our climate neutrality target 2035, we are working intensively on switching over our power plants initially from coal to more climate-friendly gas (fuel switch) and then to climate-neutral gas such as biogas or hydrogen in the long term. Natural gas plays an important role as a transition technology either in the form of lique/fied natural gas (LNG) or grid-based natural gas. Therefore, we are now gradually expanding our measures for the responsible procurement of raw materials to also include the procurement of natural gas.\n\n## Origin and own consumption\n\nEnBW sources most of its natural gas via supply contracts with Equinor from Norway, Novatek and Gazprom from Russia, and the European wholesale market.\n\nIn 2020, we acquired 9,660 MWh of natural gas for our own consumption at EnBW. We use this gas for generating electricity and heat in our power plants, for heating our buildings and for operating our gas plants.\n\nThe opportunities and risks in relation to gas procurement can be found in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 103) .\n\n## Due diligence\n\nWe are increasingly ful/filling our responsibility as a company also in the procurement of gas and exercising human rights due diligence in our supply chain. In future, we will examine all new",

All of the economies relevant to us experienced a sharp drop in economic performance. This was accompanied by political uncertainties, for example, due to the United Kingdom exiting the European Union.\n\n## Development of gross domestic product (GDP)\n\n| in %           |   2021 |   2020 |   2019   1 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| World          |    5.5 |   -3.5 |        2.8 |\n| Eurozone       |    4.2 |   -7.2 |        1.3 |\n| Germany        |    3.5 |   -5.4 |        0.6 |\n| France         |    5.5 |   -9   |        1.5 |\n| Sweden         |    3.5 |   -4.7 |        1.3 |\n| Switzerland    |    3.6 |   -5.3 |        1.2 |\n| Czech Republic |    5.1 |   -6.5 |        2.3 |\n| Turkey         |    5   |   -5   |        0.9 |\n\n- 1 The figures for the previous year have been restated.\n\nAs the further development of the coronavirus pandemic remains unpredictable, any statements relating to the economic trends in 2021 are subject to considerable uncertainty. In general, economic activity is expected to recover strongly in reaction to the economic downturn in 2020. However, economic performance will at best reach levels seen in 2019. The macroeconomic trends are not expected on balance to have either a particularly positive or negative in/fluence on our business performance in 2021.\n\n## Development of interest rates\n\nThe central banks have helped to counteract the e/ffects of the coronavirus pandemic with their very expansive monetary policies. In the /first quarter of 2020, the yields in the EU periphery countries initially rose, although the recovery package made available  by  the  EU  led  to  falling  interest  rates  during  the remainder of the year. German government bonds traded at negative yields and the high demand for good credit ratings led to a further fall in yields from ten-year bonds during the year.\n\nThe discount rates applied to company pension provisions and nuclear provisions fell slightly again in 2020 so that the present value of the pension obligations of EnBW, in particular, rose due to interest rate-driven reasons. The consensus forecast for the ECB interest rate on the main re/financing operations remained unchanged at 0.00%.\n\n## Development of the sector and competitive situation\n\n## Selection of international, national, regional and new competitors\n\n\u00bb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\n\n\u00bb",

        "page_content": "In particular, the revision of the Emissions Trading Directive and E/ffort Sharing Regulation are of central importance for our company. Many di/fferent options for their reform, including the expansion of the emissions trading system to encompass the transport and heating sector, are currently being discussed. In addition, there are plans to reform the Renewable Energy Directive and the Energy E/fficiency Directive. Preparations have also been made for revision of the /financing instruments and capital market guidelines as well as measures for the decarbonization of the gas and transport sector.\n\nWe welcome the Green Deal agenda and the tightening of the European 2030 climate target to at least -55%. It is anticipated that the associated amendments to the regulations will support our own transformation agenda. We are advocating, in particular, an ambitious redesign of the emissions trading system: Clear price signals and the establishment of a minimum price for CO 2 emissions will make it easier to integrate renewable energies into the market and safeguard investment.\n\n## Coal phase-out\n\nA/f\\_ter the Coal Commission presented its /final report in January 2019, the Coal Phase-out Act was passed in July 2020. It envisages - in accordance with the recommendations made by the Coal Commission - an end to coal-/fired power generation in Germany by 2038 at the latest. German brown and hard coal capacities in the energy industry should also be reduced to 15  GW each by 2022 (the total capacity of both is currently around 42 GW). A further reduction in the total capacity to 17 GW will then be required by 2030. The law includes the negotiated decommissioning of brown coal power plants and compensation for their operators, as well as compensation in the form of auctions for operators of hard coal power plants. Participation in the auctions will be made more di/fficult for operators of power plants in southern Germany due to an additional factor concerning the grids because these plants are considered to be important for supporting the grids. In general, there will be no compensation for the decommissioning of power plants a/f\\_ter 2030 (except in cases of possible hardship). Power plants that are not decommissioned via an auction can be forced to shut down as a part of 'statutory reductions.' In addition, incentives will be created for power plant operators to switch over their power plant sites to climate-friendly fuels (fuel switch).\n\n## Sales segment\n\n## Electricity and gas prices for retail and industrial customers\n\nAccording to an analysis of electricity prices by the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) published in January 2021, the average monthly electricity bill for a household with an annual consumption of 3,500 kWh in 2020 came to \u20ac92.78 compared to \u20ac88.84 in the previous year. Taxes and levies  account  for  more  than  half  of  this  amount.  EnBW increased the price for the basic supply of electricity by around \u20ac97 per year on 1 April 2020. This was due to an increase in costs both for the procurement of electricity and also for cost allocations  and  network  user  charges.  For  industrial  customers\n\nThe energy sector is currently experiencing a period of great upheaval. There is particular pressure for change due to the Energiewende. However, digitalization, sector coupling (Glossary, from p. 138) and the desire of local authorities to become self-su/fficient are also having a strong in/fluence on the sector.\n\nA signi/ficant factor is that the energy sector is highly regulated, which means that political policies strongly in/fluence developments in the sector. Traditional energy supply companies need to re-examine their competitiveness in individual business areas, exploit the potential o/ffered by a changed market environment and align their strategies for the future.\n\n## Cross-segment framework conditions\n\n## Climate protection\n\nAlthough the coronavirus pandemic has clearly dominated the political agenda in the last few months, the issue of climate protection has continued to receive a lot of attention. In part, the emergency aid programs and stimulus measures to combat the threat of an economic crisis were linked at a European and national level with the goal of supporting investment in the green transformation of the economy and of accelerating structural change. Due to the signi/ficantly more ambitious targets at a European level in the EU Green Deal (Glossary, from p. 138) , there has been increasing pressure at a national level to accelerate the expansion of renewable energies, the transport transition and the heating transition in the building sector and introduce new measures and instruments. Although the national climate protection targets for 2020 were narrowly achieved due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there is already a signi/ficant gap that must be bridged to achieve the current emissions reduction target of -55% by 2030. EnBW is campaigning for a signi/ficant acceleration in the expansion of renewable energies and for the elimination of existing hurdles within the approval processes and those that restrict the availability of sites. Without sweeping changes to the legal framework, the aim of increasing the share of gross energy consumption accounted for by renewable energies to 65% by 2030 will not be achievable. To improve the market perspectives for renewable energies in all sectors, we are continuing to advocate the introduction of a minimum CO 2 price across all sectors and a climate-based reform of the tax, duty and levy systems so that climate-friendly electricity applications become more competitive against fossil fuels.\n\n## EU Green Deal\n\nThe EU Green Deal (Glossary from p. 138) presented by the EU Commission together with the stricter emissions reduction target of at least -55% by 2030 and the target of climate neutrality across the continent by 2050 both stipulated in the accompanying climate law has received broad support from the majority of the European Council. It is thus probable that the climate law will be passed by the end of 2021 and the associated directives and regulations will be amended and tightened accordingly next year.",

Electricity consumption in Germany fell by around 3.6% in 2020. Due to the sharp increase in the number of people working from home and the fact that people have spent more time at home, it is likely that electricity consumption in private households has increased. In contrast, we believe that there will have been a decrease in the electricity consumption of commercial customers because the retail trade has been shut down for many weeks. Due to our focus on retail customers in our electricity sales, we are only impacted to a limited extent by the falling sales volumes to business and industrial customers. We automatically passed on the reduction in VAT of three percentage points - which was designed to stimulate the economy - in full to our customers. The dra/f\\_t law for fair consumer contracts that was already presented in 2019 is in the process of being approved. The aim of this law is to protect consumers against excessively long contractual terms.\n\nDue to limitations on mobility in the early part of the year because of the coronavirus pandemic, there was a temporary fall in the number of charging processes at public charging points. However, the demand for electric vehicles increased signi/ficantly over the course of the year. This was primarily due to government incentives and the CO 2 limits imposed on the /fleets of cars that are produced by car manufacturers. Demand was also supported by measures in the recovery package for purchasing electric vehicles and expanding the charging infrastructure. We anticipate that this will gradually result in greater utilization of the charging infrastructure (Glossary, from p. 138) .\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has increased awareness for the fact that the Internet provides an 'insurance function' for the economy and social life. Acceptance for digitalization and its application has been boosted considerably as a result. In everyday working life, the huge number of people working from home has led to a sharp increase in video conferencing. Data transmission volumes have increased rapidly as a result. In order to be able to handle this increasing demand in Germany, the\n\nfurther expansion  of  the  'last  mile'  of  the  broadband network ( Glossary, from p. 138) is essential. In September 2020, the German government reached an agreement with the EU Commission to allow state aid for so-called 'gray spots' that already have bandwidths of at least 30 Mbit  /  s but do not yet have  gigabit  connectivity.  Together  with  our  subsidiaries NetCom BW and Plusnet, we cover the entire value added chain in the broadband sector and will bene/fit from this accelerated expansion (p. 78) .\n\nOn 17 December 2020, the dra/f\\_t version of the German Renewable Energies Act (EEG) 2021 was passed by the German Bundestag. In this context, improvements to the framework conditions for the operation of storage systems and own consumption models are important for the success of the Energiewende. The proposals in the Winter Package from the EU will signi/ficantly improve the economic framework conditions for so-called 'prosumers.' This is important to support the engagement and investments of customers who have already invested in technologies for the Energiewende or those who plan to do so. We are actively involved in the discussion about the design of these framework conditions.\n\nAlongside the reform of the EEG, we are also following the consultation process for the design of an ordinance for load management of the low-voltage grid in accordance with section 14 a Energy Industry Act (EnWG). However, the initial dra/f\\_t version of the Controllable Consumption Devices Act (SteuVerG) that was published on 22 December 2020 was subsequently withdrawn again on 17 January 2021 by the Federal Ministry for Economic A/ffairs and Energy. We fundamentally welcome more speci/fic rules on the implementation of section 14 a EnWG. The utilization of /flexible consumption devices, such as electric vehicles or heat pumps, and their smooth integration into the distribution grid will make it easier for market participants to deal with the challenges posed by the transport and heating transitions. However, there are still considerable shortcomings in the proposal that is currently being discussed, such as making the proposed model suitable for the mass market. EnBW is closely following this process.",

The TSOs TransnetBW, Amprion and TenneT have de/fined the capacity they each require and issued invitations to tender to construct suitable power plants within their controlled zones to cover this capacity. TransnetBW has issued an invitation to tender for a capacity of 300 MW for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. For this invitation to tender, EnBW AG had its bid proposing the power plant site in Marbach am Neckar accepted. The groundbreaking ceremony on 12 October 2020 marked the o/fficial start of the construction process.\n\nA major /field of activity for our grid subsidiaries is digitalization. They are engaged in a number of di/fferent projects, from the digitalization  of  internal  work  processes  and  new  exchange platforms connecting operators of the transmission and distribution grids through to the digitalization of customer and supplier interfaces.  In  the  DA  /  RE  (DAta  exchange  /  REdispatch)   project,  for example, TransnetBW and Netze BW are developing a digital platform solution for the deployment of decentralized power plants at a distribution grid level to stabilize the grids. To ensure we are prepared for the challenges associated with the Energiewende, we are continuing to improve the transparency and automation of the medium and low-voltage grids. This includes the introduction of smart metering systems that was started in 2020.\n\n## Renewable Energies segment\n\n## Germany\n\nThe proportion of total German electricity generation ac counted for by renewable energies increased signi/ficantly to 52% in 2020, which was mainly due to favorable weather conditions and, to a lesser extent, a fall in demand due to economic conditions. This corresponds to an increase of six percentage points compared to 2019.\n\nIn 2020, the increase in installed output of renewable energies in Germany was lower than expected, which was primarily attributable to complex approval processes. Around 4 GW of output  from  new  photovoltaic  plants  and  1  GW  from  new onshore wind farms was placed into operation. In the /first half of 2020, a great deal of interest was shown by project developers in the auctions held for photovoltaics, while the auctions held for onshore wind power were once again clearly undersubscribed, despite a slight upwards trend in the number of bids in the second half of 2020.\n\n## Grids segment\n\nIn January 2020, the four German transmission system operators presented the dra/f\\_t framework scenario for the Network Development Plan Electricity (Glossary, from p. 138) for the period up to 2035. All variants anticipate an increase in electricity consumption. The dra/f\\_t takes into account the phasing out of nuclear power by the end of 2022 and the planned phase-out of coal-/fired power generation by 2038 at the latest.\n\nThe consultation process for the Network Development Plan Gas (Glossary, from p. 138) 2020 to 2030 was held in May 2020 on the basis of the already published dra/f\\_t proposals. The transmission system operators published their dra/f\\_t later than in previous years on 1 July. Hydrogen and the required transmission infrastructure have been taken into account as a central component of the German decarbonization strategy. The schedule for the evaluation of the request for changes by the Federal Network Agency has not yet been de/fined. However, it is expected that the evaluation will be carried out during the /first quarter.\n\nApproval for the construction of a direct current substation (HVDC  converter)  at  the  site  of  the  nuclear  power  plant  in Philippsburg,  which  is  currently  being  dismantled,  for  the 340 km direct current transmission line between Osterath in North Rhine-Westphalia and Philippsburg that will be realized by our transmission system operator (TSO) TransnetBW together with  Amprion  in  the ULTRANET project  was  received  on 26 March 2020. The ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone was held on 16 September 2020. Construction work on ULTRANET is due to be completed by 2024. In parallel, the two transmission system operators TenneT and TransnetBW are also realizing the SuedLink project. It comprises two DC transmission lines more than 600 km long from Schleswig-Holstein to Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The Federal Network Agency opened the planning approval process for the /first northern sections in February 2020. In the second half of the year, TransnetBW also submitted an application to the Federal Network Agency to open the planning approval process for some southern sections, such as in Lower Franconia. Progress is thus being made in a project that is key to the success of the Energiewende.\n\nHowever,  the  expansion  of  the  grids  is  not  progressing  as quickly as planned. It is therefore foreseeable that additional reserve capacity to support the stability of the grid will be required a/f\\_ter the last nuclear power plants have been shut\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nThe figures for the previous year have been restated.\n\n- 2 Correction to the value for hydropower from 4.80 GW to 5.50 GW by EnBW.

        "page_content": "As part of the 'mini EEG reform' passed in the summer of 2020, the 52 GW ceiling for the funding of photovoltaic power plants with an output of less than 750 kW was removed so that power plants that are placed into operation a/f\\_ter this ceiling has been reached can still receive funding in accordance with the EEG. For onshore wind power, a /flexibility clause for the minimum distance rule of 1,000 m was introduced so that individual states could deviate from this rule. The privileges for community energy cooperatives have been removed so that they no longer have a right to participate in auctions without approval in accordance with the Federal Immission Control Act.\n\nIn November 2020, the German Bundestag passed the O/ffshore Wind Energy Act, which increases the target for o/ffshore wind capacity from 15 GW to 20 GW for 2030 and sets a target of 40 GW for 2040.\n\nThe EEG reform 2021 was passed at the end of 2020. It includes the target of achieving climate neutrality in Germany by 2050. In addition, the annual tender volumes for renewable energies have been increased so that the 65% target for 2030 can be achieved.\n\n## France\n\nWe entered the French market for renewable energies with the acquisition of Valeco in 2019. We expect dynamic growth in renewable energies in France, both in the wind power and photovoltaic sectors. The auction-based invitations to tender that are mainly used in France will guarantee continued and reliable support for renewable energies.\n\n## Sweden\n\nSweden o/ffers very favorable conditions and a competitive environment for renewable energies. In particular, onshore wind energy will play an increasingly important role on the Swedish generation market in the next few years. Since our entry onto the market in 2018, we have consistently expanded our wind power portfolio.\n\n## Turkey\n\nThe current funding mechanism for renewable energies in Turkey is valid until the middle of 2021. The design of the new funding mechanism is still being de/fined. We still believe that the Turkish market is an attractive proposition for the future, although we are monitoring the current political and economic developments in Turkey very closely.\n\n## Generation and Trading segment\n\n## Electricity wholesale market\n\nThe average spot market price (Glossary, from p. 138) in 2020 was around \u20ac15  /  MWh below the level in the previous year. The average price on the forward market (Glossary, from p. 138) was also signi/ficantly below the average price in the previous year. The fall in prices was primarily attributable to the low demand for electricity because of the restrictions placed on public life\n\ndue to the coronavirus pandemic, high feed-ins from renewable energy sources and the signi/ficant drop in gas and coal prices.\n\nCurrent prices on the forward market for the German market in 2022  /  2023 indicate that prices will increase. This re/flects, above all, similar trends on the markets for coal, gas and CO 2 allowances (Glossary, from p. 138) where prices are also increasing. An important lever will also be the future development of energy and climate policies both at home and abroad.\n\n## Development of prices for electricity (EPEX), base load product\n\n| in  \u20ac  /  MWh            |   Average 2020 |   Average 2019 |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Spot                     |          30.47 |          37.67 |\n| Rolling front year price |          40.2  |          47.79 |\n\n## Gas market\n\nThe spot market price (Glossary, from p. 138) fell signi/ficantly until the middle of 2020 but recovered from August and is currently higher than at the beginning of 2020. The prices for deliveries in 2021 fell until the middle of March 2020, experienced sideways movement a/f\\_ter that and began to rise slightly from September onwards. On the one hand, the global supply of lique/fied natural gas (LNG) increased due to new production facilities in the USA and Australia, which led to a noticeable increase in LNG deliveries to northwest Europe, while on the other  hand,  above-average  temperatures  in  large  parts  of Europe and Asia led to a much lower demand for heating. This e/ffect was ampli/fied by the extensive lockdowns in Europe.\n\nMost market participants are once again expecting high levels of LNG deliveries to Europe in winter 2020  /  2021. In combination with the very well-stocked gas storage facilities in Europe, this means that many market participants do not expect any excessive increases in prices.\n\n## Development of prices for natural gas on the TTF (Dutch wholesale market)\n\n| in  \u20ac  /  MWh   |   Average 2020 | Average 2019                   |\n|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Spot            |           9.41 | 13.51                          |\n|                 |          13.49 | Rolling front year price 18.19 |\n\n## Oil market\n\nThe price of Brent oil stood at US$66  /  bbl at the beginning of the year. Following the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the front month price initially dropped to US$48  /  bbl by the beginning of March 2020. An attempt to cut production by the OPEC+ group failed. Instead, an increase in oil production and the spread of the coronavirus led to a historically unprecedented collapse in global demand for oil. The Brent prices fell to US$16  /  bbl on 22 April 2020.

        "page_content": "## CO 2 allowances\n\nThe coronavirus crisis had its biggest impact on the development of prices for CO 2 allowances (Glossary,  from  p.  138) in March 2020. It led to a considerable fall in emissions due to the reduction in industrial production, lower electricity consumption and the almost complete cessation of air travel. Another reason for the fall in emissions was the signi/ficantly lower fuel switch costs due to the low price for gas. These prices were actually negative in summer 2020 - even when the price of CO 2 allowances is zero, the generation costs at gas power plants are still lower than those at coal power plants. As the coronavirus pandemic is overcome and the economy starts to recover, it is anticipated that there will again be a huge undersupply of EUA certi/ficates (Glossary, from p. 138) from 2021. It is likely that the reduction in supply imposed by the market stability reserve (MSR) and the ambitious targets for the reduction in emissions introduced by the EU Commission will also support an increase in prices. It is thus expected that prices will increase as a result.\n\n## Development of prices for emission allowances  /  daily quotes\n\n| in  \u20ac  /  t  CO 2              |   Average 2020 |   Average 2019 |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| EUA - rolling front year price |          24.46 |          24.88 |\n| CER - rolling front year price |           0.26 |           0.21 |\n\n## Nuclear power\n\nThe coalition agreement of the German government sets out the framework for current nuclear power policy: The main targets are the retention of specialist personnel and expertise, quick progress in the search for a /final storage site for highly radioactive waste (by 2031) and the rapid commissioning of the /final storage site for low- and medium-level radioactive waste (2027 according to the current plans).\n\nThe authorization to operate the Philippsburg nuclear power plant for the purpose of generating power expired on 31 December 2019. On 14 May 2020, we successfully and safely completed the demolition of the two cooling towers at the site. The waste storage facilities that were newly constructed on the power plant site were placed into operation on 14 April 2020 and handed over to the state-owned company responsible for the intermediate storage. On 11 December 2020, we also received approval from the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Ministry for the Environment for the commissioning of the newly constructed residual material processing center at the site in Philippsburg. The processing of material from the dismantling of the two nuclear power plants at the site can now begin.\n\nOn 28 September 2020, the federal company for radioactive waste disposal (BGE) published its report on 90 areas in Germany that have favorable geological conditions for the construction of a /final storage site for nuclear waste. The aim is to select a site by 2031 and to start storing the containers holding the radioactive waste underground by 2050.\n\ndemand  for  oil.  Front  month  prices  experienced  sideways movement as a result. There were serious concerns about the demand for oil at the end of October 2020 due to the sharp increase in the number of people infected with the coronavirus in the USA and Europe. This caused oil prices to collapse once again. It was only a/f\\_ter Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled that they were willing to adapt oil production by the OPEC+ group to the new framework conditions that oil prices began to stabilize.\n\nForward market prices are re/flecting the expectation that prices will increase slightly. Cuts in production by the OPEC+ group and other countries as well as a recovery in the global demand for oil are anticipated.\n\n## Development of prices on the oil markets\n\n| in  US$  /  bbl                                              |   Average 2020 |   Average 2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Crude oil (Brent) front month   (daily quotes)               |          43.21 |          64.16 |\n| Crude oil (Brent), rolling front   year price (daily quotes) |          45.88 |          61.31 |\n\n## Coal market\n\nThe front year price for coal fell sharply until the end of April 2020. This was mainly attributable to the extremely limited demand for coal in Europe due to low gas prices (displacement of coal-/fired generation with gas-/fired generation) and the negative e/ffects of the coronavirus crisis on global demand. There was a period of stabilization from the end of April until the beginning of June when the collapse of the only railway bridge to the Russian coal export port of Murmansk and rising gas prices resulted in an increase in prices. The front year price for coal experienced sideways movement in the second half of 2020. The increasing restrictions on imports to China, the negative e/ffect on demand due to the coronavirus pandemic and European gas prices remained deciding factors. Production losses in Colombia also played a role on the supply side.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, European natural gas prices and demand from China - which is by far largest consumer of coal in the world - will have a decisive in/fluence on European coal prices. European natural gas prices are signi/ficant because of the competition between both fuels in the area of electricity generation.\n\n## Development of prices on the coal markets\n\n| in  US$  /  t                          |   Average 2020 |   Average 2019 |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Coal - API #2 rolling front year price |          57.98 |          69.54 |\n| Coal - API #2 spot market price        |          50.4  |          60.75 |",

Due to a change in the classi/fication  of  business  activities,  there  was  a  shi/f\\_t  between  the Generation and Trading and Sales segments. The /figures for the previous year have been restated accordingly.\n\nSales: In the 2020 /financial year, revenue in the Sales segment increased in comparison to the previous year. Adjusted for the e/ffects of the changes in the consolidated companies, external revenue fell slightly by 0.4% or \u20ac43.5 million and almost reached the same level as in the previous year. This was primarily due to a slight fall in electricity sales.\n\nGrids: Revenue in the Grids segment in the reporting year was slightly higher than the /figure in the previous year, which was mainly  due  to  higher  revenue  from  the  use  of  the  grids. Adjusted for some small e/ffects of the changes in the consolidated  companies,  external  revenue  increased  by  5.2%  or \u20ac180.6 million in comparison to the previous year.\n\nRenewable Energies: In the Renewable Energies segment, revenue increased signi/ficantly in the 2020 /financial year in comparison to the previous year. Adjusted for the e/ffects of the changes in the consolidated companies, which involved the /first full-year contributions of Valeco and our EnBW Hohe See o/ffshore wind farm and the commissioning of EnBW Albatros in 2020, there would have been an increase of 9.4% or \u20ac89.9 million. This increase was mainly attributable to the fact that the electricity delivered from our hydropower plants was sold on the forward market at higher wholesale market prices than in the previous year. In addition, there was an increase in revenue due to higher generation from our onshore wind farms as a result of the weather.\n\nGeneration and Trading: Revenue in the Generation and Trading segment fell in the reporting period in comparison to the previous year, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in electricity trading activities. Adjusted for the e/ffects of the changes in the consolidated companies, there would have been a fall of 15.9% or \u20ac951.3 million.\n\n## Material developments in the income statement\n\nThe fall in the cost of materials was mainly due to lower electricity and gas procurement expenses.  Electricity procurement expenses were largely in/fluenced by a decrease in trading activities  with  a  corresponding  fall  in  revenue.  Alongside  wage\n\nincreases as part of the collective bargaining agreement, the rise in personnel expenses was mostly due to an increase in the number of employees in the growth areas of Grids, Renewable Energies and Sales. The balance from other operating income and other operating expenses in the reporting period fell from \u20ac251.1  million in the previous year to \u20ac-680.7 million in the reporting year. This decrease was largely the result of valuation e/ffects from derivatives (Glossary, from p. 138) and a lower balance of income and expenses from CO 2 allowances. The fall in the investment result was primarily attributable to the loss of the positive e/ffect of the revaluation of the shares in EnBW Hohe See in the previous year, which was due to the change in the consolidation method. A write-up of the joint venture in Turkey and the revaluation of the shares in EnBW Albatros had a positive e/ffect in the 2020 /financial year. The /financial result fell to \u20ac-307.0 million in the reporting year (previous year: \u20ac-95.8 million), which was mainly due to the loss of the positive market valuation of securities in the previous year. This was o/ffset to some extent by lower interest expenses as a result of the drop in the discount rates applied to pension and nuclear provisions. Overall, earnings before tax (EBT) stood at \u20ac1,002.6 million in the 2020 /financial year, compared to \u20ac902.2 million in the previous year.

This positive earnings performance was within the forecasted range for  the  2020  /financial  year.  All  segments  achieved  a  result within  their  forecasted  range  for  2020.  The  shares  of  the adjusted EBITDA accounted for by the segments were all within the forecasted ranges.\n\nSales: The adjusted EBITDA in the Sales segment increased in the 2020 /financial year in comparison to the previous year by 2.8% and was thus within the originally forecasted range. The adjusted  forecast  from  the  third  quarter  (\u20ac275  million  to \u20ac325 million) was exceeded. Plusnet, which was acquired in 2019, has been contributing to earnings since the beginning of the third quarter 2019. Adjusted for the e/ffects of changes in the consolidated companies, earnings for the segment fell by 7.4%. The main reasons for this change in earnings were lower sales volumes in the B2B sector at companies EnBW holds a share in due to the coronavirus pandemic and the selling o/ff of already purchased volumes. In contrast, adjustments to energy industry provisions resulted in higher out-of-period earnings.\n\nGrids: In the Grids segment, the adjusted EBITDA in the 2020 /financial year almost reached the same level as in the previous year (-0.6%). Adjusted for the e/ffects of the changes in the consolidated companies, earnings in the segment were also at about the same level as in the previous year (-0.6%). This was attributable to the fact that a volume-related drop in earnings from the distribution grids was almost fully compensated for by higher  revenue  from  the  use  of  the  electricity  and  gas\n\ntransmission grids, above all because of the increased investment necessary to ensure the security and reliability of supply of the grids. Earnings for the segment were moderately negatively impacted by the e/ffects of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\n\nRenewable Energies: The adjusted EBITDA in the Renewable Energies segment for the 2020 /financial year clearly exceeded the level in the previous year by 67.4%. Adjusted for the e/ffects of the changes in the consolidated companies, which mainly involved the EnBW Hohe See and EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farms and the acquisition of Valeco, the increase was 6.0%. The EnBW Hohe See and EnBW Albatros wind farms have been contributing to earnings since they were commissioned at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019 and in the /first quarter of 2020, respectively. Valeco has been contributing to earnings since the third quarter of 2019. In addition, better wind conditions at our onshore wind farms in comparison to the previous year contributed to a positive earnings performance. Furthermore, the electricity delivered from our hydropower plants was sold on the forward market at higher wholesale market prices than in the previous year. The coronavirus pandemic did not have any negative impact on earnings in 2020.\n\nGeneration and Trading segment: In the Generation and Trading segment, the adjusted EBITDA increased in the 2020 /financial year by 3.7% in comparison to the previous year. Adjusted for the e/ffects of changes in the consolidated companies, the increase was 3.5%. We sold our electricity deliveries at higher wholesale market prices in comparison to the previous year. In addition, earnings contributions from trading activities had a positive e/ffect due to growing volatility on the wholesale markets. It was thus possible to compensate for the loss of the earnings contribution from Block 2 of the Philippsburg nuclear power plant as a result of the power plant being decommissioned. The coronavirus pandemic did not have any negative impact on earnings in 2020.\n\nAs already mentioned in the Integrated Annual Report 2019, there was an adjustment to the management concept in connection with the reorganization of the SAP system at the beginning  of  2020.  This  has  resulted  in  a  shi/f\\_t  between  Other  / Consolidation and the segments.",

In 2020, the other non-operating result was around the same level as in the previous year. In the reporting  year,  this  item  contained  extraordinary  negative e/ffects related to VAT, while the value for the previous year was\n\nmainly in/fluenced by risk provisions for a possible obligation to pay EEG cost allocations (Glossary, from p. 138) for the company's own energy deliveries within the EnBW Group. The result for the previous year also included valuation e/ffects related to the valuation of our gas storage facilities.

The main reason for the impairment of the gas grid was an amendment to the network user charge notice, while the evaluation of the fair value of the o/ffshore wind farm was impacted by the fact that it will have fewer and fewer operating years with EEG funding in the future due to its advancing age. In 2019, impairment losses on power plants were mainly due to the quicker phase-out pathway for hard  coal.  Depreciation  decreased  despite  high  investment activities in relation to the decommissioning of the Philippsburg nuclear power plant at the end of 2019. A write-up of the joint venture in Turkey due to the commissioning of two wind farms had a positive e/ffect on the non-operating investment result. In addition, the shares in EnBW Albatros were revaluated due to a change in the consolidation method. The high /figure in\n\nthe previous year was mainly attributable to the revaluation of the shares in EnBW Hohe See. The decrease in the /financial result in comparison to the previous year was mainly due to the signi/ficantly more negative market valuation of securities. This was o/ffset to some extent by the development of the discount rate for pension and nuclear provisions.\n\n## Financial position\n\n## Financial management\n\n## Basis and objectives\n\nThe purpose of our /financial management system is to ensure that EnBW is able to meet its payment obligations at all times without restriction. In order to minimize risk, optimize costs and increase transparency, /financial transactions are managed within the Group /finance department as far as possible.",

        "page_content": "In the operating business, derivatives (Glossary, from p. 138) are deployed for hedging purposes only: for example, for forward contracts for electricity and primary energy source trading. This also applies for foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. All trading activities take place within a consistent framework using risk capital on the one hand and derived limits on the other. The risk capital for trading is approved by the entire Board of Management of EnBW on an annual basis. The risk capital used for own trading stood at \u20ac60 million.\n\nInterest rate risk management involves the management and monitoring  of  interest-sensitive  assets  and  liabilities.  The included companies regularly report on the existing risk position as part of the rolling liquidity planning process. An interest rate risk strategy is developed in an analysis conducted every quarter on an aggregated basis. The purpose is to limit the impact of /fluctuations in interest rates and interest rate risks on the results of operations and net assets. The interest rates on /financial liabilities are predominantly /fixed. We use interest rate derivatives to keep the relationship between /fixed and variable interest rates within prede/fined limits in order to optimize the interest income. The potential risk is determined on the basis of current interest rates and possible changes in these interest rates.\n\nCurrency positions resulting from operations are closed by appropriate forward exchange contracts. Currency /fluctuations from operating activities do not have any major e/ffect on our operating result. Foreign exchange risks are monitored on a case-by-case basis within the framework of the currency management system. Details on the risk management system are presented in note 25 of the notes to the consolidated /financial statements at www.enbw.com/report2020-downloads .\n\nAs part of the EnBW-wide digital transformation, the treasury IT landscape including the payment transaction system is being renewed. The aim is to achieve greater automation and more stable processes. In addition, new and amended governance rules will be implemented.\n\nWe continue to strive to maintain a balanced /financing structure, a solid /financial pro/file and thus solid investment-grade ratings (Glossary, from p. 138) .\n\n## Development of credit ratings - rating  /  outlook\n\n|                   | 2020          | 2019          | 2018        | 2017          | 2016                       |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| Moody's           | A3 / negative | A3 / negative | A3 / stable | Baa1 / stable | A3 / negative A\u00ad / negative |\n| Standard & Poor's | A- / stable   | A\u00ad / stable    | A\u00ad / stable  | A\u00ad / stable    |                            |\n| Fitch             | BBB+ / stable | A\u00ad / stable    | A\u00ad / stable  | A\u00ad / stable    | A\u00ad / stable                 |\n\nIn March 2020, Fitch downgraded the EnBW issuer rating by one notch from A- to BBB+ and con/firmed this rating again in December. The reasons given by Fitch for this downgrade were the acquisitions of Valeco and Plusnet in 2019 and the imminent start of the growth phase with higher investment and increasing /financial debt. In contrast, the ratings for senior and\n\nsubordinated bonds were con/firmed at A- and BBB, respectively, due to the valuation methods used by Fitch. S&P con/firmed the EnBW rating of A- with a stable outlook in May 2020. Moody's published an update on EnBW in June 2020. The rating was unchanged at A3 with a negative outlook.\n\nWe aim to secure our long-term access to the capital markets under competitive conditions by broadening our investor base using  sustainable  /financial  instruments.  For  this  purpose, we are digitalizing the underlying information and decisionmaking processes by creating a centralized data structure that can be managed and viewed using new media.\n\nThe ongoing strategic development of our company is designed to continuously improve the operating result (adjusted EBITDA). Our target for adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac2.4 billion in 2020 has been raised to \u20ac3.2 billion in 2025.\n\nUntil the transformation of our portfolio was completed at the end  of  2020,  the  internal  /financing  capability  served  as  an important performance indicator for the Group. It describes the adjusted retained cash /flow in relation to the adjusted net (cash) investment and measures our company's ability to /finance its activities internally. In the growth phase post 2020, the internal /financing capability will be replaced by the debt repayment potential - the ratio of the retained cash /flow to net debt. This performance indicator should enable us to achieve a controlled growth in earnings within the scope of our /financial targets, while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating at the same time.\n\nFurther explanations of our /financial terms can be found in the chapter 'Strategy, goals and performance management system' on p. 39 and in the Glossary, from p. 138 .\n\n## Rating and rating trends\n\nWe aim to hold solid investment-grade ratings in order to:\n\n- \u203a ensure unrestricted access to capital markets\n- \u203a o/ffer reliable opportunities for /financing partners\n- \u203a be regarded as a dependable business partner in our trading activities\n- \u203a achieve the lowest possible capital costs\n- \u203a implement an appropriate number of investment projects and thereby maintain the future viability of the company",

As part of the /financing strategy, we constantly assess capital market trends with regard to the current interest rate environment and to identify potentially favorable conditions. On this basis, we decide on further /financing steps.\n\nAlongside the internal /financing capability and our own funds, we have the following /financing instruments at our disposal to cover the /financing needs for the operating business:\n\n- \u203a Debt Issuance Program (DIP) (Glossary, from p. 138) , via which bonds are issued: \u20ac3.7 billion of \u20ac7.0 billion has been drawn\n- \u203a Subordinated bonds: \u20ac3.5 billion\n- \u203a Commercial paper (CP) program (Glossary,  from  p.  138) : \u20ac2.0 billion undrawn\n- \u203a Sustainability-linked syndicated credit facility: \u20ac1.5 billion undrawn, with a term until the end of June 2025 and an annual extension option a/f\\_ter the /first and second full year until the end of June 2027 at the latest\n- \u203a Committed bilateral credit lines: \u20ac0.3 billion of \u20ac1.2 billion drawn\n- \u203a Project /financing and loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB)\n- \u203a In addition, subsidiaries have other /financing activities in the form of bank loans and promissory notes.\n\nDocumentation of short-term and long-term borrowings on the capital markets under the established DIP and CP programs, as well as other credit documentation with banks (e.g., syndicated lines of credit) include internationally standardized clauses. The issuing of a negative pledge and a pari passu clause (Glossary,\n\nfrom p. 138) to all creditors form essential key elements of our /financing policy. The use of undrawn credit lines is not subject to restrictions. Details on /financial liabilities are presented in note 22 and explanations on other /financial commitments are presented in note 26 of the notes to the consolidated /financial statements at www.enbw.com/report2020-downloads .\n\nWe signed a sustainability-linked syndicated credit facility with a volume of \u20ac1.5 billion on 24 June 2020. The consortium consists of 18 banks. The facility will be used for general business purposes and replaces, ahead of schedule, the existing syndicated credit line that expires in July 2021. The initial term of /five years can subsequently be extended twice by a period of one year in each case. There is also an option to increase the volume by \u20ac500 million. The /financing costs are tied to the sustainability performance of EnBW for the /first time. The borrowing costs reduce or increase according to the degree to which the targets for selected non-/financial key performance indicators, which re/flect both environmental and social criteria, are achieved:\n\n- \u203a CO 2 intensity\n- \u203a Share of the generation capacity accounted for by renewable energies\n- \u203a SAIDI (electricity)\n\n## Bond issues in 2020\n\nThe 2020 reporting year demonstrated that we have su/fficient and /flexible access to the capital market at all times due to the robustness of our business model. Despite a very volatile market environment due to the coronavirus pandemic, we issued a corporate bond with a volume of \u20ac500 million at the beginning of April 2020. The bond has a term of /five years and a coupon of 0.625%.",

        "page_content": "A green subordinated bond also with a volume of \u20ac500 million was then issued at the end of June 2020. The proceeds were used in their entirety to re/finance the French wind and solar company Valeco, which we acquired in 2019. EnBW has the right to redeem the bond with a starting coupon of 1.875% at the /first call date on 29 March 2026 and then early at every coupon date.\n\nThe bond is subordinate to all other /financial liabilities but has an equal ranking to our existing subordinated bonds. The environmental contribution, use of funds and other information on our green bonds can be found in the impact report at www.enbw.com/green-bond .\n\nWe issued another corporate bond with a volume of \u20ac500 million in the middle of October 2020. The bond has a term of ten years and a coupon of 0.250%. Due to the high demand, we were able to secure attractive conditions.\n\nEnBW thus has a well-balanced maturity pro/file.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 First call date: subordinated bond maturing in 2076.\n- 2 First call date: subordinated bond maturing in 2077; includes US$300 million (swap in \u20ac), coupon before swap 5.125%.\n- 3 CHF 100 million, converted into \u20ac as of 31/12/2020.\n- 4 First call date: green subordinated bond maturing in 2079.\n- 5 First call date: green subordinated bond maturing in 2080.\n- 6 JPY 20 billion (swap in \u20ac), coupon before swap 5.460%.\n- 7 Includes US$300 million, converted into \u20ac at rate on 05/10/2016.\n\n## Asset liability management model\n\nWe ensure the timely coverage of the pension and nuclear obligations using our asset liability management model (Glossary, from p. 138) .\n\nThe aim is to cover the Group's pension and nuclear provisions within an economically feasible period of time by means of appropriate /financial assets. We ensure this using our cash /flowbased asset liability management model. For this purpose, we determine the e/ffects on the cash /flow statement, income statement and balance sheet over the next 30 years. Alongside the anticipated  return  on  /financial  assets,  actuarial  reports  on pension provisions and sector-speci/fic appraisals by external experts on costs for nuclear decommissioning and disposal are taken into account. The aim of this model is to limit the impact of the pension and nuclear obligations may have on the operating business to \u20ac300 million (plus an in/flation supplement) a year by taking funds from the /financial assets. As soon as the provisions are fully covered by the /financial assets, no further funds will be taken from the cash /flow from oper ating  activities as part of the model. This model also allows  simulations of various alternative scenarios.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the dedicated /financial assets (Glossary, from  p.  138) for  pension  and  nuclear  provisions  totaled \u20ac6,220.3 million (previous year: \u20ac6,328.7 million). Alongside the dedicated /financial assets, there are plan assets to cover certain pension obligations with a market value of \u20ac949.9 million as of 31 December 2020 (previous year: \u20ac974.3 million).\n\nWe strive to reach the de/fined investment targets with minimum risk. We also further optimized the risk  /  return pro/file of the /financial assets in 2020. The main part of the dedicated /financial assets is distributed as investments across nine asset classes. The /financial assets are bundled in two master funds with the following investment targets:\n\n- \u203a Risk-optimized investments, with a performance in line with market trends\n- \u203a Consideration of the e/ffects on the balance sheet and income statement\n- \u203a Broad diversi/fication of the asset classes\n- \u203a Reduction  of  costs  and  simpli/fication  of  administrative processes\n\nFinancial asset management (Glossary, from p. 138) at EnBW exploits the strategic opportunities o/ffered by digitalization. The main focus is being placed on improving the reliability of processes and improving e/fficiency. More speci/fically, a newly created data structure now forms the basis for several new digital solutions that can be scaled up across the Group. At the forefront is, among other things, a novel AI-based cash /flow forecasting tool. New digital technologies for intelligent data mining are also being implemented. All of the digital solutions are combined within a user-centered dashboard that is geared towards optimizing performance.",

These amounted to \u20ac39.9 million in the reporting period (previous year: \u20ac40.2 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment by the EnBW Group in 2020 was lower than in the previous year. This was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Plusnet and the French wind and solar company Valeco in 2019. Around 67.5% of overall gross investment was attributable to growth projects; the proportion of investment in existing facilities stood at 32.5%. This was mainly because of higher replacement investment in the distribution and transmission grids.\n\nThe investment in the Sales segment of \u20ac246.4 million was lower than the level in the previous year (\u20ac389.4 million), which was mainly due to the acquisition of Plusnet in the previous year. The majority of the investment was for the expansion of electromobility and the development of energy solutions.\n\nInvestment in the Grids segment of \u20ac1,407.3 million was higher than the level of investment in the previous year (\u20ac1,230.9 million). In both years, it was primarily attributable to the expansion of the transmission grids by our Group subsidiaries TransnetBW, terranets bw and ONTRAS Gastransport (despite the fact that the EUGAL project was largely completed in 2019). There was also investment in the distribution grid, to an increasing extent in its renewal, and the expansion of the charging infrastructure for the bene/fit of electromobility.\n\nInvestment in the Renewable Energies segment of \u20ac597.3 million was lower than the level in the previous year (\u20ac1,405.5 million). This decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of Valeco and the investment in our EnBW Hohe See and EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farms in the previous year. These wind farms were commissioned in autumn 2019 and at the beginning of 2020, respectively. There was additional expenditure in the area of photovoltaics.\n\nInvestment in the Generation and Trading segment in 2020 of \u20ac122.6 million was higher than the level in the previous year (\u20ac98.3 million). This increase was largely attributable to the construction of a gas turbine power plant in Marbach am Neckar as special technical equipment for grids (Glossary, from p. 138) . The groundbreaking ceremony was held in October 2020.\n\nOther investments in 2020 of \u20ac152.1 million were signi/ficantly higher than in the previous year (\u20ac44.0 million). This was due primarily to the acquisition of Gas-Union in 2020. Most of the assets held by Gas-Union in the form of a transmission grid have now been transferred to terranets bw.\n\nDivestitures of \u20ac698.8 million were approximately at the same level as in the previous year (\u20ac686.7 million). A signi/ficant proportion of the divestitures was related to the 'EnBW connects' participation model for local authorities in the reporting period and, in the previous year, to the sale of the remaining shares in EWE.  Other  disposals  in  2020  involved  the  transfer  of  the high-voltage grid to the City of Stuttgart.\n\nInvestment obligations for the acquisition of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac2,176.6 million as of 31 December 2020 (previous year: \u20ac1,213.8 million). Commitments from corporate acquisitions totaled \u20ac657.2 million (previous year: \u20ac535.5 million).",

This was due to lower cash payments for company acquisitions in the 2020 /financial year. In the previous year, there were cash payments for the acquisition of the shares in Valeco and Plusnet. This was o/ffset to a certain extent by higher capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment in comparison to the previous year. In addition, there was an out/flow of cash from securities and /financial investments in the 2020 /financial year, compared to a cash in/flow in the previous year.\n\nCash /flow from /financing activities returned a higher cash in/flow than in the previous year. In particular, this was attributable to cash received from the 'EnBW connects' participation model. There were also cash payments relating to the commercial paper program (Glossary, from p. 138) in the previous year. Furthermore, the reporting period was characterized by more new /financial liabilities being incurred. This was o/ffset to some extent by higher dividend payments and an increase in repayments for lease liabilities.\n\nThe solvency of the EnBW Group was ensured at all times throughout the 2020 /financial year thanks to the company's available liquidity and its internal /financing capability, as well as external sources available for /financing. The company's future solvency is secured by its solid /financial position.\n\n## Retained cash flow\n\n| in \u20ac million                            | 2020    | 2019    | Change   in %   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|\n| EBITDA                                  | 2,663.3 | 2,245.2 | 18.6            |\n| Changes in provisions                   | -553.3  | -416.0  | 33.0            |\n| Non-cash-relevant  expenses  /  income  | -26.1   | 46.3    | -               |\n| Income tax paid                         | -207.8  | -409.1  | -49.2           |\n| Interest and dividends received         | 264.5   | 286.5   | -7.7            |\n| Interest paid for financing activities  | -236.1  | -214.9  | 9.9             |\n| Dedicated financial assets contribution | 123.1   | 19.2    | -               |\n| Funds from operations (FFO)             | 2,027.6 | 1,557.2 | 30.2            |\n| Dividends paid                          | -389.1  | -316.5  | 22.9            |\n| Retained cash flow                      | 1,638.5 | 1,240.7 | 32.1            |\n\nFunds from operations (FFO) increased signi/ficantly compared to the previous year, which was due primarily to the increase in cash-relevant EBITDA.

Positive value is added when the return on capital employed (ROCE) (Glossary, from p. 138) exceeds the cost of capital. The cost of capital is determined based on the weighted average cost of equity and debt together. The value of equity is based here on a market valuation and thus deviates from the value recognized in the balance sheet. The cost of equity is based on the return of a risk-free investment and a company-speci/fic risk premium. The latter is calculated as the di/fference between a risk-free investment and the return for the overall market, weighted with a company-speci/fic business /field risk.

This was o/ffset to some extent by the increase in losses in other comprehensive income, which was mainly caused by the fall in the discount rate for the pension provisions from 1.1% at the end of 2019 to 0.75% as of the reporting date in 2020. The equity ratio fell from 17.2% to 16.9% between the two reporting dates. Non-current liabilities increased by \u20ac1,707.5 million. The main reasons were the increase in pension provisions because of the fall in the discount rate, the increase in derivatives and the increase in /financial liabilities due to the issuing of a green subordinated bond with a volume of \u20ac500 million and two senior bonds with a total volume of \u20ac1 billion.

The level of ROCE and value added depend not only on the development of the operating result but above all on the capital employed. Large-scale investments tend to signi/ficantly increase the capital employed in the early years, while the e/ffect on income that boosts value, however, only /filters through over a lengthier period of time, o/f\\_ten long a/f\\_ter the investments were initially made. This is especially true of capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment relating to the construction of new power\n\nplants, which do not have any positive e/ffect on the operating result of the Group until a/f\\_ter they are commissioned. Capital expenditure on power plants, on the other hand, is already taken into account in the capital employed during the construction phase. In a comparison of individual years, the development of ROCE and value added is, to a certain extent, cyclical in nature, depending on the investment volume. This e/ffect is therefore inherent in the system and results in lower ROCE in phases of strong growth or phases of investment.",

        "page_content": "In the 2020 /financial year, value added increased in comparison to the previous year to \u20ac253.3 million. Both the adjusted EBIT including the adjusted investment result and the average capital employed increased. The risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital was at the same level as in the previous year at 5.2%. The ROCE reached 6.3% and thus exceeded the expectation for the 2020 /financial year (forecast for 2020: 5.5% to 6.0%).\n\nSales: Value added in the Sales segment decreased in 2020 by \u20ac24.1 million. This was attributable to the increase in the average capital employed, which was primarily due to the increased activities in the areas of electromobility and broadband. In addition, the lower adjusted EBIT including the adjusted investment result had a negative e/ffect on value added.\n\nGrids: Value  added  in  the  Grids  segment  decreased  by \u20ac131.4 million in comparison to 2019. The adjusted EBIT including the adjusted investment result was \u20ac58.9 million lower than the /figure in the previous year. The increase in capital employed was primarily attributable to the investment in the transmission and distribution grids and also the increase in EEG payments.\n\nRenewable Energies: Value added in the Renewable Energies segment of \u20ac146.2 million was several times higher than the value in the previous year. The adjusted EBIT including the adjusted investment result increased to \u20ac522.5 million. The construction and commissioning of the EnBW Hohe See and Albatros o/ffshore wind farms and photovoltaic projects led to an increase in capital employed.\n\nGeneration and Trading: Value added in the Generation and Trading segment of \u20ac13.3 million was signi/ficantly higher than the level in 2019. This positive development was caused by the increase in adjusted EBIT including the adjusted investment result. The average capital employed in the reporting year was slightly below the level in the previous year.\n\n## Performance indicators relevant to remuneration\n\nThe  performance  indicators  relevant  to  remuneration  are derived as follows.

We were able to signi/ficantly increase the number of page views and contracts concluded via the website with the help of a revised content strategy in 2020. In particular, we attribute this to the continuous optimization of our portfolio of products and services and the improved user experience. Our end-customer portal 'My EnBW' allows customers to manage their contracts and also provides them with services such as a cost overview, discount check and relocation service. We were able to signi/ficantly increase the number of 'My EnBW' registrations and the ratio of monthly active users in 2020.\n\nThrough the application of our new IT and process landscape EnPower, we have been able to push forward the digital transformation of the EnBW and Yello brands. For example, we were able to automate signi/ficantly more manual processes than in the previous year, also with the aid of arti/ficial intelligence and RPA (robotic process automation).

This means that the satisfaction of the retail customers of EnBW was once again at a high level and at the upper end of our forecasted range. A good level is reached when half of those surveyed indicate that overall they are particularly satis/fied with EnBW. This is the case from 114 points upwards. A very good level of satisfaction is achieved from 136 points upwards. We attribute some of the improvement in the Customer Satisfaction Index to the expansion of our  digital  services  following  the  introduction  of  the  new EnPower platform. The increase in the index value also appears to have bene/fited to some extent from the positive image of the company: During the coronavirus pandemic, EnBW has been\n\n## Customers and society goal dimension\n\n## Reputation\n\nA strong reputation is an important factor for the sustainable success of a company. The good social reputation of a company re/flects the trust placed by the general public and relevant stakeholders in the competent and responsible actions of a company.\n\nWe assume our responsibilities for the economy and society and aspire to be a driver of the Energiewende. In the process, we want to gain social acceptance and improve our reputation. A good reputation signals the willingness of society and its di/fferent stakeholder groups to cooperate with and invest in the company.\n\nWe aim to continuously improve our reputation. The focal point of this concept is the stakeholder team, which was set up on the initiative of the Board of Management in 2017. It consists of representatives from all important areas of the company. The stakeholder team communicates and maintains dialog with relevant stakeholder groups both directly and indirectly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reputation Index\n\nReputation is measured using the key performance indicator Reputation Index using a standardized survey that is carried out by an external market research institute. It is measured in accordance with the requirements of the EnBW Group standard for market research and surveys (p. 39) .\n\n## Key performance indicator\n\n|                  |   2020 |   2019 |   Change   in % |   Forecast   2020 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Reputation Index |   55.5 |   52.8 |             5.1 |              55.4 |\n\nIn the reporting year, our Reputation Index rose to its highest level since we started compiling this value and also slightly exceeded our target for 2020. The improvement in the assessment of our company by the target group investors was especially strong. We assume that these stakeholders place particular importance on the continuity and reliability of our business performance and our engagement in sustainability and climate protection. In addition, the reputation of our company also grew signi/ficantly among opinion leaders and the wider public, not only in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg but across Germany.

We believe that this high value was due to, among other things, the further development of Yello's digital services and its expanded range of products. Since the beginning of 2020, Yello has been exclusively o/ffering green electricity to new customers and is using a TV campaign to advertise these tari/ffs, products related to solar power and e-mobility, as well as the range of Yello services.\n\nFurther details are available in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' on p. 103.\n\n## Selected activities\n\nGreen electricity is becoming increasingly signi/ficant for the product portfolio of EnBW and Yello. At the beginning of 2020, Yello switched all new customer tari/ffs over to 100% green electricity and introduced a climate-neutral biogas product. All electricity and gas tari/ffs also make a contribution to climate protection by investing in climate protection projects. Yello customers have been able to compensate for more than 74,000 t CO 2 in this way. The theme of sustainability is also part of the new advertising campaign 'More Yello.' The business operations of NaturEnergie+ Deutschland were also merged with its sister company Yello Strom in 2020 to consolidate our sales potential. The proportion of the product range for household customers that is accounted for by green electricity is also increasing continuously at the EnBW brand. Since November 2020, the range of products available to household customers on www.enbw.com has been switched over completely to green electricity. Some 81% of the contracts concluded with new household customers in the electricity segment are based on green electricity tari/ffs, while 33% of the existing household customers are already being supplied with green electricity products. We are thus able to save around 330,000 t CO 2 per year via both brands.\n\nA main focus of the activities in the area of 'Customer proximity' in 2020 was electromobility. As a full-service provider together with our subsidiaries, we cover the complete service spectrum from the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and the installation, expansion and supply of electricity, as well as the operation of a comprehensive charging infrastructure (Glossary, from p. 138) through to digital services for the consumer.\n\nTo expand the charging infrastructure (Glossary, from p. 138) , we are cooperating with business partners, such as chain stores, to install ultra-fast charging stations with an output of up to 300 kW at their locations. In 2021, we aim to operate 1,000 quick-charging stations across Germany. We were not able to achieve this /figure sooner due to, on the one hand, the changed framework conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and, on the other hand, the pending legislative and funding proceedings with respect to electromobility. In cooperation with the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, EnBW has also been implementing the projects 'Urban Quick-Charging Parks in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg' (USP-BW) and 'Fast Lane BW' since 2020. In the USP-BW\n\nproject, public quick-charging parks are being installed at 16 sites in 15 cities, while FastLane BW involves the expansion of /five existing quick-charging sites to form quick-charging parks along long-distance routes in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. We are also pushing forward the expansion of the charging infrastructure internationally: We are widening our position as a national market  leader  in  quick  charging  to  cover  the  Austrian  market through our joint venture SMATRICS EnBW. We are demonstrating how e-cars will be charged in the future at the new /flagship charging park in Rutesheim on the A8 motorway. The charging park is equipped with all standard connections and enables ultra-fast charging with an output of up to 300 kW. In addition, it o/ffers the drivers of e-cars access to public Wi-Fi and a secure environment with lighting and video surveillance. At the new Tank & Rast service station 'Werratal S\u00fcd,' EnBW quick-charging stations have been installed right next to the conventional fuel pumps. 'Werratal S\u00fcd' is thus the /first service station in Germany to combine all types of drive under one /filling station roof.\n\nAt the same time, we are working together with vehicle manufacturers to o/ffer their customers complete charging solutions and  access  to  the  EnBW  HyperNetwork.  This  is  the  largest charging network in Germany, Austria and Switzerland; France, Italy and the Netherlands were also added to the network in 2020. Using the EnBW mobility+ app and a charging card, drivers of e-cars have access to more than 100,000 charging points where they can always charge at the same price. We are using the  advertising  campaign  for  the  EnBW  HyperNetwork  to make our commitment to the expansion of a comprehensive charging infrastructure and our solutions for customers known beyond Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg throughout Germany. The campaign is being run in selected regions, including Hamburg, Munich and the Rhine-Ruhr region.\n\nOn 1 January 2021, EnBW combined its operational and strategic activities in the area of electromobility within one independent company EnBW mobility+. The new company is a wholly owned subsidiary and is responsible for all activities related to the operation of the charging infrastructure and the range of products and services for electromobility.\n\nOur subsidiary SENEC is one of the top 3 providers of home storage systems for solar power plants in Germany and a specialist in equipping customers so that they are able to meet their own energy needs with solar electricity. In 2020, SENEC doubled its revenue and the number of electricity storage systems sold in comparison to the previous year, while signi/ficantly increasing the capacity of the PV modules sold. According to a survey conducted by the market research company EuPD Research, SENEC was able to increase its market share on the German home electricity storage market by 15% in the /first half of 2020 in comparison to the previous year. The main drivers of the expansive business development are the network of SENEC specialist partners, which has been expanded to more than 850 companies, and innovative products, for example for emergency power supply or for the smart integration of electromobility into a customer's system for generating their own electricity.\n\nIn the area of contracting, we provide industry, the real estate sector and public clients with a sustainable and e/fficient energy infrastructure  directly  at  the  customer's  site.  We  create",

        "page_content": "network services in the business and industrial customer segment. The cooperation between the two companies is being constantly expanded and intensi/fied, for example in the areas of infrastructure, purchasing and customer contact. An important element of this cooperation is the harmonized target IT architecture across both companies. The new platform will act as the basis for scaling, improvements in e/fficiency and a quick and /flexible response to all situations on the market. As part of the process to expand its /fiber-optic infrastructure, NetCom BW is also receiving support from the EnBW subsidiary Netze BW.\n\nWe are positioning ourselves as a provider of cybersecurity services for cities and municipalities, public utilities, the telecommunications sector, health sector and industry in various customer projects across Germany. In May 2020, a cooperation agreement to combat cybercrime and protect critical infrastructure was concluded between the Federal State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and EnBW. As part of this cooperation, we started to compile a status report on 'cybersecurity for critical infrastructure' for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg together with the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Bureau of Investigation in 2020.\n\n## Supply reliability\n\nAs an energy company and in cooperation with our distribution grid companies, we are tasked with guaranteeing a secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers. We face additional challenges both now and in the future due to the increasing amount of decentralized generation, with volatile feed-ins as a result of changing weather conditions, and the electri/fication of road tra/ffic. We are preparing our distribution grids so that they can handle this decentralized energy world. Therefore, we are expanding the existing conventional infrastructure with smart grid technologies (Glossary, from p. 138) so that we can better monitor and manage the generation, distribution and storage of energy.\n\nOur grid companies are responsible for the secure and reliable operation of the distribution grids. The processes are managed by the respective grid control center, which is also responsible for coordinating any work to rectify faults in the grid in the respective region. As part of the investment and maintenance programs, our grid companies maintain the grids and expand them according to demand. The overall annual budget for the realization of all investment and maintenance measures is approved by the Board of Management of the EnBW Group. The measures are carried out over one or multiple years and are realized independently by our grid companies. Some of the investment budget is used for the gradual expansion of smart grids. The increasing use of smart grid technology (Glossary, from p. 138) enables us to avoid or delay expensive investment in conventional grids. Besides the reliability and security of supply, the e/fficiency of the measures is also taken into account when making investment decisions. This is because grid investment also has an in/fluence on the grid charges that make up part of the electricity price paid by customers.\n\ncustomized energy concepts to provide energy while saving on CO 2 emissions at the same time. For example, we developed an energy concept in 2020 based on near-to-surface geothermal energy, PV power plants and decentralized heat pumps for an industrial park that is currently being realized. An important component of our long-term contracting agreements is the ongoing monitoring and optimization of plant operation. For this purpose, we develop applications and business processes as part of our digitalization approach that automatically collect, link and evaluate data from the plant.\n\nOur company views itself as an experienced and capable partner for local authorities and public utilities. We have invested in many local authority companies across Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and play an active role in networks for the exchange of information between our participating interests and other public utilities. By developing customer-speci/fic products and services, we currently support numerous local authorities and public utilities. We are guided here by the trends and developments that will shape and in/fluence the local authority environment in the future. We developed /five new product clusters in 2020 on this basis:  smart  mobility,  networked  infrastructure,  innovative communities, sustainable energy and reliable security systems. They will create the foundations for our local authority business in the next few years.\n\nIn the smart mobility cluster, we support local authorities to implement the mobility transition in rural areas with the business development 'twist.' 'twist' is an electromobility car sharing service that is o/ffered to local authorities as a full-service care-free package. We launched several initiatives in the networked infrastructure cluster in 2020: At the beginning of the year,  Netze  BW  started  the  construction  of  the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) network for the whole of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which is due to be completed by the end of 2022. This network will enable local authorities to utilize smart networking technologies (Internet of Things). We have also been o/ffering a climate protection consulting service to local authorities since the middle of 2020.\n\nThe 'EnBW connects' participation model started in July 2019. 116 local authorities have since acquired shares in the newly founded  local  authority  holding  company.  They  now  own approximately 9% of the shares in Netze BW. The second participation phase was announced at the constituting meeting of shareholders on 4 November 2020. It begins on 1 July 2021 and aims to further intensify the close relationship between Netze BW and the cities and communities of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\nSince 2019, EnBW AG has bundled together its main telecommunications activities in the company EnBW Telekommunikation with its subsidiaries NetCom BW and Plusnet. NetCom BW has a strong market position as a telecommunications network operator for the retail and business customer segment with its own /fiber-optic infrastructure in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Plusnet is  a  nationwide  specialist  provider  of  communication  and",

This data /flows into the 'System Average Interruption Duration Index' (SAIDI) for electricity. It states the average duration of supply interruptions per end consumer in minutes per year (p. 39) .\n\n## Key performance indicator\n\n|                                             |   2020 |   2019 | Change   in %   | Forecast   2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| SAIDI (electricity)   in  min.  /  year   1 |     15 |     15 | -               | 15 - 20           |\n\n- 1 SAIDI includes all unscheduled interruptions to supply that last more than three minutes for the end consumer.\n\nAs in the previous year, supply reliability was once again at a very good level in 2020. Thanks to the early introduction of rigorous safety measures for our operating and contingency personnel, we were able to avoid any sta/ff shortages due to the coronavirus pandemic when it came to identifying and rectifying faults on the grids we supply. Extraordinary climatic events that  have  a  noticeable  negative  in/fluence  on  SAIDI  only occurred to a minor extent in the reporting year.\n\nTo continuously improve our grid operations, we initiated various projects at our grid subsidiaries in 2020 that are already being implemented. One example is increasing the level of digitalization by installing sensors and actuators in the medium and low-voltage grids.\n\n## Environment goal dimension\n\nOur Group environmental targets - which are integrated into the EnBW 2025 Group strategy - relate to the expansion of renewable energies and to making our contribution to climate protection. These targets are measured using the key performance indicators 'installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE' and CO 2 intensity. These are supplemented by activities and targets for the implementation of environmental themes in the EnBW sustainability program (p. 35) . Alongside EnBW AG, the main subsidiaries dealing with environmental issues include ED and SWD. These and other subsidiaries have an environmental management system certi/fied according to DIN EN ISO 14001:2015, as does EnBW AG. This creates the prerequisites for ensuring that environmental requirements are systematically and continuously taken into account. It is used to manage the required guidelines and regulations, de/fine and monitor environmental targets and establish the necessary testing processes. The consistent implementation and further development of the environmental management system ensures that any material negative impacts on the environment can be avoided as well as possible. Risks generally exist in the area of environmental protection due to the operation of power generation plants and transmission facilities and the possible consequences for air, water, soil and nature. We counter these risks using organizational and procedural measures to reduce their impact, as well as through emergency planning and hazard  prevention measures.\n\n## EU taxonomy\n\nThe European Commission presented the European Green Deal in December 2019. It includes the target of reducing net emissions from greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 in the European Union. A key component of the EU Green Deal (Glossary, from p. 138) is the EU taxonomy (Glossary, from p. 138) -a classi/fication system used to de/fine environmentally sustainable business  activities. The  aim  is  to  classify  economic  activities EU-wide with respect to their contribution to six de/fined environmental objectives on the basis of certain requirements in order to encourage the development of sustainable /financing products:  (1)  climate  change  mitigation,  (2)  climate  change adaptation, (3) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) transition to a circular economy, (5) pollution prevention and control and (6) protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nAgainst the background of current developments and in line with our sustainable corporate strategy, we have decided to already expand our integrated reporting this year to include some  of  the  information  that  will  be  obligatory  in  future according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, and are thus publishing  the  required information  on  revenue,  operating expenses (opex) and capital expenditure (capex) from environmentally sustainable activities based on the Taxonomy Regulation in the version of 18 June 2020 and the technical screening criteria in the dra/f\\_t delegated act for the Taxonomy Regulation for the environmental objective of climate protection of 20 November 2020, as well as additional information on adjusted EBITDA. Business activities are 'environmentally sustainable' in the sense of the Taxonomy Regulation when they:\n\n- \u203a make  a  substantial  contribution  to  mitigating  climate change or adapting to climate change, veri/fied through compliance with certain technical screening criteria,\n- \u203a do no signi/ficant harm (DNSH) to the achievement of any of the other EU environmental objectives and\n- \u203a comply with minimum safeguards for occupational safety and human rights.\n\nFor energy companies, speci/fic taxonomy criteria have been de/fined for a total of 25 business activities. The criteria were developed in accordance with the principle of technology neutrality, which means for the energy sector that they are independent of the type of energy generation involved.\n\nIn the 2020 /financial year, we started a project to implement the taxonomy requirements with respect to the EU environmental objective of climate protection. It covers the business activities of onshore and o/ffshore wind, solar, run-of-river and electricity  grids  (transmission  and  distribution  grids).  We publish the results and other information on the EU taxonomy in detail in a publication at www.enbw.com/eu-taxonomy .",

Based on the current requirements of the EU taxonomy, it determines with the aid of the specialist departments concerned the environmentally sustainable revenue, opex, capex and adjusted EBITDA with respect to activities across the Group. Opex at EnBW includes operating expenses and income from the operation and maintenance of the power plants, including administrative costs, without taking account of energy industry e/ffects and levies.\n\nIn the /first stage carried out in the reporting year, we focused on the two segments Renewable Energies and Grids. In the coming years, we plan to expand the reporting for the EU taxonomy to all Group activities and segments.\n\n## Activities examined for the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nExamined segments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following shares were derived for the Grids segment:\n\n## Environmentally sustainable revenue, opex, capex and ad justed EBITDA from business activities in the Grids segment\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                    | 2020         | 2019         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Revenue                                                         |              |              |\n| Sales segment                                                   | 3,658        | 3,460        |\n| of which environmentally sustainable   in  \u20ac  million  /  in  % | 2.506  /  69 | 2.376  /  69 |\n| Opex                                                            |              |              |\n| Sales segment                                                   | 1,122        | 1,039        |\n| of which environmentally sustainable   in  \u20ac  million  /  in  % | 692  /  62   | 623  /  60   |\n| Capex                                                           |              |              |\n| Sales segment                                                   | 1,407        | 1,231        |\n| of which environmentally sustainable   in  \u20ac  million  /  in  % | 975  /  69   | 778  /  63   |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                 |              |              |\n| Sales segment                                                   | 1,347        | 1,355        |\n| of which environmentally sustainable   in  \u20ac  million  /  in  % | 987  /  73   | 960  /  71   |",

        "page_content": "## Substantial contribution to one EU environmental objective\n\nIn the case of the business activities relating to wind and solar energy and with respect to the requirement for a substantial contribution to climate protection, it is not currently necessary to test compliance with the criteria because these types of energy generation should remain signi/ficantly below the current threshold of 100 g CO 2 eq  /  kWh,  even  when  analyzed  over their entire life cycle. It can also be assumed that the electricity grids are making a substantial contribution to climate protection due to the fact that the majority of the connections in the last /five years have been for renewable energies. Hydropower plants make a substantial contribution to climate protection over their entire life cycle as they have a very low greenhouse gas intensity of signi/ficantly less than 100 g CO 2 eq  /  kWh.  We used the emissions factors published by the German Environment Agency as a reference, which give /figures for both run-ofriver and pumped storage with natural /flow of water well below the threshold of 100 g CO 2 eq  /  kWh.\n\n## No significant harm to the other EU environmental objectives\n\nIn the next stage, we examined whether any signi/ficant harm was being done to the other four environmental objectives ( sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). This predominantly relates to the legal and o/fficial regulations in the energy industry that have to be observed in order to receive approval for constructing and operating power plants. Compliance with these energy industry regulations and with any further requirements (such as those related to the circular economy) was analyzed at the superordinate level of the business  activities  with  the  aid  of  the  respective  specialist departments at EnBW. With respect to the four environmental objectives, the analysis yielded the following results:\n\n## The environmental objective sustainable use and protection of\n\nwater and marine resources is relevant above all at the hydropower plants and o/ffshore wind power plants. In particular, the criteria reference the legal and o/fficial regulations in the energy industry that have to be observed to receive approval for constructing and operating power plants.\n\nIn terms of the environmental objective transition to a circular economy, there are general regulations relating to high durability, easy dismantling, repairability and a declaration of intent to maximize the recycling of the plant at the end of its service life. The vast majority of components are designed for a very long service life, are recyclable and have monetary value at the end of their period of use (steel, aluminum, copper). Plant components that ful/fill these criteria can either be recycled within the EnBW Group or also sold to third parties for further use.\n\nFor the environmental objective pollution prevention and control, there are only criteria relevant to run-of-river power plants in the activities that were considered, namely guaranteeing observance of the valid EU regulations for a management plan for the river basin, as well as for the frequencies for taking samples and for taking measurements of the water quality. Compliance with these energy industry regulations is a prerequisite for receiving approval to operate the power plant.\n\nFor the last relevant environmental objective protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, we examined environmental impact assessments and comparable assessments that are a key requirement for receiving approval for constructing and operating power plants.\n\n## Compliance with minimum safeguards\n\nIn a third and /final stage, we analyzed the business activities at a Group level with respect to their compliance with the minimum social safeguards for human rights and occupational safety (pre-quali/fication processes (p. 53) , information on occupational safety (p. 89 f.) and the report on opportunities and risks (p. 104) ).\n\n## Expansion of Renewable Energies\n\n/#TOP Installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE\n\n## Key performance indicator\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2020         | 2019         | Change   in %   | Forecast   2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Installed output of RE in   GW and the share of  the generation capacity  accounted for by RE in % | 4.9  /  39.0 | 4.4  /  31.8 | 11.4  /  -      | 5.0  /   > 40     |\n\nIn 2020, the installed output of renewable energies increased to 4.9 GW and was thus slightly below our forecasted value. The increase in comparison to the previous year was primarily due to the commissioning of our EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farm with a capacity of 118 MW, the commissioning of 124 MW p of the total capacity of 187 MW p at our Weesow-Willmersdorf solar park and the expansion and acquisition of onshore wind farms and other photovoltaic power plants. Overall, the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE increased to 39.0% and almost reached the forecasted value as a result. We have thus made decisive progress in the expansion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources in accordance with our strategy.",

The main reasons for this clear decrease were the decommissioning of Block 2 of our Philippsburg nuclear power plant and the lower deployment of our thermal power plants because of prices on the market. In contrast, generation based on renewable energies increased considerably. This was mainly due to the /first full year of operation of our EnBW Hohe See o/ffshore wind farm and the commissioning of our EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farm in January 2020. In addition, higher volumes of electricity were generated by our onshore wind and photovoltaic power plants. The proportion of own generation from renewable energy sources thus increased signi/ficantly in comparison to the previous year to more than 32%.\n\n## Breakdown of the generation portfolio 1 (as of 31/12)\n\n| Electrical  output   2  in MW                                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Renewable Energies                                                              | 4,865  | 4,398  |\n| Run-of-river power plants                                                       | 1,007  | 1,006  |\n| Storage  /  pumped  storage  power  plants using the natural flow of  water   2 | 1,507  | 1,507  |\n| Onshore wind                                                                    | 951    | 826    |\n| Offshore wind                                                                   | 976    | 834    |\n| Other renewable energies                                                        | 424    | 225    |\n| Thermal power plants   3                                                        | 7,621  | 9,451  |\n| Brown coal                                                                      | 875    | 875    |\n| Hard coal                                                                       | 3,467  | 3,586  |\n| Gas                                                                             | 1,165  | 1,165  |\n| Other thermal power plants                                                      | 346    | 347    |\n| Pumped storage power plants that  do not use the natural flow of water   2      | 545    | 545    |\n| Nuclear power plants   4                                                        | 1,223  | 2,933  |\n| Installed  output   5                                                           | 12,486 | 13,849 |\n| of which renewable in %                                                         | 39.0   | 31.8   |\n| of which low CO 2  in %   6                                                     | 13.7   | 12.3   |\n\n- 1 The generation portfolio includes long-term procurement agreements and generation from partly owned power plants.\n- 2 Output values irrespective of marketing channel, for storage: generation capacity.\n- 3 Including pumped storage power plants that do not use the natural flow of water.\n- 4 The output from Block 2 of the Philippsburg nuclear power plant is included in the generation portfolio in 2019 because it was not shut down until the evening of 31/12/2019.\n- 5 In addition, power plants with an installed output of 1,706 MW were registered for decommissioning.

We publish a five-year comparison of the performance indicators in our 'Multi-year overview' on p. 143.\n\nThe CO 2 intensity of our own electricity generation fell by 11.4% in comparison to the previous year to 372 g  /  kWh. We had forecast an increase of between 16% and 23% despite higher generation from renewable energies in comparison to 2019, especially due to the EnBW Hohe See and EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farms. Electricity generation at our fossil fuel-/fired power plants was signi/ficantly lower than expected due to market-driven developments. The unforeseeable e/ffects of the coronavirus pandemic also played a role.\n\nWe also refer you to the details provided in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 104).\n\n## Carbon footprint of EnBW\n\nDirect CO 2 emissions are determined mainly by the deployment of power plants. In particular, the decrease in electricity generation from coal in combination with a signi/ficant increase in electricity generation from renewable sources led to a corresponding reduction in direct CO 2 emissions from 10.8 to 9.6 million t CO 2 eq. Lower indirect CO 2 emissions from grid losses led to a fall in Scope 2 CO 2 emissions from 0.9 to 0.8 million t CO 2 eq. Scope 3 CO 2 emissions are mainly in/fluenced by the gas consumption of our customers and thus by gas sales in the B2C and B2B sectors. Due to a change in the classi/fication of business activities, there was a shi/f\\_t between the Generation and Trading and Sales segments. The /figures for the previous year have been restated accordingly. For this reason, and also as a result of the purchase of Gas-Union by VNG, gas sales and thus the Scope 3 emissions rose signi/ficantly in the 2020 /financial year in comparison to the previous year. Primarily as a result of the increased generation from renewable energy sources, CO 2 emissions avoided rose from 7.9 to 8.9 million t Co2eq.\n\n## Carbon footprint\n\n| in thousand t CO 2 eq  /  in  %                                  | 2020            | 2019            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Direct CO 2  emissions (Scope 1)                                 |                 |                 |\n| Electricity generation                                           | 8,526  /  89.2  | 9,725  /  90.1  |\n| Heat generation                                                  | 754  /  7.9     | 806  /  7.5     |\n| Operation  of  gas  pipelines  /  plants                         | 216  /  2.3     | 193  /  1.8     |\n| Operation of electricity grid                                    | 26  /  0.3      | 21  /  0.2      |\n| Buildings                                                        | 8  /  0.1       | 10  /  0.1      |\n| Vehicles                                                         | 26  /  0.3      | 24  /  0.2      |\n| Other   2                                                        | 2  /   <  0.1   | 13  /  0.1      |\n| Indirect CO 2  emissions (Scope 2)                               |                 |                 |\n| Grid losses                                                      | 709  /  93.0    | 870  /  95.2    |\n| Operation of plants, electricity grid   1                        | 10  /  1.3      | 11  /  1.2      |\n| Operation of plants, gas grid                                    | 28  /  3.7      | 12  /  1.3      |\n| Operation of plants, water supply                                | 4  /  0.5       | 4  /  0.5       |\n| Buildings                                                        | 12  /  1.6      | 17  /  1.8      |\n| Upstream indirect CO 2  emissions  (Scope 3)                     |                 |                 |\n| Upstream gas sales   1                                           | 6,287  /  12.7  | 5,318  /  12.7  |\n| Procurement of fuel for energy  generation                       | 563  /  1.1     | 715  /  1.7     |\n| Upstream gas consumption, gas  plants                            | 5  /   <  0.1   | 7  /   <  0.1   |\n| Business trips                                                   | 2  /   <  0.1   | 4  /   <  0.1   |\n| Downstream indirect CO 2  emissions  (Scope 3)                   |                 |                 |\n| Gas consumption by customers   1                                 | 42,596  /  86.1 | 36,000  /  85.6 |\n| CO 2  emissions avoided   1                                      | 8,904           | 7,922           |\n| CO 2  intensity of business journeys and  traveling CO 2   /  km | 190             | 169             |\n\n- 1 The figures for the previous year have been restated.\n- 2 Includes non-automotive fuel consumption (e.g., emergency generators).",

It does not include conversion losses during energy generation or grid losses. Total /final energy consumption is mostly in/fluenced by pump energy as well as the company's own consumption requirements and the operating consumption of the power plants. Due to the lower level of own generation overall, total /final energy consumption fell by around 4.4% in comparison to the previous year from 2,929 GWh to 2,799 GWh.\n\nThe proportion of renewable energies in /final energy consumption increased from 53.2% in 2019 to 54.6% in 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in electricity generation from renewable  energies  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  the proportion of renewable energies used for the company's own consumption requirements and the operating consumption of the power plants.\n\nThe energy consumption of our buildings covers the energy required for heating rooms, providing hot water and electricity. The energy consumption of buildings per employee decreased from 9,905 kWh in 2019 to 5,885 kWh in 2020. This considerable decrease was primarily attributable to the much greater number of employees working from home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.",

In addition, all vehicles that are newly purchased  in  future  by  the  central  mobility  management department at EnBW AG will be exclusively hybrid or electric vehicles.\n\nSustainable real estate management: We aim to reduce CO 2 emissions in our real estate portfolio. EnBW Real Estate GmbH, the subsidiary responsible for most of the real estate activities of EnBW AG, has been set the target of reducing the CO 2 emissions in its portfolio by 50% by 2025 and by 75% by 2030, based on the reference year of 2018. In addition, the speci/fic energy consumption of existing buildings will be reduced by 10% by 2025 and by 20% by 2030, based on the reference year of 2018. The portfolio managed by EnBW Real Estate GmbH comprises around 100 properties with approximately 260 buildings and a net /floor space of about 650,000 m\u00b2 in total. An important measure for achieving this target will be, for example, switching to green electricity and biogas in the building portfolio from 2021.\n\nReduction in paper consumption: We have set ourselves the goal of signi/ficantly reducing paper consumption. More specifically, we have set ourselves the target of reducing the volume of paper procured and ordered at EnBW AG headquarters by 90% by 2025, based on the reference year of 2019. We were able to reduce internal paper consumption by around 50 t and customer-driven paper consumption by around 280 t in 2020. This milestone  was  reached  signi/ficantly  earlier  than  originally planned. This success is mainly attributable to our e/ffective digitalization initiatives. The coronavirus pandemic and the associated regulation allowing for working from home also led to a noticeable reduction in paper consumption.\n\n## Other selected activities\n\nWe also report on other important activities in 2020 in the environment goal dimension.\n\nHydropower: Electricity generated from hydropower protects the climate. At the same time, the use of hydropower also encroaches on nature. Therefore, we are committed to harmonizing hydropower with the environment. If power plants cause changes to the natural landscape, we compensate for these e/ffects through environmental enhancement measures. For example, we ensure or improve the continuity of watercourses by constructing or optimizing /fish passes and /fish ladders for /fish to ascend or descend the river. In addition, we are developing innovative solutions to protect /fish. In future, for example, the conditions for /fish to migrate along the river Enz in the area of the Enzberg I and II and M\u00fchlhausen run-of-river diversion power plants will be much improved. A close-to-nature bypass channel has been constructed so that /fish can ascend the river and a groyne has been built in the river to help the /fish navigate. A guidance system including migration routes has also been set up for the downstream migrating /fish. We are thus making a valuable contribution to achieving the targets in the EU Water Framework.\n\nConservation of biological diversity: We initiated the program 'Stimuli for Diversity' for the protection of amphibian species together with the LUBW (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Institute for the Environment) in 2011, which has also included funding for protective measures for reptiles since 2016. The program is part of the project 'The economy and business for nature,' which is a component of the state initiative 'Active for biological diversity.' It still remains the only conservation program from a company nationwide that not only funds the protection of one  single species but two whole groups of species across the state. The funding program celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2020. During this ten year period, numerous measures have been implemented in a total of 125 projects that have helped to im prove the habitats of native amphibians and reptiles so that their populations can start to grow again in the medium to long term.",

There is no value for 2019 and no forecasted value for 2020 available.\n- 2 Variations in the group of consolidated companies (all companies with more than 100 employees are generally considered [except ITOs]).\n- 3 The performance indicator was reported for the last time in 2019.\n\nThe /first employee survey using the EnMAB was held from 16 to 27 November 2020. The survey achieved its highest coverage to date, being answered by around 22,000 employees, including trainees  and  students.  On  the  basis  of  this  survey,  the  PEI reached 83 points in 2020 on a scale of 0 to 100. There are no values available for previous years at EnBW. According to an assessment by the service provider, an international benchmark index compiled using similar questions at numerous companies from various di/fferent sectors stood at 74 points in 2020. The motivation and engagement of employees of EnBW is thus at a very high level in comparison with other companies. However, our extremely good result in 2020 could have been in/fluenced by the extraordinary e/ffect of employees at EnBW rating the company's handling of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic very positively.\n\nWe also refer you to the details provided in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 104).\n\n## HR strategy 2025\n\nOur new HR strategy 2025 'People as the main focus' supports the implementation of the EnBW 2025 corporate strategy. Digitalization requires a willingness to change, technological expertise and modern working practices. Our managers should not just place expectations on their employees but also support them and lead their teams with conviction into a more complex world. Our newly designed HR policy will support employees in this process of change, for example by developing new forms for cooperation and for further training and education. In addition, we value the potential o/ffered by the internationality and diversity of our employees.\n\nThe new HR strategy focuses on six key themes with 21 strategic areas:\n\n- \u203a People-centered transformation\n- \u203a Employer brand and recruiting\n- \u203a Leadership and skills\n- \u203a Quali/fication@EnBW\n- \u203a Diversity@EnBW\n- \u203a HR processes, services & digitalization\n\nAlongside the key performance indicators in the environment goal dimension, other environmental targets are de/fined in the EnBW sustainability program (p. 35) . We utilize a broad range of additional environmental performance indicators for measuring, managing and reporting on the other results of our environmentally relevant activities. Selected activities and performance indicators are described in this section. A comprehensive presentation of our environmental performance indicators can be found in our 'Multi-year overview' (p. 143). Further information on the Global Reporting Initiative is available on the Internet at www.enbw.com/environmental-protection . There is also information available here on our measures to improve energy e/fficiency, conserve biological diversity and protect nature and species.\n\n## Employees goal dimension\n\nThe further development of our corporate strategy in the period up to 2025 (p. 34 ff.) will place new demands on our HR policy. In future, the strategy will focus on growth, infrastructure, selective internationalization and new business also outside of the energy sector. Using our HR strategy 2025 'People as the main focus,' we want to give the people at EnBW and our company their own opportunity for growth, development, a future and thus success. The key tasks of HR are recruiting employees for the company, managing their development including accompanying them through the transformation, encouraging loyalty to the company among employees and maintaining and fostering their motivation, satisfaction and employability.\n\nAs an operator of critical infrastructure, we place special importance on protecting the health of our employees. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, around 10,000 EnBW employees have been working mostly from home thanks to the capabilities of modern IT. At the same time, the parties involved in the collective bargaining agreements have agreed to make the working time provisions in the current collective pay agreements more /flexible.\n\nMore than 2,800 employees at our key subsidiaries Energiedienst (ED), Pra\u017esk\u00e1 energetika (PRE), Stadtwerke D\u00fcsseldorf (SWD) and VNG have been working at home since March 2020.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\n## /#TOP People  Engagement  Index  (PEI)  /  Employee  Commitment Index (MCI)\n\nSince  November  2020,  we  have  been  using  a  redesigned employee survey (EnMAB) to measure the People Engagement Index (PEI) as a new key performance indicator. The PEI allows us to draw conclusions not only on the satisfaction of employees, but also on how motivated and engaged they are in their work at EnBW. Before the 2020 /financial year, we used the Employee Commitment Index (ECI) to measure the degree to which employees identi/fied with the company.",

        "page_content": "## Selected activities in our six themes\n\nPeople-centered transformation: We consider ourselves to be the shapers of a people-centered transformation in the Group and are placing the main focus on people and their needs. To support employees as well as possible in the transformation process, we are further developing, for example, the employee survey and establishing the transformation circle - the /first Group-wide community for all colleagues who are pushing forward the themes of transformation.\n\nThe employee survey will be carried out twice a year in the future. The new employee survey o/ffers us bene/fits in three areas:\n\n- \u203a Content: The PEI not only re/flects how satis/fied employees are with their company but also their enthusiasm for their work.\n- \u203a Speed: Real-time transmission of results and comments that can be used to derive speci/fic and achievable proposals for action.\n- \u203a Flexibility: The survey can be linked with individual business needs, the EnBW 2025 strategy and current challenges. In addition, it will still be possible to compare our results with those of the competition.\n\nThe 'Best Work' initiative deals with the question: 'How do we design the working world of the future?' Employees and works council representatives are developing joint concepts for /flexible and virtual working for the time a/f\\_ter the coronavirus pandemic. The project is placing a special focus on rules for mobile working that take account of the best interests of employees, especially those working from home, and designing modern working worlds in the o/ffice that ful/fill the needs of a more /flexible and hybrid way of working. In addition, the initiative is dealing with, for example, the question of how working practices will change the culture of cooperation and leadership.\n\nAt ED, the main focus in 2020 was placed on the further development of the corporate culture under the motto of 'Shaping the future together' to re/flect the following values: a pioneering spirit, responsibility, simplicity, sincerity and enthusiasm. PRE focused on new online platforms for digital communication. SWD continued its company-wide management dialog on the themes of leadership in transition and project management guidelines and started the 'Working world of the future' initiative. A transformation and innovation campus and a task force have been set up at VNG. They will work on the theme of future collaboration in a changing working environment.\n\nEmployer brand and recruiting: A prerequisite for our future growth is securing new talent. The aim is to recruit 4,500 new employees across the Group by 2023. In November 2020, we started an employer campaign under the motto 'We are the E' or 'I am the E.' The aim of this campaign is to make EnBW more well-known nationwide as an employer and to also increase the attractiveness of EnBW as an employer.\n\nWe continuously optimize our recruiting processes to improve e/fficiency and place a greater focus on applicants. For example,\n\nwe have signi/ficantly reduced the length of the process for appointing a new employee. Our new applicant management system also supports the development of more e/fficient internal processes and the improved documentation of key recruiting /figures that are critical to success. During the application process, we hold more interviews via videoconference, while the Welcome Days to introduce new employees were also being held in virtual form.\n\nIn 2020, our subsidiaries ED, PRE, SWD and VNG worked on improving their recruitment processes via their websites and other online channels, such as social networks, and on further digitalizing  their  application  processes  and  optimizing  the onboarding processes.\n\nLeadership and skills: The growth of our company is closely linked to the personal development of every individual and the collective development of the management team. Therefore, we have de/fined eight key 'future skills.' Alongside professional expertise, they describe the skills we feel are necessary and form the new competency model for the management team. They will be established across EnBW in a slightly amended form as the new competency model for all employees in 2021.\n\nAs part of the 'Leadership Development Journey' program, around 235 managers discussed and examined these future skills, their own individual development and the requirements of modern leadership in depth in 36 digital workshops. In the 'Next Level Leadership' format, around 1,200 EnBW employees and managers also took part in virtual training courses to promote their personal development in 2020. The main focus was the theme of resilience in order to support employees with the huge changes to their working conditions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. A quali/fication program has also been created that is speci/fically designed to provide support to employees who are taking on new, agile leadership roles.\n\nThe talent development program 'SP4RK for Pioneers,' which was launched in 2019, combines the development of talent with the development of innovative business models. In the /first phase of the program, talent from across the entire company worked for several months in cross-functional teams on projects with  a  start-up  character  in  order  to  identify  strategically relevant business models. Furthermore, we have developed the digital learning and development platform 'LernWerk' (Learning Factory) that allows EnBW employees to independently shape their own development. The /first version of the platform was tested at the beginning of 2021, and it will be gradually rolled out.\n\nAt our key subsidiaries, there was a focus on further training and education programs with an increased use of digital media. In addition, ED established a new organization development department to accompany the transformation project for the development of a joint leadership culture that was started in the previous year. For the /first time, employee appraisals will be used as the basis for developing a HR development strategy for the entire ED Group. SWD started a cross-mentoring program with other companies in D\u00fcsseldorf for 'Women in leadership' and a quali/fication program 'Time for leadership' that includes",

        "page_content": "As a result of these promotions and structural changes, the proportion of women in upper management fell from 17.2% to 14.5%. We will develop measures based on the HR strategy to achieve the set targets.\n\nIn addition, our Executive Group has been extended to form a Global Management Board. This board works strategically at the level below the Board of Management and has been enlarged from 60 executives to around 100 members to achieve greater diversity. The 100 members now include about 20 women - previously just two women - as well as representatives from the areas of digitalization and internationalization. The English-language Intranet page 'EnBW World' has been launched for our international colleagues and employees who have links with activities abroad.\n\nHR processes, services & digitalization: There were four main areas of focus related to this theme in 2020: customer-oriented revision and digitalization of HR forms, the introduction of electronic signatures for employment contract management, the development of a digital platform for contact with applicants and the introduction of robotic process automation (RPA) for standard processes in HR services.\n\n## Other issues\n\nEnBW developed very positively from an economic perspective in 2019 and achieved the targets for the 2020 strategy at an early stage. Against this background, it was decided that employees at the Group companies that have corresponding company agreements would receive a pro/fit sharing bonus for 2019, which corresponded to 115% of one month's salary. The Board of Management has announced that a pro/fit sharing bonus will be awarded to employees for 2020, although the amount has not yet been de/fined.\n\nBased on the collective bargaining agreement between the Employers  Association  for  Electricity  Power  Plants  in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and the labor union ver.di from 19 February 2018, the third stage of the agreed wage increases was implemented on 1 July 2020 with a raise of 1.9%. The rates paid to trainees were also raised again by \u20ac50 on this date. The collective bargaining agreement runs until 28 February 2021.\n\nEnBW provides a comprehensive range of services to promote the health of its workforce. We were awarded Excellence status at the Corporate Health Awards for this work in December 2020 and also received an award in the special category of 'Mental Health.' The services provided by health management include preventative medical services, vaccinations such as /flu vaccines, physiotherapy treatments and psychological counseling.\n\nThe sickness ratio stood at 4.3% in 2020 and was thus 0.6 percentage points lower than the /figure in the previous year.\n\ncontent on labor law, leadership methods, feedback and digital leadership. VNG started work on developing a new 180-degree feedback process for its managers that it plans to establish in 2021.\n\nQuali/fication@EnBW: On 31 December 2020, there were a total of 1,163 trainees and students working in the EnBW Group. At Netze BW and EnBW AG, we have begun to align our training methodology to more e/ffective teaching and learning formats as well as to the needs of younger generations. In March 2020, more than 120 trainees, DH students and trainers came together to shape the new learning culture. More than 60 trainers got to experience the /first stage of a learning journey in July. We have also introduced some new learning methods. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, we were still able to employ 1,455 (2019: 1,333) working students and interns in 2020.\n\nAt our key subsidiaries, the main focus was placed on switching over to digital training formats - not least due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. ED also held workshops on strategy and leadership principles and held a leadership forum in a hybrid format for all managers at ED and its investment companies across four sites. PRE set up enhanced functions for its online tests and seminars, as well as for webinars held via online platforms.\n\nDiversity@EnBW: Diversity is a /fixed component of our corporate culture and a key element of the HR strategy. In order to emphasize our commitment to diversity, EnBW participated in, among other things, Christopher Street Day in Stuttgart as in the previous year. The event was held in front of a limited audience and predominantly in virtual form due to the coronavirus pandemic and had the motto 'Diversity needs strengthening.' In addition, we supported the themes of equal opportunities, internationalization and innovative working cultures. For example, EnBW introduced the use of the gender star (an asterisk that is used to form gender-neutral terms in German) for its written communication and published a diversity statement on the Day of Tolerance on 16 November.\n\n## Proportion of women in management positions at EnBW AG\n\n| in %                                         |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| First level below the Board   of Management  |    8.7 |    0   |\n| Second level below the Board   of Management |   14.5 |   17.2 |\n\nThe Board of Management had set the goal of further increasing the proportion of women at both management levels below the Board of Management in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020. At both the /first level (top management) and second level (upper management), the proportion of women should increase to at least 20%. These targets were not yet achieved in 2020, although the proportion of women in top management did increase from 0% to 8.7% due to the promotion of two female managers from upper management to top management.",

This increase was primarily due to taking on new employees in strategic growth /fields. The number of employees in the Renewable Energies segment thus increased due to the expanded activities in the areas of biogas and onshore wind power. In the Grids segment, the increase in the number of employees was due to the importance of the regulated business. However, this increase was o/ffset to some extent by restructuring within the Group. The expansion of the broadband business, increased demand for energy  and  storage  solutions  and  restructuring  measures within the Group led to an increase in the number of employees in the Sales segment. Digitalization and transformation processes increased the number of employees in 'Other,' although these e/ffects were also o/ffset to some extent by restructuring measures within the Group. The employee turnover ratio stood at 5.9% in 2020 and was thus 0.4 percentage points lower than the /figure in the previous year.\n\nFurther performance indicators for employees, such as the regional distribution or age structure of our employees, can be found on our website at www.enbw.com/performance-indicators .\n\n## Occupational safety\n\nIn the area of occupational safety, we have set ourselves the goals of avoiding accidents and work-related illness and creating a safe working environment. The Group guidelines 'Occupational safety and health protection' describe the responsibilities and tasks related to occupational safety and de/fine the processes. The EnBW guidelines for occupational safety and health protection are also described in this document. The Occupational Safety Working Group has the task of regulating issues that a/ffect all companies uniformly within the Group. It is headed by the Chief Technical O/fficer of EnBW and has the power to make binding decisions in accordance with the company's rules of procedure.\n\n## /#TOP LTIF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe key performance indicator LTIF is used to measure the number of LTI according to the de/finition on p. 40. Every Group company included in the consolidated companies for the LTIF receives an individual target from the Board of Management the ful/fillment of this LTIF target /flows into the assessments for\n\nthe achievement of targets in each case. The companies can also set their own individual targets that go beyond those set by the Board of Management.\n\n## Key performance indicator\n\n|                                                        |   2020 |   2019 |   Change   in % | Forecast   2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| LTIF for companies  controlled by the  Group   1, 2, 3 |    2.1 |    2.1 |             0   | \u2264  2,1            |\n| LTIF  overall   1, 2                                   |    3.6 |    3.8 |            -5.3 | \u2264  3,8            |\n\n- 1 LTIF indicates how many LTI occurred per one million working hours performed. Further information on the calculation of this performance indicator can be found on p. 40.\n- 2 Variations in the group of consolidated companies (all companies with more than 100 employees, excluding agency workers and contractors, are generally considered).\n- 3 Except for companies in the area of waste management.\n\nIn  2020,  the  LTIF  for  companies  controlled  by  the  Group remained at a good level in comparison to the previous year. The average days of absence per accident stood at 21.9 (previous year: 19.0) and were within the multi-year range. The LTIF overall fell slightly in comparison to the previous year, while the average days of absence per accident were 22.1 (previous year: 22.0). The LTIF overall includes subsidiaries in the area of waste management. However, the number of accidents in this area is at a good level in comparison to other companies in the sector.\n\nThe measures for achieving targets are independently de/fined by the Group companies. Various di/fferent activities focusing on occupational safety were carried out in 2020:\n\nWe work continuously on minimizing danger in the workplace, which  could  result  in  accidents  or  work-related  illnesses, through training and programs of measures. In 2020, the main focus of the work relating to occupational safety was placed on the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences. As an energy supply company, EnBW forms a part of Germany's critical infrastructure. Therefore, we established a task force at the beginning of 2020 that included representatives from all relevant areas of the company and took measures to guarantee the reliable supply of energy. The main points were:\n\n- \u203a Organizational measures to avoid the spread of infection within the company and to guarantee the reliable operation of the energy supply\n- \u203a Procurement of equipment protecting against the coronavirus - such as masks, disposable gloves, disposable overalls and protective goggles\n- \u203a Production of hand sanitizer according to the WHO formula\n- \u203a Creating the technical and organizational conditions to allow the majority of employees to work safely from home\n- \u203a Creating risk assessments with respect to the coronavirus\n- \u203a Preparing e-learning modules about the new coronavirus rules\n- \u203a Detailed occupational health advice for employees (also psychological)\n\nIn 2020, Netze BW implemented various measures to further improve occupational safety and health protection:",

A permanent EnKK working group assessed measures for protecting against the coronavirus pandemic, coordinating closely with the coronavirus task force at EnBW. Compliance with the measures by the company's own employees and those from partner companies is encouraged and monitored by all employees and managers - supported by daily checks carried out by a hygiene team.\n\nAt SWD, inspections and obligatory instruction and training courses (e.g., on respiratory protection, /first aid) took place in the course of regular occupational safety and health protection measures. In addition, a new module on hazardous substance management came into force in the specialist departments.

The regulations for large corporations apply.\n\nThe /financial statements as audited by the Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtscha/f\\_tspr\u00fcfungsgesellscha/f\\_t, as well as the management report of EnBW AG contained in the Group management report, will be published in the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).\n\n## Results of operations of EnBW AG\n\n## Condensed income statement of EnBW AG\n\n| in \u20ac million   1                   | 2020      | 2019      | Change   in %   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Revenue                            | 37,943.8  | 38,220.6  | -0.7            |\n| Cost of materials                  | -36,959.1 | -37,385.9 | -1.1            |\n| Amortization and depreciation      | -300.9    | -569.3    | -47.1           |\n| Other operating result             | -804.3    | -39.6     | -               |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes | -120.5    | 225.8     | -               |\n| Financial result                   | 315.2     | -29.3     | -               |\n| Tax                                | -36.8     | 84.1      | -               |\n| Net profit                         | 157.9     | 280.6     | -43.7           |\n\nEnBW AG reported an annual net pro/fit of \u20ac157.9 million. The decrease in comparison to the previous year was mainly in/fluenced by \u20ac346.3 million lower earnings before interest and taxes, the increase in the /financial result of \u20ac344.5 million and the decrease in tax of \u20ac120.9 million.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes of EnBW AG is primarily determined by the revenues generated from electricity and gas sales, as well as by the associated cost of materials. The decrease in revenue of \u20ac276.8 million was o/ffset by a decrease in the cost of materials of \u20ac426.8 million.\n\nRevenue (a/f\\_ter the deduction of electricity and energy taxes) of \u20ac37,943.8 million primarily includes revenue from electricity sales of \u20ac14,134.8 million and gas sales of \u20ac22,239.6 million. Electricity and gas sales comprise both the trading business, involving deliveries to trading partners and stock exchanges, and sales activities in the form of the direct delivery of energy to end customers.\n\nThe trading business recorded a slight decrease in revenue in 2020 of \u20ac223.4 million to \u20ac35,651.3 million. The higher trading volume in the gas sector could not fully compensate for the drop in market prices in the gas sector. The decrease in revenue\n\nwas  also  o/ffset  by  the  decrease  in  the  cost  of  materials  of \u20ac111.8 million to \u20ac34,603.1 million.\n\nRevenues from sales activities were split into \u20ac1,669.3 million for electricity and \u20ac195.4 million for gas, which represented an overall drop of \u20ac4.4 million.\n\nIn the retail and end customer sector (B2C), electricity sales of 6.5 billion kWh were 0.4 billion kWh lower than the level in the previous year due to the slight decrease in the contract portfolio. The increase in energy sector costs was passed on to customers in the electricity business segment, which resulted in higher revenues. Gas sales decreased in the same period to 3.8 billion kWh due to the temperature and the slight decrease in the contract portfolio, and were 0.3 billion kWh lower than the previous year. Due to the developments in sales described above, revenue in the gas business fell.\n\nSales to business customers (B2B) includes supplying customers within the Group and redistributors and holding reserve supplies for B2B customers. Sales in the B2B electricity business fell by 0.3 billion kWh to 0.2 billion kWh due primarily to the decrease in sales to redistributors. Gas sales to business customers remained constant at 0.2 billion kWh in the same period.\n\nFor statements that are necessary to understand the position of EnBW AG and that are not explicitly described in the following sections, especially those relating to the strategy of the company and economic and political conditions, please refer to the information provided for the EnBW Group (p. 34 ff. and 57 ff.) . The full /financial statements of EnBW AG are available for download at (www.enbw.com/report2020-downloads).\n\nThe annual net pro/fit, which indicates the company's ability to pay  a  dividend,  is  an  important  performance  indicator  for EnBW AG.",

This was o/ffset to some extent by an increase in interest expenses for back taxes of \u20ac35.7 million, the accrual of tax provisions of \u20ac24.0 million in the previous year and an increase  in  interest  expenses  for  subordinated  bonds  of \u20ac11.9 million.\n\nThe tax expense in the /financial year was \u20ac36.8 million, while there was a positive tax result of \u20ac84.1 million in the previous year. The taxes mainly comprise allocations to the provisions for tax audit risks of \u20ac46.0 million. In the previous year, there was a reversal of provisions for tax audit risks of \u20ac107.0 million and positive e/ffects from out-of-period taxes of \u20ac29.2 million.

        "page_content": "The net assets of EnBW AG as of 31 December 2020 are signi/ficantly in/fluenced by the non-current assets (particularly the /financial assets), the receivables and other assets. These are primarily o/ffset by non-current liabilities, current liabilities to a/ffiliated entities, current liabilities for a subordinated bond and provisions relating to nuclear power and for pensions and similar  obligations.\n\nFinancial assets primarily consist of shares in a/ffiliated entities of \u20ac14,839.7 million, securities held as non-current assets of \u20ac2,720.5  million  and  investments  of  \u20ac1,346.1  million.  The increase in /financial assets of \u20ac561.7 million mainly comprises additions to loans to a/ffiliated entities. In addition, shares in a/ffiliated entities included payments into the capital reserve, capital repatriation at subsidiaries and reversals to impairment losses, primarily at EnBW Holding A.S.\n\nTrade receivables to the amount of \u20ac819.9 million mainly comprise  receivables  from  trading  activities  and  consumption accruals for electricity and gas deliveries not yet invoiced, and were \u20ac104.2 million above the /figure in the previous year.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of EnBW AG totaling \u20ac413.7 million largely consist of bank deposits, which are invested as time deposits to the amount of \u20ac50.0 million. More details on the development of this item can be found in the section 'Financial position of EnBW AG.'\n\nThe increase in prepaid expenses of \u20ac302.2 million was primarily due to earnings components from futures as a result of the increased trading volumes.\n\nThe provisions for pensions and similar obligations held by EnBW AG to the amount of \u20ac5,800.4 million combine obligations from the company pension scheme and other company agreements made by major subsidiaries and EnBW AG. The resulting annual expenses for retirement bene/fits are paid by the subsidiaries concerned in each case. The increase in the provisions for pensions and similar obligations of \u20ac514.6 million was mainly due to the e/ffect of the further decrease in the discount rate as in the previous year. In addition, provisions relating to nuclear power of \u20ac3,844.1 million are disclosed, which are formed to ful/fill public law obligations and requirements in the operating licenses.\n\nOf the liabilities totaling \u20ac12,483.0 million, \u20ac7,090.7 million have a residual term of more than one year. Overall, there are liabilities of \u20ac7,532.3 million to a/ffiliated entities, which primarily result from intercompany settlement transactions within the framework of centralized /financial and liquidity management, as well as from loan agreements.\n\nThe total increase in liabilities of \u20ac388.8 million was mainly attributable to the increase in liabilities to a/ffiliated entities and to investments of \u20ac189.1 million. This was o/ffset to some extent by repayments totaling \u20ac310.5 million to bank loans.\n\nNon-current liabilities exist to the amount of \u20ac3,700.9 million to EnBW International Finance B.V. as part of the Debt Issuance Program (DIP) (Glossary, from p. 138) , of which \u20ac2,492.6 million is from the issuing of six subordinated bonds and \u20ac527.3 million from loan agreements with credit institutions. The main changes in comparison to the previous year were the issuing of one green subordinated bond with a total volume of \u20ac500.0 million.\n\nThe aim is to cover the non-current pension and nuclear provisions with appropriate /financial assets within an economically feasible time period. Overall, /financial assets of \u20ac22,687.3 million are o/ffset by long-term debt of \u20ac16,233.0 million.\n\nThe liquidity of EnBW AG on the reporting date guarantees the solvency of the company for the payment of current liabilities from the operating business.\n\n## Financial position of EnBW AG\n\nIn  comparison  to  the  reporting  date  in  the  previous  year, the liquidity of EnBW AG increased from \u20ac169.5 million by \u20ac244.2 million to \u20ac413.7 million.\n\nThe cash /flows of EnBW AG fundamentally arise from both its own operating business and also the operating business of the subsidiaries which balance payments received and made via the bank accounts of EnBW AG as part of the intercompany cash pooling system (Glossary, from p. 138) within the framework of central /financing and liquidity management.\n\nImportant business transactions that had an e/ffect on the /financial position of EnBW AG in the /financial year are summarized below:\n\nIn the /financial year, there was investment of \u20ac346.1 million, mainly in the area of renewable energies. In contrast, there were cash in/flows from /financial assets of \u20ac740.1 million.\n\nIn addition, a green subordinated bond with a volume of \u20ac494.8 million and two new bonds with a volume of \u20ac994.4 million were issued via EnBW International Finance B.V. This was o/ffset to some extent by repayments totaling \u20ac310.5 million to bank loans.\n\nThere was a cash out/flow of \u20ac608.5 million in connection with the utilization of the nuclear power and pension provisions.\n\nAnother business transaction with a material impact on liquidity was the settling of the EEG credit line of \u20ac656.0 million.\n\nA total of \u20ac189.6 million was distributed to the shareholders of EnBW AG in dividends.\n\nThis was o/ffset to some extent with an impact on liquidity by the receipt of dividends of \u20ac171.8 million.",

As a vertically integrated energy supply company in the sense of EnWG, EnBW AG engages in activities in electricity distribution, activities in gas distribution, other activities within the electricity sector, other activities within the gas sector and other activities outside of the electricity and gas sectors in accordance with section 6 b (3) sentence 3 and sentence 4 EnWG.\n\n## EnBW share and dividend policy\n\nAs a result of the small proportion of EnBW shares in free /float (www.enbw.com/shareholder-structure) , events on the /financial markets and the development of the DAX generally only have a minor in/fluence on the development of the EnBW share price. The price of EnBW shares was \u20ac52.00 at the start of 2020 and stood at \u20ac56.00 by the end of the year (www.enbw.com/stock-chart) .\n\nThe transformation of the portfolio up to the end of 2020 and the strategic further development of the company as an infrastructure partner by the end of 2025 create the foundations for the future viability of EnBW. The trust placed in EnBW by shareholders is based on this value generated by the company. EnBW manages the development of value using ROCE. The /financial pro/file will be maintained using the debt repayment potential from the 2021 /financial year onwards. EnBW strives to generally pay a dividend payout ratio of between 40% and 60% of adjusted Group net pro/fit. Based on the annual net pro/fit of EnBW AG of \u20ac157.9 million and taking into account the pro/fit carried forward of \u20ac194.0 million, there are retained earnings of \u20ac351.9 million for the /financial year and thus dividends will be paid for the 2020 /financial year. If approved by the Annual General Meeting, the dividend to be distributed for the 2020 /financial year will be \u20ac1.00 per share. This corresponds to a dividend payout ratio of 40%.\n\n## Overall assessment of the economic situation and development of EnBW AG\n\nIn our judgment, the development of the results of operations, /financial position and net assets of EnBW AG as of 31 December 2020  is  satisfactory  a/f\\_ter  taking  into  account  the  e/ffects described below that are not relevant to the ongoing management of the company. In the previous year, an annual net loss of \u20ac250 million was expected in 2020. The annual net pro/fit for 2020 stands at \u20ac157.9 million and was signi/ficantly in/fluenced by e/ffects not relevant to the ongoing management of the company, which arose both at EnBW AG itself and at its subsidiaries which had an impact on EnBW AG due to pro/fit and loss transfer agreements.\n\nThe main e/ffects not relevant to the ongoing management of the company were higher interest expenses for pension provisions  and  provisions  relating  to  nuclear  power  totaling \u20ac566.2 million (\u20ac523.7 million of which is reported as interest expenses of EnBW AG) resulting from the drop in the discount rate, and which were \u20ac33.8 million lower than expected. Furthermore, additions to the provisions relating to nuclear power of \u20ac112.1 million (of which \u20ac87.4 million was reported as cost of materials of EnBW AG) had a negative e/ffect. Other negative e/ffects arose from impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment totaling \u20ac64.3 million.\n\nThis was o/ffset to some extent by income from the disposal of assets and the sale of investments of \u20ac378.2 million, reversals of impairment losses on /financial assets of \u20ac43.6 million and tax e/ffects of \u20ac37.6 million.\n\nBased on the annual net pro/fit of \u20ac157.9 million and taking into account the pro/fit carried forward of \u20ac194.0 million, there are retained earnings of \u20ac351.9 million.\n\nWe expect a break-even annual net result in 2021. The result will be negatively in/fluenced by high interest expenses for non-current provisions. As a result of the low-interest phase, the average interest rate will fall further in the future. In the 2021 /financial year, we expect that e/ffects not relevant to the ongoing management of the company will in total negatively impact earnings by around \u20ac650 million. We also expect these negative e/ffects on earnings to be o/ffset to some extent by positive e/ffects not relevant to the ongoing management of the company of around \u20ac50 million. Adjusted for these e/ffects, the annual net pro/fit will be around \u20ac600 million.\n\nWe anticipate that the negative impact on earnings caused by the fall in the average interest rate will be smaller in 2022. Based on the assumption that the average interest rate will fall to a lesser extent, we expect a negative impact on earnings of around \u20ac400 million.\n\nThe amount that is ineligible for distribution as dividends, which primarily comprises the valuation of the provisions for pension obligations, is expected to be around \u20ac650 million as of 31 December 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Overall assessment of the economic situation of the Group\n\nThe energy sector is experiencing a period of great upheaval. There is particular pressure for change due to the Energiewende. However, digitalization, sector coupling and the desire of local authorities to become self-su/fficient are also having a strong in/fluence on the sector. The coronavirus pandemic underscores the  huge  importance  of  supply  reliability  and  has  focused greater attention once again on the task of the energy companies to supply power. The Coal Phase-out Act passed in 2020 requires that coal-/fired power generation is completely phased out in Germany by 2038 at the latest, while the last nuclear power plant will be disconnected from the grid in Germany in 2022. Against this background, energy supply companies are being forced to examine their business models so that they are able to exploit the potential of the changing market environment and realign their strategies for the future.\n\nWe developed our EnBW 2020 strategy eight years ago as a consequence of the Energiewende and have worked to implement it in a resolute and disciplined manner, with huge commitment from all involved. We have now fully achieved almost all of the targets in our EnBW 2020 strategy and reached many of them earlier than planned, which we view as a huge success. The new strategy period up to 2025 will place the focus on the infrastructure aspects of our business activities. Organized in three new strategic business /fields, we want to further strengthen our pro/fitability and continuously improve our sustainability performance at the same time. In autumn 2020, we launched a comprehensive sustainability program whose central aim is to make the company climate neutral with respect to our own emissions by 2035.\n\nThe operating business developed overall in 2020 as expected and  forecast  at  the  start  of  the  year:  The  adjusted  EBITDA increased by 14.3% in comparison to the previous year. The result in the Sales segment exceeded the forecast that had been adjusted during the year. All other segments achieved a result within their forecasted range. The result in the Grids segment remained at the high level achieved in the previous year. A volume-related drop in earnings from the distribution grids was o/ffset by higher revenue from the use of the electricity and gas transmission grids. In the Renewable Energies segment, the result improved signi/ficantly. The EnBW  Hohe See and EnBW Albatros wind farms have been contributing to earnings since they were commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2019 and since the /first quarter of 2020, respectively, while Valeco has been contributing to earnings since the third quarter of 2019. In addition, better wind conditions had a positive e/ffect and the electricity delivered from our hydropower plants was sold on the forward market at higher wholesale market prices. In comparison to the previous year, the result in the Generation and Trading segment improved. The reasons for this development were higher wholesale market prices for our electricity deliveries and earnings contributions from trading activities. Overall, the  Grids  and  Renewable  Energies  segments  accounted  for more than three quarters of our adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe loss reported for the non-operating EBITDA decreased in 2020  in  comparison  to  the  previous  year  by  37.0%  from \u20ac187.3 million to \u20ac117.9 million. This was mainly due to an adjustment to the nuclear provisions.\n\nIn total, the Group net pro/fit attributable to the shareholders of EnBW AG decreased from \u20ac734.2 million in 2019 to \u20ac596.1 million in the reporting year. Earnings per share amounted to \u20ac2.20, compared to \u20ac2.71 in the previous year.\n\nThe /financial position of the company remains sound. Solvency was ensured at all times throughout the 2020 /financial year thanks to the company's available liquidity and its internal /financing capability, as well as external sources available for /financing. We issued two corporate bonds, one at the beginning of April and one in the middle of October 2020, each with a volume of \u20ac500 million. At the end of June 2020, we issued a green subordinate bond that also had a volume of \u20ac500 million, the proceeds of which were used in their entirety to re/finance the French wind and solar company Valeco. In addition, we agreed a sustainability-linked syndicated credit line with a consortium of 18 banks in June 2020 that has a volume of \u20ac1.5 billion. The /financing costs are tied to the sustainability performance of EnBW for the /first time. The adjusted retained cash /flow reached the forecasted range of \u20ac1.9 billion to \u20ac2.0 billion in the reporting year, while the internal /financing capability exceeded the target value of \u2265100% in 2020. ROCE stood at 6.3% and thus exceeded expectations for the 2020 /financial year.\n\nIn the customers and society goal dimension, our Reputation Index improved signi/ficantly in 2020 in comparison to the previous year, not only within the target group of investors but also among opinion leaders and the wider public. The satisfaction of EnBW and Yello customers was once again high in 2020. As in the previous year, supply reliability remained at a very good level in 2020. In the environment goal dimension, the expansion of renewable energies continued according to plan. The CO 2 intensity of our own electricity generation reduced signi/ficantly in comparison to the previous year, which was due to, among other things, the EnBW Hohe See and EnBW Albatros o/ffshore wind farms and the reduction in electricity generation from our fossil fuel-/fired power plants caused by market-driven developments. In the employees goal dimension, the newly introduced People Engagement Index (PEI) achieved a high level in comparison with other companies. In the area of occupational safety, the LTIF for companies controlled by the Group in 2020 remained at a low level as in the previous year, while the LTIF overall fell slightly in comparison to the previous year.\n\nIn the estimation of the Board of Management, the operating business of our company developed positively in 2020. The operating result increased as expected. EnBW is also on the right track in the non-/financial goal dimensions.",

In order to make the transmission of renewable energies from the north to the south of Germany possible, funds have been allocated to the transmission grid for the realization of two HVDC projects (Glossary, from p. 138) ULTRANET and SuedLink that involve our subsidiary TransnetBW and are part of the Network Development Plan (Glossary, from p. 138) . In addition, extensive investment in the expansion and upgrading of the existing grids is planned by our grid subsidiaries.\n\nAround 28% of the investment is planned for the Sustainable generation infrastructure segment and for other investment (other investment: 2%). 24% of the investment will be on growth themes. Investment of around \u20ac1.7 billion for the expansion of renewable energies is planned for the period 2021 to 2023, which corresponds  to  20%  of  the  gross  investment.  The  planned investment in renewable energies includes funds for the realization of further o/ffshore wind farms, such as our EnBW He Dreiht wind farm in the German North Sea, and for further o/ffshore  projects  in  Great  Britain.  In  addition,  investment  is planned for the construction of onshore wind farms to achieve a total capacity of 1,500 MW at home and abroad by 2023 and for photovoltaic parks (including the two solar parks Gottesgabe and Alttrebbin, each with a capacity of around 150 MW p , by the end of 2021) from our comprehensive project pipeline (p. 46 ) . Furthermore, the investment planned in the 'Sustainable generation infrastructure' segment includes the construction of a gas turbine power plant in Marbach am Neckar as special technical equipment for grids (Glossary,  from  p.  138) . The groundbreaking ceremony was held in October 2020. Other investment mainly involves investment in the central IT system and /financial investments in minority shareholdings.\n\nThe investment program of the EnBW Group thus supports our strategy of expanding renewable energies and ensuring security of supply in the regulated areas of the transmission and distribution grids, as well as the expansion of charging infrastructure for the bene/fit of electromobility.\n\nThe total investment volume of around \u20ac8.4 billion between 2021 and 2023 will be accompanied by divestitures of around \u20ac0.7 billion. These include divestitures in the onshore and photovoltaic sectors, which will build on our already realized participation models. The remaining divestitures will involve the receipt of construction cost subsidies and the participation model 'EnBW connects.' This local authority participation model is attracting a great deal of interest from local authorities (p. 78).\n\nThe balance of gross investment and divestitures gives the net investment, which is \u20ac7.7 billion or \u20ac2.6 billion on average per year.\n\n## Forecast\n\nIn our forecast we take a look, insofar as is possible, at the expected future growth and development of EnBW in the years 2021 to 2023. Due to the changes in segment reporting from the 2021 /financial year, the forecast will focus on the development of the future segments 'Smart infrastructure for customers,' 'System  critical  infrastructure'  and  'Sustainable  generation infrastructure' (p. 26 f.).\n\nThe expected economic, political and regulatory conditions are presented in the chapter 'General conditions' (p. 57 ff.). Potential factors in/fluencing the forecast are described in detail in the 'Report on opportunities and risks' (p. 100 ff.).\n\n## Expected trends in the finance and strategy goal dimensions\n\n## Investment over a three-year period\n\nIn order to continue to play an active role in shaping the Energiewende, gross investment of \u20ac8.4 billion is planned for the 2021 to 2023 period. This represents on average \u20ac2.8 billion per year. \u20ac2.3 billion (27%) of this investment will be on existing projects and \u20ac6.1 billion (73%) on growth projects. The majority of the gross investment (83%) will be in the 'System critical infrastructure' segment and the expansion of renewable energies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAround 10% of the investment is planned for the Smart infrastructure for customers segment, of which approximately 8% will  be  for  growth  investment.  This  investment  is  mainly intended for the expansion of electromobility, as well as for the development of energy solutions.\n\nAround 62% of the investment will /flow into the System critical infrastructure segment, of which growth investment will",

We expect stable earnings in a challenging market environment, even against the backdrop of the ongoing coronavirus  pandemic.  We  thus  anticipate  a  stable  share  of  the adjusted EBITDA for the Group accounted for by this segment.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA of the System critical infrastructure segment will reach the same level in 2021 as in the 2020 /financial year. Revenue from the use of the grids is expected to increase slightly in comparison to the previous year, despite the ongoing coronavirus  pandemic,  as  a  result  of  returns  on  increased investment activity in projects that are included in the Network Development Plan Electricity and Network Development Plan Gas (Glossary, from p. 138) . We expect a stable or slightly de creasing in the share of the adjusted EBITDA for the Group accounted for by this segment.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the Sustainable generation infrastructure segment will increase signi/ficantly in 2021. Renewable energies will contribute around \u20ac900 million to earnings. The further expansion of power plants for the utilization of renewable energies will have a positive impact on the earnings performance. The forecasts for wind yields and thus for the volume of electricity generated are based on the long-term average. As the wind yields in 2020 were below this level, we expect higher earnings in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. In addition, we expect a consistently good trading performance in 2021. The share of the adjusted EBITDA for the Group accounted for by this segment should reach at least the level in the previous year.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the EnBW Group will increase further in 2021 and be between \u20ac2.825 billion and \u20ac2.975 billion. We expect the adjusted EBITDA for the Group to be higher in 2022 than  in  2021.  This  will  be  due  to  the  stabilization  of  and improvement in earnings in all segments.\n\nThe EBITDA in 2021 and 2022 will develop in line with the adjusted EBITDA. We do not make any forecasts relating to material non-operating e/ffects.\n\nThe EBT relevant to remuneration will be between \u20ac1.1 billion to \u20ac1.2 billion in 2021. This is an increase in comparison to the previous year, which will be due to the elimination of negative\n\nnon-operating e/ffects on earnings. A further slight increase in EBT is expected in 2022. The accuracy of the forecast for EBT is, however, dependent on other exogenous factors relevant to the non-operating result that cannot be planned for, such as impairment losses, the reversal of impairment losses or impending losses on onerous contracts for electricity procurement agreements.\n\nAssuming an adjusted EBITDA in the range of \u20ac2.825 billion to \u20ac2.975 billion, we expect to achieve a retained cash /flow (p. 72) of between \u20ac1.6 billion and \u20ac1.7 billion. Adjusted for dividend payments (including payments from investments to third parties) and income tax payments, we expect an FFO (Glossary, from p. 138) relevant to remuneration of between \u20ac2.3 billion and \u20ac2.4 billion. We expect that the retained cash /flow in 2022 will be slightly higher than in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /#TOP Debt repayment potential\n\n## Key performance indicator\n\n|                               | 2021        | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Debt repayment potential in % | 11.5 - 12.5 | -      |\n\nFollowing the transition to the 2025 growth strategy, the key performance  indicator  internal  /financing  capability  will  be replaced by the new key performance indicator debt repayment potential from 2021 on.

We are striving to achieve a value of between 15 and 20 minutes in the 2021 /financial year and subsequent years.\n\n## Expected trends in the environment goal dimension\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2021                        | 2020         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| Installed output of RE in GW and   the share of the generation capacity  accounted for by RE in % | 5.2 - 5.4  /    40.5 - 41.5 | 4.9  /  39.0 |\n| CO 2 intensity  in  g  /  kWh   1, 2                                                              | 0% - 15%                    | 372          |\n\n- 1 Includes redispatch deployment.\n- 2 Nuclear generation is not included in the calculation for the key performance indicator CO\u2082 intensity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /#TOP Installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE\n\nThe installed output of renewable energies and the share of the generation capacity of the Group accounted for by renewable energies will continue to rise in 2021. This increase will be mainly attributable to photovoltaics with the full commissioning of the Weesow-Willmersdorf solar park and the Gottesgabe and Alttrebbin parks that are currently under construction. In addition, we are planning to further expand onshore wind power.  In  subsequent  years,  we  also  expect  a  continuous increase in the installed output of renewable energies. This will thus increase the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE further.\n\nIn the 2021 /financial year, ROCE is expected to be between 5.3% and 6.3% and will thus at best achieve the same level as in the previous year. In general, investments tend to lead at /first to a fall in ROCE as a result of low initial contributions to earnings. This will be the case due to the cost of capital for the planned investment in the grids and o/ffshore wind farms in 2021, which will not yet have a positive e/ffect on earnings, together with an unchanged EBIT. ROCE is expected to stabilize in 2022 at the same level as in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the ROA relevant to remuneration will be between 5.1% and 5.6%. It is thus expected to reach at least the level in the previous year due to the elimination of negative non-operating e/ffects on earnings from 2020. As things currently stand, we expect that the ROA will fall slightly in 2022 in comparison to 2021.\n\n## Expected trends in the customers and society goal dimension\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n|                                                   | 2021                      | 2020        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Reputation Index                                  | 55-58                     | 55.5        |\n| Customer Satisfaction Index   for  EnBW  /  Yello | 127 - 139  /    150 - 161 | 132  /  159 |\n| SAIDI  (electricity)  in  min.  /  year   1       | 15 - 20                   | 15          |\n\n- 1 SAIDI includes all unscheduled interruptions to supply that last more than three minutes for the end consumer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reputation Index\n\nEnBW will strive to improve its reputation continuously and noticeably over the next few years. The Reputation Index is an important non-/financial performance indicator because it is in/fluenced by a whole series of factors that are important to the future viability of our company. The existing reputation management department and stakeholder team at EnBW can recommend measures for optimizing the reputation of the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /#TOP Customer Satisfaction Index\n\nWe continue to expect a high level of competitive pressure in 2021 both from direct competitors within the energy industry and, to an increasing extent, competitors from other sectors that have already entered the energy market or will do so shortly. In addition, exogenous factors could negatively impact customer satisfaction more and more in the future, such as discussions about the future of coal-/fired power generation, the development of state levies, the proposed gradual increase in CO 2 prices up to 2023 included in the German government's climate  action  package,  increasing  costs  or  delays  to  the expansion of the grids.\n\nTo improve the satisfaction of our customers, we are thus also expanding our range of sustainable energy industry services",

The repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic were felt throughout almost the whole of 2020. We expect the conditions to normalize in 2021. Therefore, we anticipate CO 2 intensity in 2021 at the same level as in 2020 in the best-case scenario, and an increase of 15% in the worst-case scenario. In comparison to the reference year of 2018 used for our target of climate neutrality, which was also the last year without extraordinary e/ffects, this forecast corresponds to a reduction in CO 2 intensity of between 20% and 30%.\n\n## Expected trends in the employees goal dimension\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n|                                                       | 2021      |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| People Engagement Index (PEI)   1                     | \u2265  77     |   83   |\n| LTIF for companies controlled by the  Group   2, 3, 4 | 2.0 - 2.2 |    2.1 |\n| LTIF  overall   2, 3                                  | 3.6 - 3.8 |    3.6 |\n\n- 1 Variations in the group of consolidated companies (all companies with more than 100 employees are generally considered [except ITOs]).\n- 2 LTIF indicates how many LTI occurred per one million working hours performed.

However, it is probable that this very good result re/flects the fact that\n\nemployees have attached too much importance to the company's handling of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in their positive assessment. An international benchmark index compiled using similar questions at numerous companies from various di/fferent sectors stood at 74 points in 2020. Taking into account this global benchmark score and the extraordinary e/ffect of the coronavirus pandemic on this index in 2020, we are striving to achieve a target value for the PEI of at least 77 points in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /#TOP LTIF\n\nWe are committed to our goal of continuously improving occupational safety within the company for both our own employees and those of our partner companies who carry out work on behalf of EnBW. Therefore, we have implemented numerous accident  prevention  measures.  Our  activities  in  2020  were highly in/fluenced by the coronavirus pandemic. As a critical infrastructure company, we have a responsibility to ensure a reliable supply of energy. The coronavirus pandemic will also have a big impact on safe and healthy working practices in 2021. Irrespective of this challenge, we are still striving to continuously reduce both the LTIF for companies controlled by the Group and LTIF overall.\n\n## Overall assessment of anticipated developments by the management\n\nWe anticipate a further increase in the adjusted EBITDA for the Group in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. The share of earnings accounted for by the 'Sustainable generation infrastructure' segment will increase signi/ficantly in the process. We will always strive to maintain a balanced /financing structure, solid /financial pro/file and thus solid investment-grade ratings (Glossary, from p. 138) . With respect to our non-/financial key performance indicators, we expect a stable to positive development in 2021 - with the exception of the People Engagement Index (PEI), which was subject to extraordinary e/ffects in 2020.",

The iRM aims, through a holistic and integrated approach, to e/ffectively and e/fficiently identify, evaluate and manage opportunities and risks (including monitoring) and report on the opportunity and risk position, as well as to ensure the appropriateness and functionality of related processes. Risk management involves measures for avoiding, reducing or transferring risk through adequate accounting provisions, as well as measures for managing risk tolerance. For this purpose, we de/fine an opportunity  /  risk as an event that might\n\ncause  a  potential  over-attainment  /  non-attainment  of  strategic  / sustainability, operational, /financial and compliance goals in the future. The iRM process also takes into account the guidelines for a non-/financial declaration. In order to identify and categorize opportunities and risks, the opportunity and risk map that is well-known throughout the Group is utilized. The risk map is used to explicitly consider possible opportunities and risks that a/ffect the sustainable orientation of our company. As well as focusing on the ful/fillment of the requirements for a non-/financial declaration, the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (Glossary, from p. 138) are also taken into account.",

Alongside legal regulations and audit requirements, digitalization and the quality of the methods used are particularly important. A quantitative assessment of opportunities and risk is facilitated by question-based collection methods. A Group-wide tool to validate opportunities and risks also supports paperless processing.\n\n## Structure and processes of the integrated opportunity and risk management system\n\n## Structure and process of the iRM system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  structures  and  processes  of  the  iRM  are  well-known throughout the Group. The central risk management & ICS functional unit is responsible for specifying methods, processes and systems for the whole Group, determining the opportunity and risk position of the Group and for reporting. The central steering body is the risk committee, which - with the involvement of specially selected units  /  companies - is responsible for clarifying relevant issues from various Group perspectives, as well as for determining the top opportunities  /  risks.\n\nThe iRM is tested annually by the Group auditing department with a focus on di/fferent main themes each year and the results of the test are then presented to the Supervisory Board in the form of a so-called e/ffectiveness report. All opportunities and risks are initially assessed with the help of the iRM relevance\n\n/filter before and a/f\\_ter consideration has been taken of both implemented and envisaged management instruments. In the process, they are allocated to one of seven relevance categories on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria for each of the  four  dimensions:  'strategic  /  sustainability,'  'operational,' '/financial' and 'compliance.'\n\nOpportunities and risks are evaluated within the medium-term planning period. As long as a /financial valuation of the opportunities and risks is possible, they are allocated to relevance classes 0 to 4 if they have a value in the range of less than \u20ac0.2 million up to less than \u20ac50 million within the medium-term planning period. From relevance class 5 and above and with a probability of occurrence of over 50%, the opportunities and risks are generally included in the Group report on opportunities and risks. This corresponds to \u20ac50 million within the medium-term planning period. The top risks  /  opportunities and the long-term opportunities and risks that are of particular importance are then added. The reports are submitted on a quarterly basis in standardized form. In the case of any signi/ficant changes, a special report is immediately issued.\n\nThose opportunities or risks relevant to the Group report on opportunities and risks are generally evaluated in relation to the current planning period using quantitative methods (e.g., scenario techniques and distribution functions) for the purpose of stochastic modeling. Any possible e/ffects on the adjusted EBITDA, ROCE (via any impact on the adjusted EBIT and capital employed) and the debt repayment potential (via any impact on the retained cash /flow and net debt) are considered. Further explanations of our /financial terms can be found in the chapter 'Strategy, goals and performance management system' on p. 39 and in the Glossary,  from  p.  138 . Alongside these /financial e/ffects, opportunities and risks can also have impacts on the other key performance indicators (p. 38 ff.) , which are discussed with those responsible in the specialist areas.\n\nAny opportunities and risks with a probability of occurrence of up to 50% are subject to an individual review to determine whether they should be taken into account in the next planning session. Opportunities and risks with a probability of occurrence of over 50% are generally taken into account in the planning process and, as far as possible, appropriate accounting measures are taken in the consolidated /financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\n\nAlongside the top opportunities  /  risks, there are a wide variety of other opportunities and risks facing the Group that are allocated to the respective risk category on the opportunity and risk map (p. 100) and evaluated with the aid of the iRM relevance /filter. Alongside the key performance indicators in the /finance and strategy goal dimensions, these e/ffects can also have an impact on the key performance indicators in the customers and society, environment and employees goal dimensions. Any impact on the areas of compliance, social engagement and procurement is also examined in the process.",

In order to guarantee that this ICS is e/ffective, the appropriateness and functionality of the Groupwide control mechanisms are tested regularly at the level of the individual companies and at a Group level.\n\nIf any existing weaknesses are identi/fied in the control system and are considered relevant to the /financial statements, they are remedied. This accounting-related ICS methodology is based on the COSO II standard.\n\nOnce the control mechanisms have reached a standardized and monitored degree of maturity, and no material control weaknesses can be identi/fied, the accounting-related ICS is deemed to be e/ffective. The materiality of control weaknesses is measured as the probability of occurrence and the extent to which there could be a potential misstatement in connection with those /financial statement items concerned. The accounting-related risk management system de/fines measures for identifying and assessing risks that jeopardize the preparation of compliant /financial statements as part of the accounting- related ICS.\n\nDespite having established an ICS, there is no absolute certainty that it will attain its objectives or that it will be complete. In\n\nindividual cases, the e/ffectiveness of the ICS can be impaired by unforeseeable changes in the control environment, fraud or human error.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe accounting-related ICS at EnBW is organized at both a centralized and decentralized level. All key companies, business units and functional units have an ICS o/fficer. These o/fficers monitor the e/ffectiveness of the ICS and evaluate any control weaknesses that may arise. A report on the e/ffectiveness of the ICS is prepared on an annual basis. The ICS o/fficer at Group level assists  the  companies  /  units  with  the  implementation  of standardized procedures and also consolidates collected data.\n\n## Process\n\nStandardized procedures are used to ensure completeness and consistency in the preparation of the /financial statements and /financial reporting. The accounting-related ICS de/fines controls designed to ensure compliance with the accounting policies used by the Group, as well as procedures and deadlines for the individual accounting and consolidation processes. During the Group consolidation process, the rigorous implementation of the four-eye principle is observed, while random samples and deviation analyses improve quality. An annual control cycle monitors whether the documentation is up to date and also checks the appropriateness and functionality of the controls. In addition, it identi/fies and evaluates any control weaknesses that may arise.",

        "page_content": "A risk-based selection process de/fines the companies  /  units, signi/ficant items in the /financial statements and processes including their associated control measures that are relevant.\n\nThe de/fined processes and controls are recorded in a central documentation system. The e/ffectiveness of the various control activities is then assessed. If any control weaknesses are identi/fied, their e/ffect on the /financial statements is evaluated. The results are reported at both company or unit level and at Group level. Furthermore, the Group auditing department  performs ICS reviews as part of its risk-oriented audit planning.\n\n## Non-financial declaration\n\nAs part of the non-/financial declaration, we closely analyze the related opportunities and risks in the areas of compliance, social engagement, and procurement, as well as in the customers and society, environment and employees goal dimensions. In order to guarantee that the requirements for a non-/financial declaration are ful/filled, the established iRM methods and the associated process are used. In this context, the iRM also identi/fies opportunities and risks relating to climate protection and thus provides important impetus for the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (Glossary, from p. 138) . You can /find further information on this subject on p. 122.\n\n## Risks associated with the non-financial declaration\n\nThe non-/financial declaration describes, among other things, the fundamental opportunities and risks connected with the EnBW business model and the activities based upon it that could have a possible impact on one of the individual issues. Material individual risks with a very high probability of a serious negative impact in relation to any of the following issues do not exist at EnBW.\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe observance of relevant legal regulations and internal company rules forms the basis of our business activities. Managing compliance risks at EnBW (with a main focus on corruption, antitrust and data protection risks) is the task of the compliance management system, which comprises regular risk assessments of this type. Risks related to /fighting corruption and bribery are addressed on p. 43 f. in a cross-segment manner.\n\n## Social engagement\n\nThere are no risks in the area of social engagement. In fact, we take our social responsibility for civic and social engagement seriously (p. 47 f.) .\n\n## Procurement\n\nSustainable procurement - purchasing: In the area of procurement, risks cannot be excluded due to increasing levels of complexity and the large number of suppliers. Purchasing utilizes an active risk management system, counters procurement risks and  implements  the  necessary  measures  for  safeguarding against  and  avoiding  risk.  These  risks  are  managed  using de/fined processes and, especially in this area, through the prequali/fication process (p. 53 f.) .\n\nRaw materials procurement - coal and gas: In the area of raw materials procurement and thus in the associated supply chain, there are above all potential human rights and environmental risks. In the procurement of raw materials, a multi-stage process is used to check whether human rights and environmental standards are being observed. All coal suppliers and also potential suppliers are regularly subjected to a screening process. The activities carried out for the procurement of coal are currently being implemented for gas procurement. Other measures that form part of the assessment are carried out in direct cooperation with the compliance department.\n\nIn coal mining and the production of natural gas, there are possible human rights risks related to the working and living conditions of people in the coal mining regions and natural gas producing regions. In addition, there are environmental risks for the immediate environment in each of these mining and gas producing regions. An increase in civil society activity in this context can in turn result in an increase in reputational risk. We are in constant contact with representatives from civil society and  keep  them  informed  about  the  advances  made  and challenges faced in all sustainability topics (p. 54 ff.) .\n\n## Customers and society goal dimension\n\nReputation: All opportunities and risks, as well as non-/financial issues, can have a positive or negative impact on reputation and thus on the key performance indicator, the Reputation Index (p. 76) . The reputation management department thus identi/fies opportunities and risks related to reputation, develops measures to protect and improve reputation, advises the Board of Management and management and provides recommendations for action.\n\nCustomer proximity: Risks exist especially in connection with the still high level of competitive pressure both from direct competitors within the energy industry and, to an increasing extent,  competitors  from  other  sectors  that  have  already entered the energy market or will do so shortly. This is associated with the risk of a negative impact on the customer base and sales volumes. Opportunities exist above all through the provision of a broader range of customer-speci/fic products and services  such  as  o/ffering  hardware  bundles (Glossary,  from p. 138) and product options, as well as through processes more oriented to the customer. EnBW also continued to expand its range of electromobility, sustainable energy industry services and energy solutions in 2020 and targeted its sales activities in this direction (p. 76 ff.) .",

        "page_content": "addition, there is uncertainty due to increasing environmental restrictions for the realization of projects for sustainable energy generation and for the operation of power plants. These risks are managed and mitigated in internal processes using targeted control measures.\n\nAlongside changes in physical climate parameters and other developments relating to or governed by environmental factors, regulatory guidelines and the potential changes associated with them, as well as changes in the market, also /flow into the risk evaluation process. However, there are also opportunities such as changing customer needs (p. 76 ff.) and an increasing demand for climate-friendly products such as e-mobility. These opportunities  and  risks  are  regularly  and  systematically  identi/fied Group-wide. The recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (Glossary,  from p. 138) are continuously implemented and are communicated in the report on opportunities and risks. Building on the risk map,  special focus is placed on sustainability aspects - especially climate protection targets - and they are anchored more deeply in the risk evaluation process. We closely examine the signi/ficance of sustainability and climate protection themes for the business model and implement measures and set targets to orientate our opportunity and risk management system even more towards climate-related opportunities and risks.\n\n## Employees goal dimension\n\nEngagement of employees: Due to the persistent level of competition on the labor market, especially for quali/fied and highly quali/fied specialists, there is a fundamental risk when recruiting employees that the company will not be able to secure a su/fficient number of employees with the necessary quali/fications at the right time. The more intensive measures to strengthen the company's reputation as an employer, the growing interest in jobs in the energy sector and the possibility of tapping into the international job market lessen this risk to some extent. We believe that regular anonymous employee surveys, from which we derive the People Engagement Index (PEI) as a key performance indicator, are an important tool for seizing opportunities early in the areas of employee development and employee loyalty (p. 86) .\n\nOccupational safety: Risks generally exist in the areas of occupational safety and health protection in our business activities. We counter these risks using comprehensive organizational and procedural measures, such as workplace-speci/fic hazard analyses, to protect employees as well as possible against any adverse consequences. We also view these measures as an opportunity to preserve the capacity of our employees to do their work and to maintain the position of EnBW as an attractive employer. Occupational safety is measured in the employees goal dimension in the form of the key performance indicator LTIF for companies controlled by the Group and LTIF overall (p. 89f.) .\n\n## Environment goal dimension\n\nExpansion of renewable energies: Risks generally exist in the approval and auction process. These risks can result in delays to the further expansion of renewable energies. Due to the fact that the auctions are held on equal terms, we continue to expect a high level of competition. We measure the expansion of renewable  energies  with  our  key  performance  indicator 'installed output of renewable energies (RE) and the share of the generation capacity accounted for by RE' (p. 81  f.) .\n\nCO2  intensity  /  climate  protection: Risks generally exist in the area of environmental protection due to the operation of power generation and transmission plants with possible consequences for the air, water, soil and nature. The importance of climate protection is taken into account in, for example, the key performance indicator CO 2 intensity (p. 83  f.) .\n\nWe counter these risks using, among other things, an environmental management system certi/fied according to DIN EN ISO 14001:2015,  which  has  been  established  at  key  subsidiaries (p. 79) . We take the safety of the population and the protection of the environment very seriously. In this context, risks also exist due to external circumstances, such as extreme weather conditions. We counter these risks using comprehensive organizational and procedural measures to reduce their impact. We ensure that the risks posed by crisis and emergency situations are  mitigated  quickly,  e/ffectively  and  with  a  coordinated approach through regular crisis management exercises and other measures. Through our diverse range of activities in the areas of environmental, nature and species protection, we also utilize the opportunity - beyond our core activities - to make a substantial contribution to improving environmental protection. Thanks to the positive public perception of these activities, they can also have a positive impact on our key performance indicator, the Reputation Index (p. 76) .\n\nAt the same time, EnBW also faces potential risks due to the ongoing process of climate change. For example, more frequent extreme weather conditions leading to highly /fluctuating water levels or limits being placed on emissions locally could have a negative impact, particularly on the operation of power plants and thus the security of supply (electricity grids). The operation of hydropower plants can be restricted by both a lack of, or also an abundance of, water. The output from thermal power plants that must be cooled could possibly be impacted by temperature limits on discharged water. Increasing volatility in the availability of wind, water and sun presents challenges in terms of planning certainty for the operation of power plants and the sale of volumes of electricity (p. 50 ff.) . For this reason, the top opportunity  /  top risk wind /fluctuations has been reported since the Integrated Annual Report 2016, although these opportunities  /  risks have no material e/ffect on non-/financial issues.

To a limited extent, we are also conducting legal proceedings relating to topics in the area of corporate law. For this purpose, adequate accounting provisions are made or, in the event of a probability of occurrence of < 50%, adequate contingent liabilities. As a consequence, there is also an opportunity of positive e/ffects on earnings if these provisions can be reversed once again. In addition, various court cases, o/fficial investigations or proceedings and other claims are pending\n\nagainst EnBW. The probability of these actions being successful is, however, considered very low and thus they are not reported under contingent liabilities and other /financial obligations.\n\nIn connection with these types of legal proceedings, we also recognize the water concession risk in Stuttgart. In the court proceedings dealing with the takeover of the water grid a/f\\_ter the water concession in the state capital Stuttgart expires, the state capital and EnBW are still striving to reach an amicable settlement. The court proceedings have been suspended several times, namely from January 2015 until the end of 2016 and from April 2018 until the end of January 2019, to give the parties the opportunity to reach an amicable settlement. Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach such an agreement due to a di/fference of opinion on the valuation. Therefore, there continues to be a risk in 2021 of losing the water grid without receipt of adequate compensation.\n\nthey could have with a high probability of occurrence on our key performance indicators in the /finance goal dimension: adjusted EBITDA, debt repayment potential and ROCE. The risks are depicted a/f\\_ter the implementation of the risk limitation measures.\n\nThe following opportunities and risks were new in 2020:\n\n- \u203a E/ffects of the pandemic on certain business areas",

        "page_content": "Depending on market developments and the framework conditions related to the Energiewende, we also identify a general risk of a negative impact on earnings due to impairment losses on power plants and impending losses on onerous contracts for electricity procurement agreements.\n\n/#04 E/ffects of the pandemic on certain business areas: The coronavirus pandemic has had various e/ffects on the opportunity and risk position in the individual business areas:\n\nIn B2B sales, there is an increased risk due to the sale of insufficient quantities of electricity at lower prices. Possible payment defaults are being closely monitored. These effects could have a negative impact in the low double-digit million euro range in 2021 and in the low single-digit to low double-digit million euro range  in  2022  on  the  key  performance  indicator  adjusted EBITDA and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify an increased level of risk in this area.\n\nIn the grids sector, there may be lower revenue from the use of the grids depending on the future development of the pandemic, the economy as a whole and any reduced load on the grid as a result. This could have a negative impact in the low double-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash /flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify a balanced level of opportunity and risk in this area.\n\nIn the area of generation, the coronavirus pandemic has only had a minor impact on the operation of power plants up to now. Possible system-relevant bottlenecks both in the supply chain and also in the personnel and service sector have so far not occurred. In the area of power generation, the pandemic does not only harbor risks but also possible opportunities. These opportunities could arise in subsequent years due to optimized and even more efficient processes in the future, as well as to the push towards greater digitalization initiated by the pandemic. The risks could have a negative impact in the mid single-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify a low level of risk in this area.\n\nIn trading, there is mainly an increased level of risk with respect to the gas trading activities of our subsidiary VNG, which is due to, among other things, defaults and bad debt. This could have a negative effect in the mid double-digit million euro range in 2021 and a negative effect in the low single-digit million euro range  in  2022  on  the  key  performance  indicator  adjusted EBITDA and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify an increased level of risk in this area.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\n/#01 Market  prices  of  /financial  investments: The  financial investments managed through the asset management system are subject to risks that arise from price losses and other losses in value as a result of the volatile financial market environment. There was a sharp fall on the stock market at the beginning of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, which was followed by a significant recovery in the second half of the year and an alltime high at the beginning of 2021. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the market situation must still be closely monitored. To improve the opportunity  /  risk ratio of the portfolio, greater  focus  is  currently  being  given  to  more  sustainable investments. This could have both a positive or negative impact in the low three-digit million euro range in 2021 and in the mid three-digit million euro range in 2022 on net debt and thus an impact  on  the  key  performance  indicator  debt  repayment potential. For the market prices of financial investments, we currently identify a slightly higher level of risk than opportunity due to the ongoing uncertainty on the stock markets.\n\n/#02 Discount rate applied to pension provisions: There is a general opportunity and risk due to any change in the discount rate applied to the pension provisions because the present value of the pension provisions falls when the discount rate increases and increases when the discount rate falls. On the reporting date for the annual /financial statements of the Group in 2020, the discount rate stood at 0.75% in comparison to the previous year (1.1%). The future development of interest rates could have a negative impact in the high three-digit million euro range or a positive impact in the low three-digit million euro range on net debt in 2021 and 2022 and thus an impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential. Against the background of the expected development of interest rates in future, we currently identify a lower level of opportunity and a higher level of risk.\n\n## /#03 Margins  /  liquidity  requirements  (previously:  Liquidity):\n\nDue to unforeseeable liquidity developments, especially margin payments, the Group's liquidity planning is subject to uncertainty that could lead to deviations between actual payments and  planned  payments.  Margin  and  liquidity  outflows  are actively monitored and controlled. The high volatility on the commodity markets resulted in high margin requirements in 2020.  The  further  utilization  of  liquidity  for  other  margin requirements cannot be excluded. Potential outflows, such as those resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, are estimated using stress scenarios for different time periods. As part of a liquidity management project, the processes and funds required at short notice have been further optimized. The risk can be covered by existing credit lines. In general, there is also a risk of additional liquidity requirements if the rating agencies downgrade the credit rating of EnBW. These effets could have a positive impact in the mid three-digit million euro range or a negative impact in the low three-digit million euro range in 2021 and a positive or negative impact in the mid three-digit million euro range in 2022 on net debt and thus an impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential, as well as an indirect impact on the key performance indicator ROCE via capital employed. We currently identify a balanced level of opportunity and risk in this area.",

        "page_content": "Compensation for the phasing out of nuclear energy: There is the possibility that EnBW will receive /financial compensation following the phasing out of nuclear energy in accordance with section 7e Atomic Energy Act (AtG) for investment, made based on the expectation of an extension to the service lives of the nuclear power plants, which was almost fully invalidated by the political decision to phase out nuclear power in 2011. The probability of receiving this compensation was considered low on the reporting date. A/f\\_ter the reporting date, however, there was a change to this assessment in February 2021 following exploratory discussions with the German government. The key points that resulted from these discussions were accepted by EnBW. The results of the discussions still need to be implemented in a binding regulation. We currently identify a high level of opportunity in this area with a positive impact in the mid to high double-digit million euro range on retained cash /flow.\n\n## Compliance opportunities and risks\n\nCompliance risk assessments focus, in particular, on assessing risks and de/fining appropriate preventative measures in the compliance risk areas of corruption, antitrust law and data protection.\n\nRisks for which we derive measures for /fighting corruption and bribery primarily exist in sales activities relating to local authority  /  political business when dealing with public o/fficials. Important preventative measures, especially training and  advisory services, are described on p. 43 f.\n\nIn addition there are antitrust risks in the sales activities of some subsidiaries that could result in /fines and damage to reputation and also have signi/ficant strategic implications. This risk is countered by the joint preventative measures of the compliance and legal departments.\n\nThe incorrect handling or illicit disclosure or use of personal data poses data protection risks. These risks exist in view of the digital transformation of many business activities. Advisory and awareness services and process controls are in place to guarantee adherence to legal data protection requirements in the Group. Company-speci/fic measures are coordinated via the compliance and data protection department.\n\n## Sales segment\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\n/#05 Competitive environment: The competitive environment is characterized by a high willingness among customers to switch suppliers and a continuous pressure on prices. There is a risk that the competitive situation could have a negative impact on sustained viable growth for all EnBW brands in the electricity and gas business, as well as for solutions. There is still a high willingness amongst customers to switch suppliers and pressure on prices, while sustainability, especially in the area of e-mobility, has become an increasingly important issue for customers. There are opportunities for the targeted acquisition of customers using new, attractive and sustainable products (personalization, digitalization, ecosystem). This could have a negative impact in the low single-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and 2022 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash /flow and on the key\n\nperformance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify a generally low level of risk in this area.\n\n## Compliance opportunities and risks\n\nCompliance with data protection regulations: The violation of data protection regulations is currently being investigated at one of the companies in which we hold a share. This is due to an official request. The process is still currently ongoing and the statement for the authorities has been submitted. These proceedings could have a negative impact on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT.\n\n## Grids segment\n\n## Strategic opportunities and risks\n\n## Recognition of costs for high-voltage direct current (HVDC)\n\ntransmission technology: TransnetBW plans to set up new connections using high-voltage direct current transmission technology (HVDC) (Glossary, from p. 138) with other transmission system operators. In addition, a regulation stipulating the use of underground cabling applies to the SuedLink project. In both projects, there are currently general risks of potential delays and additional costs, as well as a low level of risk that the necessity for these transmission lines might no longer be con/firmed in a new Network Development Plan (Glossary, from p. 138) . This risk will decline as the approvals are gradually received.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\nYear-end balance on the EEG bank account: The EEG bank account is a separately managed bank account in accordance with section 5 of the German Compensation Mechanism Ordinance (AusglMechV) and is kept separate from other areas of activity. In accordance with AusglMechV, a deficit or surplus on the account balance can have a temporary positive or negative e/ffect on the calculation of the net debt of EnBW, respectively. As of the reporting date of 31 December 2020, there was a de/ficit of \u20ac629.3 million on the EEG bank account of our subsidiary TransnetBW. The EEG bank account held by TransnetBW was settled by the German government with a payment on 11 January 2021. The financing needs for the EEG bank account, which had been met by EnBW, were repaid to EnBW by TransnetBW on 11 January 2021. We expect the EEG account to develop positively throughout 2021 and have a positive bank balance at the end of the year in the high three-digit million euro range. This will have a positive impact on net debt. We currently identify an increased level of opportunity in this area.\n\n## Renewable Energies segment\n\n## Strategic opportunities and risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/#06 Political and economic environment in Turkey: We have been commercially active in Turkey for many years in the expansion of energy generation from wind power and hydropower. In the past few years, the economic and political framework conditions in Turkey have deteriorated noticeably. There has also been a considerable decline in tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic. This has placed an additional burden on economic growth, making it more di/fficult to develop new projects. Re/financing remains a challenge due to the tense situation on",

Moreover,  there  is  also  an opportunity to make lasting cost savings due to synergies over the course of time and due to learning effects for subsequent dismantling  activities.  During  the  project  planning  stage, opportunities and risks were identified that could result in reduced or additional costs or adjustments to the term of the project. There could be opportunities that have an impact in the mid double-digit million euro range and risks that have an impact in the low three-digit million euro range on net debt and thus on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential in both 2021 and 2022. We currently identify an increased level of risk in this area.\n\nIt may be necessary to suspend dismantling activities to reduce the risk of infection to employees. This could result in delays, which will extend the term of the projects and thus significantly increase costs. The situation is being continuously monitored and  measures  to  protect  employees  are  being  updated  or adapted accordingly. This could have a negative or positive impact in the mid single-digit million euro range on net debt in both 2021 and 2022, as well as an indirect impact on the key performance indicator ROCE via capital employed. We currently identify an increased level of risk in this area.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\n/#10 Hedging: When selling generated electricity volumes, EnBW is exposed to the risk of falling electricity prices and the risk of the unfavorable development of fuel prices in relation to electricity prices. The concept underlying our hedging strategy not only limits risk but also seeks to exploit opportunities. The hedging instruments utilized in 2020 were forwards, futures and swaps. The EnBW Group has exposure to foreign exchange risks from procurement and the hedging of prices for its fuel requirements, as well as from gas and oil trading business. This could have a positive effect in the mid double-digit million euro range or a negative effect in the low double-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash /flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify  a  balanced  level  of  opportunity  and  risk  in  the  area  of hedging (Glossary, from p. 138) due to increasing fuel and CO 2 prices. Further information can be found in the section 'Accounting for /financial instruments' in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements at www.enbw.com/report2020-downloads .\n\n/#11 Power plant optimization: Following the conclusion of the hedging of generation activities, the Trading business unit will manage the further deployment of the power plants. This is being carried out as part of power plant optimization on the forward market (Glossary, from p. 138) , through the sale of system services (Glossary, from p. 138) and through placements on the spot and intraday trading platforms (Glossary, from p. 138). However, regulatory interventions continue to have a strong in/fluence. In particular, /fluctuating revenues from system services and volatility on the forward and spot markets (Glossary, from p. 138) could have both a positive or negative impact in the mid double-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and also 2022 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment  potential  via  the  retained  cash  /flow  and  on  the  key\n\nthe banking market. This risk could have a negative impact in the mid single-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator ROCE in 2021. We currently identify a low level of risk in this area.\n\n## Financial opportunities and risks\n\n/#07 Fluctuations in energy yield in the North Sea and Baltic Sea (previously: Wind energy yield): There is a general opportunity or risk for wind power plants due to /fluctuations in the energy yield because the amounts of electricity generated by them are subject to variations in the mean annual wind speed. The economic importance of these /fluctuations increases as we expand our wind farm portfolio. In order to take these /fluctuations into account in our planning, wind reports were created. Measurement campaigns were carried out up to the end of 2020 to evaluate wind speeds and are being continued in 2021. Nevertheless, these /fluctuations could naturally have both a positive or negative impact in the mid double-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA in 2021 and 2022 and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash /flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. As our wind farm portfolio continues to grow, the variation in the level of opportunity and risk will naturally increase.\n\n## Generation and Trading segment\n\nThere  are  general  risks  associated  with  the  operation  and dismantling of nuclear power plants. During the dismantling of nuclear power plants, there is an additional risk of a delay in the return of waste to the local intermediate storage facilities, with possible additional costs as a result of the waste being stored for a longer period of time in Great Britain and France, as well as the risk of further costs for approval and authorization procedures.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the remaining provisions held by EnBW were revalued as part of the regular examination of the discount rate and escalation rate. Due to changes in these kinds of assumptions in the future, we currently identify a low level of opportunity and risk for the remaining nuclear provisions.\n\n## Operative opportunities and risks\n\n/#08 Availability of nuclear power plants: There is a general risk that exogenous and endogenous factors will have an influence on the availability of these power plants. We try to counter these risks using preventive measures. Depending on their duration, interruptions to the operation of the power plants can positively or negatively impact the operating result. The availability of nuclear power plants could have a positive or negative impact in the low single-digit million euro range in 2021 and a positive impact in the low single-digit million euro range or a negative impact in the low double-digit million euro range in 2022 on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify an increased level of risk in this area.\n\n- /#09 Dismantling of nuclear power plants (previously: Operation and dismantling of nuclear power plants): For long-term major projects such as the remaining operation and dismantling of a nuclear power plant, there is a general risk that delays",

We currently identify a balanced level of risk and opportunity that is dependent on the development of market prices.\n\n/#12 Obligation to pay EEG cost allocations for power plants (previously: Obligation to pay EEG cost allocations for the company's own and jointly owned power stations and obligation to pay EEG cost allocations for dismantling): For its own power plants, including nuclear power plants, EnBW AG not only utilizes the exemption from EEG cost allocations for storage but also the exemption for end usage for each power plant. There are a number of different arguments that suggest that the German Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) and the transmission system operators could define the role of the operator differently. Possible back payments for EEG cost allocations in previous years and increased costs for the dismantling of the nuclear power plants, depending on the results of a legally binding clarification process on this matter, could have a negative impact in the low three-digit million euro range on the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA, and thus an indirect impact on the key performance indicator debt repayment potential via the retained cash flow and on the key performance indicator ROCE via the adjusted EBIT. We currently identify - without sharing the viewpoint held by BNetzA, which differs from that of EnBW,\n\nand  due  solely  to  the  practical  development  described above - an increased level of risk in this area.\n\nThe opportunity  /  risk relating to unrestricted access to capital markets that was added during the 2020 financial year has been eliminated from the report at the end of 2020 due to its lack of materiality.\n\nIn comparison to the report issued for the 2019 /financial year, the following opportunities  /  risks have also been eliminated due to their lack of materiality:\n\n- \u203a Obligation to pay EEG cost allocations for leasing models\n- \u203a Obligation to pay EEG cost allocations for jointly owned power stations\n- \u203a Phase-out of coal power: early decommissioning of power plants\n\n## Link to the key performance indicators\n\nThe top opportunities  /  risks can have an impact on our key performance indicators, whereby the e/ffects on the non-/financial key performance indicators are potential and long term in nature and more di/fficult to measure. They have thus been shown less boldly in the following diagram.\n\nLinking the top opportunities  /  risks with the key performance indicators\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|

However, we implemented a comprehensive range of preventative measures and countermeasures to counteract these risks at an early stage. In terms of the /financial opportunities and risks, persistently low interest rates, in particular, have led to higher risk premiums for the discount rate applied to pension provisions.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\nThe remuneration report summarizes the principles relevant for determining the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and explains the structure and level of both Board of Management and Supervisory Board remuneration. The remuneration report takes the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) in the version from 16 December 2019, which came into force on 20 March 2020, and the German Accounting Standard (GAS) 17 (amended in 2010) into consideration in this respect. It also contains disclosures required by German commercial law that are to be included in the notes pursuant to section 314 HGB and the management report pursuant to section 315 HGB.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration\n\nBased on proposals of the personnel committee, the Supervisory Board passes resolutions on the remuneration of the Board of Management, including the main contract elements, and reviews it on a regular basis. The criteria for determining appropriate  remuneration  include  the  responsibilities  and  performance of the members of the Board of Management, the economic situation, the success and sustainable development of the company and the relationship between the remuneration of the Board of Management and the remuneration of senior management and the workforce as a whole, as well as its development over time.\n\nThe Board of Management remuneration system in the following form has been valid since 1 January 2018. The de/finitions of the performance indicators were changed on 5 December 2018 (see explanation for the performance indicator EBT). The following diagram shows the structure of the total remuneration:\n\n## Components of target remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe remuneration in the reporting year comprises basic remuneration, single-year and multi-year variable remuneration, as well as contributions as part of the company pension scheme. The ratio of single-year to multi-year variable remuneration is approx. 40% to 60%, depending on the individual target income for the member of the Board of Management, so that multi-year variable remuneration signi/ficantly outweighs single-year variable remuneration. In general, the variable remuneration components have a multi-year measurement basis. The single-year variable remuneration component is described below as the Short Term Incentive (STI), while the multi-year variable remuneration component is described as the Long Term Incentive (LTI).\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe /fixed remuneration comprises basic remuneration and fringe bene/fits.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\n## Short-term variable remuneration (Short Term Incentive - STI)\n\nThe STI is paid for a period of one /financial year in each case and paid out in the following /financial year. The measurement period for the STI is the /financial year for which it is paid.\n\nThe performance indicators for calculating the extent to which the  target  for  the  STI  has  been  achieved  are  the  following non-adjusted corporate performance indicators for the EnBW Group determined for one /financial year:\n\n- \u203a EBT (earnings before taxes), adjusted for earnings from the measurement of /financial assets allocated to the /financial result and outstanding items for derivatives allocated under trading as well as for e/ffects due to the adjustment of the nuclear provisions and to the change in the in/flation rate for costs for the operation, dismantling and disposal of the nuclear power plants and in the discount rate\n- \u203a FFO  (funds  from  operations),  adjusted  for  the  items  of income tax paid and income tax received\n\nThe Supervisory Board will de/fine the target values for the performance indicators EBT (Glossary, from p. 138) and FFO (Glossary, from p.138) each year before the start of the singleyear measurement period.\n\nThe target value for the performance indicator EBT is generally de/fined on the basis of the /figure actually achieved in the previous year, whereby the Supervisory Board can, at its own discretion, make the achievement of the target easier or more di/fficult by adjusting the /figure from the previous year, taking into account extraordinary events in the previous year and general considerations on the development of earnings (target-actual comparison).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIf the de/finitions for the performance indicators or accounting policies change, especially as a result of amendments to accounting standards, the target values and ranges will be adjusted correspondingly during the ongoing measurement period, insofar as these changes cause the relevant achievement level to di/ffer by more than +/-5 percentage points in comparison to the value that would have been achieved without these changes. The sum of the partial remuneration amounts for each performance indicator gives the total preliminary STI remuneration.\n\nThe amount of the total preliminary STI remuneration, which is calculated exclusively on the basis of /financial performance indicators, is then evaluated qualitatively using additional criteria. The adjustment is carried out by multiplying the total preliminary remuneration by a certain factor, whose lowest value is 0.7 and highest value is 1.3. Only one decimal place is used for this factor. If not de/fined otherwise by the Supervisory Board, the default factor is 1.0. The level of this factor is primarily determined by the Supervisory Board on the basis of an evaluation of criteria that are de/fined in advance on an annual basis. The sustainable growth of the company is an aspect that is  particularly taken into account.\n\nEvaluation factor based on defined criteria\n\nFinal\n\nSTI remuneration\n\nThe target value for the performance indicator FFO corresponds to  the  value  de/fined  for  the  performance  indicator  in  the single-year budget plan approved in the year before the start of the measurement period (plan-actual comparison).\n\nThe target remuneration for the STI consists of two equally weighted partial remuneration amounts (50 : 50). Each partial remuneration amount will be achieved if the target value for the respective performance indicator is achieved to 100%.\n\nThe extent to which the individual targets for each of the performance indicators are achieved is based, in the case of the underachievement or overachievement of the target value, on the ratio of the de/fined target value and the actual value for the performance indicator in the measurement period as de/fined in the consolidated /financial statements for the year of payment.\n\nIn the event of the overachievement of the target, the maximum possible remuneration that can be paid is limited to 180% of the partial target remuneration de/fined for each performance indicator (partial remuneration cap). The sum of both partial remuneration caps gives the total STI remuneration cap, which is 180% of the total amount for the STI target remuneration. In the event of the underachievement of the target, STI remuneration has no lower limit and can fall to an amount of \u20ac0.\n\nWhen de/fining the target values for the short-term remuneration components, the Supervisory Board also separately de/fines a minimum and maximum value - at its own discretion - and thus the target range for each of the performance indicators on an annual basis.\n\nThe target range corresponds to a piecewise linear function, as shown in the adjacent diagram, which is determined by the value of the lowest achievement level X min in relation to the lowest payout factor and the value of the highest achievement level X max in relation to the highest payout factor. The relationship between the target value and the minimum and maximum values can be used to determine the lowest and highest achievement levels (X min and X max ), respectively, while the relationship between the target remuneration and the minimum and maximum remuneration can be used to determine the lowest and highest payout factors, respectively. The partial amount of the short-term variable remuneration for each performance indicator based on the achievement level is calculated by multiplying the actual payout factor by the target remuneration de/fined for the respective performance indicator. The actual payout factor is derived using the actual value achieved for the performance indicator and the piecewise linear function for the target range.\n\n## Calculation of the Short Term Incentive (STI)\n\nPartial target remuneration EBT\n\nPartial target remuneration FFO\n\nTarget achievement level EBT\n\nTarget achievement level FFO",

This discretionary power does not apply to the success targets or comparative values, the subsequent adjustment of which should be excluded according to the recommendation G.8 DCGK.\n\nIf remuneration is granted in accordance with the two previous paragraphs, the total STI remuneration cap of 180% of the target STI remuneration still applies.\n\n## Long-term variable remuneration (Long Term Incentive - LTI)\n\nThe LTI is paid for a period of one /financial year and paid out in the /financial year following the conclusion of the measurement period. The measurement period for calculating the LTI covers a period of three /financial years, which includes the year for which the remuneration is being paid and the two subsequent /financial years (performance period).\n\nThe performance indicators for calculating the extent to which the  target  for  the  LTI  has  been  achieved  are  the  following non-adjusted corporate performance indicators for the EnBW Group determined for one /financial year in each case:\n\n- \u203a EBT (earnings before taxes), adjusted for earnings from the measurement of /financial assets allocated to the /financial result and outstanding items for derivatives allocated under trading as well as for e/ffects due to the adjustment of the nuclear provisions and to the change in the in/flation rate for costs for the operation, dismantling and disposal of the nuclear power plants and in the discount rate\n- \u203a ROA (return on assets = return on the capital expenditure for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment based on the relationship between the non-adjusted EBIT [adjusted in line with the regulations for deviations in the performance indicator EBT] and the sum of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment [adjusted for subsidies related to capital expenditure])\n\nThe target values for the performance indicators EBT and ROA for a performance period are de/fined by the Supervisory Board at its own discretion on an annual basis based on the corporate strategy and with e/ffect for the next performance period that begins in the following year.\n\nThe target remuneration for the LTI consists of two equally weighted partial remuneration amounts (50 : 50). Each partial remuneration amount will be achieved if the target value for the respective performance indicator is achieved to 100%.\n\nThe extent to which the individual targets for each of the performance indicators are achieved is based, in the case of the underachievement or overachievement of the target value, on the ratio of the de/fined target value and the arithmetic mean of the actual values for the performance indicator as de/fined in the consolidated /financial statements for each individual year of the performance period.\n\nIn the event of the overachievement of the target, the maximum possible remuneration that can be paid is limited to 180% of the partial target remuneration de/fined for each performance indicator (partial remuneration cap). The sum of both partial remuneration caps gives the total LTI remuneration cap, which is 180% of the total amount for the LTI target remuneration. In the event of the underachievement of the target, LTI remuneration has no lower limit and can fall to an amount of \u20ac0.\n\nWhen de/fining the target values for the long-term remuneration components, the Supervisory Board also separately de/fines a minimum and maximum value - at its own discretion - and thus the target range for each of the performance indicators on an annual basis (see here the information provided for the STI).\n\nThe partial amount of the long-term variable remuneration for each performance indicator based on the achievement level is calculated by multiplying the actual payout factor by the target remuneration de/fined for the respective performance indicator. The  actual  payout  factor  is  derived  using  the  actual  value achieved for the performance indicator and the piecewise linear function for the target range. The sum of the partial remuneration amounts for each performance indicator gives the total LTI remuneration.\n\nIf the de/finitions for the performance indicators or accounting policies  change,  especially  as  a  result  of  amendments  to accounting standards, the target values and ranges will be adjusted correspondingly during the ongoing measurement period, insofar as these changes cause the relevant achievement level to di/ffer by more than +/-5 percentage points in comparison to the value that would have been achieved without these changes.\n\nFor the previous year, the long-term variable remuneration was still based on the regulations for the Board of Management remuneration system that were valid up to 31 December 2017.

Alternatively, a life-long pension payment can be made on the request of the member of the Board of Management - including a 60% entitlement for surviving dependents - or a mixed form of payment. Payment options are also available to the surviving dependents. If the member leaves the Board of Management before the pension is due, the pension account will remain at its current balance plus any surplus payments that are still due to be made.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are entitled to make their own contributions to the pension scheme and supplement the pension provision /financed by the employer. For this purpose, a proportion of the annual STI bonus up to a maximum sum of \u20ac50,000 p.a. can be converted into a pension entitlement. The regulations described above apply correspondingly to self-/financed contributions.\n\n## Vested pension entitlements from the old pension scheme:\n\nAs part of the transfer of the existing pension entitlements from the old pension scheme, the following vested pension entitlements - in accordance with the individual term of service in each case - were determined for the serving members of the Board  of  Management  as  of  31  December  2015:  Dr.  Frank Mastiaux: \u20ac80,676 p.a., Thomas Kusterer: \u20ac89,523 p.a., Dr. HansJosef Zimmer: \u20ac174,636 p.a.\n\nIndividual pension contributions that deviate from the regulations for the new pension scheme: From 1 January 2016, the annual pension contributions and the interest on the contributions will generally be paid in accordance with the rules of the new system for new members of the Board of Management appointed in the future. However, a deviation was necessary for the then serving members of the Board of Management to take account of the transition to the new system, and individual pension contributions and an individual contribution period have been de/fined. The following individual pension contributions were determined: Dr. Frank Mastiaux: \u20ac360,000 p.a., Thomas Kusterer: \u20ac215,000 p.a., Dr. Hans-Josef Zimmer: \u20ac120,000 p.a.\n\nRegulation for limiting severance payments: No severance bene/fit obligations exist in the event of premature termination of service on the Board of Management. However, severance bene/fits may be payable on the basis of a severance agreement made with the individual. For agreements in place as of the reporting date, it was agreed that payments made to a member of the Board of Management on premature termination of his or her contract without serious cause, including fringe bene/fits, shall not exceed the value of two years' remuneration (severance cap) and compensate for no more than the remaining term of the contract. In concluding or extending contracts for the Board of Management, care is taken to ensure that no payments will be made to a member of the Board of Management in the event of the premature termination of the contract due to an important reason for which the member of the Board of Management is responsible.\n\nIn the event of the premature termination of service on the Board of Management due to a change of control, the possibility of a severance payment for the member of the Board of Management is limited to the pro rata share of annual remunera-\n\n## Compensation agreed with the Board of Management in the event of termination of service\n\nThe Supervisory Board of EnBW AG passed a new resolution on 18 March 2016 for the reorganization of the company pension scheme for the Board of Management, e/ffective as of 1 January 2016.\n\nThe regulations that were valid up until then can be found in the following publications:\n\n- \u203a The company pension scheme that was valid for members of the Board of Management up until 31 December 2015 is presented in detail in the remuneration report for 2015, which was published in the combined management report of the EnBW Group and EnBW AG for the 2015 /financial year.\n- \u203a The regulations governing the transition of the company pension scheme that was valid for members of the Board of Management up until 31 December 2015 are presented in detail in the remuneration report for 2016, which was published in the combined management report of the EnBW Group and EnBW AG for the 2016 /financial year.\n\nThe company pension scheme for the members of the Board of Management at the company is a modern and market-oriented pension system that provides members of the Board of Management with /flexibility with respect to how the pension bene/fits are paid out. Following the introduction of the new system, there has been a shi/f\\_t from the previous de/fined bene/fit pension plan to a de/fined contribution pension model. In the new system, annual pension contributions will be paid that accrue interest at a rate oriented to the capital market. In order to ensure that the business risks associated with the pension scheme - especially the interest rate risks and biometric risks remain calculable in the future, the interest model only contains a relatively low /fixed interest entitlement that forms the basic interest rate plus a non-guaranteed surplus that is based on the actual development of interest rates in the life insurance industry.\n\nDuring the term of the contract, EnBW pays /fixed annual contributions  to  the  pension  scheme  to  an  individual  pension account. Pension contributions are paid for a maximum period of three terms of o/ffice (or 13 years in o/ffice). The /fixed annual contributions are \u20ac230,000 for ordinary members of the Board of Management and \u20ac390,000 for the Chairman of the Board of Management. In the event of invalidity and as a supplementary risk bene/fit, age-dependent 'notional' contributions will be paid on top of the balance already existing on the pension account until the member reaches the age of 60 - although at the most seven contributions will be paid.\n\nAs well as the annual contributions, interest is paid that is oriented to the market and consists of a guaranteed basic interest rate and a non-guaranteed surplus. The guaranteed interest is paid on every contribution in advance until the de/fined retirement age (63 years old). In addition, annual surplus payments can be paid above and beyond the guaranteed interest. These are based on the current average interest rate for capital investments actually achieved in the past year in the life insurance industry and are not guaranteed.",

There are de/fined bene/fit obligations in accordance with IFRS of \u20ac16.6 million for the current members of the Board of Management (previous year: \u20ac20.0 million).\n\nFormer members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents received total remuneration of \u20ac6.6 million in the 2020 /financial year (previous year: \u20ac5.2 million). These pension payments are indexed to the percentage change in remuneration according to the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThere are de/fined bene/fit obligations to former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents in accordance with IFRS of \u20ac116.9 million (previous year: \u20ac114.8 million).\n\nAs in the previous year, no loans or advances to members of the Board of Management existed at the end of the /financial year.\n\n## Supervisory Board remuneration\n\nIn response to a proposal of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, the Annual General Meeting on 17 July 2020 revised the regulations for Supervisory Board remuneration. Accordingly, members of the Supervisory Board each receive /fixed basic remuneration of \u20ac44,000 for the entire 2020 /financial year, payable at the end of the /financial year in addition to reimbursement of their expenses.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board  receives  twice  the above, while the Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives one and a half times the aforementioned basic remuneration.\n\nFor membership in one of the committees of the Supervisory Board, a member of the Supervisory Board also receives /fixed, /flat-rate remuneration of \u20ac7,500 per /financial year and per committee for the additional work on the committee(s) in addition to their basic remuneration, which is payable at the end of the /financial year. For membership in the /finance and investment committee or the audit committee of the Supervisory Board, the /flat-rate remuneration is \u20ac10,000 per /financial year. For membership in multiple committees in one /financial year, the additional /flat-rate remuneration for members of the committees is only paid for a maximum of two committees, whereby membership in committees with the highest remuneration for membership takes precedence. There is no additional /flat-rate remuneration paid for membership in the nomination committee or mediation committee. The additional /flat-rate remuneration for membership in a committee of the Supervisory Board is only paid if the relevant committee convenes at least once in the /financial year.\n\nSupervisory Board members who have only belonged to the Supervisory Board or a committee or acted as a Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson for part of the /financial year are paid remuneration proportionate to the duration of their o/ffice or their position in that /financial year.",

For this D&O insurance, the deductible for members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is 10% of the claim in each case, but no more than one and a half times the /fixed annual remuneration.\n\nIn addition, members of the Supervisory Board each receive an attendance fee of \u20ac750 per Supervisory Board meeting or committee meeting.

        "page_content": "## Disclosures pursuant to sections 289 a (1) and 315 a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory report of the Board of Management\n\nIn the following, the Board of Management provides the information prescribed by sections 289 a (1) and 315 a (1) HGB and explains this in accordance with section 176 (1) sentence 1 AktG.\n\n## Composition of the subscribed capital and shares in capital\n\nThe composition of the subscribed capital is described and explained in the notes to the annual and consolidated /financial statements in the section 'Equity.' Direct or indirect shares in capital which exceed 10% of the voting rights are described and explained in the notes to the annual /financial statements in the sections 'Shareholder structure' and 'Disclosures pursuant to sections 33 /ff. German Securities Trading Act (WpHG)' and the notes  to  the  consolidated  /financial  statements  in  section 'Related parties (entities).' Information and explanations about the company's treasury shares are presented below and can be found in note 19 of the notes to the consolidated /financial statements at www.enbw.com/report2020-downloads .\n\n## Restrictions relating to voting rights or transferability of shares\n\nAgreements were reached on 22 December 2015 between, on the one hand, Zweckverband Oberschw\u00e4bische Elektrizit\u00e4tswerke (Zweckverband OEW) and OEW Energie-Beteiligungs GmbH and, on the other, the Federal State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, NECKARPRI  GmbH  and  NECKARPRI-Beteiligungsgesellscha/f\\_t  mbH, which include clauses relating to restrictions of authorization over EnBW shares held by these parties and a general mutual obligation of both main shareholders to maintain parity investment relationships in EnBW with respect to each other. Restrictions relating to voting rights no longer exist to the knowledge of the Board of Management since the aforementioned direct and indirect EnBW shareholders annulled a shareholder agreement on 22 December 2015 that had previously existed between them.\n\nLegal provisions and statutes on the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Management and amendments to the Articles of Association\n\nPursuant to section 84 AktG in conjunction with section 31 MitbestG, responsibility for the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Management rests with the Supervisory Board. This competence is stipulated in article 7 (1) sentence 2 of the Articles of Association of EnBW. If, under exceptional  circumstances,  a  necessary  member  of  the  Board  of Management is missing, section 85 AktG requires that a member of the Board of Management be appointed by the court in urgent cases. The Annual General Meeting has the right to make changes  to  the  Articles  of  Association  in  accordance  with section 119 (1) no. 6 AktG. The speci/fic rules of procedure are\n\ncontained in sections 179 and 181 AktG. For practical reasons, the right to amend the Articles of Association was transferred to the Supervisory Board where such amendments a/ffect the wording only. This option pursuant to section 179 (1) sentence 2 AktG is embodied in article 18 (2) of the Articles of Association. Pursuant to section 179 (2) AktG, resolutions by the Annual General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association require a majority of at least three quarters of the capital stock represented when passing the resolution, unless the Articles of Association stipulate a di/fferent majority, which, however, for any amendment to the purpose of the company can only be higher. Pursuant to article 18 (1) of the Articles of Association, resolutions by the Annual General Meeting require a simple majority of the votes cast, unless legal regulations or the Articles of Association stipulate otherwise. If the law requires a larger majority of the votes cast or of the capital stock represented when passing the resolution, the simple majority su/ffices in those cases where the law leaves the determination of the required majority to the Articles of Association.\n\n## Authority of the Board of Management regarding the possibility to issue or redeem shares\n\nNo authorized or conditional capital nor any authorization of the Annual General Meeting pursuant to section 71 (1) No. 8 AktG for the purchase of treasury shares by the company currently exists at EnBW. Therefore, the company may only acquire treasury shares on the basis of other reasons justifying such purchases in accordance with section 71 (1) AktG. As of 31 De cember 2020, the company holds 5,749,677 treasury shares which were purchased on the basis of earlier authorizations in accordance with section 71 (1) No. 8 AktG. The company's treasury shares can be sold on the stock exchange or by public o/ffer to all company shareholders. The use of treasury shares, in particular their sale, in any other way can only occur within the scope of the resolution issued by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2004. The treasury shares held by EnBW do not grant the company any rights in accordance with section 71 b AktG.\n\n## Material agreements of the company subject to the condition of a change of control as a result of a takeover bid and the resulting effects\n\nThe following EnBW agreements are subject to the condition of a change of control following a takeover bid as de/fined by sections 289 a (1) No. 8 and 315 a (1) No. 8 HGB:\n\nEnBW concluded a new sustainability-linked syndicated credit line with a volume of \u20ac1.5 billion on 24 June 2020.

This report was prepared in accordance with the GRI standards 'Core' option. An audit will be carried out in the second quarter of 2021 as part of the GRI content index service.

In addition, the  standard  quick-charging  CHAdeMO  connector from Asia is also commonly used and can charge at up to 50 kW.\n\n## Clean dark spread (CDS)\n\nThe  difference  between  the  electricity  price and  the  generation  costs  for  a  typical  coal power station, which is calculated using the coal price, CO 2 allowance price and the  degree of efficiency of the power station.\n\n## CO 2 allowances\n\nCO 2 allowances  have  been  traded  on  the Leipzig  electricity  exchange  since  2005.  If  a company  purchases  a  CO 2 allowance,  it  is entitled to emit 1 t CO 2 .\n\n## Coal Commission\n\nThe Commission  on  Growth,  Structural Change and Employment (commonly known as  the  Coal  Commission)  was  appointed  by the  German  government  to  present  recommendations  on,  among  other  things,  the themes  of  climate  protection,  safeguarding jobs  and  economic  aspects  related  to  the phase-out of coal generated power. The Coal Phase-out Act was passed in July 2020.\n\n## Commercial paper (CP) program\n\nThe CP program is a flexible financing instrument and serves to issue unsecured bonds on the  money  market  for  the  purpose  of  shortterm financing.\n\n## Coverage ratio\n\nThis  shows  the  proportion  of  the  Group's pension and nuclear provisions that is covered by  the  financial  assets  in  the  \u203a  dedicated financial assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nD\n\n## Debt Issuance Program (DIP)\n\nThe DIP, also known as EMTN (Euro Medium Term Notes), is a standardized documentation platform for raising debt through the issuing of  medium  and  long-term  bonds  on  the capital market.\n\n## Glossary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adjusted earnings figures\n\nAdjusted  earnings  figures  are  operational earnings figures that are adjusted for non-operating  effects.  They  include,  among  other, things, adjusted EBIT and adjusted Group net profit  /  loss.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nThe  operating  profitability  of  companies  is often  measured  based  on  adjusted  EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization).  It  describes  earnings before  the  investment  and  financial  results, income  taxes  and  amortization,  adjusted  for non-operating  effects.  The  key  performance indicator adjusted EBITDA is the central earnings indicator for EnBW.\n\n## Asset liability management (ALM) model\n\nA model for asset liability and cash flow management. A cash flow-based model is used to determine the effects of the pension and nuclear provisions on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement over the next 30 years. This ensures that the Group can cover its long-term pension and nuclear provisions  within  an  economically  viable  time period  using  corresponding  financial  investments (so-called \u203a dedicated financial assets).\n\n## Asset management\n\nA  financial  asset  management  system  facilitates the active management of investments that  are  used  to  cover  pension  and  nuclear provisions. The central focus of this activity is to generate appropriate returns while taking into account the risks incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nB\n\n## Base\n\nBase load product. The constant base level of supply  /  demand over a period of time.\n\n## Broadband\n\nEnBW supports local authorities and municipal  associations  with  tasks  ranging  from broadband planning and the installation of the infrastructure through to operation, as well as with  the  associated  end-customer  business (Internet, telephone and television).\n\n## Bundle\n\nProduct bundling (bundle offer) describes offering multiple products or services together in one package. Customers receive an appropriate add-on in addition to their purchase.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capital employed\n\nCapital  employed comprises all assets from the operating business. At EnBW, it primarily comprises property,  plant  and  equipment  in the form of power plants or grids. Non-interest-bearing  liabilities  -  such  as  trade  payables - are deducted.\n\n## Cash pooling\n\nDaily pooling of the cash or cash equivalents of one or multiple companies within a Group with the target of concentrating and transparently  depicting  them  at  the  level  of  the parent  company  in  order  to  optimize  the interest result.\n\n## CER (Certified Emission Reduction)\n\nCertified  emission  reductions  from  Clean Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  projects. Pursuant to the Kyoto protocol, investors in industrialized countries earn these in developing  countries  with  CDM  emission  reduction projects. 1 CER corresponds to 1 t CO 2 . CERs can be used by companies to meet the obligation  to  return  allowances  under  the European emissions trading system.\n\n## Charging infrastructure for electromobility\n\nA  charging  location  can  have  one  or  more charging stations, which in turn can have up to three charging points. The actual charging capacity is dependent on how quickly an e-car can charge. EnBW operates the largest quickcharging network in Germany with charging capacities of up to 300 kW. Depending on the e-car,  drivers  can  charge  their  cars  with enough electricity to travel 100 km in just five minutes.  There  are  four  different  types  of electrical  connectors  for  charging  electric cars:  For  charging  with  alternating  current (AC),  there  is  the  standard  Type  2  connector which charges at up to 22 kW and - less commonly - the Schuko connector at up to 3.6 kW. The  European  standard  for  quick  charging with direct current (DC) is the CCS connector,",

        "page_content": "## Debt repayment potential\n\nThis key performance indicator describes the \u203a  retained  cash  flow  in  relation  to  the  \u203a  net debt and is the most significant performance indicator  of  the  Group's  ability  to  repay  its debts internally. It will replace the \u203a internal financing capability from 2021.\n\n## Dedicated financial assets\n\nDedicated financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and financial assets that are held to cover the pension and nuclear obligations.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nFinancial instruments whose price or market rate is derived from its underlying asset.\n\n## District development\n\nDistrict  development  deals  with  smart  and sustainable  urban  planning,  as  well  as  connecting up, constructing and operating modern  residential  districts.  It  comprises  urban infrastructure themes such as energy, grids, e-mobility,  digital  networking,  safety  and smart services.\n\n## E\n\n## EBIT\n\nEBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nEBITDA  stands  for  earnings  before  interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\n## EBT\n\nEBT stands for earnings before taxes.\n\n## EEG cost allocations\n\nCost  allocations  under  the  EEG  (Renewable Energies Act) are charged by the transmission system operators (TSO). On the one hand, the cost allocations cover the difference between the  income  generated  by  the  transmission system operators from selling the electricity from renewable energies (RE) plants and the expenses  incurred  by  the  transmission  system operators for the fixed feed-in remuneration and market premium payments to direct marketers  of  RE  plants,  while  on  the  other hand, they also cover the costs of implementing the EEG. More than half of the electricity price for household customers today consists of taxes, duties and cost allocations. The EEG cost allocations account for the largest share.\n\n## Energy saving contracting\n\nThe  cross-discipline  optimization  of  building technology  together  with  building  operation based  on  cooperation  in  partnership.  Investments  in  renovations  or  efficiency  enhancement measures are financed through energy cost-savings.\n\n## Energy supply contracting\n\nThe outsourcing, for a specific period and for a  specific  area,  of  tasks  relating  to  energy optimization or utility  energy  supplies  to  a third party.\n\n## EPEX\n\nThe  European  Power  Exchange  (EPEX  SPOT SE)  is  a  stock  exchange  for  the  short-term wholesale  trading  of  electricity  in  Germany, France,  Austria,  Switzerland  and  Luxembourg.\n\n## EU Green Deal\n\nThe EU Green Deal is a package of measures from  the  European  Union  with  the  primary aim of making the EU climate neutral by 2050 and  which  contains  staggered  measures  to achieve this goal.\n\n## EUA (European Allowances)\n\nEU  emission  allowance.  An  EUA  entitles  a company  to  emit  1  t  CO 2 .  Each  EU  state allo cates its supply of EUAs (1 EUA = 1 t CO 2 ) to its national companies either free of charge or via auctions.\n\n## EU taxonomy\n\nIn  light  of  global  warming,  European  countries have committed themselves to do more for climate protection. Both the Paris Agreement from 2015 and the European Green Deal view sustainable investment as an important starting  point.  The  European  Commission is currently working on the sustainable finance taxonomy  -  a  central  tool  in  this  regard.  It should  make  classifying  EU-wide  economic activities  based  on  their  sustainability  easier in future. During the first stage, the taxonomy will place a special focus on climate targets. There  are  plans  to  expand  it  beyond  various environmental  targets  to  also  cover  social aspects and good corporate management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nF\n\n## Financial Asset Management\n\n\u203a Asset-Management\n\n## Forward market\n\nMarket on which the supply and procurement of  electricity,  fuel  and  CO 2 allowances  are traded  for  a  future  period.  Usual  periods include  weeks,  months,  quarters  and  years. Settlement can be either physical or financial. The forward market has the primary function of acting as a price hedge.\n\n## Funds from operations (FFO)\n\nFFO  is  the  cash-relevant  earnings  from operating  activities  that  is  available  to  the com pany for investments, the distribution of dividends and the repayment of debt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nG\n\n## Green bonds\n\nGreen bonds are issued exclusively to finance climate-friendly  projects.  The  proceeds  are invested  in  sustainable  environmental  and climate protection projects.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe increase in  the  concentration  of  various greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2 ),  increases  the  greenhouse  effect  and leads  to  global  warming,  which  itself  has many consequences. Alongside carbon dioxide, other  greenhouse  gases  include  methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated hydrocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.\n\n## H\n\n## Hedging\n\nHedging is a structured approach for securing against financial risks through  financial transactions.  Hedging  involves  engaging  in countertrade  transactions  to  offset  a  transaction or an existing position. This is usually carried out in the form of futures contracts.\n\n## HVDC\n\nHigh-voltage  DC  transmission  lines  (HVDC) are  used  to  transport  electrical  energy  over large  distances.  The  transmission  lines  use direct current for transportation as the transmission losses are lower.",

        "page_content": "## Non-operating figures\n\nThe  non-operating  figures  include  effects that cannot be predicted or cannot be directly  influenced  by  EnBW and as such are not relevant to the ongoing management of the company. They include, among other things, non-operating EBIT and non-operating Group net profit  /  loss.\n\n## Nuclear fuel rod tax\n\nThis tax was imposed from 2011 to 2016 at a rate  of  \u20ac145  /  g  of  nuclear  fuel  employed. However,  it  was  declared  unconstitutional on 7 June 2017 and also repaid to all energy supply companies in 2017.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nP\n\n## Pari passu clause\n\nA pari passu clause (Latin 'pari passu' = on equal footing) is an obligation in financial agreements  (for  example,  in  bond  agreements  or loan agreements). The debtor  /  issuer obligates themselves during the term of the uncollateralized financial liability (for example, bond or loan) to the principle of equality, meaning future uncollateralized financial liabilities will not be given  precedence  over  the  existing  financial liability.\n\nR\n\n## Retained cash flow and adjusted retained cash flow\n\nThe  retained  cash  flow  is  decisive  for  the \u203a internal financing capability of EnBW. After covering  ongoing  costs  and  dividend  payments,  it  is  available  to  the  company  for investment  without  the  need  to  raise  additional debt. The adjusted retained cash flow is  the  retained  cash  flow  adjusted  to  take into account the extraordinary effect of the reimbursement of the \u203a nuclear fuel rod tax in  2017.  In  the  2018  financial  year,  the reimbursed funds were used for the repayment of debt and for strategic investments. We plan to distribute the remaining amount on a straight-line basis in the period 2019 to 2020,  also  for  the  purpose  of  strategic investment. Accordingly, this will lead to an increase in the adjusted retained cash flow over the period 2018 to 2020.\n\nI\n\n## Independent Transmission Operator (ITO)\n\nThe  'Independent  Transmission  Operators' must fulfill the European unbundling regulations for greater liberalization of the electricity and natural gas markets. The aim is to increase competition on the European energy market. An  important  prerequisite  here  is  that  the transmission grids are made available to all market participants as a neutral platform in a non-discriminatory way.\n\n## Internal financing capability\n\nThe key performance indicator internal financing capability  describes  the  \u203a  adjusted retained  cash  flow  in  relation  to  the  \u203a  net (cash) investment and is the most significant performance indicator in the period from 2017 to  2020  of  the  Group's  ability  to  finance  its activities internally.\n\n## Intraday trading\n\nIntraday  trading  of  electricity  is  carried  out on both the \u203a EPEX SPOT in Paris and the OTC (Over-the-Counter) market, i.e., via contracts negotiated  off-exchange  between  electricity purchasers and sellers. It describes the continuous purchase and sale of electricity that is delivered on the same day. Therefore, it is also  described  as  short-term  wholesale electricity trading.\n\n## Investment-grade rating\n\nAn investment-grade rating exists if a credit rating  of  at  least  Baa3  (Moody's)  or  BBB(Standard & Poor's) has been issued.\n\n## N\n\n## Net financial debt\n\nNet  financial  debt  comprises  the  financial liabilities (including finance leases) taken on by  the  company less cash and cash equivalents and financial assets that are available to  the  company  for  its  operating  business. Financial liabilities are adjusted for valuation effects from interest-induced hedging transactions and for the portion of equity for the hybrid bonds.\n\n## Net (cash) investment and adjusted net (cash) investment\n\nNet (cash) investment describes the overall cash-relevant  investment  less  the  overall cash-relevant  divestitures  in  the  financial year. In the 2019 financial year, the adjusted net (cash) investment was adjusted to take account  of  accelerated  growth  investment, which has already been paid for the EnBW 2025 growth strategy.\n\n## Net debt\n\nNet\tdebt\tcomprises\t\u203a\tnet\tfinancial\tdebt\tand the\t\u203a\tnet\tdebt\trelating\tto\tpension\tand\tnuclear\n\nobligations.\n\n## Net debt relating to pension and nuclear obligations\n\nNet  debt  relating  to  pension  and  nuclear obligations comprises the provisions for pensions and similar obligations and provisions relating  to  nuclear  power.  These  provisions are netted against receivables relating to the dismantling of nuclear power plants and the \u203a dedicated financial assets.\n\n## Network Development Plan Electricity (NDP Electricity)\n\nThis plan describes the measures that need to be deployed over the next 10 and 20 years to expand  and  restructure  the  German  landbased high-voltage grid to ensure the secure operation  of  the  network.  These  measures make a significant contribution to the integration  of  rapidly  growing  renewable  energies and thus also to the Energiewende. The NDP Electricity is prepared jointly by the four German  transmission  system  operators  every two  years  (since  2016),  before  being  submitted  to  the  German  Federal  Network  Agency (BNetzA) as the responsible regulator.\n\n## Network Development Plan Gas (NDP Gas)\n\nIn the NDP Gas, German gas transmission system  operators  calculate  the  transportation  capacities  that  they  will  require  in the future. The plan is prepared every two years in close cooperation with the German Federal  Network  Agency  (BNetzA)  and  in consultation  with  relevant  market  participants.",

The  key  performance  indicator ROCE  describes  the  relationship  between adjusted  EBIT  including  the  adjusted  investment result and the average capital employed and is thus the central value-oriented performance indicator  of  EnBW  for  assessing  the return  on  capital  employed  in  the  relevant financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sector coupling\n\nSector coupling is the networking of electricity,  heating, mobility and industrial processes for  the  purpose  of  lowering  carbon  dioxide emissions. As sector coupling offers synergy effects in the integration of high proportions of renewable energies, it is viewed as a key concept  for  the  Energiewende  and  the  development  of  energy  systems  using  100%  renewable energies. There is a general consensus that sector coupling is necessary for the implementation  of  the  Energiewende  and  the achievement of climate protection targets.\n\n## Smart grid\n\nThe  smart  electricity  grid:  a  communication and  control  network  that  monitors  and  optimizes the operation of its interconnected elements - from electricity generators, storage systems,  consumers  of  electricity  and  network  operating  equipment  in  energy  transmission and distribution grids. The aim is to optimize the supply of energy by operating the system efficiently, reliably and cost-effectively.\n\n## Special technical equipment for grids\n\nSpecial  technical  equipment  for  grids  are generation plants that will secure the electricity  supply  in  the  event  of  grid-related  supply bottlenecks after the last nuclear power plants have been shut down.\n\n## Spot market\n\nMarket on which electricity supply and procurement quantities are offered and requested for the following day.\n\n## System services\n\nThe  complete  set  of  services  required  to ensure the quality of electricity supplies: provision of operating reserves, maintaining frequency  stability,  maintaining  voltage  levels, re-establishing supply, management services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nT\n\n## TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures)\n\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD)  has  developed  recommendations  for  the  climate-related  opportunity  and  risk  reporting  by  companies. Companies  are  encouraged  to  disclose climate-related information - in the four key areas of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics and Targets - where such information  is  considered  material  for  the company.
