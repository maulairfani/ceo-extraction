We have been continuously working to strengthen the business foundation, a basic policy of the first Medium-Term Management Plan, while also endeavoring to develop and strengthen our growth businesses.\n\nThe business environment surrounding the ENEOS Group is changing rapidly. These changes include the acceleration of the worldwide trend toward a decarbonized, recycling-oriented society. Additionally, the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic have become even more challenging and protracted than anticipated.\n\nIn the Integrated Report 2021, we clarify the challenges and measures put into place to achieve the Long-Term Vision in the midst of this dramatically changing business environment, and also report on our progress to date. The report also contains information on material ESG issues that we have reviewed based on the Group's current situation and the state of society. Going forward, we will continue our disclosures in order to provide our stakeholders with ample information that is clear, concise and easily accessible.\n\nTo remain an essential company in the future, we will continue to fulfill our social mission of providing a stable supply of the energy and materials that are vital to our everyday lives and the economy, while accelerating structural reforms with an eye toward sustainable, stable growth.\n\nWe ask for your continued support.\n\nSeptember 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSugimori Tsutomu\n\nRepresentative Director, Chairman of the Board, Group CEO ENEOS Holdings, Inc.\n\nOta Katsuyuki\n\nRepresentative Director, President ENEOS Holdings, Inc.\n\n04",

The pandemic has brought about major changes in our values in terms of day-to-day life. However, these changes are consistent with the progression of the three changes in the business environment we envisioned when we developed our Long-Term Vision to 2040, namely, a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society; digital innovation; and lifestyle changes. In fact, we think the pace of these changes will continue to accelerate. Therefore, we must speed up the initiatives we are planning and achieve results in order to address these changes and realize our Long-Term Vision.\n\nWe are also pursuing ESG management. In terms of 'environmental,' our Executive Council and other company organizations are discussing our response to future management risks and opportunities posed by societal changes.

We will further speed up business structure reforms and ensure that top management exhibits strong leadership, not only with an eye toward 2040, but also during the transition phase leading up to 2040. Under the key phrase 'taking on the challenge of transformation,' we are making strong efforts, knowing that if we don't change now, we won't be able to change in the future.\n\nFiscal 2020 marked the first fiscal year of the second Medium-Term Management Plan. Can you provide an update on the results and progress of your core businesses?\n\nWe recorded an increase in profits over the previous fiscal year by steadily implementing various measures tailored to market conditions.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, sales volumes of petroleum products declined substantially due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but operating income excluding inventory valuation rose year on year to 215.5 billion yen, underpinned by a robust petroleum product margin and rising copper prices, among other factors. Using the positive outcomes gained from maximized synergies of the business integration and strengthening of the financial base achieved under the first Medium-Term Management Plan as a foothold, we embarked on further structural reforms and steadily implemented various measures to develop and strengthen our growth businesses. We are also focusing on collaboration with outside parties in the areas of research and development and new business creation. In addition to promoting industry-academia collaboration with universities, we are seeking out partnerships with venture companies through investments in venture capital and implementation of an accelerator program. These efforts are helping us to pursue open innovation. The following is an overview of our business results for fiscal 2020.\n\n## Petroleum refining & marketing business Restructuring of our refinery and plant network\n\nIn October 2020, the refining function was terminated at the Osaka Refinery, operated by Osaka International Refining Company, Limited, a joint venture with PetroChina International (Japan) Co., Ltd., and relocated to the Chiba Refinery in December the same year. In addition, we will cease production at the Chita Plant around October 2021 and plan to decommission part of the facilities at the Negishi Refinery around October 2022.\n\n## Next-generation energy supply and community services business Expansion of renewable energy power generation business\n\nWe began commercial operation at the Muroran Biomass Power Plant, the largest such plant in Japan, and also participated in a number of solar power, onshore wind power and offshore wind power projects across Japan. We also started operations at three more mega solar power plants built on idle land in Japan.\n\n## Development of virtual power plants (VPP)\n\nWe launched verification testing of VPP to control energy resources, including energy storage systems and our in-house power generation facilities. The verification testing included testing at service stations, a first in Japan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the speed of growth in the semiconductor market driven by growing demand for mobile devices and telecommunications infrastructure, we have decided to increase production capacity of sputtering targets for semiconductors by an additional 30% or so from current levels.\n\n## Environmentally conscious businesses\n\n## Increased collection and processing capacity of raw metal materials for recycling\n\nIn addition to increasing the collection and processing capacity at our recycling center in Taiwan, we decided to establish a logistics base in Oita Prefecture and increase the pre-processing capacity for raw materials at the nearby Saganoseki Smelter & Refinery.\n\n## Metal resources development, copper smelting and refining business Acquisition of all interests in the Caserones Copper Mine\n\nWe acquired all of the interests in the Caserones Copper Mine owned by our joint investment partners in order to secure high grade, clean copper concentrate.\n\nWhat is the current status of your initiatives to strengthen the management foundation?\n\nWe continue to focus on human resources development and diversity and inclusion, while laying the groundwork for a corporate culture that encourages transformation.\n\nThe importance of human resources for our growth remains unchanged. Our work styles changed a great deal during the COVID-19 pandemic. To enable our employees to generate in-depth transformation and innovative ideas, we introduced project manager training and expanded optional training and seminars for self-development to support autonomous career development. We are also focusing on the development of future management resources, who will be charged with increasing corporate value over the medium to long term.

I expect that work-life balance will lead to even more ideas for transformation and value creation.\n\nAt the same time, in terms of diversity and inclusion, we have increased the ratio of women among new hires and women in managerial positions with each passing year, but we can still improve in terms of building a workforce with diverse age groups, career experience, nationalities and values. In addition to systems and training mindful of diversity and inclusion, executive management will actively get involved in building an environment for daily internal communication where each and every employee respects individuality and can develop their full potential.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we began delegating authority to increase the speed of management's decision-making and business execution as well as strengthen the supervisory function of the Board of Directors through enhanced monitoring. While I feel good progress has been made, we need to accelerate the structural reforms aimed at achieving our Long-Term Vision. We will share management's direction with employees and pursue management with rapid decision-making and execution capabilities under the appropriate supervision of the Board of Directors.\n\nPlease explain the earnings outlook for the period of the second Medium-Term Management Plan, released in May 2021, which takes into account the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe outlook includes an impact of negative 500.0 billion yen for the three-year period, and we will continue our efforts to compensate for this impact.\n\nThe second Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2020-2022), announced in May 2020, only included the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of fiscal 2020. Unfortunately, the timing of the end of pandemic remains difficult to predict. Therefore, in May 2021 we prepared a revised earnings forecast for the second Medium-Term Management Plan, assuming that the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue until fiscal 2022.\n\nAs of May 2021, compared to our initial plan, we anticipate that profits will decline by 500.0 billion yen cumulatively over the three years of the second Medium-Term Management Plan due mainly to the impacts of the pandemic, including declining export volumes of jet fuel and other petroleum products, deteriorating product market conditions overseas, and restrictions on operations at the Caserones Copper Mine. Based on these factors, we forecast operating income excluding inventory valuation of 760.0 billion yen over the three years, falling short of the target of 970.0 billion yen, even after reflecting our additional measures to cut costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the movement toward a decarbonized and recycling-oriented society will accelerate further and domestic petroleum demand will undoubtedly continue to decline. Therefore, the direction and scale of our investments remain unchanged in order to speed up the development and strengthening of growth businesses aimed at structural reforms and the restructuring of our business portfolio.\n\nManagement will continue working to achieve the targets of the Medium-Term Management Plan despite the difficulty of forecasting the future business environment, including when exactly the COVID-19 pandemic will be under control.",

The movement toward carbon neutrality is picking up steam around the world, making it a material issue for us as a group of energy and materials companies.\n\nCurrently, we are working on promoting energy conservation at our production bases, switching to renewable energy to power the Caserones Copper Mine, and expanding our renewable energy business in Japan and abroad.\n\nOver the long term, there are growing expectations for the potential of next-generation energy, especially CO2-free hydrogen and synthetic fuels made from renewable energy.\n\nFirst, with regard to CO2-free hydrogen, we were among the first to focus on hydrogen as a next-generation form of energy and we have actively built up our hydrogen station network. In recent years, there has been even greater interest in and expectations for hydrogen, so we intend to grow hydrogen into a major pillar of our business portfolio in the future. There is a wealth of untapped resources overseas in terms of renewable energy and lignite. We are exploring the possibility of producing and procuring low-cost CO2-free hydrogen overseas and then supplying it to the domestic market. Our nationwide network of refineries can be utilized as hubs for receiving, storing and shipping CO2-free hydrogen from overseas; therefore, we will speed up our commercialization study while working closely with various partners.\n\nNext is synthetic fuels made from renewable energy (CO2-free fuels). These fuels are alternatives to petroleum products made from hydrogen derived from renewable energy and CO2. Since CO2 is recovered as a raw material from the exhaust gas of power plants, there is no net increase in CO2 in the atmosphere when using these fuels. In addition, synthetic fuels have nearly the same characteristics as petroleum products, which means the entire supply chain, including existing refineries, storage and transport facilities, and service stations, can be repurposed, and the fuels can be used as aviation and automotive fuels without modification. Therefore, we believe these fuels have the potential for rapid growth once the production technology is established. To this end, we are now working to develop the production processes and catalysts.\n\nTo achieve a decarbonized society, we need to build a platform for supply bases and networks for next-generation energy. We will explore the establishment of independent energy supply systems driven by local production for local consumption, the stabilization and streamlining of intra-regional energy supply using storage batteries, and the provision of new value-added services, including mobility services.\n\nThrough these efforts, we aim to become carbon neutral in terms of our own CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2040. Switching to CO2-free energy in all social infrastructure is needed to reduce the CO2 emissions of our customers (Scope 3). Here, CO2-free hydrogen and synthetic fuels made from renewable energy, which we are now working on, will play a substantial role.",

Our current policy on shareholder returns remains the same. We will target a total return ratio of 50% or more of net income excluding inventory valuation cumulatively over three years and maintain the dividend at the current level or above.

We also commenced operations at three new mega solar power plants in Japan using idle land and participated in solar as well as onshore and offshore wind power generation projects across Japan. We started verification trials on a virtual power plant (VPP) that uses an energy management system (EMS) to control a storage battery system and our own power generation facilities as part of our efforts to build a system that can supply CO2-free electricity in a stable manner.\n\nIn Japan, we opened four new hydrogen stations. We also participated in multiple projects that evaluated commercial viability and technological development of and conducted verification trials for building a future supply chain that can supply hydrogen made from inexpensive CO2-free energy produced overseas to Japan in a\n\n## Strengthening the Business Foundation\n\nstable manner. Furthermore, we moved ahead with technological development to build a supply chain that can procure fuels made from inexpensive CO2-free energy produced overseas.\n\nTo build the ENEOS Platform, we are now exploring opportunities in community services as well as the mobility and lifestyle support businesses. To contribute to appealing and sustainable community development through collaboration with community partners, we concluded a basic agreement with Shizuoka Prefecture and Shizuoka City for the promotion of next-generation energy and community development in the Sodeshi area of Shimizu, Shizuoka City.\n\nIn the mobility business, we are continuing with verification trials for ENEOS Car Share and commenced the nationwide rollout of ENEOS Car Lease using our service station network.

We are now exploring additional possibilities after signing a basic agreement with Shizuoka Prefecture and Shizuoka City, where one of our refineries was formerly located, to build an energy supply platform.\n\nIn terms of renewable energy, we are accelerating business expansion with the goal of increasing our total generation capacity in Japan and overseas to more than 1 GW by fiscal 2022. To this end, in fiscal 2020 we continued expanding our portfolio of mega solar power plants using idle land and started commercial operations at the Muroran Biomass Power Plant, the largest such plant in Japan.\n\nWith an eye toward increasing future generation capacity, we decided to join a solar power generation project in Ako District, Hyogo Prefecture, the Mutsu Ogawara Onshore Wind Farm in Kamikita District, Aomori Prefecture, and the wind power projects offshore of Happo Town and Noshiro City in Akita Prefecture and offshore of Goto City in Nagasaki Prefecture. We are also working on distributed power source development, and launched the ENEOS Zero Setup Cost Solar Service in fiscal 2020.\n\nWe are also expanding initiatives for renewable energy outside of Japan, and decided to participate in solar power generation projects in Australia and the United States. The solar power generation project in Australia shows promise for the manufacture of CO2-free hydrogen.\n\nTo achieve a mass supply of inexpensive CO2-free hydrogen from overseas, we are working on development initiatives for proprietary technologies and a broad range of verification trials through alliances. Our proprietary Direct MCH fi technology simplifies the process of manufacturing methylcyclohexane (MCH), a carrier of hydrogen, from renewable energy, which is expected to greatly lower costs. We already established the technolo-\n\ngy during the research and development stage, so going forward we plan to conduct large-scale verification trials.\n\nIn terms of CO2-free hydrogen manufactured overseas, we are working to build a hydrogen supply chain where we can import to our refineries and use our hydrogen stations as community hubs for supplying CO2-free hydrogen to customers in a stable manner.\n\nWe are moving ahead with various initiatives utilizing a broad range of alliances, including collaboration with Saudi Aramco and a review of hydrogen supply derived from hydroelectric power generation in Malaysia. As part of our efforts to build a CO2-free hydrogen supply system in Japan, we are supplying hydrogen to Woven City, a demonstration city operated by Toyota Motor Corporation, and participating in a demonstration project for hydrogen manufacture and supply using renewable energy in Kitakyushu City.\n\nCO2-free fuels, made by combining hydrogen derived from renewable energy and CO2, can be used without modification in existing engines and the fuel supply infrastructure, and we are now working to build a supply system for these fuels. Utilizing the ultra-high-speed AI-driven molecular simulator co-developed with Preferred Networks, Inc., we are now developing manufacturable catalysts at a higher efficiency in order to streamline the manufacture of CO2-free fuels.\n\nIn addition, looking toward rising demand for bio jet fuel in the future, we are conducting a commercialization review of sustainable jet fuel manufacturing using waste, including waste plastics, as part of our efforts to build a supply system for CO2-free fuel.\n\n## Diagram of Japan's First VPP Verification Trial at Service Stations\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, we do not believe that sales volumes of petroleum products will return to the levels seen in 2019 due to the continuing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the challenging business environment has carried over from the last fiscal year, we will do our best to further increase profits by implementing a number of initiatives, including cost-cutting measures.\n\n|                                                 | (Billion yen)   | (Billion yen)   | (Billion yen)                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                 | FY2019 Actual   | FY2020 Actual   | FY2021 Forecast as of May 2021 |\n| Net sales                                       | 10,011.8        | 7,658.0         | 9,500.0                        |\n| Operating income                                | -113.1          | 254.2           | 260.0                          |\n| Operating income excluding inventory valuation  | 96.7            | 215.5           | 230.0                          |\n| Net income attributable to owners of the parent | -187.9          | 114.0           | 140.0                          |\n\n## Operating Income Excluding Inventory Valuation\n\n<!-- image -->",

Today, the pandemic continues and it is difficult to predict when it will be under control. We anticipate that the negative impacts on operating income if this situation persists until the end of fiscal 2022 will amount to 500.0 billion yen cumulatively over the plan's three-year period.\n\nBased on this assumption, we intend to continue with cost-cutting measures and asset sales, among other measures. As of May 2021, we forecast three-year cumulative operating income excluding inventory valuation of 760.0 billion yen, which is 210.0 billion yen less than the initial plan.\n\nIn terms of our investment plan, we will maintain the direction and scale set out in the Medium-Term Management Plan so that we can pursue business structure reforms compatible with a decarbonized and recycling-oriented society. At the same time, we will carry out asset sales and other measures to secure positive free cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2022, we expect our net debt-to-equity ratio to be 0.8 times or lower and ROE to be 7%. In addition, we have issued publicly offered hybrid corporate bonds worth 300 billion yen to fund strategic investments for the future and maintaining our financial soundness.\n\nThe business environment surrounding the Group is changing rapidly. To achieve the envisioned goals in the Long-Term Vision, we will speed up development of growth businesses and transform our business portfolio in accordance with the business strategies and investment plan of the second Medium-Term Management Plan.",

We will target a total shareholder return of at least 50% of net income excluding inventory valuation for the cumulative three years. As for the dividend for fiscal 2021, we plan to pay a dividend of 22 yen per share and we will ensure that it does not fall below the level paid out in fiscal 2020, regardless of our profit situation.

Comprehensive discussions (held annually in the third quarter) (see (1) in diagram below)\n\nThe Executive Council comprehensively discusses the following matters to ensure effective discussion and quick decision-making.\n\n- \u00b7 Material risks identi/fied through the enterprise risk management (ERM) system (see page 65)\n- \u00b7 Material ESG issues identi/fied through ESG risk analysis\n- \u00b7 Internal control risks identi/fied through the internal control system (see page 65)\n\n## 2. Determination of responses and status confirmation (annually in the first quarter) (see (2) in diagram below)\n\nUnder the guidance of the departments in charge at ENEOS Holdings, the relevant departments and principal operating companies work together in a cross-functional manner to develop and implement responses for the identi/fied risks and material issues.\n\nThe Executive Council con/firms the status of responses\n\n## ESG Management Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Example: Internal Control Department and Legal & Corporate Affairs Department work together to build and operate a comprehensive internal control structure (see page 65)\n\n\uff5c",

Reporting to the Board of Directors (as needed) (see (4) in diagram at left below)\n\nThe Board of Directors passes resolutions on management, medium-term management plans and budgets, and also performs monitoring and supervision by receiving reports (once a year, in principle) on risks and material issues determined by the Executive Council and on the status of responses.\n\nIn /fiscal 2020, the following ESG-related matters were reported to the Board of Directors.\n\n- \u00b7 Fiscal 2019 performance results and /fiscal 2020 action plans\n- \u00b7 Responses to speci/fic issues\n- \u00b7 TCFD recommendations\n- \u00b7 Business and human rights\n- \u00b7 CSR procurement\n\n## 5.

We believe that developing practical solutions to climate change will enable us to continuously generate profits into the future. As a clear expression of our intent, we established the following as our envisioned goals in our Long-Term Vision to 2040: become one of the most prominent and internationally competitive energy and materials company groups in Asia, create value by transforming our current business structure, and contribute to the development of a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society. We have also stated our intent to achieve carbon neutrality in our own emissions by 2040.\n\nTo succeed in these endeavors, we are implementing comprehensive measures to reduce energy consumption at our\n\n## Governance System for Climate Change\n\nThe Company's Executive Council, chaired by its president, deliberates on the Group's response to climate change, including in future business plans, and manages and evaluates the status of climate initiatives from a cross-functional perspective.

Using this information, the Group identified three long-term trends in the business environment: the development of a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society, digital innovation, and lifestyle changes.\n\nBy 2040, the Group envisions the mass introduction of renewable energy; the replacement of gasoline and diesel cars\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith electric vehicles (EVs), used for car sharing and energy storage; distributed energy resources with energy storage; and recycling technology and infrastructure for metals and plastic. Although we expect domestic fuel demand to decline to half the 2017 level, we also foresee a great increase in demand for hydrogen and renewable energy in line with the shift to a low carbon, recycling-oriented society.\n\nIn addition, with the progression of digital innovation, demand is expected to rise dramatically for copper, a base metal, raw materials for recycling, and high-performance and advanced materials required for digital devices.\n\n## Changes in the Business Environment\n\n## Digital innovation\n\n## Lifestyle changes\n\n- \u00b7 Rapid progress of Internet society and blockchain technology\n- \u00b7 Dramatic improvement in productivity with IoT, AI, robotics, etc.\n- \u00b7 Electrification (shift to EVs, autonomous driving, etc.)\n\nScenario in 2040\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Low-carbon, recycling-oriented society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uff5c\n\n- \u00b7 Growing world economy, especially in Asia, and people seeking abundant life\n- \u00b7 People active until 100 years old\n- \u00b7 Congestion in urban areas and greater need for community development\n- \u00b7 Growth of sharing economy, preference for experiences rather than material possessions\n\n## Development of a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society\n\n- \u00b7 Ever-increasing global warming concerns (including extreme weather events and natural disasters worldwide)\n- \u00b7 Rapidly decreasing cost of renewable energy and battery storage\n- \u00b7 Natural resource conservation efforts worldwide (rare metals, plastic waste, etc.)",

Financial impacts of transition risks\n\n## (1) Higher costs for achieving carbon neutrality\n\nThe ENEOS Group will work to become carbon neutral in its own emissions by reducing CO2 emissions by 17 million tons by 2040. We will achieve this by reducing our environmental burden and strengthening our environmentally conscious businesses. If we were to acquire carbon credits commensurate with a 17-million-ton reduction in CO2 emissions, our costs would increase by about 90 billion yen 1 .\n\n- 1 Carbon credit price (52 USD/tCO2 [IEA World Energy Outlook 2020 ]) \u00d7 volume (17 million tons) \u00d7 exchange rate\n\n## (2) Declining demand for petroleum due to advancements in EV technologies / Declining demand for petroleum due to growing environmental awareness\n\nDemand for petroleum in Japan is projected to fall by around 40% by 2040 compared with the 2019 level according to the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) 2 in the IEA World Energy\n\n## 2. Financial impacts of physical risks\n\n## (1) Increasing frequency and severity of wind and flood damage caused by extreme weather events\n\n## (major typhoons)\n\nBased on repair expenses following major typhoons in fiscal 2018 and 2019, we estimate that such expenses could total about 2 billion yen if our facilities were damaged by a typhoon of similar scale.\n\n## Response to Physical Risks\n\nDuring the capex planning stage, the Group examines risks associated with localized wind and flood damage caused by extreme weather events and rising sea levels, and takes action as necessary, including incorporating these risks into its business continuity plan (BCP).\n\nFor example, the 10 ENEOS refineries in Japan are geographically dispersed, resulting in a supply system where refineries in one area are able to offset, to a certain degree, any impacts that may arise if refineries in another area are unable to operate at full capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutlook 2020 report. We expect that this drop in demand will reduce operating income from petroleum and other products in the Energy business by about 40 billion yen 3 annually from fiscal 2020 to 2022, the period of the second Medium-Term Management Plan.\n\n- 2 The scenario incorporates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to countries' plans for Nationally Determined Contributions.\n- 3 FY2020-2022: 305 billion yen \u00f7 3 years \u00d7 40%\n\n## (3) Stranding of upstream oil assets\n\nUpstream oil assets owned by the Group consisted of reserves totaling 452 million barrels oil equivalent as of March 31, 2021, equivalent to 46 million barrels of annual production volume over the next 10 years. Therefore, we believe that the long-term risk of stranding of upstream oil assets is low. In fiscal 2020, operating income from oil and natural gas development projects came to 2.8 billion yen.\n\n## (2) Rising sea levels caused by global warming\n\nAbout 1 billion yen in expenses was needed annually for measures to deal with rising sea levels in fiscal 2018 and 2019, including expenses for increasing the number of water pumps and raising the height of structures affected by high tides. Assuming the same measures will continue, around 1 billion yen will be needed every fiscal year going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uff5c",

Financial impacts of opportunities\n\n## (1) Increasing demand for raw materials for recycling\n\nDemand for base metals like copper and various rare metals is expected to increase in the future in line with the shift to a decarbonized, recycling-oriented society, combined with digital innovation. Therefore, making greater use of raw materials for recycling will be important for meeting such growing demand.\n\nIn our copper smelting and refining business, raw materials for recycling currently make up about 12% of the total amount of raw materials needed, but we are working to increase this percentage to 50%. In fiscal 2020, operating income from copper smelting and recycling amounted to about 30 billion yen, and we aim to increase this amount going forward.\n\n- For more information, see 'Hybrid Smelting' on page 30.\n\n## (2) Increasing demand for hydrogen and renewable energy\n\nWith the shift to a decarbonized, recycling-oriented society, demand for hydrogen, renewable energy and EVs is expected to grow. Based on estimates of the size of these markets in 2040, as well as assumptions regarding the Group's market share and operating income rate, we estimate that operating income in these businesses could reach about 100 billion yen by that year. Therefore, we are proactively expanding these growth businesses, while paying close attention to economic feasibility, in order to raise our corporate value.\n\n- For more information, see 'Building a Supply Chain for CO2-Free Electricity, Hydrogen and Fuels' on page 23.\n\nAn electric car sharing service verification trial underway in Saitama City\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (3) Expansion of initiatives to reduce environmental impacts in the mobility industry / Increasing demand for functional and thin-film materials needed for electrification\n\nWith the shift to a decarbonized, recycling-oriented society, the growth of next-generation vehicles, particularly EVs, is anticipated, but demand for automobile tires is expected to increase regardless of the power source change. Consequently, the global market for synthetic rubber is projected to increase by between two and three percent annually.\n\nENEOS has acquired JSR Corporation's elastomers business, which includes the manufacture and sale of synthetic rubber, and will supply the main product of this business, an advanced raw material for the treads of high-performance, fuel-efficient tires, thereby helping to reduce environmental impacts. We forecast about 10 billion yen in operating income from this elastomers business by fiscal 2023, and expect it to continue steadily in the future.\n\n- For more information, see 'Acquisition of Elastomers Business' on page 24.\n\nWith the advancement of digital innovation, high-performance and advanced materials needed for IoT, AI and robotics are expected to remain in high demand. The Group has already secured a share of about 60% in the global functional and thin-film materials markets, which includes sputtering targets for semiconductors and targets for magnetic materials. Our functional materials business and thin-film materials business generated a combined total of about 30 billion yen in operating income in fiscal 2020, and we seek to further increase income from these businesses in the future. Our Metals business, which includes copper mining and smelting as well as resource recycling, generated about 80 billion yen in operating income in fiscal 2020, and we expect continued steady growth of this business due to the anticipated increase in copper demand.\n\n- For more information, see 'Increasing Production Capacity' on page 29.\n\n## Building a Business Portfolio That Addresses Risks and Opportunities\n\nWe are accelerating structural reforms to build a resilient business portfolio that will enable us to respond to risks and opportunities that have been identified and achieve sustainable growth. In building our business portfolio, we have largely categorized the Group's businesses into growth businesses, where we will increase strategic investment, and base businesses.

We pursue recycling and reuse through initiatives for waste reduction, including using the collected particulate matter and sludge released from oil refineries as raw materials for cement, and the repeated use of neutralized slag at our smelting and refining facilities.

The JX Metals Endowed Unit is using industry-academia collaboration to advance various initiatives to cultivate human resources to develop and apply smelting and refining technologies in the non-ferrous base metals and rare metals fields.\n\nPhase 2, started in 2017, continues the Phase 1 activities, started in 2012, which include symposiums, workshops, and other opportunities for learning about nonferrous metals. Phase 2 also emphasizes public relations to highlight the importance and future potential of the nonferrous metals field to the general public. Central to this appeal are young people of high school age and below, as we seek to secure human resources to lead the next generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Landfill Disposal Volume and Waste-to-Landfill Ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * In fiscal 2020, we maintained zero emissions (waste-to-landfill ratio of less than 1%) despite a significant increase in landfill disposal volume due to factors such as the start of operation of the Muroran Biomass Power Plant and the inclusion of figures from JX Nippon Mining & Metals affiliate Taniobis.\n\n## Example of Activities\n\n## Participation in an international alliance on worldwide plastic waste\n\nENEOS Holdings joined the international organization Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) in April 2021, becoming the first member from the energy industry in Japan.\n\nA non-profit organization affiliated with government agencies, environmental and economic development NGOs, and communities around the world, AEPW focuses on projects addressing plastic waste issues in the four areas of infrastructure development, innovation, education & engagement, and clean-up. We are currently studying chemical recycling technology to reuse waste plastics as raw materials for petroleum refining and petrochemicals. By participating in AEPW, we are contributing to addressing the issue of plastic waste from a global perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also held a seminar on the inclusion of female employees and employees with small children for managers with subordinates who have young families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Training for female employees\n\nWe set up career promotion meetings for female employees to encourage interactions with women in leadership positions and to assist in forming networks among female employees. As part of this effort, we held networking events for female employees at manufacturing sites in fiscal 2020. The events included lively group discussions about the unique rewards and challenges of working in manufacturing and participants' visions for their future careers.\n\nwe consider disability to be one of many characteristics that make up a person's individuality.\n\nEncouraging employees to take annual paid leave is one of our measures for ensuring a healthy work environment. While raising awareness in each organization of the company about planning for and taking paid leave, we strive to foster a culture where it is easy to take paid leave by encouraging employees to take consecutive paid leave days and designate one day a year as a personal 'memorial day' to take paid leave.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, our measures to prevent the spread of infection included expanding and revising the telework system. At present, roughly 30% of our head office staff is working at the office. Telework will remain a part of our efforts to increase the variety of work styles we accommodate.\n\nMeasures to support employee health management include increasing the participation rate in regular health checkups and cancer screenings, preventing infectious diseases and implementing mental health measures. The Company has been certified as a Health and Productivity Management Outstanding Organization under the large enterprise category for four consecutive years for our active efforts to promote employee health.\n\n- * See the ENEOS Report: ESG Data Book 2021 (available on our website in January 2022) for further details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.hd.eneos.co.jp/english/csr/ ESG Data Book-Healthy Work Environment / Health",

The results and analysis of the survey were reported to the Board of Directors on March 26, 2021.\n\nAll of the survey questions received mostly positive responses, and the results indicated that the Board of Directors generally continues to be effective. Regarding the two issues identi/fied in last year's evaluation survey, the /first issue, 'further separation of business management and execution,' was evaluated as having improved through better organization\n\nof the matters for Board discussion and by improving the environment to enable better focus during discussions of basic management policy. Regarding the second item, 'strengthening the oversight function,' the Board expanded the reporting of pro/fitability to encompass the progress of investments and the cost of capital for each business area.\n\nIssues raised in the /fiscal 2020 evaluation survey were 'further strengthening the oversight function' and 'raising the quality of discussions by the Board of Directors.' In response, the Board of Directors will consider improvements in monitoring the progress of the Long-Term Vision and Medium-Term Management Plan, discussion of carbon neutrality, providing more timely information about new businesses, and other matters.\n\n## Process for Evaluation of Effectiveness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Policy for Appointing Director Candidates\n\nThe Board of Directors is composed of an appropriate number of members to enable free and constructive discussion and exchange of opinions, with members appointed in consideration of Board diversity and the knowledge, experience and abilities of each member. The Company strives to appoint independent outside directors 4 to at least one-third of director positions. As of June 25, 2021, the percentage of outside independent of/ficers was 37.5%.\n\nAs for directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members, the Company appoints persons with high standards of business ethics, superior strategic thinking and judgment capabilities, and /flexible attitudes toward change, as well as the ability to supervise decision-making and management from the viewpoint of what is best for the Group as a whole. Two or more of the directors are independent outside directors.\n\nAs for directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members, the Company appoints persons with high standards of business ethics, a certain level of specialist knowledge in legal affairs, /finance and accounting, etc., as well as the ability to\n\nappropriately audit the execution of duties by directors and the ability to appropriately supervise the execution of business. The majority of these directors are independent outside directors.\n\n- 4 Outside directors who have satis/fied the Company's 'Standards for Consideration of Independence of Independent Of/ficers'\n\n## Support System for Outside Directors\n\nEach of the three outside directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members and the three outside directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members meet the independence standards based on the rules of the Tokyo and Nagoya stock exchanges, on which the Company is listed. The Company sends materials regarding the agenda of meetings of the Board of Directors to the outside directors, in principle, at least three days prior to meetings, and also provides explanations to the outside directors about important agenda items before the meetings.

Full-time staff members have been assigned to the\n\nof/fice to assist with the duties of the Audit and Supervisory Committee members. In addition, the Board Members' Support Of/fice, with full-time staff members, has also been established to assist outside directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members with business execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Training for Directors and Corporate Auditors of Principal Operating Companies\n\nThe directors of the Company and principal operating companies and the corporate auditors of principal operating companies have the duty of working toward the realization of the Group Philosophy, the sustainable growth of the Group, and the achievement of increased corporate value over the medium to long term.

The information in the table includes the amount of bonuses for fiscal 2020 that is expected to be paid after the 11th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.\n- 3. Bonuses and share-based remuneration are applicable to performance-linked remunerations. In addition, share-based remuneration is applicable to non-monetary remunerations.\n- 4. The share-based remuneration amounts indicated in the table are the average price per share of the Company purchased through the trust that the Company established, multiplied by the number of standard points awarded to the director in the fiscal year and the performance-linked coefficient. The performance-linked coefficient used to calculate the share remuneration for fiscal 2020 is assumed to be 100% because it is determined after fiscal 2022 is finished.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Matters Concerning Bonuses\n\nBonuses are linked to performance within a single /fiscal year and can /fluctuate between 0% and 200% (target: 100%) depending on the level of achievement of performance targets. Bonuses are determined by multiplying the monthly remuneration by the base number of months (8 months) and the percentage of target achieved.\n\nThe indicators that affect shareholder returns and the indicators that re/flect actual performance should be used when calculating the percentage of target achieved. Therefore, 'pro/fit attributable to owners of parent' and 'consolidated operating pro/fit after adjustment' of the Company's consolidated results, as well as 'operating pro/fit' and 'operating pro/fit after adjustment' of the Energy business results are used as performance indicators with a weight of 25% each.\n\nThe /fiscal 2020 performance target for the bonus calculation process was set based on the /fiscal 2020 results forecast\n\n(disclosed in May 2020), and the resulting percentage of target achieved was 185%. The results of each performance indicator to calculate the percentage of target achieved are as follows.\n\n## Performance Indicator Weighting\n\n| Performance indicators                                   | Weight   | Results in FY2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|\n| Profit attributable to owners of parent                  | 25%      | 114.0 billion yen   |\n| Consolidated operating profit after adjustment           | 25%      | 306.6 billion yen   |\n| Operating profit of the Energy business                  | 25%      | 121.1 billion yen   |\n| Operating profit of the Energy business after adjustment | 25%      | 139.7 billion yen   |\n\nNotes:\n\n- 1. 'Consolidated operating profit after adjustment' and 'operating profit after adjustment' are calculated by subtracting temporary gain/loss, such as gain/loss on sale of fixed assets and shares and loss by disasters, from the operating profit made by the main business.\n- 2. Until June 2020, 'profit attributable to owners of parent' and 'consolidated operating profit after adjustment' of the Company's consolidated results were used as performance indicators with a weight of 50% each, and the percentage of target achieved was 192%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Matters Concerning Share-based Remuneration\n\nShare-based remuneration is linked to performance over three successive /fiscal years and can /fluctuate between 0% and 200%",

The percentages achieved for operating profit excluding inventory valuation, free cash flow, and total return ratio are calculated using the accumulated results from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2022.\n\n- 3. The percentages achieved for net D/E ratio and ROE are calculated using the results for fiscal 2022.\n- 4.

The rollout of these systems began in /fiscal 2018 at the Company and ENEOS, and in /fiscal 2020 at other Group companies, including overseas business sites.\n\nIn /fiscal 2021, we will develop a risk information database\n\n\uff5c\n\nfor the integrated storage and management of risk-related information in order to achieve more sophisticated risk management in the Group's management and operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.hd.eneos.co.jp/english/csr/governance/ pdf/system01\\_03.pdf The ENEOS Group Basic Policy on Internal Control System\n\n## Internal Control System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Comprehensive Internal Control Structure\n\nThe Company has established the ENEOS Group Internal Control and Compliance Committee, chaired by the of/ficer responsible for the Internal Control Department and vice-chaired by the of/ficer responsible for the Legal & Corporate Affairs Department. The committee works to continuously improve the internal control system for the ENEOS Group.\n\nThe committee con/firms and evaluates the status and operation of the internal control system twice a year, in principle, and reports its /findings to the Executive Council.\n\nEvery April, the committee reports to the Board of Directors on the status and operation of the internal control system and on speci/fic points of policies for initiatives for the /fiscal year. The Board of Directors appropriately monitors and supervises the internal control system for the ENEOS Group and ful/fills its duty of accountability by providing an overview of the operation status in the Business Report section of the Convocation Notice of the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n## Comprehensive Internal Control and Compliance Structure\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the screening of new investments, in addition to country risks and foreign exchange rate risks, we analyze and evaluate ESG-related risks, including environmental risks such as those related to the scope of response to biodiversity and environmental regulations, risks in the procurement of raw materials, including water, and human resources risks, including those related to human rights and occupational health and safety. Based on this, appropriate actions are taken when necessary.\n\nFor example, when reviewing potential investments, we perform screenings based on the stage-gate system. The process from initial examination to execution of an investment project is divided into multiple stages of examination, and deliberations are conducted at each stage. During the deliberations, we clarify various risks, including ESG-related risks, using sensitivity analysis and case analysis, among other means, and take steps to minimize these risks as much as possible. For important investments, follow-up is carried out after a certain period of time has passed to clarify impacts on the initial outlook caused by environmental changes or other factors and to determine whether to continue with the project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Crisis Management\n\nIn the event of a crisis situation that could signi/ficantly affect the management of the Group, the Company responds quickly and appropriately in accordance with the ENEOS Group Rules for Responding to Crises and Emergencies and has systems in place to minimize any damage that may occur.\n\nThe Group's basic stance on crisis situations is to place the highest priority on protecting human life, issue information promptly and implement centralized information management, quickly determine, execute, and follow up the most effective response measures, implement transparent and smooth communications, and prevent recurrence.\n\nThe Crisis Management Department functions as the standing organizational unit in charge of crisis response and management in the event of a crisis situation. The department maintains a system enabling immediate reporting on conditions and the status of response measures from the site of an incident.\n\nDepending on the magnitude of the crisis, we may set up a response headquarters, led by the president, and organize response teams at the head of/fice and at the site of the incident to ensure agile and effective response.\n\nThe Group's basic policy is to (1) place the highest priority on respect for human life and make every effort to protect against and prevent the spread of infectious diseases to the Group's of/ficers, employees and their families, and (2) engage all Group companies in maintaining a continuous supply of our products that support the functioning of society. In the event that management is signi/ficantly affected by an infectious disease epidemic, a system is in place to set up a response headquarters, led by the president, to ensure the prompt determination and execution of countermeasures.\n\nENEOS has business continuity plans at its head of/fice, branch of/fices, re/fineries, and other sites to ensure that we can ful/fill our responsibility of providing a stable supply of petroleum products, even during an epidemic. In addition, to protect employees from infection and prevent the spread of disease, we systematically stockpile surgical masks, goggles, alcohol-based disinfectants, and other items at our business sites in Japan and overseas, and we also maintain a system and an IT environment that enable employees to work from home.\n\nOur efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, implemented since the beginning of 2020, include the following in addition to the above.\n\n## Examples of COVID-19 countermeasures\n\n- 1. Encouraging employees to work from home (excluding employees at production and distribution sites)\n- 2. Refraining from non-essential domestic business trips\n- 3. Prohibiting overseas business trips\n- 4. Enabling remote participation in training and meetings\n- 5. Refraining from holding or attending social gatherings and events\n\nIn addition, at ENEOS re/fineries and plants, we worked to ensure the continuation of a stable supply of petroleum products by establishing guidelines to prevent infections at our sites, and thoroughly implementing countermeasures, including the following, to prevent the virus from entering our sites and to prevent mass infections.\n\n## Examples of COVID-19 countermeasures\n\n- 1. Ensuring the use of masks and proper ventilation\n- 2. Checking the temperature of employees and visitors when they enter the sites\n- 3. Limiting the number of people using cafeterias, changing rooms, and bathing facilities\n- 4. Recommending the use of private cars and avoiding public transport when commuting to work\n- 5. Refraining from visiting areas with high infection rates\n\n<!-- image -->",

No signi/ficant legal violations occurred within the Group in /fiscal 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal Control and Compliance Structure\n\nThe Internal Control and Compliance Committee has been established under the Executive Council to ensure the implementation of effective and ef/ficient internal control and compliance. The committee, comprising relevant of/ficers and department managers, regularly con/firms the performance of and issues related to the Group's internal control and compliance activities and deliberates policies for future activities (see Comprehensive Internal Control Structure on page 65).\n\n## Establishment and Operation of Internal Reporting Systems\n\nTo enable prompt detection and corrective action in the event of legal violations, ENEOS Holdings and some of its subsidiaries maintain internal reporting systems (compliance hotlines) for their employees and those of contractor companies. Persons making reports have the option of identifying themselves or remaining anonymous, and the systems also facilitate contact with reporting contacts outside the companies. We have also introduced internal reporting systems, including some with multilingual capabilities, at overseas subsidiaries where we have ownership of more than 50%.\n\nBased on internal regulations, when a report is received, the content is reported to the relevant of/ficers, including the chairman and president, and an investigation is launched. The investigation results, any necessary corrective measures and recurrence prevention measures are reported to the of/ficers, and a response is carried out under their guidance. Individuals who identify themselves when making reports are also informed of the investigation results.\n\nTo ensure that employees do not hesitate to use the system, they are informed through the intranet, posters, and training that the identity of those making reports is strictly con/fidential and that reports can be made even if the employee is not sure if the matter constitutes a legal violation.\n\nIn /fiscal 2020, the Group recorded 123 reports via its internal reporting systems.\n\n## Internal Control and Compliance Inspections\n\nWe conduct internal control and legal compliance inspections annually as a voluntary initiative to ascertain the status of internal control and legal compliance.\n\nSpeci/fically, we inspect each business operation to ascertain compliance with Group-wide rules (internal control standards). In addition, as the management environment is rapidly changing, we use a risk control matrix to ascertain whether risks have been appropriately identi/fied and assessed, and whether effective controls for these risks have been developed and implemented. We also utilize interviews of all staff by managers to identify compliance issues, including questions and concerns, in order to prevent legal violations and to identify and correct any issues at an early stage.\n\nThe Group identi/fied approximately 400 compliance issues, questions, and concerns in /fiscal 2020. None of the issues signi/ficantly impacted management. The Company resolved 70% of the issues within the /fiscal year and is taking steps to promptly address the remaining 30% of unresolved issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance Training\n\nStrong awareness among all of/ficers and employees is an important element in achieving thorough compliance. To this end, we issue ENEOS Group Philosophy cards and ENEOS Group Code of Conduct handbooks to all personnel and regularly provide compliance training for all of/ficers and employees.\n\nIn /fiscal 2020, we conducted training on competition laws, bribery, security trade control, and the protection of personal information, focusing on important laws and regulations. We will continue to provide training on relevant topics as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure thorough compliance.\n\n## Competition Law Compliance and Anti-Corruption Initiatives\n\nAs part of its efforts to achieve thorough compliance, the Group established and disclosed the Competition Law Compliance Policy and the Anti-Corruption Policy for the conduct of fair business practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompetition Law Compliance Policy\n\nhttps://www.hd.eneos.co.jp/english/company/policy/ competition\\_law/index.html\n\nAnti-Corruption Policy\n\nhttps://www.hd.eneos.co.jp/english/company/policy/ anti\\_corruption.html\n\n* See the ENEOS Report: ESG Data Book 2021 (available on the company website in January 2022) for further details about compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhttps://www.hd.eneos.co.jp/english/csr/\n\n\uff5c",

Strengthened monitoring by the Board of Directors and, in particular, the provision of information to outside directors, are essential elements in increasing the effectiveness of corporate governance. The Company holds advance briefings for board members and immediately provides information in the event of serious incidents. Consideration is also given to enabling deep discussion with outside directors, based on discussion by the Executive Council, regarding the progress, items for resolution, and other matters concerning the second Medium-Term Management Plan. The Company has also speeded up decision-making for business execution by delegating authority over individual investment projects to the relevant principal operating companies.\n\nTo enhance the link between execution of the second Medium-Term Management Plan and the Long-Term Vision, the Company needs to improve the content of the information provided by the departments responsible for business execution in order to improve the quality of discussions by the Board of Directors. I will be looking for the Board of Directors to engage in intensive discussions about important management issues and specifically about the Company's direction for the medium and long term. I will also be looking for top executives to share issues raised by stakeholders at the Board of Directors meetings.\n\n## Expectations for the second Medium-Term Management Plan\n\nIn addition to carrying out structural reforms for the long-term decline in oil demand, the Company must ensure the steady operation of its base businesses and develop and strengthen its growth businesses to respond to the dramatic changes in the external environment, such as the SDGs and decarbonization. In\n\nPart\n\n\u2161\n\nESG Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe second Medium-Term Management Plan, the Company has increased investment in growth businesses, and I expect strong leadership by the top executives, backed by Board of Directors decisions, to firmly and steadily implement growth strategies that will guide the Company toward its Long-Term Vision.\n\n## The role of outside directors in achieving targets\n\nFor the Company to achieve its targets, the Board of Directors must closely monitor progress toward those targets. The Company needs to accelerate its structural reforms by developing and strengthening growth businesses, and doing so will require the departments responsible for business execution to make accurate and prompt investment decisions. There will surely be some trial and error in this process. Management must be flexible in the execution of the Medium-Term Management Plan and be ready to withdraw investments if necessary, as well as to update the Long-Term Vision to reflect further changes in society. As an outside director, I will provide my frank opinions and engage in open discussions with the corporate directors.\n\nAs a legal practitioner, I pay particular attention to governance and compliance, which are the basis of corporate management.\n\nIn terms of governance, I believe the Company needs to address the effectiveness of the Board of Directors' checks and balances for maintaining discipline. In terms of compliance, in addition to complying with laws and regulations, the Company must also maintain high ethical standards. Doing so also gives employees a sense of pride in their work. Management needs to be able to flexibly respond to the uncertainties that accompany changes in the external environment, and I believe that compliance as a form of practical theory in risk management is especially important.\n\nI will continue to carry out my responsibility as an outside director to provide frank opinions from a standpoint of governance and compliance.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these briefings were held online in fiscal 2020. Audio presentations of the briefings are available on the corporate website. In addition, regularly scheduled visits to investors, participation in investment conferences and attendance at meetings with overseas investors by the president, the director responsible for investor relations and others were conducted online as the Company made every effort to maintain dialogue with investors during the pandemic.\n\nDue to the pandemic, the Company refrained from holding its regular annual briefings at ENEOS Group refineries, smelters, and other facilities for analysts and institutional investors, and its regular briefings for individual investors. In fiscal 2021, we will carefully consider whether to hold the briefings based on the status of the pandemic and the policies of national and local governments.\n\nThe Investor Relations section of the Company's website contains useful materials for investors, such as financial results, presentation materials, annual and quarterly financial statements, shareholder newsletters, integrated reports, and presentation materials used at shareholder briefings.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company received awards for its IR activities from the following organizations.
