For this reason, and since the COVID-19 crisis erupted, we have had to adapt on a daily basis to a changing reality, where our company's vision and purpose form the basis of the regenerative approach we are developing.\n\n## NOT A LOST YEAR\n\nIn this context, ACCIONA proved its capacity to respond forcefully but also flexibly. We have been preparing for this for over 20 years. By developing basic infrastructure, designed and operated to create societies that are more sustainable and resilient. As a result of this conviction, many of the services the company delivers proved to be absolutely vital for addressing the pandemic in 2020.\n\nHospital management, uninterrupted electricity supply, water management and cleaning services helped society to better withstand the di/fficulties. We are proud that our company and the people in it were able to contribute to sustaining living standards in our society. We have demonstrated that our principles and our sustainable approach are a central and critical element of our business strategy.\n\nOn the economic front, the main challenge was to control the company's debt and liquidity. The uncertainty resulting from the economic slowdown and lockdowns forced us to define a response for each of our lines of business, as well as to actively manage investments and divestments.\n\nAs a result, we attained a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 4.21x, below the 4.5x ceiling announced at the beginning of the pandemic. We also reduced net financial debt by 11% and maintained unprecedented levels of liquidity at all times. Despite a 10% decline in revenues and a 22% decline in EBITDA, Group net profit grew by 8% thanks to active management of our operations.\n\nThe fact that the concessions and water divisions were classified as essential activities during the pandemic enabled them to attain double-digit growth in revenues. Construction, energy and services saw a year-onyear decline in revenues, largely as a result of the widespread slowdown and the consequent decline  in the demand for energy. Nevertheless, we believe that these dips are temporary and we are confident of a recovery in 2021 and 2022.\n\nConversely, as the leading company in the sustainable infrastructure sector, we were able to seize opportunities that arose during the year. In 2020, we attained 10.7 GW of renewable power generation capacity, surpassing the 10.5 GW target we had set in 2015. The infrastructure backlog expanded in 2020 from 8 B\u20ac to 12.1 B\u20ac due to obtaining major contracts and new projects. In June it became known that ACCIONA was the world's largest scooter sharing operator, and in December we launched a pioneering project to produce green hydrogen on the island of Mallorca. These milestones clearly point to new revenue streams in the future that will enhance the leading position of our business model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur or the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our solutions have become even more productive in a context of health crisis and polarisation, where governments and other clients are increasingly making contract awards conditional upon a positive impact  - what we call \"regenerative by design\".\n\nClients have a growing awareness that only companies that show an explicit long-term  commitment can be relied upon, especially given the context and the implications of the infrastructure industry for society.\n\nAs a result, our value proposition is even more important, positioning ACCIONA as the go-to partner for contributing to the 2030 Agenda and attaining the Sustainable Development Goals at local level, in each municipality, region, country or state. At ACCIONA we have created a solid, stable funding framework for our investors, in which each project we develop represents a profitable investment opportunity, as well as a way to maximise the social and environmental productivity of the communities in which we operate. This has enabled us to minimise risks and to deploy the full transformational potential of our activity.\n\nIntegrating this approach into all our projects between now and 2025 will allow us to connect the supply of capital with the demand for profitable projects that drive sustainable local development, enabling the generation of profits in the medium and long term.\n\n## IT'S TIME TO ACCELERATE\n\n2021 is a very important year for us. The IMF projects 6% economic growth worldwide, but it is our responsibility to ensure that the development arising from that economic growth results in a more inclusive and resilient planet. In this context, ACCIONA expects to invest close to 2 B\u20ac in 2021.\n\nGovernment plans to re-launch the economy in a sustainable way have spurred net zero commitments for 2050 on the part of many economies, encouraging large companies to secure green energy supplies. This is a turning point in which, after thirty years of development, renewable energy is entering a stage of maturity and mass deployment. It is also an opportunity for other technologies needed for a complete decarbonisation, such as hydrogen.\n\nThe ACCIONA Energ\u00eda IPO seeks to take advantage of the exceptional climate in the renewable energy  industry and to lock in our privileged position in a context of accelerating decarbonisation. The company is determined to maximise its contribution to a zero emissions economy and firmly establish its lead in this era. In its 30-year history, ACCIONA Energ\u00eda has contributed to the creation and development of the green energy sector, using its own resources to date. The company has been preparing its teams for a long time, strengthening its geographical footprint and its project portfolio to take advantage of this unique moment in the renewable sector, with the objective of doubling in size to an installed capacity of 20 GW in 2025. An independent listing will provide us with greater financial capacity and e/fficiency, as well as strategic strength to address this great challenge and continue to lead the sector.\n\nACCIONA doesn't have all the answers to what will happen in the coming years, but we do know the role we want to play. As has occurred in the past, those who place their trust in us will be rewarded by our company's leadership and strong commitment to the sustainable development and transformation of our world. The time for regenerative action is now. I am relying on you to help us achieve it.\n\nContents\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## A solid, resilient company\n\nwith solutions to the planet's needs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUSINESS AS UNUSUAL APPROACH\n\nACCIONA is one of the main companies in Spain's IBEX 35 index; it has a presence in more than 40 countries and employs over 38,000 people around the world. ACCIONA o/ffers itself as an expert in designing a better planet, responding to basic infrastructure needs through innovative solutions that produce real progress. The company develops and invests in many types of projects - energy, transport, water, social, cities, real estate and finance - that respond not only to the challenges facing our planet, but also to the needs of small communities.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, this report shows the value of ACCIONA's Business as Unusual model. Launched in 2018, this strategy enables us to address global challenges in a comprehensive manner, with a positive local impact and ensuring a presence in established markets and in emerging markets with good long-term prospects. ACCIONA understands that productivity and profitability go beyond the short-term view of the bottom line; companies that can di/fferentiate themselves by generating a positive impact on people and the planet will be the most competitive in the medium and long term. They are companies that will be capable of raising finance in the markets and meeting real needs with their projects over the next 10 years.\n\nThe year 2020 was a very challenging one. Progress towards the sustainable development goals slowed due to the pandemic. The road ahead to achieving those goals is now longer and more complicated. For this reason, both public institutions and governments consider that, if anything, it is now even more essential to invest in projects that contribute to fulfilling these commitments before 2030. With a solid portfolio in the energy and infrastructure sectors, and with a strategy aligned with the 2030 Agenda, ACCIONA defines itself as the company in a new industry with the capacity to o/ffer solutions that accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY FIGURES\n\nACCIONA evidenced the capacity, strength and resilience of its business in 2020. Despite the uncertainty at the start of the year, ACCIONA responded with a plan to guarantee liquidity and contain debt. Revenues amounted to 6.472 B\u20ac, a 10% decrease year-on-year. Against the backdrop of a widespread economic downturn, the negative impact on turnover was contained with mechanisms such as PPAs in the energy field and long-term contracts in concessions and services.\n\nThe group arranged investments and divestments to ensure liquidity at all times while engaging in strategic transactions. As a result divestments contributed 318 M\u20ac in revenues. The appeal of ACCIONA's assets in the market made it possible to cut debt by 11% net in the year, to achieve a debt/EBITDA ratio of 4.21x, better than the target of 4.5x.\n\nThe  strength  of  the  project  portfolio  enabled  dividends  to  regain  pre-COVID-19  values.  Moreover, ACCIONA's three-year total shareholder return (26.1%, or 18.1% when adjusted for revenues) exceeded that of the S&P Global Infrastructure and Clean Energy indices.\n\n## INCREASE INVESTMENT, DOUBLE THE IMPACT\n\nThe next few years will be dominated by the flotation of part of the energy division in 2021. With this deal, ACCIONA aims to raise funds to invest in renewable facilities that will enable it to reach 20 GW of installed capacity by 2025, double its current generation capacity.\n\nACCIONA's Sustainability Master Plan 2025 sets out its goal of both doubling the positive impact of its activities and becoming a recognised leader in the development of basic infrastructure assets with the added value of putting people and the planet at the centre. This strategy involves increasing infrastructures' productivity - their regenerative capacity - by enhancing their e/fficiency and their ability to generate prosperity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

The need to prevent infection and curb the spread of the virus forced most of the world's economies to enforce strict lockdowns. As a result, economic activity came to a standstill and the IMF cut its forecasts, projecting a 3% contraction in global GDP for 2020.\n\nGovernments were forced to address the problem on a domestic level while trying to coordinate globally to beat the common enemy. In 2020, we saw how countries set up international guidelines to curb the spread of the pandemic and established a shared roadmap to mitigate the crisis unleashed by the coronavirus.\n\nThe world's response to COVID-19 might be a lesson on how to tackle climate change\n\nThe pandemic has had an acute impact on the 2030 Agenda goals, although unquestionably it is developing countries that will su/ffer the most and will see their economies shrink the most. The World Bank 1 estimates that 150 million people will find themselves living in extreme poverty in 2021 due to COVID-19. The UN 2 calculates that almost 490 million people in 70 countries will enter poverty, lacking basic rights such as drinking water, a home and food. If the pandemic has shown us one thing, it is that the challenges we face cannot be tackled independently.\n\nIn this context, many countries and markets took the opportunity to revisit the climate agenda and even to establish more ambitious goals. This is the case of the European Union which, within the framework of action of the European Green Deal, proposed and adopted various action plans in connection with climate and environment. Furthermore, after exceeding the goal of reducing emissions by 40%, the EU set a new goal of 55% by 2030, with respect to the 1990 baseline.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2020, the European Commission approved a stimulus package for member states aimed at mitigating the e/ffects of the crisis created by the pandemic. The EU's long-term budget, combined with this Next Generation EU aid package, comprising a total of 750,000 M\u20ac, will furnish the bloc with total funds of 1.8 T\u20ac to tackle the reconstruction. These funds will be used to modernise Europe by means of research and innovation, fair and inclusive climate and digital transition, combating climate change, protecting biodiversity and overhauling existing policies.\n\n## The European Union has earmarked more than 1,800 M\u20ac to rebuild Europe\n\nThis kind of incentive increasingly highlights the importance of green investment within the framework of the economic agenda. Decarbonising the economy in a fair and inclusive manner, thereby minimising the negative social impact, will pave the way for proper global economic and social development, which also encompasses protecting the environment and public health. In context, large investment funds are increasingly taking account of companies' environmental and corporate sustainability management policies in their investment decisions, penalising those whose practices are not considered to be responsible.\n\nStimulus packages, vaccine development and the trend towards responsible investing are some of the factors making the outlook for the next few years more than positive, despite the 0.5% additional contraction in the IMF's global GDP forecasts with respect to its April 2020 estimates. 2021 began with a global growth forecast of 5.5%.\n\nThe IMF projects global growth of 5.5% in 2021\n\n- 1   COVID-19 to Add as Many as 150 Million Extreme Poor by 2021 (worldbank.org)\n- 2   UNSDG | Investing in the SDGs in a post COVID world\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n10\n\n<!-- image -->",

The visibility of this roadmap and the consensus around it are accelerating the pace of change based on the need to advance towards more sustainable development models.\n\nThe SDGs were first approved in 2015, when the 193 member countries of the United Nations General Assembly unveiled the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The United Nations (UN) considers the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as key to ensuring the progress and well-being of people, the environment and the economy. These goals (which, in turn, contain 169 specific targets and 232 o/fficial indicators to measure progress) are aimed at promoting education, equality and inclusiveness, fighting climate change and eradicating global poverty, among others.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the pandemic, good progress was being made on the SDGs, but this trend was severely hampered by the health crisis and the chances of achieving the goals have decreased. Despite the slower progress, there have been positive and negative impacts depending on the goal in question. For example, the reduction in global GDP has also led to a decrease in GHG emissions and air pollution, contributing positively to the goal of combating climate change. Conversely, the global economic slowdown has had negative consequences in terms of inequality, poverty and the development of infrastructure to improve the living conditions of the communities most in need.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Development Programme 3 (UNDP), development on the planet will be reduced to levels not seen since 1990, when the index was first created.\n\n## Changes in the Human Development Index. Source: UNDP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3   COVID-19: Human development on course to decline this year for the first time since 1990 | UNDP\n\nInequalities between countries have been heightened: places with the most deficient education and access to technology will su/ffer more severely from the economic impact of COVID-19. Although the shortfalls in the attainment of the 2030 Agenda a/ffect the 17 SDGs to varying degrees, some goals have become challenges with a real need for investment over the next few years. The pandemic overwhelmed the world's healthcare sector, evidencing the importance of investing in the social and health sector, in research and in developing vaccines. The economic crisis also increased poverty and created a shortage of basic foodstu/ffs in the countries most in need. As a result, it is vital to invest in infrastructure, education and job creation in order to improve global levels of well-being.\n\nThrough the SDGs, the UN set out a number of priorities for 2021 with a view to rebuilding society, the economy and the environment. Of special note are: responding to the COVID-19 pandemic; combating Human Rights violations; ensuring an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery; protecting the environment through global coalitions to attain carbon neutrality by 2050; transparency in emissions reductions and the development of adaptation mechanisms; respect for financial commitments on climate change and alignment of banks' and investment funds' portfolios with the Paris Agreement and SDGs; and combating poverty and inequality in accordance with the UN's own pledge to leave no-one behind.\n\n## GLOBAL CLIMATE AGENDA\n\nOn 12 December 2015, 195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, signalling a turning point in the history of climate negotiations. This particular treaty was special in that it did not force countries to drastically reduce emissions. Instead, the signatory countries willingly undertook to take part in an international system for climate responsibility, enshrining clear and ambitious targets in a written document.\n\nWhile national policies have not lived up to the provisions of the Paris Agreement in the last ten years, 2020 marked the start of a decade focused on the climate emergency and on reducing GHG emissions, as well as implementing policies to adapt to and mitigate the climate catastrophes to come.\n\nYounger generations have spearheaded e/fforts to highlight the urgent need for climate action, with the birth of the Fridays for Future movement, which calls on world leaders to take up the cause. On the political and economic front, the transition towards a climate responsibility system gathered pace in 2020, with new laws and action plans, such as the European Green Deal. Moreover, this year is significant because the US rejoined the Paris Agreement. At an online meeting of the UN General Assembly, China also announced its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The fact that the US is back in the fight against climate change with the rest of the world will further boost the paradigm shift. Joe Biden has already announced plans to transform the country into a decarbonised economy thanks to a renewables-based energy system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n11\n\n<!-- image -->",

According to the IMF 4 , around 10 T USD in fiscal aid has been injected into the economy in response to the crisis unleashed by COVID-19, thereby avoiding a large-scale collapse and helping to bolster the recovery.\n\nThe climate emergency requires the implementation of public policies and business models to tackle this new need. In addition, the health crisis that shook the world's economy in 2020 further emphasised the urgency of moving towards a sustainable, decarbonised economy. To guarantee this change in the financial system, it is indispensable to re-route private capital towards investments that fulfil sustainability criteria.\n\nIn June 2020, the European Council approved the European Union's first sustainable taxonomy, which was designed by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on Sustainable Finance. This new classification will provide investors with objective information as to whether or not an activity makes a material contribution to achieving the sustainability goals set by Europe.\n\nThe 72 activities defined in the taxonomy must foster a carbon-neutral economy, not significantly impair other environmental goals and be implemented in accordance with certain minimum ethical and employment standards. In its current form, the taxonomy includes environmental matters along with basic social guarantees, such as fundamental labour rights. However, the EU acknowledges that an integrated taxonomy should also include social objectives. Accordingly, it plans to include social principles at the end of 2021.\n\n## This environmental taxonomy is aimed at:\n\n- > Climate change mitigation.\n- > Climate change adaptation.\n- > Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources.\n- > Fostering the transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling.\n- > Pollution prevention and control.\n- > Protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nEurope plans to redirect investment towards projects that contribute to achieving these goals while also fulfilling certain social criteria. The European Union's commitment to meeting these goals is so far-reaching that it has already announced that all listed companies must disclose their degree of alignment with the taxonomy in their Non-Financial Information Statements in 2022.\n\nAt global level, the International Energy Agency (IEA) presented a Sustainable Recovery Plan 5 in June 2020. This programme invites governments to adopt energy policies as they re-open their economies in response to the turmoil caused by COVID-19. Based on an analysis conducted in cooperation with the IMF, the goal of the IEA's Sustainable Recovery Plan is economic growth, targeting the creation of millions of jobs and the deployment of the technologies and infrastructure needed to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy. The agency estimates that an annual global investment of approximately 1 T USD per year will be required over the next three years. In total, this amounts to 0.7% of current global GDP, including public and private investments in the energy sector.\n\n## The goals established in the Sustainable Recovery Plan are aimed at achieving the following economic and social benefits:\n\n- > A 1.1% annual increase in global economic growth.\n- > Maintenance or creation of around 9 million jobs per year.\n- > A reduction of GHG emissions by 4.5 B ton in total by the end of the plan.\n- > A 5% decrease in air polluting emissions, improving people's health.\n- > Access to electricity for almost 270 million people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n12\n\n<!-- image -->",

To get economies back on their feet and enable the worsthit countries to show signs of improvement, we must avoid making the same mistakes as in the past. The conventional business approach, also known as Business as Usual , has proven to be ine/ffective at protecting the most vulnerable, emphasising the need to change the established business models.\n\n## Business as usual has proven ineffective at protecting the most vulnerable\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has served to highlight the importance of safe managed access to water and sanitation, as well as proper handwashing facilities. It has also placed the spotlight on access to other types of resources such as energy, especially electricity, which is of vital importance in the health sector, where the lack of it or supply disruptions caused by a poor quality network can endanger the lives of many people. Other challenges such as education and food should not be overlooked, as the lockdowns and rising poverty levels have hampered access to these basic rights.\n\n## INVESTING IN THE PLANET\n\nThe way to address this challenge is to commit to a regenerative economy that enhances not only economic growth, but also sustainable development, understood as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations, ensuring a balance between economic progress, care for the environment and social well-being, as well as the attainment of the SDGs.\n\nThere are three ways to approach achieving these goals: use the same methods that have been used until now to achieve the goals set for 2030; scale down the SDGs to adapt their targets and ambitions to the changing reality of the coronavirus; or prioritise those SDGs that are most relevant to the business.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, ACCIONA has decided to be a part of the solution, by choosing the latter option: prioritise the most relevant SDGs, namely those relating to infrastructure. According to various studies, 72% of the Sustainable Development Goals are dependent upon infrastructure. The lack of infrastructure during the pandemic put millions of people, and specifically the healthcare sector, at risk by hampering access to water and electricity. By investing in this type of projects, the company helps protect against systemic shocks, thus generating robust and safe systems that sustain societies.\n\n72% of the Sustainable Development Goals are dependent upon infrastructure development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n13\n\n<!-- image -->",

This aligns the company's e/fforts not only with the 2030 Agenda, but also with the European taxonomy. In fact, ACCIONA was ahead of the European Union's requirement to publish its degree of commitment to this new classification and has already provided investors with the assessment of its business model based on sustainable solutions. The company ensured that the chosen activities meet the low carbon criteria for each sector, assessing whether the projects \"Do No Significant Harm\" to the achievement of the environmental objectives, as indicated by the taxonomy, and noting that the minimum social requirements are met. In this regard, 85% of ACCIONA's project portfolio, in terms of investment volume, meets the technical criteria to qualify for the European taxonomy.\n\n## 85% of ACCIONA's CAPEX is aligned with the European taxonomy for sustainable activities\n\nACCIONA's long-term strategy enables it to focus on the main social challenges of the moment. By pinpointing opportunities, the company can develop complex, multi-sector projects by leveraging the talent and experience of its great team of professionals in the various areas in which it operates. These solutions help to generate an impact that improves people's lives and cares for the planet, while providing a suitable return on investment.\n\nIn its core activities, ACCIONA contributes to various SDGs, most notably: SDG 6 \"Clean water and sanitation\", ensuring access to water and responsible water management; SDG 7 \"A/ffordable and clean energy\", promoting a decarbonised energy model and addressing the growth in energy demand; SDG 9 \"Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\" through the use of the most advanced and innovative technology throughout the entire infrastructure value chain; SDG 11 \"Sustainable cities and communities\", facilitating access to energy and water in communities; and SDG 13 \"Climate action\", including the fight against climate change, one of ACCIONA's priorities, and leading the transition to a low-carbon economy\n\nACCIONA integrates the synergies between the SDGs by creating combined projects that meet the needs of various of the 2030 Agenda goals\n\nAll this makes ACCIONA a leader in renewable energy generation at a global level, enabling it to develop outstanding projects with a high degree of specialisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n14",

Globally, labour productivity growth in construction has stayed at 1% per year for the past two decades. However, global economic growth has been 2.8% per year. This di/fference, evidences the challenges facing the construction and infrastructure industry and shows how di/fficult it has been to unlock value in recent times. The challenge is even greater when comparing the infrastructure sector with manufacturing, where productivity has grown at an annual rate of 3.6%.\n\nThe productivity problem is also evident when comparing the production capacity of the infrastructure sector with that of the national economies in which ACCIONA operates. In this case, less than 1 in 4 companies have been able to boost productivity with respect to the market in which they operate.\n\nThis stagnation in productivity has kept profitability ratios in the sector at 2.1%, according to the Standard & Poor's infrastructure index. The renewable energy index (renewable energy accounted for 26% of ACCIONA's revenue in 2020) obtained a total return of 46.1% in the last 3 years. Consequently, synergies and horizontal transfer of know-how are an opportunity for the sector.\n\nIn the last three years, infrastructure companies obtained a net total return of 2.1%, annualised in euros, according to the S&P Global Infrastructure Index\n\n## INNOVATING IN THE SECTOR TO BOOST PRODUCTIVITY\n\nThe sector needs innovation to improve its overall productivity and profitability ratios, remain attractive in the market and become a clear choice for investors and stakeholders. Taking into account the factors outlined above, the question is how a company dedicated to infrastructure and energy can improve its production capacity and profitability, and what other services or projects it can o/ffer. To properly respond to the potential for growth, it is important to define an infrastructure company's productivity.\n\nIn 2013, research by McKinsey identified the scope for improving overall infrastructure productivity 6 , referring to both the public and private sectors. The public sector should prioritise those infrastructure projects that best respond to the general objectives of the territory, including job creation, improving the resilience of other infrastructure, raising GDP in the area or generally optimising infrastructure. In the current circumstances of the pandemic and recovery, it is important to note that the public institutions are already taking account of this approach and the related criteria.\n\nAnother study published in 2021 by McKinsey 7 quantified the sector's potential to generate additional value for projects. It is estimated that an infrastructure investment of 75,000 M\u20ac to 150,000 M\u20ac in a country receiving EU recovery funds would create 1 to 3 million jobs per year, reduce GHG emissions by 15-30% by 2030 and generate between 180,000 M\u20ac and 350,000 M\u20ac in additional wealth. The enabling potential of the infrastructure sector far outstrips the infrastructure itself.\n\nThe United Nations defined the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a shared blueprint for action by all countries. There is now a general consensus that the SDGs reflect an aspiration of all societies and communities, so that infrastructure that contributes to promoting them will be valued not only for its economic impact, but also for its ability to generate a positive impact at the local level.\n\n## Infrastructure projects multiply a region's overall productivity\n\nACCIONA has been reinforcing its sustainability strategy since 2005, and the company has been fully aligned with the SDGs since 2018, when it unveiled the Business as Unusual Plan. This innovative approach to working on infrastructures that facilitate the attainment of the SDGs by 2030 enables ACCIONA to channel the capital needed to accelerate this objective. ACCIONA has responded to interest in supporting the Sustainable Development Goals on the part of public authorities in di/fferent regions, cities and communities by cooperating with them to meet the needs they have made public through tender processes.\n\n- 6   https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/infrastructure-productivity\n- 7   https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/a-low-carbon-recovery-is-vital-and-achievable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n15\n\n<!-- image -->",

ACCIONA calls them 'adjacent projects', and they help close the shortfall in the attainment of the SDGs in the territory in question. One of the group's most appealing features is its ability to create synergies between projects and simultaneously meet di/fferent needs for any region.\n\n## Chart showing the relationship between main and adjacent projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMain infrastructure project.\n\n2\n\nOptimisation of the positive social and environmental impact based on potential projects.\n\n3\n\nAdditional prosperity enablers. Infrastructure micro-projects to meet local needs.\n\nThanks to the company's experience in this type of operations and its human capital, ACCIONA is highly qualified to identify additional projects that help achieve the SDGs in regions and cities. As detailed below, this experience, capacity and leadership are set out in the Sustainability Master Plan as key levers for generating business and improving the company's positioning.\n\nBased on its business model and its SMART approach (Sustainability, Mitigation, Adaptation, Resilience and Transformation), the group uses its solutions to respond to the needs arising from the SDGs. The solutions are made up of various projects at the same time: generally one main project and several adjacent ones that create significant added value and have a powerful local impact. This makes ACCIONA a channel for financing that specifically targets those regions with a shortfall in their SDG compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCIONA develops 7 solutions\n\nthat generate a positive local impact and shareholder value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORT 2020\n\nContents\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n16",

This new way of understanding and valuing the sector enables resources and the value generated to be distributed more e/ffectively among stakeholders.\n\n## REGENERATIVE CAPACITY AS A PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCER\n\nACCIONA's shareholder and investor value proposal is twofold. On one hand, the company continues to boost e/fficiency through the conventional approach (industrialisation, digitalisation, verticalisation, specialisation, etc.) and, on the other, it revamps the infrastructure proposal by creating adjacent projects that help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in the regions where it is present. In addition to adding value to the main projects, these adjacent projects are a way to set the company apart and contribute additional business volume to the solutions.\n\n## Chart showing how a regenerative project works\n\n+\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                   | Clients and investors  do not tolerate  unsustainable  practices                                               | Clients and financial  investors applaud the  commitments.

This process is based on new solutions alongside infrastructure that are required by the same customers with whom the company already works. This is a necessary and more coherent evolution of the infrastructure business, which broadens its vision of how to contribute value to society in general, how to improve its relationship with stakeholders and increase its project portfolio.\n\nIf isolated from the infrastructure project, these solutions would present a higher risk. For example, laying a new fibre optic network poses the standard risks and margins. However, if the fibre optic network is rolled out in conjunction with the construction of a metro line, the risk and incremental investment required for the fibre optic installation is negligible in relation to the total construction costs, so the possibility of unforeseen events is significantly reduced and the margins of adjacent projects are improved. In this way, ACCIONA strives to improve its risk-adjusted profitability ratios. The Sharpe ratio shows that the risk, i.e. the return per unit share price volatility in a given time interval, is equal to that of the composite benchmark index 8 .\n\n## Sharpe ratio of 0.80 vs. 0.79 ACCIONA vs. S&P Global Infrastructure & Clean Energy\n\n## Risk related to the various business activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 8   The Sharpe ratio reflects the return obtained in a specific time frame as a function of the share's risk. The risk is measured using the share price volatility during that same interval. In this way, it is possible to compare the risk-adjusted return on an investment. The Sharpe ratio compared with ACCIONA is 74% in the case of the S&P Global Infrastructure Index and 26% in the case of the S&P Global Clean Energy, corresponding to the proportion of ACCIONA's revenues obtained in those two broad categories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our\n\nbusiness model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation:\n\nthe value of doing\n\nthings right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n17\n\n<!-- image -->",

In a context of robust investor appetite for financing infrastructure with a positive impact, this approach generates new business opportunities.\n\nACCIONA has direct, transparent and frequent contact with investors interested in this type of project. As a result, the company finds sources of co-financing for these adjacent projects, which are low risk because they are linked to a larger infrastructure project while also responding to local needs. SDG-linked projects vary and, therefore, so do their conditions. Adjacent projects may involve new technology that will be used in the future, or known businesses such as fibre optic infrastructure.\n\nAccess to financing and its conditions are regulated by ACCIONA in its green financing framework. The aim is to guarantee financiers that the capital will go to a series of projects aligned with the most exacting current sustainability criteria. In this way, the company improves transparency vis-\u00e0-vis investors and reduces the risk of exposure to businesses that have no real local impact.\n\n## Sustainable financial innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 63% of the funds raised with Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) in 2020 were green\n\nFurthermore, there is considerable demand for capital to invest in projects with a positive impact: that is a fact. This demand, driven by large institutional investors and public institutions, is a growing trend that will gain traction in the next few years. According to Standard & Poor's, green bond issuance rose to 282,000 M USD in 2020, a 5.8% increase on 2019 9 . The issuance of this type of bond has risen exponentially since 2012, when they were almost non-existent. In 2020, there was also a sharp increase in sustainable bond issuance, which added a social component to the environmental criteria, and raised 139,400 M USD, compared to just 40,999 M USD in 2019.\n\n## 282,000 M USD in green bonds\n\nissued worldwide in 2020, up 5.8% compared to 2019\n\nIn the new industry that ACCIONA represents, new business opportunities are secured by connecting this wide range of financing sources with the demand for projects needed to achieve the SDGs. In this context, the group has the capacity and experience to identify the capital to invest and develop infrastructure that help fulfil the 2030 Agenda. Accordingly, the company has a competitive edge as the leader in this sector. Its technical capability, international presence and appropriate balance sheet structure enable it to deploy comprehensive solutions to meet the challenges of today's society and the needs of future generations.\n\nACCIONA chooses projects on the basis of the European taxonomy for sustainable activities.  This classification is the technical document created by the European Commission's group of experts in sustainable finance. In 2020, 85% of the investments made by ACCIONA and 84% of its EBITDA were fully aligned with the guidelines defined by that expert group. This firm commitment to the EU taxonomy shows that the company meets the highest sustainability standards in the market today.\n\n## THE RESULT IS AN INCREASE IN PROJECT PRODUCTIVITY\n\nUltimately, compared to productivity growth in the infrastructure sector as a whole in recent years, ACCIONA has the capacity to increase project productivity between 2- and 10-fold thanks to its approach of creating adjacent projects aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n18\n\n<!-- image -->",

The year had a negative impact on infrastructure due, among other things, to projects being halted, rising costs and the general disruption of the operating framework. The energy business was a/ffected to a lesser extent, although the fall in electricity demand in Spain led to a sharp drop in wholesale prices.\n\nIn this di/fficult environment, the group managed to protect its solid financial position and its capacity for growth, logging a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio of 4.21x on 31 December 2020. This good result was made possible by the implementation of the package of measures aimed at mitigating the temporary impact of the pandemic, focused on liquidity and financial flexibility, moderating investment flows and working capital management, asset rotation, a 50% reduction in the dividend and cost e/fficiency.\n\nGoing forward, the renewable energy division's IPO will significantly bolster revenues, which will be used for both energy solutions and other investment opportunities. In the context of the IPO, ACCIONA expects to increase CAPEX to approximately 2,000 M\u20ac in 2021, to be used to develop the growth strategy and further enhance the group's position.\n\nIn the next decade, the business will focus on helping countries and society to achieve their SDG targets. The positive local impact generated by ACCIONA is one of the company's hallmarks and a means of improving our competitive position. Sustainability is one of the factors in decisions made by clients and governments and we must respond to those demands. Thanks to its relationship of trust with investors, ACCIONA is in a position to channel the supply of financing to high-impact projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUSINESS AS UNUSUAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2018-2020\n\nIn 2018, ACCIONA launched its Business as Unusual strategy, aimed at generating solutions to address the challenges of a more sustainable future. All the countries that are committed to achieving the SDGs by 2030 require this kind of solution. Moreover, ACCIONA helps to channel the necessary capital to undertake the projects.\n\n## 2020: resilient and ready to grow\n\nACCIONA's active management approach during the pandemic made it possible to overcome the most di/fficult stage of COVID-19, validating its Business as Unusual model and reinforcing its growth potential.\n\n- > The business proved resilient , achieving an EBITDA margin of 17.37% in an environment of shrinking demand and falling electricity prices.\n- > Revenues from water solutions and concessions increased in FY20, mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic in other areas.\n- > Coordinated management of debt and investments kept the debt/EBITDA ratio at 4.21x, very close to the 4x target in times of crisis and below the 4.5x 10 target set for 2020 due to the pandemic.\n- > A dividend of 3.9 \u20ac/share was paid to shareholders even in times of crisis, showing the resilience of the business model and the company's assets.\n- > Financial capacity to undertake investments totalling 829 M\u20ac to seize market opportunities.\n- > Divestments amounting to 318 M\u20ac thanks to market interest in ACCIONA's assets .\n\n## Group revenue and margin performance\n\n| Income statement                   | FY18 (M\u20ac)   | FY19  (M\u20ac)   | FY20  (M\u20ac)   | Chg.

The company o/ffers a portfolio of resilient projects with a balanced risk profile and a diversified solution set.\n\nBased on its Business as Unusual approach, ACCIONA identifies capital investment opportunities in sustainable assets. According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), about 2.4 T USD per year of additional investment will be needed to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda, especially for infrastructure, which is essential to meeting 72% of the SDGs. This market forecast and ACCIONA's positioning as the leading company in this new sector give it a competitive advantage.\n\nACCIONA's plan and its targets for 2025, aim to accelerate the sustainable transition to which the world is heading. The company aspires not only to be recognised as a pioneer in the sector, but also to establish itself firmly as a leader. The aim of this new industry is to inspire and demonstrate that investing in the planet is the smartest solution.\n\n## 2025 AMBITION\n\nACCIONA's plan is ambitious in that it sets 2025 as the target date, five years before the deadline for the 2030 Agenda. By then, the company will have validated its image as a world leader in the transition to a sustainable system.\n\nAlthough ACCIONA manages its roadmap through the solutions it identifies, but with an integrated vision of the synergies o/ffered by the SDGs, its ambition for 2025 is based essentially on sustainable development of the community. Its objective is basically to double the positive impact of its actions.\n\n## Affordable non-polluting energy\n\nWe all know that the world and the economy are totally dependent on energy production and consumption. ACCIONA is working on the path towards the energy transition with the gradual incorporation of renewable energies to replace the most widely used fossil fuels, which also contributes to decarbonising the global economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewable energy production\n\n## Industry, innovation and infrastructure\n\nInfrastructures enhance living standards for society in general and local communities in particular. To give meaning to this reality and keep economies active, ACCIONA believes it is necessary to invest in innovation and industrial development. In order to be a leader in sustainable infrastructures, the company is committed to innovation through its regenerative solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPositive impacts of the projects in terms of employment and the local economy\n\n## Clean water and sanitation\n\nWater is the basis of life and an increasingly scarce resource. ACCIONA will continue to invest in sanitation and in caring for water sources to contribute to the planet's sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClean water production\n\n## Decent work and economic growth\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are designed to achieve equal rights overall. Accordingly, investing in people is one of ACCIONA's strategic priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGender and disability inclusiveness ratios in infrastructure projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n26\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable cities and communities\n\nCities concentrate 50% of the world's population. One of ACCIONA's solutions is aimed at transforming today's cities into smart and interconnected ones.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kilometres of electrified rail track\n\n## Climate action\n\nInvesting in the planet to mitigate the e/ffects of climate change is a fundamental goal of ACCIONA. Its solutions are designed to achieve near-zero emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Emissions avoided\n\n## STRATEGIC CHALLENGES\n\nACCIONA's plan focuses on four strategic challenges that will enable it to achieve its 2025 targets while reinventing the business. They all share the same three-phase approach: responsibility, resilience and regeneration.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to become aware of the impact of our actions on the planet in order to understand our responsibility and how we should act. This first phase is the basis of any business: analyse the risks and minimise the negative e/ffects. By measuring a company's economic performance, we can learn from its past, but also predict how its profitability will develop over the long term.  Additionally, it is increasingly important to analyse the impact of a company's operations on the environment in order to ascertain its viability. And, of course, how a company is managed in social terms is also an eloquent expression of its core values.\n\nOnce these responsibilities have been identified, it is necessary to take steps to foster the sustainable development of the business. As the first company in a new industry, ACCIONA defines itself as a resilient company. According to the Business as Unusual approach, this industry consists of adapting our core business strategy on the basis of the megatrends of our era, which are basically shaped by the SDGs and other legislation on social responsibility, climate change mitigation and reduction of environmental impacts. Based on these premises, the company generates a positive impact on the planet and the communities in which it operates through each of its projects. This success is underpinned by integrating the sustainability criteria set out in the European taxonomy into the design of its action plan. In this way, the company replaces the conventional concept of value chain with the idea of a value system, which is much broader and more realistic, as it includes all those who benefit from the impact of ACCIONA's activity.\n\nUnderstanding how value systems work makes it possible to identify the strategic capabilities of regenerative sectors. For this reason, the last phase of ACCIONA's plan consists of regeneration through solutions. At this point, it is necessary to identify risks as opportunities, i.e. to minimise the negative e/ffect in order to make a meaningful contribution with real solutions and impacts. This results in value creation with competitive advantages as in the taxonomy, in order to continue investing in formulas that respond to current and future needs.\n\n## People-centric\n\nEmployees are the soul of a company. For this reason, ACCIONA puts people at the core of its strategy.\n\nIn order to successfully carry out its programme and achieve its objectives, it is necessary to train employees, involve them in the corporate challenges and retain their talent. Therefore, it is important to ensure basic employee rights, as well as equality and inclusiveness in the workforce. The levers of change in this connection include transformational leadership on the part of ACCIONA, diversity in the workforce, recognition of their hard work, a healthy and safe working environment and the involvement of everyone in the company's values.\n\n## These five levers of transformation will make it possible to achieve the five main objectives by 2025:\n\n| Leadership   | Develop agents of change capable of providing di/fferential  value.                   |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Diversity    | Be more diverse because it will make us better.                                       |\n| Recognition  | Enhance the model to better recognise excellence and  outstanding e/ffort.            |\n| Environment  | Have a smart, safe work environment, reflecting our values.                           |\n| Access       | Safeguard the fundamental rights of the people  who participate in our value systems. |\n\n## Main indicators:\n\n- > Leadership development programmes that integrate assessment tools, skill development, mobility, team management and career development.\n- > People with a living wage.\n- > Reduction of the pay gap between men and women.\n- > ESG performance indicators in variable remuneration.\n- > Locations with the company's 'ACCIONA Well' certification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n27\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2020, in a context of a widespread decline in energy demand and prices because of the pandemic, ACCIONA's business model proved its strength. This model, based on diversification and an optimal combination of energy sale mechanisms (marked by long-term contracts and a planned hedging strategy), enabled the company's revenues to fall by much less (only 10.9%) than energy prices.\n\nACCIONA's e/fficient management ensured that this moderate decline in revenues did not reach the bottom line, as EBITDA during the pandemic period fell by just 6.7% year-on-year.\n\nIn the year as a whole, ACCIONA boosted EBT by 55% year-on-year as a result of actively managing its investments and of the market's interest in ACCIONA's assets.\n\n## ACCIONA ENERG\u00cdA - A UNIQUE PLATFORM\n\n## 30 years of experience - a unique, multi-technology platform with a global reach\n\n| A  world-leading  pure-play  renewable energy operator.                                               | Solid operational and  financial results.                                                   | Strong development  capabilities and  pioneering solutions.                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 100% renewable  since  assets.                                                                        | > 30 years  of experience.                                                                  | innovative                                                                                  |\n| inception - no legacy fossil                                                                          |                                                                                             |                                                                                             |\n| 10,694 MW                                                                                             | Assets in  16 countries on 5  continents.                                                   | Unparalleled ESG  credentials .                                                             |\n| of total  installed capacity.                                                                         | Spain's largest all- renewable  electricity  supply company ,                               | 4 th  largest global  developer in terms of  corporate PPAs signed in                       |\n| 24,075 GWh  of total  production in 2020,  equivalent to the  consumption of 7.5 million  households. | according to the CNMC.                                                                      | 2020  (BloombergNEF).                                                                       |\n| A vertically integrated  model.                                                                       | 6 renewable technologies ,  including storage. Historical asset  availability  of 97%, with | Good  positioning  to benefit from  the opportunities  arising from  Net Zero  commitments. |\n\nHaving pioneered renewable energy in its early days, the company is a key player in the inexorable evolution of the energy sector towards a decarbonised system. Renewable energy is already the most competitive electricity generation source, and its potential is accelerating based on the drive to sustainability on the part of society, government, business and the financial sector. Ever-increasing climate neutrality commitments represent a unique opportunity for structural decarbonisation of all sectors of the economy, with renewables at the heart of the system.\n\nACCIONA Energ\u00eda's track record and strengths position as a leading player in the renewable energy sector with no legacy fossil exposure. The company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the opportunities o/ffered by the current context, in which the fundamentals of the energy transition have been enhanced by close ties with the economic recovery.\n\nWith assets in 16 countries on five continents, ACCIONA Energ\u00eda is 100% renewable, which means it has no transition risks related to fossil asset depletion or rising carbon prices. Its geographic, technological and regulatory diversification, as well as its vertically integrated global organisation, enable it to pursue high growth opportunities and improve margins through integration and scale economies. In addition, its solid strategy of diversification in terms of geographies, technologies and sales mechanisms minimises risk in the short, medium and long term.\n\nThe company's capabilities, linked to its extensive experience, size, global presence and financial strength are a source of competitive advantages. These features enable it to attract companies that want to decarbonise their energy consumption by buying a competitive renewable energy supply that o/ffers short-term and long-term security.\n\nWith vertical integration throughout the entire value chain of renewable projects, it is able to implement continuous improvements that allow for greater e/fficiency and more agile progress in the development of new technologies and business models. Its role as a first mover in the industry and its multi-technology approach maximise opportunities, such as the potential for hybridisation in existing facilities and access to the best sites.\n\nThis strategy, its broad portfolio of 100% renewable assets and the full integration of sustainability into the business from the outset, enable ACCIONA to position itself as an ESG leader and to stand out in terms of potential, competitiveness and profitability.\n\n## STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2021-2025\n\nWith a track record of solid, profitable growth, ACCIONA Energ\u00eda is poised to take advantage of the growing opportunities arising from the energy transition, with the aim of accelerating the company's organic growth and doubling its installed capacity to 20 GW by 2025. As solid foundations to ensure this ambitious growth, the company has defined the following levers that will enable it to maximise profitability:\n\n- > Industry-leading asset management that assures and maximises future cash flows, with the goal of extending the useful life of assets beyond 40 years through the development of advanced life extension programs, operational excellence and best practices in digitalisation.\n- > Highly sophisticated energy management ensures revenue flows from a diversified portfolio, seeking maximum profitability through diversification (public PPAs 12 , corporate PPAs, feed-in-tari/ffs, judicious financial hedging strategy,...), with the recurring objective that at least 80% of production is secured through long-term contracts and hedging mechanisms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur or the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n34\n\n<!-- image -->",

Projects will be approved only if they exceed the risk-adjusted return threshold (WACC 13 + 200bp), while never sacrificing profitability for growth, in order to protect a robust business and long-term sustainability.\n\nThe growth plan through 2025 focuses on innovative technologies and profitable new business models that will ensure continuous diversified growth in the coming decades. To this end, ACCIONA Energ\u00eda continues to develop innovative clean energy projects that may be eligible for future funding rounds arising from the economic recovery, as well as making progress in its plan for the expansion of green hydrogen and its entry into the o/ffshore wind market. The latter two initiatives materialised following the signature of memoranda of understanding to establish joint ventures in the Iberian market with Plug Power and SSE Renewables, respectively. In this way, the company anticipates future business models to position itself for new opportunities in the global energy sector.\n\n## GROWTH PLAN FOR 2021 - 2025\n\nIn an environment where decarbonisation of the economy has accelerated, ACCIONA has drawn up a new plan to capture and expedite profitable growth in its main markets. ACCIONA Energ\u00eda's IPO, scheduled for 2021, includes an ambitious plan to increase company-owned capacity to a total of 20 GW by 2025. This means adding 9.3 GW over the period 2021-2025, doubling the current 10.7 GW of company-owned capacity. ACCIONA Energ\u00eda has already secured the first 3 GW of renewable production capacity, which is either already under construction or guaranteed to start construction in 2021-2022; that is 28% of the target to be achieved by 2025.\n\n## Installed capacity growth plan 2021-2025 in the framework of ACCIONA Energ\u00eda's IPO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe company also has a pipeline of 6.3 GW of high visibility projects that will enable it to guarantee attainment of the 2025 target, where land and grid access are secured or close to being secured. The company is also in advanced discussions for electricity supply solutions and/or visibility of sale or contract award mechanisms at these facilities.\n\nIn addition, there is a back-up pipeline of 9.8 GW at an advanced stage of development, with land or grid access close to being secured.\n\nFollowing ACCIONA Energ\u00eda's strategy of technological and geographical diversification, this 19 GW portfolio is distributed across a number of countries and technologies. The planned growth is distributed almost equally between wind and photovoltaic energy and will consolidate the company's presence in its five main markets (Spain, United States, Australia, Chile and Mexico). Nevertheless, the company is working to develop assets in countries with long-term growth potential in the environs of its existing footprint.\n\n## A SOLUTION ALIGNED WITH THE TAXONOMY\n\nThe European taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities is the basis of ACCIONA's sustainable financing framework. This new European vocabulary of sustainability together with the defined technical criteria make it possible to avoid greenwashing and to ensure that companies that fall within this framework actually behave in a sustainable way.\n\nAll ACCIONA's energy facilities fall under the European taxonomy framework, which requires life cycle emissions of less than 100 gCO 2 e/kWh, with the aim of progressively reducing them to 0 gCO 2 e/kWh by 2050. The company has been carbon neutral since 2016, o/ffsetting its already reduced emissions through Certified Emission Reductions. ACCIONA Energ\u00eda also has a surplus of these certificates and sells them to contribute to decarbonising third-party emissions.\n\nThe degree to which the energy solutions are aligned with the European taxonomy is shown below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur or the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n35\n\n<!-- image -->",

The process commences with gross water intake, continues with potabilisation, maintenance and control of reservoirs, and management of distribution networks, and concludes with supply to the population. ACCIONA also analyses the water in its own laboratories to check its status and ensure that it is fit for human consumption.\n\nACCIONA manages water supply in more than 100 municipalities in Spain, Peru and Mexico, serving 14 million people.\n\n## DESALINATION\n\nThe desalination industry is the most competitive component of ACCIONA's water business thanks to its pioneering treatment processes and its comprehensive vision of the project life cycle. The company is one of few with a long track record of using reverse osmosis technology for desalination of seawater and brackish water.\n\nReverse osmosis releases 6.5 times less CO 2 emissions than conventional desalination technologies in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nLIFE-DREAMER , a project developed by ACCIONA, increased the percentage of water recovery in reverse osmosis seawater desalination systems from 50% to 75%. The conversion rate of the desalination process also increased from 45-50% to 75%, and 70% of organic carbon dissolved in the reverse osmosis wash streams was eliminated, minimising the final discharge. All these improvements contribute to reducing specific energy consumption during desalination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n46\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reverse osmosis plant will have an initial capacity of 400,000 m 3 per day. It will help to strengthen the supply of drinking water and alleviate the water shortages faced by the inhabitants of south-western Saudi Arabia.\n\n## POTABILISATION\n\nAmong ACCIONA's di/fferent water management projects, drinking water treatment is especially important, as 1 in 10 people on the planet currently do not have reliable access to drinking water.\n\nACCIONA provides innovative solutions to the problems associated with drinking water treatment. Based on research and accumulated experience, the company ensures the quality of its projects to the highest standards in geographical and climatic contexts as diverse as Canada (Saint John plant), Egypt (New Cairo) and Australia (Mundaring, Perth), demonstrating its great capacity for adaptation.\n\n## > 8.6 million\n\nm 3 /day of capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n> 30 years'\n\nexperience\n\n## New Cairo drinking water treatment plant\n\nThe New Cairo plant's infrastructure captures water from the Nile River, transports it a distance of 40 km, and treats it at the plant. The pipes can carry up to 1 million m 3 of drinking water/day and distribute, on average, 500,000 m 3 daily to the local population.\n\n## WASTEWATER TREATMENT\n\nFour billion people in the world do not have access to basic sanitation services. Moreover, more than 80% of the wastewater produced by humans is discharged into rivers and seas without prior treatment. In response to these problems, ACCIONA uses innovative treatments in the development of water treatment projects, including biological purification processes,  sludge minimisation and reuse of treated water.\n\nThe company adapts its projects, with a minimum installation cost, to diverse contexts such as:\n\n- > Cities of any size.\n- > Municipal or industrial water.\n- > Communities with high seasonal demand.\n- > Plants located in small spaces.\n- > Wastewater treatment plants with a high visual and/or environmental impact.\n- > Plants with diverse discharge levels.\n\nACCIONA's design and construction of more than 330 wastewater treatment plants covers a wide geographical area, ranging from small cities to megacities. Water infrastructures such as Atotonilco (Mexico) and North Shore (Canada) reflect the company's ability to provide solutions to the challenges of treating contaminated water anywhere on the planet.\n\n## 330 waste water\n\ntreatment plants\n\n22.3 M m 3 /day\n\nof capacity\n\n> 80 million\n\npeople served\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n47\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is the largest wastewater treatment plant in Latin America and the third-largest in the world.\n\nDesign of the High-Impact Solution concept, for implementation at the plant, commenced in 2020. The objective of this initiative is to contribute substantially to improving living standards in nearby communities through job training, the creation of quality local employment (reducing the gender gap and other inequalities), the improvement of productive performance and soil quality.\n\nACCIONA has presented the proposal to CONAGUA (Mexico's National Water Commission) and to a potential funding partner, both of which expressed a very positive assessment of the project. Progress has also been made in the development of solutions to initiate a community outreach plan, which is expected to be implemented during 2021.\n\n## REUSE\n\nInvestment in ACCIONA's technology innovations in the area of water reuse is focused on optimising tertiary treatment processes and responding to growing demand for irrigation and recreational activities and to recharge aquifers facing saltwater intrusion.\n\nFor its own water consumption, ACCIONA has managed to increase the use of recycled and reused water, as well as rainwater, to account for 44% of the total. The bulk of reused water comes from wastewater treatment plants. In total, the company has more than 300 wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe company has created solutions to reuse wastewater treatment residues as fertilizer for farming, in line with the principles of the circular economy. In 2020, it reused 94% of sludge produced\n\n## La Escalerilla in Arequipa (Peru)\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant in Arequipa treats water from the northern part of Peru. Treated water is reused for both human consumption and for farming. The solid waste resulting from the treatment process is converted into fertilizer for farming.\n\n## WATER SERVICES FOR CITIES\n\nCities need water infrastructure and a sustainable approach to water management in order to ensure a supply of properly treated water. ACCIONA provides water supply and sewerage services as part of its endto-end water management approach. It also delivers maintenance services and customer management, providing direct user support.\n\nACCIONA manages water supply in more than 180 cities in Spain, Peru, Italy and Mexico, serving over 13 million people.\n\nACCIONA carries out smart water projects for cities with a platform that manages the drinking water supply network and oversees water quality, metered consumption and the status of the entire structure remotely in real time, directly contributing to greater network e/fficiency. This tool was tested in Burgos (Spain) as part of the EU's SWInG project.\n\n## Madrid services (Spain)\n\nACCIONA manages municipal drinking water supply, sewer maintenance and wastewater treatment services in Madrid, Spain. The project serves 1,100,000 people using a network 1,147 km long.

They also hold 50% of the world's population. If we aspire to having a sustainable planet, cities must evolve to become more resilient, inclusive, interconnected and smart.\n\nACCIONA has a unit specifically configured to address the main challenges of building, mobility, water management and the circular economy. Through SMART solutions for sustainable cities, the group addresses issues such as improving waste management and the related infrastructure, and revitalisation of cities through green areas and clean, agile, e/fficient mobility, the goal being to enhance city-dwellers' living standards. A significant part of its urban solutions involve shared economy formulas, whether exchanging vehicles, spaces or services such as heating.\n\nZero-emission vehicles, proper waste collection and transportation and highly efficient buildings are aligned with the European taxonomy.\n\nSocial solutions aligned with the European taxonomy:\n\n15%\n\nof revenues\n\n100%\n\nof CAPEX\n\n4%\n\nof EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The main criteria in the taxonomy that are applicable to urban solutions are:\n\n- > Zero direct emission vehicles, such as ACCIONA's electric scooters.\n- > Non-hazardous waste collected and transported separately to ensure proper reuse and/or recycling.\n- > A new building aligned with domestic regulations for Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) and with energy performance (EPC) equivalent to B or higher.\n\n## ELECTRIC MOBILITY\n\nACCIONA is expanding its electric scooter sharing service to cities outside the Iberian Peninsula. The scooters are powered by 100% renewable energy, and they stand out from rival services because of their range and power. In addition, the fleet for recharging these vehicles is 100% electric. As an awareness-raising exercise, users receive real-time information on the CO 2 emissions they have avoided on their trip.\n\nOver 12,000 electric scooters available in 8 cities: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza and Malaga in Spain; and Milan and Rome in Italy.\n\nBy the end of 2020, ACCIONA had a fleet of more than 12,000 scooters powered by electricity from renewable sources, making it the world's largest operator in this sector. Each shared vehicle removes two private vehicles from circulation and promotes the use of public transport by complementing it. This year alone, they avoided more than 850 tCO 2 e, equivalent to the emissions generated by approximately 100,000 cars on the road each day, and freed up space comparable to more than 45 football stadiums.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n51\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company periodically reviews its regulations as part of its e/fforts to align and incorporate those recommendations and best practices into its regulatory frameworks.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the parent company's share capital was represented by 54,856,653 fully subscribed and paid ordinary uncertificated shares, each with a par value of 1 euro, together amounting to a market capitalisation of 6.401 B \u20ac.\n\n## Ownership structure as of 31 December 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING\n\nAll shares enjoy the same rights. The Company's Articles of Association do not establish any kind of restriction or maximum limit on the voting rights that a shareholder may exercise. Neither are there obstacles in the law or the Articles of Association to the acquisition or disposal of shares, without prejudice to the pre-emptive acquisition rights that some of the company's declared core shareholders have granted each other.\n\nIn 2011, in accordance with the provisions of the Capital Companies Act, ACCIONA set up an electronic forum to ensure and facilitate communication with all shareholders, including minority interests, prior to the General Meeting of Shareholders. Proposals for a supplement to the notice of Meeting may be published in this forum, as well as requests for support for such proposals, initiatives to achieve the percentage necessary to exercise minority rights, as provided by law, and o/ffers and solicitations of proxies. Furthermore, when the Meeting is announced, ACCIONA makes available to shareholders, via its website, a remote online or postal voting system in order to help them exercise their right to vote.\n\n## The main topics discussed at the 2020 General Meeting of Shareholders 15\n\n- > Examination and approval of the 2019 financial statements.\n- > Examination and approval of the 2019 Directors' Report.\n- > Examination and approval of the 2019 Non-Financial Information Statement.\n- > Examination and approval of the 2019 Sustainability Report.\n- > Allocation of income for the year 2019 and approval of a dividend amounting to 1.925 \u20ac gross per share.\n- > Re-appointment of Ms. Karen Christiana Figueres Olsen and Mr. Jer\u00f3nimo Marcos Gerard Rivero as independent directors.\n- > Delegation of powers to the Board of Directors to increase capital and issue debt and other financial instruments in the next 5 years.\n- > Approval of the Directors' Remuneration Policy for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the new longterm incentive plan for Executive Directors.\n- > Approval of the Annual Report on Director Remuneration 2019.\n\nAll motions were passed by an ample majority, with at least 92.71% voting in favour\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe composition of ACCIONA's Board of Directors and its Committees is based on the principles of transparency and independence, guided by criteria of complementarity, professionalism and diversity. ACCIONA's Director Selection Policy ensures that proposed appointments or re-appointments of directors are based on a prior analysis of the Board's needs. This policy was amended in 2020 to adapt it to the changes introduced in the Code of Good Governance and to reflect the gender representation target recommended by the Code.\n\nThe company's Board of Directors is composed of eleven members, with a diversity of know-how, skills, origins, experience, nationalities and gender, ensuring that all shareholders are properly represented and that the Board performs e/ffectively. 64% of the Board's directors are independent, including a Lead Independent Director.

The company has specific policies in place for combating corruption and bribery, and it provides training in this area, all to ensure compliance with, and knowledge of, the group's ethics framework.\n\nACCIONA's ethical principles and guidelines for action are grounded in the Code of Conduct and in the Policy Book that implements it. The Code of Conduct establishes the values that should guide the behaviour of all persons related to the Company: executives, employees and third parties. Its objective is to establish a form of business conduct that is accepted and respected by all, while rejecting outright all illegal business practices and any inappropriate behaviour in the workplace. Through the Code of Conduct, the company undertakes to carry on its business in accordance with current local legislation and the highest international standards.\n\nTo ensure compliance with the rules and guidelines for action, ACCIONA has a Code of Conduct Committee, a Compliance Department and an Internal Audit Department, which supervise the operation and e/ffectiveness of the procedures, controls and internal commitments established for that purpose. Those bodies are responsible for ensuring that the ethical, organisational, environmental and social obligations, those imposed by law and those adopted voluntarily, are complied with, and that the related risks are identified and avoided or mitigated. The Compliance Department reports to the Board of Directors Audit Committee.\n\nThe Code of Conduct Committee also supervises the operation of the Ethical Channel, and decides on the investigation of reports that are received by this means and any necessary measures to be taken as a result.\n\n## COMBATING CORRUPTION, BRIBERY AND MONEY LAUNDERING\n\nThe company has specific policies to fight corruption, bribery and money laundering. They include mainly:\n\n- > Anticorruption Policy: sets out the group's express position against any corrupt or criminal act, which applies to the professional performance of all the people who make up the company.\n- > Policy for the Prevention of Crime and Bribery: underscores the company's zero tolerance of illegal activities. The company exercises permanent surveillance to prevent and detect illicit conduct, employs e/ffective communication and awareness-raising mechanisms for all employees, and establishes a business culture based on ethics and compliance.\n- > Rules of conduct with regard to combating corruption: provide guidelines on avoiding inappropriate conduct and are applicable to, and binding on, all employees and all parties associated with ACCIONA (including agents, intermediaries, advisors, consultants and suppliers).\n- > Corporate rules on avoiding and managing conflicts of interest: expand on the provisions of the Code of Conduct in this area.\n\nThese guidelines are based on international standards and were implemented in the organisation through corporate rules and instructions applicable to all companies that are part of ACCIONA, to all their employees and to third parties that have a relationship with the group.\n\nAdditionally, in line with the commitment to combat corruption and bribery, a Crime Prevention and Anti-Corruption Organisation and Management Model has been implemented that establishes the group's general control environment in line with international best practices.\n\nIn  2020,  the  entire  management  team  obtained  certification  of  their  knowledge  and  acceptance  of ACCIONA's applicable regulations in relation to the Crime Prevention and Anti-Corruption Model, the Code of Conduct and the Rules of conduct with regard to combating corruption.\n\n## TRAINING AND AWARENESS-RAISING TO ENSURE ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR\n\nCompliance with these corporate standards is a priority for the company. For this reason, ACCIONA has expanded training programmes and intensified awareness-raising campaigns by assigning specific responsibilities in this area.\n\nThe Compliance Planet website compiles all the courses on compliance. In total, 2,681 employees have received anti-corruption training. In addition, last year 2,464 employees took the Code of Conduct course (more than 12,700 workers have received this training since 2017), which is available to the entire workforce. Moreover, 984 employees have completed other compliance training courses and 160 employees have taken a classroom programme on competition law.\n\nWith regard to communication, in 2020 the Compliance Department posted 50 publications on the intranet (compared with 30 in 2019), which included important information on anti-corruption, specifically on issues such as gifts, bribes, intermediaries and agents, and interactions with public o/fficials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n60\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result of this process, action policies and tolerance thresholds are determined to provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives, in the short term (1 year), the medium term (the 5-year term of each Sustainability Master Plan) and the long term (10 years, in accordance with observations of megatrends and established goals, such as SBT).\n\nACCIONA uses a range of tools to identify climate risks and opportunities, including notably its digital model of climate change, which monitors historical climate-related variables at all ACCIONA's locations, and projections under the temperature increase scenarios and time horizons envisaged in the latest IPCC reports. This model also monitors production and financial variables, and emission and energy consumption figures. It includes references to climate policies and carbon markets in each region, making it an essential resource for anticipating situations, especially those related to medium/long-term physical events and short/medium-term transitions. Specifically, in order to project medium/long-term transition environments, it is necessary to categorise the activities within the European taxonomy. Other mechanisms not yet integrated into the digital model are also used during the identification process, such as the search for legal requirements; the experience of the teams assessing these scenarios is also invaluable in this connection.\n\nThe risk management process is conducted once per year, beginning with the creation of expert groups in each business unit. Using the tools referred above, each group proposes a list of risk situations for the company's locations, groups of locations and/or business activities (or its value chain), based on their geographical exposure and vulnerability.\n\nThe most common climate scenarios used for risk identification involve a limited temperature increase of 1.5 \u00b0C to 2 \u00b0C for transition events, and an increase of at least 3 \u00b0C for physical risk situations (RCP 6 and RCP 8.5).\n\nOnce each risk scenario is defined, it is assessed as a function of the likelihood that it will materialise and its economic and reputational consequences. Ultimately, these variables determine the weak points of each of the proposed scenarios (see figure with the principal climate risks). For those with the greatest likelihood, each assessment group prepares specific data sheets to inform the company's decision-making bodies about the mitigation options and an estimate of the associated costs.\n\nIn a final phase, the climate risk scenarios are integrated into ACCIONA's general risk management process, which is handled by the Board of Directors (it has a specific Sustainability Committee that meets once per quarter and is the company's highest decision-making body in matters of climate change), its Audit Committee, the Finance and Risk Department and the Management Committees of the divisions.\n\n## Notable climate risks and opportunities\n\nThe main climate risk and opportunity scenarios for ACCIONA in 2020 are presented below, with their potential impact and time horizon, their scope in terms of geographies and businesses, and the actions taken to manage them. ACCIONA's business strategy can be said to be broadly resilient to climate change, with a moderately low impact in terms of risks and a high impact in terms of opportunities.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe main climate risks in 2020 were all located in the same geography.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n5\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n62\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, of every 100 \u20ac of revenues, over 17 \u20ac were allocated to paying taxes, principally in Spain, Australia, Mexico, Poland, Norway, Portugal, Ecuador and South Africa. Once again, employment-related taxes were the largest single component.\n\nSince 2016, ACCIONA has filed its Annual Report on Fiscal Transparency with the Spanish Tax Administration Agency (AEAT) as a result of its adoption of the AEAT Code of Good Tax Practices (CBPT) in 2011. Since 2018, it has also delivered a Corporate Tax Transparency Report to the Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO).

Based on market conditions and the business strategy, the company chooses between two sustainable finance formats. One is a formula through which the funds are committed to concrete areas of the company's sustainable agenda via specific infrastructure or service projects. The other links the cost of funding to improvements in the group's environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions.\n\n## FINANCING THE SUSTAINABLE AGENDA\n\nThis funding mechanism obliges ACCIONA to channel its investments to projects that contribute directly to the fulfilment of objectives linked to the sustainable agenda. The funds are allocated mainly to the development of renewable energy infrastructures, access to water and sanitation, sustainable mobility, circular economy and adaptation to climate change.\n\nIn this way, the company creates business opportunities capable of generating interest in the capital markets or among banks. Given this growing trend, in 2019 ACCIONA drew up a new green financing framework that expands its portfolio of eligible sustainable projects. The new approach is based on projects' contribution to a low-carbon economy, based on the eligibility criteria set out in the European Commission's taxonomy of green activities.\n\nFunding transactions that choose this format fall under the scope of the European Union Green Bond Standard (EU-GBS) produced by the EU Technical Expert Group (TEG) on Sustainable Finance in June 2019. The EU-GBS is a voluntary standard available to issuers that wish to align with best practices in the market. It is designed to be globally relevant and accessible to issuers located both inside and outside the EU.\n\nACCIONA's Green Financing Framework was reviewed by Sustainalytics, which issued a Second-Party Opinion (SPO) 16 in which it confirmed alignment with market best practices: the Green Bond Principles (GBP) published by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), and the Green Loan Principles (GLP) administered by the Loan Market Association (LMA).\n\n## Sustainable agenda funding transactions\n\n| Green transactions              | Amount  (million)   | Maturity      |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| LOANS                           |                     |               |\n| Bankia loan 165 M AUD           | 165 AUD             | December 2022 |\n| ING loan 100 M AUD              | 100 AUD             | July 2024     |\n| Bankia loan 55 M AUD            | 55 USD              | December 2021 |\n| Unicredit loan 50 M EUR         | 50 EUR              | January 2022  |\n| Syndicated loan Chile 200 M USD | 150 USD             | October 2024  |\n| EMTN                            |                     |               |\n| XS1684805556 December 2030      | 68 EUR              | December 2030 |\n| XS2060619876 October 2021       | 222,7 EUR           | October 2021  |\n| XS2036691868 August 2026        | 113,2 EUR           | August 2026   |\n| XS1525867104 November 2031      | 22 EUR              | November 2031 |\n| XS2122902468 February 2024      | 60,4 EUR            | February 2024 |\n| XS2202837121 July 2023          | 30 USD              | July 2023     |\n| XS2248078136 October 2035       | 39,5 EUR            | October 2035  |\n| XS2267085616 December 2039      | 120 EUR             | December 2039 |\n| OTHER DEALS                     |                     |               |\n| Schuldschein 2016               | 78,5 EUR            | Several       |\n| NSV October 2034                | 50 EUR              | October 2034  |\n| Schuldschein 2019               | 167 EUR             | Several       |\n| NSV March 2035                  | 30 EUR              | March 2035    |\n| Private Schuldscheins           | 40 EUR              | Several       |\n\nA total of 837,85 M\u20ac were raised in 2020, in addition to the 933,05 M\u20ac raised in previous years.

P\u00ba de la Castellana, 259 C 28046 Madrid\n\nIndependent Assurance Report on the non-financial indicators included in Appendix II Information about sustainable funding projects in the 2020 Integrated Report of Acciona, S.A.\n\n(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish language version prevails.)\n\n## To the Management of Acciona, S.A.:\n\nWe have been engaged by Acciona, S.A. (hereinafter, Acciona) to review the non-financial performance indicators included in 'Appendix II. Information about sustainable funding projects' within its Integrated Report for the year ended at 31 December 2020 (hereinafter Appendix II), selected from those proposed by ACCIONA according the Second-party opinion letters available in www.acciona.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance/ associated with the green bond issued in order to comply with the Green Bond Principles' fourth principle and under the framework of Green Bond Standard (EU-GBS) produced by the EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance.\n\nOur report is presented in the form of an independent conclusion with a limited assurance indicating that, based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, there is nothing that has caught our attention and makes us think that the indicators are not reliable and do not comply, in all its material aspects, with the principles and guidelines for the determination of indicators included in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards).\n\nThe revised information is limited to the content of Appendix II above mentioned, in which Acciona has included selected non-financial indicators to comply with the current and projected progress of the environmental and social performance at El Cortijo wind farm in Mexico, Mt Gellibrand wind farm in Australia, Palmas Altas wind farm in USA, Almeyda photovoltaic plant in Chile and Quito Metro in Ecuador (currently under construction).\n\n## Responsibilities of Acciona's management\n\nAcciona's management is responsible for the selection, preparation and presentation of Appendix II in accordance with the fourth principle of the Green Bond Principles (Guidelines and procedures for the issuance of green bonds) published by the International Capital Market Association, under the framework of Green Bond Standard (EU-GBS) produced by the EU Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance and the principles and guidelines for the determination of indicators included in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards). It is also responsible for the selection and presentation of the non-financial indicators of Appendix II from those proposed by the Second-party opinion letters associated with the green bond issued, including the establishment and maintenance of the control and performance management systems from which the information is obtained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n3\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n6\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n8\n\nAppendices\n\n74\n\n<!-- image -->",

P\u00ba de la Castellana, 259 C 28046 Madrid\n\nThese responsibilities include the establishment of appropriate controls where Acciona's management considers necessary to enable that the preparation of non-financial indicators with a limited assurance review would be free of material errors, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to review Appendix II and report in the form of an independent conclusion with a limited assurance based on the evidence obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the revised International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000, 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and the Standard ISAE 3410 'Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires that we plan and perform our work to obtain a significant level of assurance about whether the Appendix II complies, in all its material aspects, with the principles and guidelines for the determination of indicators included in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards), as a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.\n\nKPMG applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC1) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Internal Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\n## Procedures applied\n\nOur limited assurance engagement consisted of making enquiries of management and people responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Appendix II and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures. These procedures included:\n\n- > Analysis of the processes of compiling and internal control over quantitative data reflected in the Appendix II, regarding the reliability of the information, by using analytical procedures and review testing based on sampling.\n- > Review of the application of the Global Reporting Initiative's GRI Standards through the Sustainability Reporting Standards requirements for the preparation of reports.\n- > Reading the information presented in the Appendix II to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the environmental and social performance in the projects above mentioned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPMG Asesores, S.L. P\u00ba de la Castellana, 259 C 28046 Madrid\n\nOur multidisciplinary team included specialists in environmental and social business performance.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than that of a reasonable assurance engagement. Under no circumstances may this report be considered an auditor's report.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur conclusion is based on and subject to the matters described in this Independent Assurance Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.\n\nBased on the limited assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the non-financial indicators included in Appendix II. Information about sustainable funding projects, of Acciona's Integrated Report, for the year ended 31 December 2020 have not been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the principles and guidelines for the determination of indicators included in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards), including the reliability of data, the adequacy of the information presented and the absence of significant deviations and omissions.\n\n## Purpose of our report\n\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of our engagement letter, this Independent Assurance Report has been prepared for Acciona in relation to its Appendix II. Information about sustainable funding projects within 2020 Acciona's Integrated Report and should therefore not be used for any other purpose or in any other context.\n\nKPMG Asesores, S.L.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPatricia Reverter Guillot 16 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nMessage from the Chairman\n\n2\n\nExecutive summary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe value of solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nOur plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolutions: our business model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur organisation: the value of doing things right\n\n7\n\nAbout this report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppendices\n\n75\n\n<!-- image -->",
