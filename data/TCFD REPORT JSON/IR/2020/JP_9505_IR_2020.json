In May 2021, we celebrated our 70th anniversary.\n\nAs a company established with the backing of the regional community, including industrial and economic circles, we have developed alongside the Hokuriku region by ensuring a stable supply of low-cost, high-quality energy, keeping coexistence and co-prosperity with the region in mind as our fundamental management philosophy, while aggressively undertaking projects such as the development of power sources. We will continue to make progress together with the region, and strive to contribute to the resolution of social issues, including the realization of carbon neutrality.\n\n## The Beginning of the Electricity Business in the Hokuriku Region \u0336 the Roots of the Hokuriku Electric Power Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Establishment of the Toyama Electric Light Company and the Kanazawa Electricity Company\n\n## 1898\n\nA number of electric power companies, including the Toyama Electric Light Company, were established in Hokuriku. Electric power resources were developed, capitalizing on the area\u029fs plentiful water resources. The low-cost electricity generated by hydropower allowed the area to develop industries, attracting industries that are heavy consumers of power, such as the steel and carbide industries, as well as the textile industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1899 Establishment of the Kyoto Electric Light Company Fukui Branch\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOkubo Power Station of the Toyama Electric Light Company Completed in 1899\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## History of the Hokuriku Electric Power Company\n\n## 1951\n\nThe Hokuriku Electric Power Company has contributed to the development of the Hokuriku region through the stable supply of low-cost, high-quality energy, while diversifying power sources in line with the needs of the times. During the high economic growth period, the company supported the strong demand for electricity by developing thermal power sources, as well as developing hydroelectric power in the Arimine area, taking advantage of the region\u029fs abundant water sources. The company\u029fs other efforts in this regard include ensuring energy security following the experience of the oil crises, and decarbonizing from power generation to help address global warming.\n\n## \u25cf Amount of Total Electricity Sales\n\n2.1 billion kWh \uff0a\n\n1951\n\n1954\n\n## 2012\n\nMikuni Photovoltaic Power Station\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFushiki Industrial Area (Toyama Prefecture)\n\n1951\n\n## Establishment of the Hokuriku Joint Electricity Company\n\n## Establishment of the Hokuriku Electric Power Company\n\n## 1941\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShosaku Yamada\uff08later the first president of the Hokuriku Electric Power Company\uff09 approached electric utility companies in Hokuriku, and 12 companies voluntarily consolidated, establishing a unified electricity business in the Hokuriku region.\n\nShosaku Yamada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen Japan\u029fs power supply framework was discussed during and after the war, the initial plan suggested that the whole country should be divided into eight blocks, with the Hokuriku area merged into the Chubu area.

I assumed the position of company president in June 2021. For many years, I worked primarily in sales and marketing, with opportunities to get in touch with customers at the head office and branches, where I always tried to understand our customers\u029f views. In our business management going forward, I would like to continue to keep in mind the importance of thinking from our customers\u029f perspective, rather than only from the supply side theory.\n\nOur corporate message, \u02a0Continuing to live up to customers\u029f needs,\u02a1 is intended to show our commitment to responding to the various expectations of our community and customers, and to fulfill their requests. We aim to continue to be chosen by customers, by being of service to them.\n\n## Changes in the Business Environment Surrounding the Group\n\nThe acceleration of the trend toward decarbonization, including the Japanese government's carbon neutrality declaration and the drastically more ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target, and the rapid progress in digital technology, including AI and IoT, have compelled the energy industry to face tremendous changes that are truly game-changing.\n\nAmid this dramatically changing business environment, we must deepen and strengthen our existing businesses, as well as take on the challenges of new businesses \u0336 a balanced implementation of both will be required. The Group will strive to deepen our electricity business, while pursuing the creation of new value in the future.",

        "page_content": "## Strengthening Our Management Base for Our Electricity Business\n\nMainly due to intensified competition in retail and increased use of distributed renewable energy resources, it has become difficult to maintain our electricity business by simply buying and selling electricity, and great changes are required. In addition to stabilizing our business foundation for our ongoing electricity business, we will reform our business structure to further strengthen it.\n\nFirst of all, we will take appropriate actions, one by one, to meet the review requirements toward the restart of Shika Nuclear Power Station at the earliest possible date, which is indispensable for stable power supply and improved financial balance. In order to stay ahead of the tough competition in the electricity market, we will work to offer added value tailored to each customer, in addition to low and attractive electricity rates, with the aim of further expanding sales, including the acquisition of more and more customers in the Tokyo metropolitan area, where sales are favorable.\n\nTo this end, we will reform our work processes and strengthen our business foundation, by further streamlining operations and reducing costs, as well as reallocating resources to meet changes in the business environment, quickly responding to cross-functional issues, and making other efforts.\n\n## Taking on Challenges toward Carbon Neutrality by 2050\n\nWe recognize that the realization of a decarbonized society is a major social challenge, and addressing the issue of global warming is an important part of our business. As a responsible energy provider to be trusted and chosen, the Group has taken on the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In April 2021, we established a roadmap placing emphasis on three points: decarbonization of power sources, increased sophistication of transmission and distribution networks, and support for customers\u029f and the region\u029fs decarbonization. In July, with the aim of strongly promoting group-wide efforts, we set up the Carbon Neutral Promotion Meeting, with myself as the chair.\n\nToward the decarbonization of power sources, we have established a target of increasing the amount of electricity generated by renewable energy sources, by 2.0 billion kWh per year by FY 2030 compared to FY 2018; however, we aim to accelerate this effort and further increase this amount. In addition, we continue working to achieve an early restart of nuclear power generation, which does not emit CO2, and mainly by making the most of this, we strive to realize decarbonization. Along with the establishment of our roadmap, we have also set a new target for the ratio of electricity generated from non-fossil-fuel sources: 50% or higher in 2030.\n\nCoal-fired power generation is a base load generation source with excellent supply stability at low costs, and we are currently using it while working to improve its efficiency by replacing turbines and increasing biomass co-combustion ratios. In addition, toward the future, we will actively seek to utilize next-generation technologies, such as power generation with ammonia and hydrogen.\n\nIn order to achieve carbon neutrality, efforts by not only the supplier side but also the consumer side are essential. We strive to properly meet customers\u029f needs for decarbonization, and thus to contribute to \u02a0zero emission\u02a1 efforts in the Hokuriku region, by providing new services such as consulting focused on saving energy and reducing CO2 emissions, proposals of solutions for electrification, development of\n\nrenewable energy sources \uff08e.g. the photovoltaic power equipment third-party possession model, in collaboration with customers and local communities\uff09, and providing renewable-energy-oriented electricity rate plans \uff08e.g. RE100-compliant plans\uff09. Going forward, we will continue to work to deepen our focus on environmental, social, and governance \uff08ESG\uff09 factors in our management, with the goal of bringing about a sustainable society \uff08achieving SDGs\uff09.\n\n## Business Development Transcending the Framework of Our Existing Electricity Business\n\nTaking into consideration the changes in the value structure of the electricity business, we will work to develop businesses transcending the framework of our existing electricity business. In April 2019, we established the Hokuriku Electric Power Group 2030 Long-term Vision, with a 2:1 ratio of electricity business to non-electricity business as the business portfolio target for FY 2030. In April 2021, we also established the future vision of the Group, wherein the Group is expected to grow by solving social issues, in the forms of sustainable regional development and the realization of a smart society. In particular, carbon neutrality is a major issue that should be addressed by the entirety of society, and achieving this goal will require not only innovations for the practical application of decarbonization technologies, but also drastic changes in lifestyles and other aspects of society. We consider this trend toward decarbonization to be a great business opportunity, and will work to expand our business domains, by creating new added value based on the knowledge and expertise we have accumulated as an energy company, toward the growth of the Group.\n\n## Message to Stakeholders\n\nWe must always keep in mind that we are a part of the Hokuriku region, and this is also true when we take on new challenges. When the electric power industry was reorganized during the war, the independence of the Hokuriku area was protected through the support of local enterprises. This laid the foundation of our company, and we have inherited in our corporate DNA a strong drive to develop alongside the Hokuriku region. Our electricity business is expected to experience significant changes going forward; even amid this situation, I believe that it is our mission to work with the Hokuriku region, as we continue to aim for future growth. Our ideal future state, \u02a0Developing alongside the Hokuriku Region, Creating New Value Nationwide and Internationally,\u02a1 in our long-term vision, was likewise based on this same idea.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the rapid changes that our electricity business has been facing, we choose to think of these changes as chances, and will continue taking on the challenges of the new era. Accordingly, I aim to build a corporate culture that tolerates risks and failures, and where people can take on challenges with pleasure and enthusiasm.\n\nFinally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of our stakeholders, whose continued understanding and support is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

In April 2021, we created a roadmap aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. We now work toward the decarbonization of power sources, with the goal of making the ratio of electricity generated from non-fossil sources 50% or higher in 2030.\n\nAn early restart of Shika Nuclear Power Station is indispensable for the realization of a decarbonized society, as well as to ensure a stable supply of electricity. Seven years have passed since we filed our application for a review on conformity to the new regulatory requirements regarding Unit 2, and at the review meeting in January 2021, our explanation of the inactivity of the faults at the site gained an overall understanding.\n\nAs part of our efforts toward decarbonization, we have established in our long-term vision a\n\ntarget of increasing the amount of electricity generated by renewable energy sources by 2.0 billion kWh per year compared to FY 2018, by FY 2030, and are promoting our study to increase our hydroelectric power generation through the construction and large-scale renovations of power stations, and other means, as well as to discover new sites for renewable energy such as wind power. In addition, in May 2021, we set up the Renewable Power Department to further accelerate our efforts. Coal-fired power generation faces severe criticism worldwide from the perspective of greenhouse gas reduction; however, as we still consider it to be an important base-load power source for stable supply at low costs, we will work to improve power generation efficiency by replacing turbines and utilizing AI and IoT technologies, and to increase biomass co-combustion ratios. Furthermore, we will advance our studies for the utilization of next-generation technologies for the introduction of carbon-free fuels such as ammonia and hydrogen.",

The proper energy mix is important for Japan given the country\u029fs low energy self-sufficiency rate; additionally, from the perspectives of not only energy security and environmental suitability, but also economy, nuclear power generation must continuously play an important role as a base load generation source.\n\n## Energy Self-sufficiency Rate\n\nJapan is poor in natural energy resources, with an energy self-sufficiency rate of only 12%, meaning that Japan relies on imports for almost all energy resources.\n\nWith the increasing global population, especially in emerging countries, energy demand is expected to rise significantly in the future, requiring energy composition that does not rely excessively on fossil fuels.\n\n## \u25cfChanges in the Global Population\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: UN, World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision \uff08Figures for 2020 and later are projections.\uff09\n\n## \u25cfEnergy Self-sufficiency Rates of Major Countries \uff082018\uff09\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uff0aUranium is a nuclear fuel, which can be used for a long period after import and can be reprocessed and recycled, and is considered a quasi-domestic energy source.\n\nSource: IEA World Energy Balances \uff082020 Edition\uff09\n\n## Energy Mix\n\nElectric utilities have a social mission to ensure a stable supply of low-cost, high-quality electricity. The proper energy mix is of importance for a supply of electricity that supports daily life and industry from the perspective of \u02a0S+3Es,\u02a1 to simultaneously achieve energy security, economy, and environmental suitability, while putting the highest priority on safety.\n\nIn addition, it is crucial to produce power based on a well-balanced combination of various generation resources that makes effective use of their respective characteristics, including economic efficiency, responsiveness to changes in electricity demand, etc., in order to satisfy ever-changing power demand.\n\nThe policy of Japan's energy mix for FY 2030 was revised in the Fifth Basic Energy Plan, which was approved by the Cabinet in July 2018. While the approximately 20-22% share of nuclear power set for 2030 was unchanged, a policy to proceed with efforts to make renewable energy serve as a main power source was indicated.\n\n## CO2 Emissions by Sources\n\nNuclear power does not emit CO 2 when generating electricity, akin to renewable energy sources like photovoltaic and wind power.\n\n## \u25cfCO2 Emissions per kWh by Sources\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry Report \uff08July 2016\uff09\n\n## \u25cfThe concept of energy mix \uff08S+3Es\uff09\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Power Generation Cost by Sources\n\nThe cost of nuclear power generation measures up favorably to other power generation sources, even if additional costs such as accident risk costs are included.\n\n## \u25cfPower Generation Cost by Sources \uff082014 Model Plants\uff09\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uff08Figures vary depending on preconditions and other factors.\uff09\n\nSource: Power Generation Cost Verification Working Group \uff08May 2015\uff09\n\n|                  | Before Tohoku Earthquake \uff082010\uff09   | Current \uff082018\uff09   |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Renewable Energy | Approx. 9%                          | Approx. 17%        |\n| Nuclear          | Approx. 25\uff05                        | Approx. 6\uff05        |\n| Coal             | Approx. 28\uff05                        | Approx. 32\uff05       |\n| LNG              | Approx. 29\uff05                        | Approx. 38\uff05       |\n| Oil              | Approx. 9\uff05                         | Approx. 7\uff05        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Created based on the data presented at the 26th meeting of the Basic Policy Subcommittee on Electricity and Gas under the Electricity and Gas Industry Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy \uff08July 2020\uff09 of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy",

Given this, in order for the Group to continue sustainable growth, it is necessary to develop businesses that transcend the framework of our existing electricity business.\n\nIn our Long-term Vision, which we established and announced in April 2019, we set objectives of increasing ordinary income and establishing a business portfolio with a 2:1 ratio of electricity business to non-electricity business in FY 2030, and we have since worked to expand our current business domains while creating new ones.\n\nIt has now been two years since the Long-term Vision was established, and our new businesses are starting to show results. Regarding our efforts to solve regional issues, a group composed of six companies, including the Hokuriku Electric Power Company, was selected as\n\nthe priority negotiation rightsholder for taking over the gas and power generation services operated by Kanazawa City; we are now proceeding with preparations for the business transfer. Additionally, in March 2021, we invested in a gas-fired power generation project in the UAE, marking our first foreign direct investment. Going forward, we will work to get our new businesses on track to secure profits.\n\nWe also declared, in the future vision of the Group that we announced in April 2021, that we will develop businesses that transcend the framework of our existing electricity business, in order to contribute to resolving social issues concerning global warming, sustainable regional development, and the realization of a smart society. We will continue to take on the challenges of new business opportunities to ensure safety and peace of mind in everyday life and health, to provide services that contribute to improving the quality of life of our customers through digital technologies, and more.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other members of the group are Toho Gas Co., Ltd.; the Hokkoku Bank, Ltd.; Hokkoku Shimbun Inc.; Matsumura Bussan Co., Ltd.; and Komatsu Gas Co., Ltd. On May 13, 2021, we established Kanazawa Gas & Electricity Co., Ltd., with operations to commence on April 1, 2022. On June 30, the company entered into a tentative business transfer agreement with Kanazawa City.\n\n## \u25cf Main Operations of the New Company \uff08Proposal\uff09\n\nWe plan for the new company to handle electricity retail business and other operations, in addition to the two existing services. On the major premise of ensuring safety and security, and placing the highest priority on the development of Kanazawa City and the lives of the people living there, we will propose business operations that leverage the expertise of private companies.\n\n- \u25cf Gas\u00a0production\u00a0and\u00a0supply\n- \u25cf Gas\u00a0retail\u00a0\uff08approx.\u00a060,000\u00a0customers\uff09\n\nGas\u00a0Business\n\nElectricity\u00a0Business\n\n- \u25cf Power\u00a0generation\u00a0\uff08hydroelectric\uff09 \uff085\u00a0power\u00a0stations,\u00a0including\u00a0Kamiterazu\u00a0Power\u00a0Station; total\u00a0capacity\u00a0approx.\u00a033,000\u00a0kW\uff09\n- \u25cf Electricity\u00a0retail\n\nThrough the integrated management of the two businesses, the company provides new services, such as rate plan options to meet customer needs \uff08e.g. package deals of gas and electricity\uff09 and monitoring.\n\nBy being trusted by the people and providing services that meet and exceed expectations, the company aims to become a comprehensive energy enterprise with close ties to the local community.\n\n## Compound Building Construction Plan East of Komatsu Station\n\nIn January 2021, we established a basic agreement with Komatsu City, on the development of a compound building in the eastern area of Komatsu Station. In line with the agreement, we will develop the said building adjoining the station, which would serve to revitalize the community, to bring liveliness, and to increase the appeal of the city. The building, planned to be completed in 2024, will contain a public university, municipal facilities, a hotel, commercial facilities, offices for our group companies, and others.\n\nThe building will be constructed and operationally managed by Hokuden Sangyo Komatsu Building G.K., a subsidiary of Hokuden Sangyo Co., Ltd., which runs the business of real estate within the Group.\n\n## Plant Factory\n\nIn March 2021, we established FreDelish Co., Ltd., a new company to\n\noperate a fully-artificially-lit plant factory in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture. Plant factories can stably produce agricultural products without being affected by weather or other external environmental factors. The company is working to build a system to produce 800 kg of leaf lettuce per day. For the plant factory business, which consumes a large amount of electricity,\n\nwe believe we can leverage our expertise on energy savings and energy management.\n\n## Investment in Asset Finance Hakusan Investment Project Limited Liability Partnership\n\nFor the purposes of contribution to the development of Hokuriku\u029fs economy and the acquisition of stable dividend income based on rent from Aeon Mall Hakusan, we invested in the Asset Finance Hakusan Investment Project Limited Liability Partnership via Hokuriku Electric Power Business Investment G.K.\n\nWe expect that this investment will contribute to the economic development of Hokuriku through Aeon Mall Hakusan.\n\nConceptual design of completed compound building\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRendering of the Plant Factory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRendering of Aeon Mall Hakusan\n\n<!-- image -->",

In FY 2020, about 50% of our employees worked from home. We intend to establish this as a system to help further improve labor productivity and promote diverse and flexible work styles, in addition to using it as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWeb Meeting with Telecommuting Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promotion of Health-conscious Management\n\nBased on the strong belief of the top management that health and safety take priority over all else, we promote health-conscious management, and have been certified as a Health and Productivity Management Organization \uff08Large Enterprise Category\uff09. We are also extending this initiative to other companies of the Group.\n\nWe work to strengthen support for employees through the Health Care Center, and push\n\nahead with health promotion measures from both physical and mental perspectives, such as improving mental health, establishing exercise habits, and helping people quit smoking.\n\n## Development of Human Resources\n\nWe implement various educational measures to help each employee develop and demonstrate skills, with a feeling of fulfillment and achievement.\n\nWe provide basic education in the knowledge, attitudes, and other characteristics required of each level of employees \uff08e.g. young, mid-grade, and managerial levels\uff09, and professional training in the knowledge, skills, and other qualities necessary to carry out duties in each specialty.\n\nIn addition, because global talent is becoming increasingly important for our operations, such as purchasing fuel (procurement of coal, LNG, etc.), providing explanations to overseas investors, and handling new businesses overseas, we send employees to various programs, such as overseas MBAs, with the aim of developing comprehensive competencies, including humanity and inner strength, in addition to language skills and professional knowledge.\n\n## Respect for Human Rights\n\nStarting in 1995, we have annually held a Human Rights Enlightenment Promotion Committee meeting, including group-based information sharing, for the purpose of establishing better understandings of human rights issues and promoting the creation of a corporate culture with an open atmosphere, free of discrimination.\n\nEach year, we host a lecture on human rights by an outside lecturer, on topics such as discrimination, harassment, and diversity. In FY 2020, we invited Yasuko Okada, Chairman and Chief Director of Cuore C Cube Co., Ltd., to give a presentation on the subject of \u02a0Prevention of Harassment: To Create a Pleasant Workplace.\u02a1\n\nIn 2016, we set a Progress \uff0a Week to correspond with Human Rights Week \uff08December 4-10\uff09 in order to further deepen our understanding of diversity; during this period, we share a message from the company president, and hold workplace discussions and other events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBasic Education for Second-year Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLecture on Human Rights\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will continue these efforts to ensure the effectiveness of our corporate governance.\n\nFor more information on our fundamental policies related to corporate governance, as well as the status of our compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, please see the Corporate Governance Report on our website: http://www.rikuden.co.jp/management/governance.html\n\n## Corporate Governance System\n\n## \u25cf Board of Directors\n\nAs a general rule, the board of directors meets\n\nonce monthly, or as necessary. In addition to making decisions on important business execution matters in accordance with laws, regulations, and our articles of incorporation, the board also receives reports from directors on the status of their execution of duties, and supervises the directors\u029f execution of duties. External directors provide surveillance, instruction, and advice for managerial judgment and decision-making processes, from various points of view. In addition, five audit & supervisory board members, three of whom are external members, are also present at meetings of the board of directors, and supervise the directors\u029f execution of duties.\n\nIn order to build a management system capable of responding more quickly to changes in the business environment, the term of office for directors is one year; through this, we intend to allow even stricter supervision of our business operations by shareholders.\n\n## \u25cf Audit & Supervisory Board Members\u029f Audits and Internal Audits\n\nOur five audit & supervisory board members \uff08including three external members, and a full-time corporate auditor with considerable knowledge of financial affairs and accounting\uff09 attend important meetings \uff08such as meetings of the board of directors and corporate management committee meetings\uff09 to listen to the deliberations, carefully read important documents \uff08such as documents for approval\uff09, hear from relevant parties, and perform other necessary tasks, for audits of directors\u029f execution of duties, the maintenance and operation of internal control systems, etc. In addition, our auditors hold periodic meetings with directors, the internal audit department, and the accounting auditor to exchange opinions, in order to strengthen their auditing functions.\n\nIn addition, we have established an internal audit department, which works in cooperation with the audit & supervisory board members and accounting auditor to ensure the propriety of our operations.\n\n## \u25cf Corporate Governance System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uff0aNote Regarding the Group Companies: The governance system of the Hokuriku Electric Power Transmission & Distribution Company is structured to conform to the conduct regulations set forth by the national government.\n\n<!-- image -->",

External directors provide surveillance, instruction, and advice for managerial judgment and decision-making processes, from various points of view.\n\nIn addition, audits by our three external audit & supervisory board members provide surveillance, instruction, and advice through more objective and multifaced points of view, and we take their work seriously as we work to take proper measures in response.\n\nAll of our external directors and external audit & supervisory board members are designated as independent officers, as stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and notifications are filed with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\n## Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nMatters requiring a resolution of the board of directors undergo advance deliberation by the corporate management committee and sufficient advance explanation to external directors, before being brought up for discussion by the board of directors. In addition, after evaluation of the operation, etc. of the board of directors, the company issues a report to the board of directors at the end of each fiscal year, alongside which, as necessary, the operation of the board of directors is reviewed, including revisions to standards for bringing up matters for discussion and reporting.\n\nWe also engage in opinion exchanges with external directors and external audit & supervisory board members on the operation of the board of directors, among other efforts toward further improvements to the effectiveness of the board of directors.\n\nThrough these efforts, we believe that the effectiveness of our board of directors is satisfactory.\n\n## Policies and Procedures for Appointment and Dismissal of Key Management Personnel, and for Nomination of Candidates to Director and Audit & Supervisory Board Member Positions\n\nIndividuals are nominated to be key management personnel, or as candidates to serve as directors or audit & supervisory board members, based on their career backgrounds, as well as their excellent character, insight, and abilities.\n\nFor our external directors and external audit & supervisory board members, we nominate individuals who possess broad knowledge and experience, and who can make use of their outstanding experience and insight to provide surveillance, instruction, and advice on our management, from a more objective perspective.\n\nIn the event of dishonesty in the execution of the duties of a member of the key management personnel, or a serious violation of laws, ordinances, or our articles of incorporation, that individual shall be dismissed. Candidates for director and audit & supervisory board member positions shall be decided after sufficient deliberation at a meeting of the board of directors at which all members of the board, including the external directors and external audit & supervisory board members, are present.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive Compensation\n\nAt the Hokuriku Electric Power Company, matters such as compensation for individual directors are determined based on an established policy, as outlined below:\n\nAs a basic policy, compensation for individual directors shall be determined by taking into consideration its function as an incentive for the sustainable growth of corporate value, and shall be at appropriate levels for their individual duties. Specifically, compensation for directors \uff08except external directors\uff09 comprises base compensation on a monthly basis and bonuses to be paid at certain times each year, while compensation for external directors comprises only monthly base compensation in view of their duties.\n\nThe amount of monthly base compensation for each director is determined through comprehensive consideration, according to their position, in light of the level at other companies, as well as the business environment, performance, and other factors regarding the Company. The bonus amounts for each director \uff08except external directors\uff09 are determined according to their positions, in view of performance for each fiscal year and other factors, after a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders for each payment.\n\nThe amount of base compensation for individual directors is determined by the chairman of the board and the president having been entrusted by the board of directors, based on the discussion at a meeting regarding compensation consisting of the three external directors, the chairman of the board, and the president. The amount of bonuses for individual directors shall be determined for each payment by the chairman of the board and the president, having been entrusted by the board of directors, based on the discussion at a meeting regarding compensation, following a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders.\n\nCompensation for our audit & supervisory board members comprises only monthly base compensation in view of their duties.\n\nBase compensation for audit & supervisory board members is within the range of the total sum approved at the general meeting of shareholders, and determined through discussion among the audit & supervisory board members.\n\n## Internal Control\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act, our board of directors has made a resolution on the maintenance of a structure to ensure the propriety of our operations \uff08fundamental policies of the internal control system\uff09, stipulating basic systems such as compliance, risk management, and propriety in the operations of the Group. Based on this resolution, we work to maintain and operate systems to ensure propriety in our work. Other Group companies have also decided upon fundamental policies based on each company\u029fs current status, as part of our Group-wide efforts to ensure propriety in our work.\n\nWith regards to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act internal control and reporting system \uff0a , our company rules stipulate systems and mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of Group financial reporting, and we operate them appropriately. Alongside this, we also evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control, and perform the necessary corrections and improvements. In June of 2021, we also submitted our internal control report to the prime minister, in which we judged our internal controls to be effective based on a self-appraisal.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Culture for Ensuring Transparency and Safety\n\nIn 2007, it came to light that we had not properly handled some incidents regarding power generation facilities, including the criticality accident at Unit 1 of Shika Nuclear Power Station. Following this, we have worked to establish a corporate culture for ensuring transparency and safety, with efforts company-wide to prevent any such issues from happening again. In February of 2011, an examination committee composed of external experts evaluated our efforts toward recurrence prevention, and concluded that the corporate culture for ensuring transparency and safety had been established. Even after this evaluation, every employee has continued and improved these long-term efforts, taking to heart the importance of never flagging in our dedication to the corporate culture. We continue further deepening the culture that we have built, improving company-wide quality of services and operations, as we work to earn the community\u029fs trust and provide sense of security.\n\n## Deepening Our Safety Culture\n\n## Connecting with Stakeholders\n\n## Enlightenment on Prioritizing Safety, and Improving Safety Quality\n\n- \u25cf Discussions between Top-level Managers and Front-line Site Employees\n\nWe aim to share top-level managers\u029f thoughts and passion for putting safety first with the company\n\nas a whole, as well as to increase mutual understanding within the company through frank discussion activities between top-level managers and employees.\n\n## \u25cf Sharing Case Studies of Failures to Prevent Reoccurrences\n\nWe share the lessons of failure cases within the company and facilitate improvement efforts in each department, with the goal of preventing similar accidents and problems through such conferences as \u02a0Electric Power Security Committee\u02a1 and \u02a0Failure Cases Review Meetings.\u02a1\n\nDiscussions between upper-level management and head office managers \uff08Electric Power Security Committee\uff09\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Efforts to Eliminate Work-related Accidents\n\nBased on the concept of placing top priority on safety, we work to prevent accidents that could affect any of our employees, contractors, outsourced staff members, or members of the public.\n\nIn FY 2021, we have particularly focused on encouraging workers to be familiar with the rules, by presenting clear rules to contractors and providing instructional materials to prime contractors, as well as focusing on inspections of worksites and instructions to personnel, including checking the state of communication from prime contractors to subcontractors, through patrols and other means.\n\n## Investor Relations Activities\n\nWe hold corporate information sessions for institutional investors and analysts, at which we engage in candid exchanges of opinions with top management about our business policies, financial status, and other topics. We also work to share information, including financial results, through other means, such as explanations on an individual basis, and posting to our website.\n\nFor individual shareholders, we organize tours of facilities, including Shika Nuclear Power Station, thermal power stations, photovoltaic power stations, and wind power stations, to further deepen their understanding of our business activities. \uff08In FY 2020, facility tours were canceled to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\uff09\n\n## \u25cfFundamental Policies for Procurement\n\n## Fair and Impartial Procurement Activities\n\nWe build good long-term relationships with our suppliers, who are our business partners, and we engage in procurement activities based on our Fundamental Policies for Procurement, as we work together toward the development of both parties.\n\n|   \uff11 | Compliance with Laws, Ordinances, and Social Norms   |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|   \uff12 | Highest Priority on Safety                           |\n|   \uff13 | Consideration for the Environment                    |\n|   \uff14 | Open Transactions                                    |\n|   \uff15 | Fair and Impartial Procurement                       |\n|   \uff16 | Establishment of Mutual Trust \uff08Partnerships\uff09       |\n|   \uff17 | Proper Management and Protection of Information      |\n\n## Promoting Compliance\n\nIn 2002, we established the Compliance Promotion Committee, with the company president serving as chair, and a code of conduct.\n\nWe have continued to improve our efforts over time. In order to further increase the effectiveness of our compliance promotion, in 2003, we established Whistle Hokuden, a point of contact for business ethics information; in 2007, we added an external third party \uff08lawyer\uff09 point of contact for reports; and starting in 2010, Group companies\u029f compliance violations can now also be reported.\n\nWe continue efforts to maintain our dedication to our corporate culture for ensuring transparency and safety, such as messages from the president on in-company TV broadcasts. In addition, we strive to ensure strict compliance through autonomous initiatives, such as compliance training for each layer of our company, including top- and middle-level managers and general employees, as well as group compliance discussions at each workplace.",

We immediately declare Alert Status when a disaster is expected to strike, and Red Alert Status when a disaster is predicted to occur within the next few hours, or has already occurred, or when an earthquake rated 6 Lower or above on the JMA Seismic Intensity Scale has occurred within the area we supply electricity to. In these cases, we set up an alert status \uff08general\uff09 headquarters or a disaster response \uff08general\uff09 headquarters at the relevant facility or office, according to the level of the alert status.\n\nAs a precaution for disasters, we have built a system of mutual cooperation to share disaster prevention information with local governments and other disaster-prevention-related organizations \uff08local meteorological observatories, fire stations, the Self-Defense Forces, police, etc.\uff09. In addition, we have also established a mutual support system in association with other electric power companies, the Electric Power Development Co., Ltd., the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators, contracted companies, electrical engineering work companies, and more, to provide mutual assistance, such as supply of electric power, personnel, materials, transportation\n\nequipment, etc.\n\nCompany-wide disaster prevention training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information Security\n\nWith the growing threat of international cyber-attacks on Japanese companies, we are working to enhance information security, as a critical infrastructure utility with social responsibility. In addition to cooperating with the national government and other electric power companies, we have set forth our basic policy on information security in our internal rules, and have established an in-house information security measures committee to promote information security measures under our top management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Basic Policy on Information Security\n\n- \uff081\uff09 We shall establish a system to continuously maintain and improve our information security level.\n- \uff082\uff09 We shall enact protective measures to block attacks on information assets.\n- \uff083\uff09 We shall determine emergency measures in the event of an attack, and prepare for quick recovery and to prevent attacks from recurring.\n- \uff084\uff09 We shall raise awareness about information security among all employees.\n\n## Measures against COVID-19\n\nWe implement various measures based on our business continuity plan, in order to prevent our employees from being infected, and to maintain a stable supply of electricity.\n\n## \u25cf Workplace Vaccination\n\nAt the end of June, 2021, we started workplace vaccinations for employees of the Hokuriku Electric Power Company and the Hokuriku Electric Power Transmission & Distribution Company. In addition to this effort, which should contribute to reducing the burden on the community and accelerating the pace of vaccinations, we continue other measures that we have taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which should eventually help prevent the spread of the disease in the Hokuriku region and enable us to maintain a stable supply of electricity.\n\n## \u25cf Major Anti-infection Measures on the Front Lines of Electric Power Supply\n\n- \u25cf Restricted access to the central control rooms of power stations and the control rooms of load-dispatching centers\n- \u25cf Separate working locations for power station staff members\n- \u25cf Maintaining physical distance and disinfecting shared items \uff08keyboards, etc.\uff09 when handing over duties\n- \u25cf Establishing backup systems, including securing substitute staff members who have previous experience performing the same jobs, in the event of an infection among power station operators or on-duty staff members at load-dispatching centers",
