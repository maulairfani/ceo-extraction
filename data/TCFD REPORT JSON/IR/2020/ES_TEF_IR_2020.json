The coronavirus pandemic has caused significant human injury, has affected every aspect of social and economic life and set before our eyes what we never thought we would have to see.\n\nIt has also been a year in which Telef\u00f3nica's purpose -to make our world more human by connecting people's lives- has become more meaningful than ever. We have been at the service of society and all our stakeholders. It is no longer enough for companies to ensure responsible business management and deliver show excellent performance; what is important is to understand the consequences of our activity on the communities in which we operate.\n\nOver  the  past  year,  we  have  been  shaping  the  New Telef\u00f3nica  by  following  the  strategic  plan  presented  at  the end  of  2019.  It  has  been  the  roadmap  that  has  guided  us through so much uncertainty. In such an exceptional period, Telef\u00f3nica  has  completed  some  of  the  most  important operations in its almost century-long history of success.\n\nOnce  again,  Telef\u00f3nica  has  been  a  driving  force  for  social progress  in  various  fields.  In  economic  terms,  we  have contributed  nearly  45  billion  euros  to  the  Gross  Domestic Product  (GDP)  of  our  major  markets;  we  have  paid  taxes amounting  to  8.16  billion  euros  and  generated  nearly  one million direct and indirect jobs, i.e. almost eight jobs for every new  hire.  On  the  environmental  front,  we  have  helped companies  save  9.5  million  tonnes  of  CO 2 and  we  have achieved  88%  electricity  consumption  from  renewable sources -100% in our main markets.\n\nOn the digital front, we have achieved 4G coverage for over 90% of the population in  the  four  main  countries  in  which where we operate. We have deployed our fibre not only  in urban areas but also in rural areas and we have expanded our 5G networks in our major markets -in Spain they are now available  to  78.5%  of  the  population.  Our  recent  issue  of  a sustainable  hybrid  bond,  the  first  of  its  kind  in  the telecommunications sector, reinforces our continued investment  in  renewable  and  social  projects  to  uphold  our commitments  to  the  fight  against  climate  change  and  to inclusive digitisation for all. Telef\u00f3nica never sleeps.\n\nIn what has been such a difficult year, we have managed to increase  the  trust  and  loyalty  of  our  employees,  our customers  and  society  in  general.  The  indicator  Telef\u00f3nica uses  to  gauge  how  much  the  Company's  employees recommend the organisation as a good place to work (eNPS) is  up  to  65%,  a  healthy  improvement  on  the  58%  of  2019 and  well  above  the  40%  considered  an  indicator  of excellence.",

Our score is up 7 percentage points on the previous year in the four main markets in which we operate: Spain, Germany, Brazil and the United Kingdom.\n\nTo make our world more human by connecting people's lives has become more meaningful than ever. We have been at the service of society and all our stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are aware of the challenges that await us as a company and as a society. In just a few months, the digital transformation has leap forward years in a positive move for sustainable  progress  -digitisation  can  reduce  global  CO 2 emissions  by  between  15%  and  35%.  However,  we  also address this transformation with the responsibility of being aware  of  the  associated  risks,  which  means  we  have  to ensure  network  security  and  data  privacy,  and  avoid inequality resulting from  discrimination in access to technology.\n\nWe  will  continue  working  towards  a  fairer,  greener,  more inclusive and prosperous economic and social recovery for all because  our  long-term  growth  potential  depends  on  our ability to help the community of which we form part thrive. Together we go further. No other way is possible and there is no  alternative.  Society  expects  us  to  get  involved,  to  help solve the big problems and to improve the world and the lives of  those  who  live  in  it.  That  is  why  we  will  maintain  our commitment to the principles of the Global Compact and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nWhatever  happens,  Telef\u00f3nica is the best travelling companion you can have. It is always there when you need it most. Now is the time to get going. Now is the time to excel.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete Chairman of Telef\u00f3nica\n\n<!-- image -->",

Global and market context\n\nIn 2020, the global market was affected by the macroeconomic  impact  of  the  pandemic;  this  led  to  a relatively unprecedented global economic downturn with the  consequent  impact  on  society  of  rising  inequality  and geopolitical tension.\n\nIn  this  unforeseen  context,  the  telecommunications  and technology  market  has  played  a  decisive  and  much  more dynamic  role  that  has  positioned  the  sector  as  one  of  the main  economic  drivers  in  new  societies.  The  demand  for technology  is  increasing  and  there  has  been  a  rise  in  the impact  of  digitisation  on  every  economic  sector  and  on people's lives.\n\nThe imminent access of societies to new fixed (fibre-based) and  mobile  (with  the  push  from  5G  in  the  coming  years) ultra-broadband alternatives will shape a future scenario that is  based on connectivity. This will entail exponential growth in the  number  of  connected  objects,  data  traffic  and connectivity-based digital services.\n\nImportantly,  this  digital  revolution  will  have  a  fundamental impact  on  the future  of  work .  On  the  one  hand,  we  are seeing  the  emergence  of  new  digitisation-related  job opportunities, demonstrating that training in digital skills is vital for creating quality jobs and reducing inequality. On the other hand, we are seeing an upsurge in new ways of working that are increasing employees' flexibility and autonomy.\n\nDigitisation  comes  with  the  need  to  minimise  and  prevent major security  and  privacy risks  so  as  to  build  the  trust necessary  for  the  new  situation.  Technological  advances  in Artificial Intelligence must  include  a  commitment  to transparency and trust building  for  end  users  in  relation  to the  processing  of  their  personal  data.  Similarly,  the  most valuable  assets  for  the  digital  future  (the  data)  must  be protected from growing external threats in the form of cyberattacks.\n\nSignificantly,  given  the  current  global  context,  society  is increasing  the  pressure  on  companies  and  governments  to meet long-term  sustainability  goals . The  ecological transition, social impacts, emission-reduction targets and the transformation  towards  a  circular  economy  that  minimises impacts  on  the  environment  will  shape  the  agenda  and regulation  in  the  coming  years.  In  addition,  society  is demanding  that  higher  levels  of  transparency,  equity  and inclusion be made a specific part of the business agenda. One good  example  of  this  is  the  United  Nations  Sustainable Development  Goals;  these  stand  as  the  most  ambitious programme ever to address major social and environmental issues and to which we are committed through our work as a company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Our contribution to communities: impacts and SDGs\n\nThe telecommunications  industry  plays  a  key  role in societies by providing connectivity and enabling technological  advances.  The  sector  is  continuing  with  its transformation to adapt to new market realities and respond to  the  growing  demand  for  quality  connectivity  that  is secure,  reliable,  transparent  and  inclusive.  Accordingly,  our industry  remains  dynamic  with  high  levels  of  competition, rapid adoption of technological innovations and a continuous search for efficiency.\n\nToday, the challenge for the future is to return to long-term sustainable growth and ensure a return on investment in the infrastructures that are critical to the digital revolution.\n\n## 1.1.2. Impact of COVID-19 on Telef\u00f3nica's business activity\n\nMarch 2020 was a date of major importance. The COVID-19 pandemic began in a year that tested not only society itself but  all  companies,  regardless  of  size  or  sector.  Every  key aspect of Telef\u00f3nica's business has been conditioned by the need  to respond  effectively  to  the  health  emergency brought  about  by  the  spread  of  COVID-19 in  all  our markets.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of constant change  and  the unprecedented  threat  to  global  health,  there  has  been  a sudden  deceleration  of  activity  in  the  core  sectors  of  our economies.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has been a key player in the societies in which it operates:\n\n- \u00b7 First of all, we responded to the urgent need to protect the health  of  our  employees  and  partners.  This  led  to  the closure of stores and workplaces in all the countries where we operate.\n- \u00b7 We  put  immediate  contingency  plans  in  place  to  ensure that Telef\u00f3nica could continue its operations, with most of its staff working from home.\n- \u00b7 We  guaranteed  the  service  levels  of  our  networks  and information systems  so  that  society  could  remain connected even at times of peak usage. Telef\u00f3nica's firm commitment  to  fibre  networks  enabled  it  to  absorb  the increased traffic demand from businesses and individuals.",

However,  for  the  telecommunications sector  in  general,  and  for  Telef\u00f3nica  in  particular,  there  are clear opportunities to collaborate in the recovery effort and  emerge  from  the  crisis  even  stronger.  These opportunities arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 The  acceleration  towards  digitisation  as  a  driver  of development  in  all  our  economic  sectors  (education, health, entertainment, commerce and industry, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Express  public  recognition  of  the  importance  of  reliable, secure and quality connectivity for our customers' personal and professional lives.\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica's firm commitment to leading investment in its markets  in  ultra-broadband  fixed  (fibre)  and  mobile  (with the  launch  of  5G)  infrastructures  as  the  foundations  for building the economy of the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile we cannot control the current environment or predict the  future,  we  can  ensure  that  Telef\u00f3nica  continues  to provide the services that are so crucial at such an important moment in history as the coronavirus pandemic. That is why we  want  people  and  society  in  general  to  be  connected  in every fundamental aspect of their lives, and we are working to achieve this goal.",

Mission, Purpose, Values GRI 102-14\n\n## \"Make our world more human by connecting people's lives\"\n\nOur mission puts people at the centre of everything we do. We  want  to  be  a  company  that  customers,  employees, suppliers,  shareholders  and  society  in  general  can  trust.  To achieve this, we must have clear principles that consistently guide  our  decisions  and  actions  inside  and  outside  the Company. Accordingly,  our  purpose  is  made  up  of  two  key elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Making  the  world  more  human: we  are  committed  to protecting  people  and  the  planet  and  to  ensuring  that corporate ethics are at the core of everything we do. This also forces us to take into account our various stakeholders'  expectations  and  needs  in  order  to  build relationships of trust with all of them.\n- \u00b7 Connecting  people's  lives: this  means  that  we  aim  to digitise  the  whole  of  society,  leaving  no  one  behind,  and reduce the digital  divide  in  terms  of  access,  affordability, accessibility and training in digital skills. This also pushes us to innovate so that we can offer products and services that  add  value  and  help  improve  people's  lives,  putting technology at their service.\n\nThe  COVID-19  crisis  has  highlighted  the  significance  of  our corporate purpose: never before has being connected made such  an  important  difference.  Connectivity  during  the pandemic  has  made  it  possible  for  us  to  study,  work,  get information, connect with family and friends, shop and even continue our businesses. The telecommunications sector has been  like  a  buoy  that  has  kept  our  society  afloat.  Looking ahead,  the  sector  will  continue  to  play  a  key  role  in facilitating  an  economic  and  social  recovery  that  leaves  no one behind and in building a greener and fairer economy for all.\n\nOur  corporate  purpose  also  complies  naturally  with  the United Nations 2030 Agenda, which explicitly highlights the key role played by technology, innovation and communications in addressing humanity's major challenges. Deploying  infrastructure  is  essential;  however  it  is  not sufficient on its own. We need to develop services based on this infrastructure that add value and allow us to get the full socio-economic benefits of fibre and technology. And there is also  a  need  to  increase  the  digital  skills  of  society  and business.\n\nOur  purpose  is  therefore  built  on  elements  and  values  of sustainability: we want to be perceived as a key player in the sustainable development of the new society and a facilitator in  meeting  the  new  socio-economic  and  environmental challenges.\n\nFor all of this, brand and culture alignment is key. Our aim is to  align  Telef\u00f3nica's  behaviour,  processes  and  objectives with the Company's purpose and values, ensuring consistency between words and actions so that our shared vision passes on from our employees to our customers and from our customers to society. Culture is strengthened when we are consistent in how we behave internally and how we present ourselves externally.\n\nWe  are  committed  to  doing  this  in  accordance  with  the values that define our Company:\n\n- \u00b7 We  are  open .  We  believe  that  the  best  solutions  are reached  by  collaborating  and  being  kind  and  transparent at work. We operate as an open system in which everyone counts.\n- \u00b7 We are challengers. We deliver innovative solutions and we transform and simplify people's lives. And we are not stuck in our ways - we are always willing to change to do things better.\n- \u00b7 We  are  trustworthy. We  work  in  an  honest,  simple, committed  way,  providing  safe,  quality  connections.  We are  still  here  after  almost  100  years  of  adapting  to  our customers' needs.\n\nOur  purpose  and  the  values  that  characterise  us  as  a company help us to clarify our raison d'\u00eatre and our position to  improve  the  world.  They  also  allow  us  to  align  our employees'  behaviour  and  bolster  motivation  and  pride  in belonging to the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By defining these, we will be able to align our behaviour as a company with society's expectations.\n\nThis year, the objective of the materiality study was to understand the impact of the pandemic on key issues for our stakeholders, the changes it has brought about and the challenges lying ahead.\n\nIn the aftermath of the pandemic, there has been a growing interest in the impact that companies have on society and their employees. In the area of materiality, there has been a growing interest in reliable and inclusive connectivity, as well as in aspects related to employee health and well-being.\n\n## 1.3.1. Our relations with our stakeholders GRI 102-15, 102-21, 102-43\n\nIn  the  2019  materiality exercise, we conducted an in-depth analysis  involving  all  our  stakeholders  in  the  different countries  in  which  Telef\u00f3nica  operates.  The  COVID-19 pandemic  has  brought  about  major  changes  in  the functioning  of  markets  and  society  as  a  whole;  these  have undoubtedly affected the expectations of our stakeholders. The  pandemic  has  accelerated  existing  trends  and  has reinforced the idea that environmental, social and governance  issues  pose  financial  risks  that  need  to  be properly managed under the understanding that, increasingly,  business  is  part  of  the  solution.  The  year  has been a true turning point and so we are looking to the future.\n\nFor  this  reason,  we  carried  out  a  materiality  update  to identify these changes and measure their impact, analysing the expectations and perceptions of our different stakeholders in our main markets. At the same time, we tried to  identify  key  ways  to  strengthen  the  recognition  of  our purpose among our stakeholders.\n\nThe conclusions from this exercise help us to determine what the  priorities,  challenges  and  opportunities  of  this  new scenario  are  so  that  we  can  incorporate  them  into  the Company's strategic decision-making. We also see this study as  a  way  of  building  trust,  by  listening  to  what  we  need  to take into account in these complicated and uncertain times in order to build a better future.\n\nIn  order  to  facilitate  this  dialogue,  we  established  the Responsible  Business  Panel back  in  2016.  Our  main stakeholders, at both local and global level, are represented on this Panel.\n\nThe Panel has two tiers, thus enabling greater representativeness, flexibility and closeness:\n\n- \u00b7 The Advisory Panel: which is made up of a small number of renowned experts representing each stakeholder group (customers,  employees,  strategic  partners  and  suppliers, shareholders and investors, opinion leaders and the media, society, etc.). (For more  details,  see  chapter  2.13. Appendix) These  experts  meet  periodically  to  discuss  in depth the current issues of major importance or impact for Telef\u00f3nica. At the end of 2020, the Panel was composed of 11 organisations (Allianz Global Investors , Bankia, CC.OO., eRevalue,  Ericsson,  Gestamp,  KREAB,  OCU,  UGT,  UNICEF and WBCSD).\n- \u00b7 The Extended Panel: which is made up of a representative  number  of  local  and  global  stakeholders. This  tier  allows  us  to  perform  quantitative  analysis  of material issues and trends through surveys.\n\nThe  Responsible  Business  Panel  reinforces  the  relationship the operators have as part of their day-to-day activities with these  stakeholders  in  their  respective  countries.  The Appendix Chapter contains the details in graphic form of the different types of relations with our stakeholders.\n\n## 1.3.2. Material aspects of our business GRI 103, 102-34, 102-44, 102-47\n\nDrawing  on  the  support  of  the  Responsible  Business  Panel and  based  on  internally  developed  methodology  that  has been  implemented  and  validated  by  Ipsos  (a  multinational market  research  company),  we  updated  the  materiality exercise performed last year.\n\nThe  aforementioned  methodology  delivers  a  materiality matrix  that  conforms  to  the  indications  given  in  the  'G4 Guidelines'  version  of  the  GRI  (Global  Reporting  Initiative) standard  for  non-financial  reporting.  According  to  these guidelines,  the  materiality  analysis  must  consider  aspects that reflect the Company's impact on economic,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix).  We  have  also  identified  the existing  gap  between  the  stakeholder  assessment  and  the Company's strategy and subsequently taken it into account in the  Responsible  Business  Plan.  In  addition  to  the materiality matrix, and as a result of the analysis performed, we can ascertain our performance as regards sustainability, our  situation  compared  to  that  of  our  competitors  and Telef\u00f3nica's  reputation  by  stakeholder  and  geographical region.\n\n## The process consists of the following phases:\n\n## A.  Mapping  and  validation  of  the  stakeholders to  be invited\n\nWe  pursued  representativeness  and  exhaustiveness  with regard to each market and stakeholder. A map of all 125,602 participants was completed.\n\n- B.  Identification  of  material  issues  to  be  evaluated: Internal  work  was  based  on  benchmark  standards  such  as GRI  101:  Foundation  2016,  Integrated  Reporting  Council (IIRC), AA1000AP on Accountability, the ISO 26000 standard, the  Principles  of  the  Global  Compact  and  the  Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs).  We  also  took  into  account information  on  ESG  trends  received  from  leading  analysts and  financial  indices,  and  the  conclusions  arising  from previous panel meetings.\n- 73 dimensions were identified, which were consolidated into 20 topics and 7 material issues. This facilitated our in-depth review of the materiality process, enabling gains in understanding  and  granularity  of  the  material  aspects identified.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the Appendix\n\n- C. Consultation  with  stakeholders: We  conducted  a consultation  through  an  online  questionnaire,  designing precise questions that allowed us to achieve our objective: to ascertain  the  impact  that  COVID-19  has  had  on  material issues for Telef\u00f3nica. We assessed the importance that our stakeholders attach to the seven material issues, as well as the  impact  that  Telef\u00f3nica's  performance  has  on  the behaviours and decisions of these stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  original  consultation  was  conducted  in  2019  and  was updated  at  the  end  of  2020  to  consider  the  impact  of COVID-19 on our main markets, based on an analysis carried out  in  three  Group  countries:  Spain,  Brazil  and  the  United Kingdom.\n\nOf the more than 125,000 invitees, 2,695 people participated actively,  which  represents  a  response  rate  of  2.15%  -  a significant rate given the mode of consultation.\n\nIn  this  phase,  85  senior  executives  were  also  consulted  to identify  gaps  between  expectations  and  strategy,  thereby aligning sustainability with the business.\n\n- D.  Data  analysis  and  validation: The  data  were  analysed and  reviewed  by  Ipsos,  and  were  subsequently  validated internally  and  externally.  They  were  submitted  to  the Sustainability  and  Quality  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors, as well as to all the areas at a global and local level who took part in defining the survey.\n\nThis  step  enabled  us  to  round  off  the  exercise  with qualitative opinions, a particularly relevant aspect given the very  narrow  area  in  which  the  materiality  matrix  moves. Telef\u00f3nica's  perceived  performance  (horizontal  axis)  ranges between 6.55 and 7.88, while the stated importance of the material issues ranges between 7.75 and 9.25. Both axes are on a scale of 0-10. This confirms that all the issues submitted for  evaluation  by  the  stakeholders  are  highly  relevant  for Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n- E.  Materiality  matrix: The  process  followed  delivers  a materiality matrix with a global perspective, but in which it is also possible to determine the assessment given by each of the different stakeholder categories in the different countries in which we operate.\n- To  obtain  representative  results,  two  weightings  were applied:\n- \u00b7 Each  country  sample  was  weighted  according  to  its contribution to the total revenue of the Company;\n- \u00b7 The  stakeholder  samples  were  weighted  according  to three  criteria:  impact  on  the  business,  relationship  level and  influence  of  the  group  on  others.  This  exercise  was performed  internally  with  the  methodological  backing  of Ipsos and Ernst & Young.\n\nThe  following  materiality  matrix  was  obtained  as  the  main product of the process:",

Strategy GRI 102-14\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe address the new challenges based on digitisation as a key building block for rebuilding society and the economy.\n\nAs part of our commitment to reversing climate change, we are deploying much more efficient state-of-theart grids that consume less energy.\n\nWe want to promote trust among customers and society in general on the basis of transparency, clarity, reliability and consistency.\n\n## 1.4.1. We connect people GRI 102-29\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  strategy  is  based  on  two  pillars:  its  mission  to \"make the world more human by connecting people's lives\" and  its  Principles  of  Responsible  Business  Principles.  The latter include not only its code of ethics but also its policy of responsibility  towards  its  stakeholders  and  society  in general.\n\nAccordingly,  our  strategy  starts  out  by  recognising  the growing importance of the transition to a more digital, green, sustainable  and  engaged  economy  for  all  our  stakeholders, and  takes  into  account  the  impacts  and  long-term  goals  it aims to achieve both internally and externally.\n\nThe  main  lines  of  our  future  strategy  are  based  on  three pillars:\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica's Strategy\n\nbased on...\n\nThree guidelines for the future\n\n## Build a greener future by developing ecological sustainability initiatives\n\n- \u00b7 Battle against climate change\n- \u00b7 More efficient networks and infrastructures\n- \u00b7 Services that reduce customers' environmental impact\n- \u00b7 Circular economy: medium-term goal of becoming a zero-waste company\n\nOur Mission: Make our world more human, by connecting people's lives\n\nGenerate a positive impact on progress in favour of economic and social development through digitisation\n\n- \u00b7 Digitisation of companies and businesses\n- \u00b7 Responsible and transparent use of data\n- \u00b7 Digital skills training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResponsible Business Principles\n\nLead by example in all our activities\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity and inclusion\n- \u00b7 Sustainability and trust in the chain\n- \u00b7 Trust, reputation and transparency",

        "page_content": "## 1.4.1.1. Generate a positive impact on progress in favour of economic and social development through digitisation:\n\nOur  customers  recognise  how  important  communication services  are  in  their  daily  lives.  Telef\u00f3nica  responds  to  this social demand by developing an efficient telecommunications  infrastructure  based  on  new,  faster, higher-capacity  networks  that  are  essential  for  long-term progress,  increasing  its  coverage  in  even  the  most  remote areas  and,  at  the  same  time,  developing  products  and services  that  are  in  line  with  the  needs  of  each  customer segment to ensure zero exclusion.\n\nRecent  developments  have  highlighted  -and  at  the  same time  accelerated-  a  trend  towards  greater  digitisation  in companies  and  businesses  as  a  prerequisite  for  increased competitiveness. Telef\u00f3nica is committed to helping SMEs in their transformation process, extending its range of communication services with specific IT solutions adapted to their needs.\n\nOur customers also demand trust when using our networks and  our  various  related  network  services.  Telef\u00f3nica implements the most advanced physical and logical security protocols  on  its  networks  to  guarantee  service  security. Telef\u00f3nica  has  also  renewed  its  Digital  Pact,  whereby  it makes a commitment to customers regarding the responsible use of their data based on transparency and the consent of the ultimate owners of the data: our customers.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica recognises the importance of training people for this  new  digital  world  and  the  challenges  it  involves.  In  the coming years,  digitisation  will  have  a  strong  impact  on  the working  world,  requiring  new  digital  skills,  new  specialist profiles and catering for the emergence of new professions. This  requires  a  strong  commitment  to  the  continuous training  of  our  main  asset:  our  employees.  Telef\u00f3nica  has developed  upskilling  and  re-skilling  plans  for  its  entire workforce,  providing  employees  with  access  to  the  training tools that will enable them to acquire the necessary skills for the future.\n\n## 1.4.1.2. Build a greener future by developing ecological sustainability initiatives:\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  aligned  with  global  goals  to reverse  climate change . We  acknowledge  the  growing  importance  of ecological sustainability for our societies and have developed plans  to  reduce  the  impact  of  our  business  and  assist  our customers in their ecological transition.\n\nInternally,  Telef\u00f3nica deploys  state-of-the-art  networks (fibre, 5G)  that  are  much  more  efficient  than  their forerunners in terms of energy consumption and, therefore, their ecological footprint. Specific plans have been developed to make Telef\u00f3nica's business carbon-neutral in the coming years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Responsibility with the environment\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  also  a  key  supplier  of  services  that  help our customers (mainly businesses) reduce their environmental impact . By digitising their internal processes,  businesses  can  increase  their  energy  efficiency and avoid unnecessary emissions. Telef\u00f3nica's services help customers in different ways: by reducing the need for travel (e.g.  via  home  working,  audio/video  conferencing,  Cloud services,  etc.),  automating  processes  (e.g.  with  IoT)  and optimising internal resources (e.g. with Big Data solutions).\n\nIn  collaboration  with  our  suppliers  and  partners,  Telef\u00f3nica promotes  the transition  to  a more  sustainable,  circular economy based on recycling. We have put plans in place for the  recovery  and  recycling  of  materials  (mainly  electronic and customer equipment related to network deployment) in all  our  operations.  Telef\u00f3nica  has  set  itself  the  goal  of becoming a zero-waste company in the medium term.\n\n## 1.4.1.3. Lead by example in all our activities:\n\nBeyond corporate responsibility, Telef\u00f3nica is committed to building trust in all its internal activities:\n\nAs Telef\u00f3nica moves towards digitisation, it needs the best digital talent. Promoting diversity and inclusion among our employees ensures  the  optimum  conditions  for  attracting, developing and retaining talent. Telef\u00f3nica guarantees equal opportunities in access to employment and is committed to increasing the presence of women in its management bodies in  line  with  government  targets,  thereby  eliminating  the wage gap.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica considers it essential to promote the sustainability and reliability of its supply chain , and does so  by  extending  its  principles  of  action  to  its  suppliers  and providers,  thereby  generating  a  positive  impact  in  terms  of responsibility  beyond  its  own  sphere  of  business  and reducing the risks to its own reputation as a result of thirdparty  activities.  Monitoring  in  our  supply  chain  primarily focuses  on  our  main  international  suppliers  of  major purchases  (network  equipment,  systems  and  professional services,  etc.),  but  is  to  be  extended  to  the  entire  supplier network.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica aspires to lead in terms of trust and reputation in every society in which it operates. The basis of this trust lies in the assumption of all our principles of action in each of the Company's processes, in its culture and in its projection towards the outside world. The objective is to promote trust among customers and society in general through transparency, clarity, reliability and consistency.",

Today, Telef\u00f3nica  maintains  a  strong  vision  for  the  future  and  is making solid progress in each of the important changes it has undertaken.\n\nAccordingly,  the current  organisation responds  to  the Company's own business strategy and will ensure that  the necessary  changes  are  made  to  achieve  the  targets  that have been set:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. A focus on the four key operators (Spain, Germany, UK and Brazil):\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group has refocused its strategy in order to concentrate  its  resources  and  investment  in  the  most mature  markets,  in  stable  economies  and  where  operators have a strong and sustainable long-term market position.\n\nOver  the  past  year,  the  Company  has  taken  key  steps  to strengthen its position in these four markets:\n\n- \u00b7 It  signed  a  strategic  joint  venture  agreement  with  Virgin Media  in  the  UK,  which  will  result  in  the  creation  of  a leading national, convergent offering.\n- \u00b7 It  sustained  leadership  in  fibre  deployment  and  launched new  services  (security,  health,  etc.)  to  consolidate  our positioning in Spain.\n- \u00b7 It  participated  in  the  market  consolidation  process  in Brazil, with the auction of Oi's mobile assets (in process).\n- \u00b7 It  significantly  improved  network  quality  in  Germany, resulting in major improvements in customer satisfaction.\n- \u00b7 It  launched  5G  technology  in  all  key  operators,  with  a target of rapid deployment.\n\n## 2. Launch of Telef\u00f3nica Tech:\n\nThis new venture seeks to capture the growth of the digital services  market  in  order  to  complete  the  connectivity offering to corporate customers.\n\nThe  initial  focus  has  been  on  a  service  offering  in  three businesses:  Cybersecurity,  Cloud  and  IoT/Big  Data.  During this  first  year,  Telef\u00f3nica  Tech  has  worked to complete the demerger  of  these  assets  to  bring  them  under  a  corporate structure  for  the  provision  of  services  to  all  the  Group's operators.\n\nIn  addition,  we  have  strengthened  our  main  corporate alliances  with  leaders  in  each  industry  (Microsoft,  Google, Amazon, etc.) and continue to acquire proprietary capabilities to grow in managed services for our customers.\n\n## 3. Creation of Telef\u00f3nica Infra:\n\nThis  new  company  was  created  with  the  main  aim  of developing  and  adding  value  to  Telef\u00f3nica's  valuable infrastructure,  taking  advantage  of  the  current  appetite  for investment in the market through a structure open to thirdparty involvement.\n\nIn  January  2021,  Telef\u00f3nica  Infra  announced an agreement with  American  Towers  for  the  sale  of  its  portfolio  of  more than  thirty  thousand  towers  in  Europe  and  Latin  America, thereby  enabling  the  monetisation  of  valuable  assets  and greater flexibility for the Group's future strategy. In addition, an agreement has been announced with Allianz in Germany for  the  development  of  fibre-to-the-home  projects  in  rural and  semi-rural  areas  (initially  covering  up  to  two  million households) in carrier-neutral mode (Fiberco).\n\nAccordingly,  Telef\u00f3nica  Infra  is  developing  new  future projects  to  accelerate  ultra-broadband  deployments  in  the geographical areas in which it operates.\n\n## 4. Operational spin-off of Hispam businesses:\n\nAfter  completing  the  operational  spin-off  of  the  Company, we reduced our exposure to assets in Latin America with a focus on differentiated management.\n\nVarious  organic  and  inorganic  alternatives  are  currently being  assessed  in  order  to  capture  growth  opportunities  in the region, accelerate infrastructure deployment and reduce exposure  to  financial  risks  generated  by  macroeconomic shocks and their impact on exchange rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the sale of our assets in Costa Rica has been  completed  (pending  regulatory approval) and a strategic review of the portfolio in the region remains ongoing in order to simplify the Group's structure.\n\n## 5. New operating model:\n\nThe acceleration of digitisation initiatives across the Group's operating units will capture synergies from process simplification  and  automation.  In  addition,  the  Corporate Centre has been restructured, its size being reduced to focus on activities that can provide differential value to operators, maximise synergies and materialise the value of Telef\u00f3nica's scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The MSCI World closed the year  with  gains  (+14.1%),  as  did  the  US indices  (Nasdaq: +43.6%;  S&P:  +16.3%;  Dow  Jones:  +7.2%),  which  reached record  highs  during  the  year.  This  was  driven  by  the technology  sector,  which  was  perceived  as  a  safe  haven sector during the crisis. In Europe, which was more exposed to 'cycle' and 'value', the main markets (except for the DAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(+2.5%))  closed  the  year  with  declines:  EStoxx-50  (-5.1%); CAC-40 (-7.1%); FTSE-100 (-14.3%, a performance that was also  affected  by  the  evolution  of  the  Brexit  negotiations); while  the  Ibex-35  continued  its  trend  of  a  poorer  relative performance (-15.5%).\n\nStock markets hit annual lows in March, with declines in the major European and US markets of around 35% on average\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "from  pre-pandemic  highs  in  anticipation  of  the  sharp contraction  in  economic  activity  in  the  second  quarter caused by lockdowns. The recovery of indices thereafter was marked by government monetary and fiscal stimuli, progress in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the outcome of the US presidential election and progress on the Brexit deal. Thus, the main European and US markets rallied by around 18% in the final two months of the year, boosted by (i) the positive  news  regarding  the  high  efficiency  of  vaccines  in early November, which was accompanied by strong rises Europe saw the biggest one-month rises in its history- and market  rotations  from  defensive  and  growth  stocks,  the biggest  beneficiaries  since  the  beginning  of  the  pandemic, towards cyclical and value stocks; (ii) the start of vaccination programmes around the world; (iii) the approval of new fiscal stimuli in the United States and (iv) the signing of the Brexit agreement.\n\nAlthough the pandemic has shown how essential telecommunications networks have become to society and the  economy,  the  telecommunications  sector  performed relatively worse than the overall market (-16.1%). Performance was affected by (i) preferences for momentum and growth during the pandemic; (ii) roaming exposure; (iii) the  complex  regulatory  environment;  (iv)  the  high  level  of indebtedness; (v) expectations of increased investment; and (vi)  high  levels  of  competition  in  certain  markets.  This  has been  partly  offset  by  news  of  company  mergers  and acquisitions,  which  have  become  a  potential  indicator  of progress  in  the  sector,  where  most  relative  valuations  are trading at historic lows.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  share  price  ended  2020  at  \u20ac3.25  per  share: -47.9%  for  the  year  with  a  total  shareholder  return  of -42.7%. The dividend payment in 2020 was made in the form of  a  voluntary  flexible  dividend  and  amounted  to  \u20ac0.40  per share. Telef\u00f3nica's share performance can be explained by (i) the  poorer  relative  performance  of  the  sector  in  a  complex regulatory  and  competitive  environment,  (ii)  the  poorer relative performance of the Spanish market, which was one of  the  hardest  hit  by  the  pandemic,  (iii)  the  Company's exposure to emerging markets, (iv) the depreciation of Latin American  currencies  and  (v)  the  level  of  indebtedness. However,  Telef\u00f3nica's  performance  has  been  resilient, protecting cash generation during the year. This was a result of  efficiency  measures  and  prioritisation  of  investments, which allowed the Company to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on revenues and OIBDA, and continue to reduce its debt.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  ended  the  2020  financial  year  with  a  market capitalisation  of  \u20ac17.959  billion,  making  it  the  25th  largest company in the global telecommunications sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.6.3. Advancing towards a more sustainable world GRI 102-4, 204-1\n\n## 1.6.3.1. Networks: our connectivity\n\nUsers  are  increasingly  adopting  new  technologies.  In  2020 that  trend  was  further  advanced  by  the  COVID-19  crisis, which led to an increase in data traffic. This adds importance to our goal of reaching out to all communities regardless of location,  connecting  people  and  improving  their  quality  of life.\n\nNetworks are getting faster and have greater capacity. Thus, among  the  developments  in  the  area  of  infrastructure,  we highlight the number of ultra-broadband (UBB) user accesses in  all  the  communities  where  we  are  present,  with  the exception  of  the  United  Kingdom,  where  we  have  a  mobile operator only.\n\nIn  addition,  it  is  important  to  highlight  the  Company's progress  in  the  deployment  of  5G.  This  new  generation  of mobile  telephony  enables  ultra-fast  connectivity  with differential  capabilities  in  terms  of  bandwidth,  upload  and download speeds, very low latency and the ability to connect millions of devices. This network  is  being  deployed progressively, such that by the end of 2020 we had 78.5% population coverage in Spain and are working on the rest of the countries in which we are present.\n\n## LTE Penetration\n\n|                | 2019   | 2020   | Year-on-year  variation   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|---------------------------|\n| Spain          | 83.2 % | 87.0 % | 3.8  pp                   |\n| United Kingdom | 89.4 % | 92.5 % | 3.2 pp                    |\n| Germany        | 77.8 % | 90.5 % | 12.7 pp                   |\n| Brazil         | 66.6 % | 75.8 % | 9.2  pp                   |\n| Argentina      | 79.6 % | 83.6 % | 4.1 pp                    |\n| Peru           | 85.0 % | 87.5 % | 2.5  pp                   |\n| Chile          | 84.0 % | 87.6 % | 3.6  pp                   |\n| Colombia       | 67.8 % | 73.6 % | 5.8  pp                   |\n| Mexico         | 64.6 % | 68.2 % | 3.6  pp                   |\n| Total          | 75.5 % | 82.1 % | 6.6  pp                   |\n\n## UBB accesses (thousands)\n\n|         | 2019   | 2020   | Year-on-year  variation   |\n|---------|--------|--------|---------------------------|\n| Spain   | 4,325  | 4,614  | 6.7  %                    |\n| Germany | 1,652  | 1,798  | 8.8  %                    |\n| Brazil  | 5,023  | 5,084  | 1.2  %                    |\n| HispAm  | 3,250  | 3,695  | 13.7  %                   |\n| Total   | 14,281 | 15,213 | 6.5  %                    |",

Highlights\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  significantly  affected  the  Group throughout the year 2020, as lockdowns imposed across the Group's markets put unprecedented pressure on both its B2C and B2B segments.\n\nIn  2020,  the  estimated  negative  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic on the Group's revenue performance amounted to 1,905 million euros, mainly related to a decrease in service revenues  (-1,450  million  euros)  and  handset  sales  (-456 million euros). With regards to service revenues, there were lower roaming revenues and commercial activity in the B2C segment, along with project delays and lower SME revenues which affected the performance of the B2B segment.\n\nTo  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  the  pandemic  on Telef\u00f3nica's  operations,  management  took  proactive  steps to  reduce  costs.  The  estimated  negative  impact  of  the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group's OIBDA amounted to 977 million  euros  in  2020,  as  a  consequence  of  the  decrease  in revenues, partially offset by certain savings mainly in direct and  commercial  costs  (while  there  was  an  increase  in  bad debt costs). In addition, there was a decrease in CapEx, which was carefully  planned  in  light  of  the  challenges  brought  by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOur estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the  Group's  results  were  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the difference  between  actual  results  and  the  results  that  we estimate would have been obtained if trends prevailing prior to the pandemic had not been interrupted. These estimates are made in respect of those items that were considered to be  most  affected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  namely, revenues (in  particular,  service  revenues,  roaming  revenues and  handset  sales)  and  expenses  (in  particular,  direct  and commercial costs, supplies (including handset costs) and bad debt  costs),  as  a  result  mainly  of  the  interruption  of  the commercial channel, international travelling restrictions, the temporary  closing  of  some  businesses  and  SMEs  in  some regions and, more generally, depressed economic conditions.\n\nTo  support  communities  in  which  the  Group  operates, Telef\u00f3nica implemented measures aimed at:\n\n- \u00b7 Protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  its  employees  and customers.\n- \u00b7 Providing  critical  infrastructure  and  technology  services to governments and health authorities.\n- \u00b7 Donating goods and services to hospitals and vulnerable customers.\n\n- \u00b7 Making  the  Group's  high-tech  buildings  available  for public use (O2 Arena in London and O2 Tower in Munich).\n- \u00b7 Providing customers with free mobile data and additional entertainment services at no extra cost.\n- \u00b7 Accelerating payments  to suppliers with liquidity problems  and  offering  flexible  payments  terms  to  our customers.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining  the  2020  dividend  for  shareholders,  while enhancing  financial  flexibility  through  a  voluntary  scrip dividend.\n\nMore  importantly,  Telef\u00f3nica's  state-of-the-art  networks have enabled the Group to facilitate record growth in traffic driven  by  remote  work  and  increased  consumption  of entertainment  services  while  maintaining  high  levels  of customer experience and service quality.\n\nDigitalization  has  proved  to  be  a  key  lever  for  Telef\u00f3nica  in this  crisis,  as  processes  were  accelerating,  needs  were crystallizing, and  the  Group  helped  communities  and companies to adapt and to enhance their competitiveness in the new environment. Digitalization has emerged as one of the drivers of economic recovery.\n\nIn  2020, Telef\u00f3nica continued capturing and retaining highvalue customers focusing on customer experiences and the strength of its infrastructure.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's total  accesses totaled  345.4  million  as  of December 31, 2020, with an improvement in the customer mix.  Customer  commitment  improved,  resulting  in  a  lower churn,  and  total  accesses  increased  by  0.3%  year-on-year, mainly  due  to  the  increase  in  postpay  mobile  accesses  in Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  and  Telef\u00f3nica  Germany.  Year-on-year access growth was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

 presented  in  'organic  terms' intend  to  present  year-on-year  variations  on  a  comparable basis,  by  considering  a  constant  perimeter  of  consolidation and constant average foreign exchange rates and by making certain  other  adjustments  which  are  described  herein. 'Organic\" variations  should  not  be  viewed  in  isolation  or  as an alternative to reported variations.\n\nFor purposes of this report, 2020/2019 'organic' variation is defined as the reported variation as adjusted to exclude the impacts detailed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange effects: we have excluded the impact of  changes in exchange rates (except for countries with hyperinflationary economies (Argentina and Venezuela)) by  assuming  constant  average  foreign  exchange  rates year-on-year  (using  average  foreign  exchange  rates  of 2019 for both years).\n\nForeign  exchange  rates  had  a  negative  impact  on  our reported 2020 results, mainly due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the euro.\n\nForeign  exchange  effects  decreased  revenue  growth  by 6.5 percentage points, OIBDA growth by 8.0 percentage points  and  operating  income  growth  by  7.8 percentage points in 2020.\n\n- \u00b7 Changes  in  the  consolidation  perimeter: we  have excluded  the  impact  of  changes  in  our  consolidation perimeter in 2020 and 2019. The main changes were the sale (and, therefore, the exclusion from our consolidation perimeter)  of  Antares,  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles  Guatemala, Telefon\u00eda  Celular  de  Nicaragua  and  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles Panam\u00e1 in 2019. To exclude the impact of these sales in the calculation of organic variations, the 2019 comparative figures exclude the results of such companies.  Additionally,  we  have  excluded  for  both periods  the  results  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Costa  Rica  and Telef\u00f3nica  El  Salvador,  which  were  classified  as  held  for sale at the end of 2019.\n- \u00b7 Gains  or  losses  on  the  sale  of  companies :  the  gains obtained  or  losses  incurred  from  the  sale  of  companies have been excluded to calculate organic variations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In  2020,  we  mainly  excluded  a  gain  of  29  million  euros related to the initial registration at fair value of the stake of  Telef\u00f3nica in the joint venture with the Allianz Group for the deployment of fiber in Germany.\n\nIn 2019, we mainly excluded the gains obtained from the sale  of  Antares  (98  million  euros),  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles Guatemala, Telefon\u00eda Celular de Nicaragua and Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles  Panam\u00e1  (for  a  total  amount  of  365 million  euros)  and  data  center  businesses  (213  million euros).\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring  costs: we  have  excluded  the  impact  in 2020  and  2019  of  restructuring  costs,  mainly  those related to the Individual Suspension Plan adopted under the  II  Collective  Agreement  of  Related  Companies  in Telef\u00f3nica Spain in 2019.\n\nThe distribution by segment of the restructuring costs, in terms of their impact on OIBDA and operating income, is as follows:\n\n| Millions of euros         | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Telef\u00f3nica Spain          | 1,733  | (2)    |\n| Telef\u00f3nica United Kingdom | 31     | -      |\n| Telef\u00f3nica Germany        | 22     | 37     |\n| Telef\u00f3nica Brazil         | -      | -      |\n| Telef\u00f3nica Hispam         | 235    | 17     |\n| Telxius Group             | 0      | -      |\n| Other companies           | 149    | 34     |\n| Total restructuring costs | 2,170  | 86     |\n\n- \u00b7 Reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries: in  the  organic  variation,  the  y-o-y  reported variation of the companies in countries with hyperinflationary  economies  (Argentina  and  Venezuela) is excluded. In reported terms, these companies' revenues, OIBDA, operating income and OIBDA-CapEx for 2020 decreased by 432 million euros, 229 million euros, 185  million  euros  and  91  million  euros,  respectively, compared to 2019.\n- \u00b7 Impairment  of  goodwill  and  other  assets: the impairment  of  the  goodwill  and  certain  assets  of Telef\u00f3nica Argentina  has  been  excluded  in  2020, amounting to 894 million euros, which consists of a 519 million  euros  goodwill  impairment  loss  and  impairment losses over non-current assets amounting to 375 million euros. In 2019, the goodwill impairment loss in Argentina (206 million euros) has been excluded.\n- \u00b7 Spectrum  acquisition: the  organic  variation  of  CapEx excludes the impact of spectrum acquisitions in 2020 and 2019, amounting to 126 million euros and 1,483 million euros  (excluding  spectrum  acquisition  in  El  Salvador  in 2019 amounting to 18 million euros), respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Other  adjustments: organic  variations  exclude  the following:  In  2020:  (i)  the  impact  of  the  accelerated amortization  resulting  from  the  transformation  of  the operating  model  of  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00e9xico  (following  the AT&T  agreement  in  2019),  amounting  to  320  million euros  in  2020  in  depreciation  and  amortization  and operating income; (ii) the impact of the assets classified as  held  for  sale  ceasing  to  be  amortized  in  Telef\u00f3nica United  Kingdom (771 million euros on depreciation and amortization  and  operating  income);  and  (iii)  other adjustments  amounting  to  34  million  euros  in  OIBDA, mainly due to the provisions recorded in Telef\u00f3nica Spain to optimize the distribution network (29 million euros in OIBDA), and the gains of the spectrum sale in Telef\u00f3nica Germany, (5 million euros in OIBDA).\n\nIn 2019: (i) the negative impact in OIBDA and operating income  resulting from  the  transformation  of  the operating  model  of  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00e9xico  (following  the AT&T  agreement  in  2019), amounting  to  239  million euros and 275 million euros, respectively; (ii) the impact of  the  irrevocable  sale  of  the  future  credit  rights  that might arise from the favorable resolution of a number of claims and lawsuits of various kinds to which Telef\u00f3nica Spain  was  a  party  at  the  date  of  the  sale  agreement, amounting  to  103  million  euros  in  OIBDA;  and  (iii)  the impact of the provisions recorded in Telef\u00f3nica Spain to optimize  the  distribution  network  (23  million  euros  in OIBDA).\n\nThe table below shows 2020/2019 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in accordance with the adjustments  referred  to  above)  of  certain  line  items  of  the consolidated  income  statement  and  capital  expenditures (\"CapEx\") and OIBDA-CapEx:\n\n|                               | YoY variation   | YoY variation   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA 2020               | % Reported  YoY | % Organic  YoY  |\n| Revenues                      | (11.0%)         | (3.3%)          |\n| Other income                  | (44.1%)         | (14.4%)         |\n| Supplies                      | (4.6%)          | 0.5%            |\n| Personnel expenses            | (34.5%)         | (3.8%)          |\n| Other expenses                | (10.9%)         | (5.5%)          |\n| OIBDA                         | (10.7%)         | (5.7%)          |\n| Depreciation and amortization | (11.6%)         | 0.6%            |\n| Operating income (OI)         | (8.8%)          | (16.4%)         |\n| CapEx                         | (33.3%)         | (12.0%)         |\n| OIBDA-CapEx                   | 20.5%           | (0.9%)          |\n\nThe table below shows the contribution to reported growth of  each  item  considered  to  calculate  the  organic  variations, as  explained  above.

Results discussion\n\nRevenues in  2020 totaled 43,076 million euros, decreasing in  reported  terms  by  11.0%  y-o-y,  negatively  impacted  by the  foreign  exchange  rates  (-6.5  p.p.)  (due  mainly  to  the depreciation  against  the  euro  of  the  Brazilian  real),  the impact of the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary  countries  (-0.9  p.p.)  and  changes  in  the consolidation perimeter (-0.4 p.p.). In organic terms, revenues fell  3.3%,  mainly  as  a  result  of  the  effects  of  the COVID-19 pandemic, which is estimated to have decreased revenues by approximately 1,905 million euros in 2020, due to lower handset sales and service revenues (mainly due to reduced commercial activity), a strong decrease in roaming revenues  (given  the  significant  decrease  in  international travel),  increased  promotion  offers  (consisting  of  discounts and promotions), lower prepay top ups and bolt-ons due to the shift from mobile data usage to Wi-Fi networks and lower revenues  in  the  B2B  segment  in  connection  with  both communication services and IT.\n\nThe  structure  of  revenues  reflects  Telef\u00f3nica's  geographic diversification. The contribution of the following segments to the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  revenues  increased  in  2020  as compared  to  2019:  Telef\u00f3nica  Spain,  which  contributed 28.8%  of  the  Group's  revenues  (+2.3  p.p.  versus  2019), Telef\u00f3nica  Germany  with  17.5%  (+2.2  p.p.  versus  2019), Telef\u00f3nica  United  Kingdom  with  15.6%  (+0.9  p.p.  versus 2019) and Telxius Group with 1.9% (+0.2 p.p. versus 2019). The  contribution  of  the  following  segments  decreased  in 2020  as  compared  to  2019:  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil,  which contributed  17.2%  of  the  Group's  revenues  (-3.5  p.p. compared to 2019) and Telef\u00f3nica Hispam with 18.4% (-1.5 p.p.  versus  2019).  The  contribution  of  these  two  segments was  adversely  affected  principally  by  the  foreign  exchange evolution.\n\nOther income mainly included own work capitalized in our fixed assets and gains on the sale of assets. In 2020, other income  totaled  1,587  million  euros  compared  to  2,842 million  euros  in  2019  (-44.1%  y-o-y  in  reported  terms), mainly  as  a  result  of  the  decrease  in  gains  on  the  sale  of companies in 2020 (-22.7 p.p.) and other gains. In particular,\n\nin  2019,  other  income  registered  gains  from  the  sale  of certain  companies,  mainly  Antares  (98  million  euros), Telefon\u00eda Celular de Nicaragua, Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Guatemala  and  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles  Panam\u00e1  (for  a  total amount  of  365  million  euros),  the  sale  of  data  center businesses  (213  million  euros)  and  the  irrevocable  sale  of credit rights that might arise  from the favorable resolution of certain  claims  and  lawsuits  of  various  kinds  to  which Telef\u00f3nica  Spain  was  a  party  at  the  date  of  the  sale agreement.  In  organic  terms,  other  income  decreased  by 14.4%  mainly  due  to  the  decrease  in  gains  on  the  sale  of telephone towers, amounting to 43 million euros in 2020 and 176 million euros in 2019.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  supplies,  personnel  expenses  and other expenses (principally external services and taxes) was 31,165  million  euros  in  2020,  down  13.8%  year-on-year  in reported terms. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease  in  restructuring  costs  (-5.8  p.p.),  mainly  those related to the II Collective Agreement of Related Companies in  Spain (Individual Suspension Plan) which were significant in 2019, and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates (-5.7  p.p.).  In  organic  terms,  the  total  amount  of  supplies, personnel expenses and other expenses decreased by 2.7%. The year-on-year variation was significantly affected by the COVID-19  pandemic.  The  evolution  of  these  expenses  is explained in greater detail below:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplies amounted  to  13,014  million  euros  in  2020, down 4.6% year-on-year in reported terms mainly as a result of the impact of foreign exchange rates (-4.6 p.p.) and changes in the scope of consolidation (-0.3 p.p.). In organic terms, supplies increased by 0.5% year-on-year, mainly due to higher TV content costs and higher costs related to IT sales in Telef\u00f3nica Spain, partially offset by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lower handset costs, due to the lower commercial activity, and lower roaming costs.\n- \u00b7 Personnel expenses amounted to 5,280 million euros in 2020,  down  34.5%  year-on-year  in  reported  terms",

In organic  terms,  personnel  expenses  decreased  by  3.8% year-on-year  due  to  the  lower  average  number  of employees in 2020 and cost-cutting measures adopted in most segments.\n\nThe average headcount was 113,182 employees in 2020, down 4.1% compared to 2019.\n\n- \u00b7 Other  expenses amounted  to  12,871  million  euros  in 2020, down 10.9% year-on-year in reported terms. This decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rates (-7.6 p.p.) and the provision registered in 2019  related  to  the  transformation  of  the  operating model of Telef\u00f3nica M\u00e9xico (-2.0 p.p.), partially offset by the  higher  impairment  of  goodwill  and  other  assets  in Telef\u00f3nica  Argentina  (+4.8  p.p.).  In  organic  terms,  other expenses decreased by 5.5% year-on-year due mainly to the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  led  to  a decrease  in  network  and  IT  costs,  offset  in  part  by  the higher  bad  debt  costs  principally  in  Telef\u00f3nica  Hispam and  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil,  which  were  also  driven  by  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  foregoing,  OIBDA  totaled  13,498  million euros in 2020, a decrease of 10.7% year-on-year in reported terms. In organic terms, OIBDA decreased by 5.7% year-onyear.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 9,359 million euros  in  2020,  decreasing  11.6%  year-on-year  in  reported terms,  mainly  due  to  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  rates (-8.1  p.p.)  and  the  lower  depreciation  and  amortization  in Telef\u00f3nica United Kingdom following the classification of the companies included within the scope of the agreement with Liberty Global plc as a disposal group held for sale, partially offset by the accelerated amortization of Telef\u00f3nica M\u00e9xico as  a  consequence  of  the  transformation  of  the  operating model.  In  organic  terms,  depreciation  and  amortization remained stable (+0.6%).\n\nOperating income (OI) in 2020, totaled 4,139 million euros, decreasing 8.8% compared to 2019, impacted by the higher impairment  of  goodwill  and  other  assets  in  Telef\u00f3nica Argentina  (-15.2  p.p.),  the  decrease  in  other  income compared  to  2019  (when  other  income  was  positively affected by capital gains derived from the sale of companies (-14.0 p.p.)), the impact of foreign exchange rates (-7.8 p.p.), the  impact  of  the  reported  variation  of  companies  in hyperinflationary  countries  (-4.2  p.p.),  changes  in  the consolidation  perimeter  (-3.8  p.p.)  and  the  impact  of accelerated  amortization  resulting  from  the  transformation of  the  operating  model  of  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00e9xico,  following  the AT&T  agreement  in  2019  (-1.9  p.p.),  offset  by  the  lower restructuring  costs  (+45.9  p.p.)  and  the  lower  depreciation and  amortization  expenses  in  Telef\u00f3nica  United  Kingdom (+17.2 p.p.). In organic terms, operating income decreased by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n16.4% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of the COVID-19  pandemic,  which  is  estimated  to  have  reduced operating income by approximately 977 million euros due to a decrease in service revenues in all regions and higher bad debt,  which  were  only  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in operational costs (mainly direct and commercial costs  as a result of the lower commercial activity).\n\nThe share of income (loss) of investments accounted for by the equity method for 2020 was a gain of 2 million euros (compared to a gain of 13 million euros in 2019).\n\nNet financial expense amounted to 1,558 million euros in 2020, 274 million euros lower than the previous year, mainly as  a  result  of  the  reduction  of  the  debt  in  European currencies, as well as its cost.\n\nCorporate  income  tax amounted  to 626 million  euros  in 2020, down 40.6% year-on-year,, mainly due to the reversal of  deferred  tax  assets  in  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00e9xico  in  2019,  which adversely affected the corporate income tax for such year.\n\nAs  a  result, profit  for  the  year  attributable  to  equity holders  of  the  parent for  2020  was 1,582 million  euros (1,142 million euros in 2019).\n\nProfit  attributable  to  non-controlling  interests was 375 million euros in 2020, 147 million euros lower than in 2019, mainly due to the lower profit attributable to non-controlling interests  at  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  and  Telef\u00f3nica  Centro\u00e1merica Inversiones  (which,  in  2019,  was  positively  affected  by  the gains derived from the sale of Telefon\u00eda Celular de Nicaragua and  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles  Panam\u00e1),  partially  offset  by  higher profit  attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  at  Telxius Group.\n\nCapEx stood  at  5,861  million  euros  in  2020,  decreasing 33.3% y-o-y in reported terms.\n\nOIBDA-CapEx stood at 7,637 million euros in 2020, growing 20.5% as compared to 2019 in reported terms.",

Restrictions  were  first  imposed  before  the  start  of  the second  quarter,  significantly  affecting  commercial  activity (approximately  90%  of  Telef\u00f3nica-branded  stores  were closed  in  March  and  April  2020;  approximately  50%  were closed in May of 2020), interrupting all sports competitions (importantly, football, which restarted in mid-June of 2020) and  suspending  portability  (i.e.,  the  switching  of  service providers by clients;  especially  in  the  fixed  service  until  the end  of  May  of  2020).  The  population  was  locked  down  for most of the second quarter of 2020. Telef\u00f3nica responded to these  challenges  by  leveraging  the  strength  of  the  largest FTTH network  in  Europe  to  provide  reliable service throughout  the  COVID-19  pandemic  crisis  and  taking unprecedented steps to support society and show solidarity with its communities and customers.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  commercial  activity  continued  to  rely  on the  differentiated  services  offered  by  the  company,  with  a multi brand strategy (Movistar, O2) to serve different market segments.  In  addition,  during  the  first  half  of  2020, Telef\u00f3nica introduced changes to its portfolio to strengthen its relationship with clients and reach new market segments. Some of these changes are described below.\n\nMovistar Prosegur Alarmas, the joint venture of Prosegur and Telef\u00f3nica, launched its first commercial offer for the alarm\n\nmarket  in  Spain.  Unlike  similar  products  in  the  market, customers do not have to pay any initial fee and there is no minimum  commitment  term.  The  service  includes  the installation  of  an  alarm  which  is  connected  to  an  alarm reception  center,  a  video  surveillance  system  and  a connection to the Movistar Prosegur Alarmas mobile app. In addition, it is the only product to offer Acudas, an immediate intervention service which sends a private security guard to the customer's house in the event of a security incident.\n\nIn addition, Disney+ content was added to the 'Fusi\u00f3n offer', following  the  signing  on  March  8,  2020  of  an  agreement between  The  Walt  Disney  Company  Iberia  and  Telef\u00f3nica, pursuant to which Movistar became the strategic distributor of  Disney+  in  Spain.  With  this  agreement  with  the  world's leading  entertainment  company,  Movistar  added  Disney+ titles  to  its  rich  catalog  of  original  content,  which  is accessible through the streaming service that gives access to more than 1,000 movies, series and programs from Disney, Pixar,  Marvel,  Star  Wars,  National  Geographic  and  much more.  Disney+  has  been  included  in  the  'Fusi\u00f3n  packages' featuring  fiction  content  such  as  'Fusi\u00f3n  Selecci\u00f3n  Plus Ficci\u00f3n',  'Fusi\u00f3n  Total'  and  'Fusi\u00f3n  Total  Plus',  and  in general  in  all  those  'Fusion  products'  that  incorporate  the Ficci\u00f3n  package. In  addition,  Movistar+  has  launched  a  new \"Cine\" (Movies)  package  which,  among  other  products,  will include Disney+.\n\nMoreover,  unlimited  data  was  provided  to  more  than  three\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unlimited  data  plans  are  also  available  for  customers  who only want a plan for their mobile devices.\n\nIn  October  2020,  Movistar  Health  was  launched.  This  is  an online telemedicine service aimed at, among other services, allowing users to connect to a primary care doctor anywhere, anytime, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Movistar Health also offers plans for companies, adapted to their needs according to their size and requirements.\n\nWe also launched the 5G network.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  Spain  had  41.3  million  accesses  as  of  December 31, 2020 (-1.3% as compared to December 31, 2019), as a result  of  the  commercial  slowdown  driven  mainly  by  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe convergent offer (residential and SMEs) had a customer base  of  4.8  million  customers  as  of  December  31,  2020,  a decrease of 0.3% y-o-y.\n\nRetail fixed accesses totaled 8.7 million and decreased 3.2% as compared to December 31, 2019, with a net loss of 293 thousand accesses in 2020.\n\nRetail broadband accesses totaled 6.0 million (-1.0% y-o-y),\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith a net loss of 61 thousand accesses during 2020.\n\nRetail  fiber  (FTTH)  accesses  reached  4.6  million  customers (+6.7%  as  compared  to  December  31,  2019),  representing 77.4% of total retail broadband customers (+5.6 p.p. y-o-y) with  net  adds  of  289  thousand  accesses  in 2020.  At December 31, 2020, fiber deployment reached 25.2 million premises, 2.1 million more than at December 31, 2019, and it continues to be the largest in Europe.\n\nTotal  retail  mobile  accesses  stood  at  19.0  million  as  of December  31,  2020,  an  increase  of  0.3%  as  compared  to December  31,  2019  as  a  result  of  the  increase  in  mobile contract  accesses  that  more  than  offset  the  decrease  in prepay accesses (-21.9% y-o-y), reflecting the success of the convergent  strategy  and  the  good  performance  of  the migration from prepay to postpay. The contract access base accelerated its growth during 2020, growing by 1.5% yearon-year.\n\nPay TV accesses reached 3.9 million at December 31, 2020, decreasing 3.4% year-on-year.\n\nWholesale  accesses  stood  at  3.7  million  at  December  31, 2020, down 2.6% year-on-year due to the decrease in nonfiber  wholesale accesses. Wholesale fiber accesses (70% of total  wholesale  accesses  at  December  31,  2020  compared with  57% at  December 31, 2019) were up 20.6% year-onyear.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  Telef\u00f3nica  Spain's  results  over  the past two years:\n\n| Millions of euros                |         |         |                |                    |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------|--------------------|\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA SPAIN  (1)            | 2019    | 2020    | % Reported YoY | % Organic YoY  (2) |\n| Revenues                         | 12,850  | 12,401  | (3.5%)         | (3.5%)             |\n| Mobile handset revenues          | 373     | 264     | (29.2%)        | (29.2%)            |\n| Revenues ex-mobile handset sales | 12,477  | 12,137  | (2.7%)         | (2.7%)             |\n| Retail                           | 10,313  | 9,906   | (3.9%)         | (3.9%)             |\n| Wholesale and Other              | 2,164   | 2,231   | 3.1%           | 3.1%               |\n| Other income                     | 640     | 540     | (15.7%)        | 5.9%               |\n| Supplies                         | (4,056) | (4,210) | 3.8%           | 3.8%               |\n| Personnel expenses               | (3,660) | (1,748) | (52.2%)        | (9.1%)             |\n| Other expenses                   | (2,055) | (1,937) | (5.8%)         | (6.2%)             |\n| OIBDA                            | 3,719   | 5,046   | 35.7%          | (5.1%)             |\n| Depreciation and amortization    | (2,013) | (2,184) | 8.5%           | 8.5%               |\n| Operating income (OI)            | 1,706   | 2,862   | 67.7%          | (13.3%)            |\n| CapEx                            | 1,667   | 1,408   | (15.5%)        | (15.2%)            |\n| OIBDA-CapEx                      | 2,052   | 3,638   | 77.3%          | (0.5%)             |\n\nNotes:\n\n- - In 2020, the breakdown of revenue for Telef\u00f3nica Spain has been simplified to facilitate understanding of our business.

We attribute  this  decrease  mainly  to  the  impact  of  the COVID-19 pandemic on households and companies.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale  and  other  revenues totaled  2,231  million euros  in  2020,  increasing  by  3.1%  year-on-year  in reported terms, driven mainly by the increase in TV and MVOs  (Mobile  Virtual  Operators)  wholesale  revenues, which  more  than  offset  the  significant  decrease  in roaming revenues as a consequence of the restrictions on\n\ninternational  travel  imposed  in  connection  with  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOIBDA reached 5,046 million euros in 2020, a year-on-year increase of 35.7% in reported terms. In organic terms, OIBDA decreased  by  5.1%  year-on-year,  highly  affected  by  the decrease in revenues due to the pandemic.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 2,184 million euros  in  2020,  increasing  by  8.5%  year-on-year  in  both reported  and  organic  terms,  mainly  as  a  result  of  a reassessment  and  adjustment  in  the  useful  lives  of  the copper service network assets.\n\nOperating income amounted to 2,862 million euros in 2020, a  year-on-year  increase  of  67.7%  in  reported  terms.  The year-on-year increase was mainly driven by the decrease in restructuring  costs  as  compared  to  2019  (+101.7  p.p.), partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in  other  income,  which  in 2019 was positively affected by the irrevocable sale of credit",

The  transaction  is  subject  to  regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\n\nFor additional information, see \"Note 2. Basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Narrowband and data accesses (which were previously included in 'Internet and data accesses') are directly included in \"Retail Accesses\" and are not separately shown. 2019 figures included in this section have been revised accordingly for comparative purposes.\n- (3) 2020 \"Mobile accesses\" show \"IoT\" accesses as an independent category within \"Mobile accesses\" due to its increasing weight. \"IoT\" accesses include both postpay and prepay IoT accesses and, therefore, are not comparable to the \"M2M\" accesses reported in prior years, which only included postpay accesses (given the limited relevance of prepay accesses in prior years). 2019 figures included in this section have been revised accordingly for comparative purposes.\n\nDuring  2020,  throughout  the  COVID-19  health  crisis  which led  to  a  lockdown  of  the  UK  population  since  the  end  of March  2020  and  despite  a  competitive  environment, Telef\u00f3nica United  Kingdom  remained  as  the  favorite telecommunications  operator  in  United  Kingdom  (Source: CCS Insight),  a  position  underpinned by the strength of the O2 brand, customer loyalty, successful commercial propositions, network reliability and good customer service. Such  value  propositions  have  allowed  the  company  to achieve  continuous  customer  growth  in  most  market segments in a competitive market.\n\nTotal accesses grew by 4.8% year-on-year, standing at 36.5 million at December 31, 2020.\n\nMobile net additions in 2020 reached 1.1 million accesses, mainly driven by the increase in IoT accesses, which grew by 26.8% mainly boosted by the program 'Smart\n\nMetering' (SMIP). Contract mobile accesses grew by 1.0% y-o-y  to  12.4  million  at  December  31,  2020  despite  the closure  of  stores  for  several  months  in  2020  due  to  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPrepay  accesses decreased  by  3.8%  y-o-y  to  8.1  million customers at December 31, 2020, mainly as a result of the continued  migration  from  prepay  to  contract  mobile accesses and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In particular,  we  have  used  the  average  foreign  exchange rate of 2019 for both years.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation  and  amortization: we  have  excluded  the positive  impact  of  ceasing  the  amortization  of  the  noncurrent assets that fall within the scope of the agreement with Liberty Global plc, which were classified as held for sale starting on  May 1, 2020, amounting to 771 million euros.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring  costs: we  have  excluded  the  impact  of restructuring  costs,  amounting  to  31  million  euros  in 2019.\n- \u00b7 Spectrum acquisitions: we have excluded the impact of spectrum  acquisitions  on  CapEx  in  2020,  amounting  to 95 million euros.\n\nThe table below shows 2020/2019 variations in reported and organic terms (the latter, calculated in accordance with the\n\nadjustments  referred  to  above)  of  certain  line  items  of  the income statement and other measures, and the contribution of  each  item  for  which  we  have  adjusted  to  our  reported growth:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excluding this impact,  mobile  revenues  decreased  by  4.4%,  mainly  as  a result  of  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  which  are estimated to have reduced revenues by approximately 328 million  euros  in  2020  related  to  the  lower  handset  sales, lower roaming revenues and a reduction in the roll out of IoT programs.\n\nMobile ARPU fell  by  13.2%  year-on-year in reported terms and  12.0%  in  organic  terms,  significantly  impacted  by  the COVID-19  pandemic,  growth  of  IoT  accesses  (with  lower ARPU)  and  customer  migration  to  the  direct  channel  as  a consequence  of  the  change  in  the  distribution  model  after the end of the contract with Dixons Carphone in March 2020 which resulted in changes in the mobile revenues allocation.\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile business revenues reached 6,476 million euros in 2020,  decreasing  by  6.0%  in  reported  terms,  affected  in part  by  the  depreciation  of  the  pound  sterling  (-1.3  p.p.). Excluding this impact, mobile business revenues decreased 4.8%  affected  by  the  impact  of  COVID-19,  which  is estimated to have amounted to approximately 320 million euros  and  are  mainly  due  to  the  shift  from  mobile  data usage  to  Wi-Fi  networks,  lower  handset  sales,  lower roaming  revenues  and  a  reduction  in  the  roll  out  of  IoT programs.\n\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA UNITED KINGDOM   |   2019  (1) |   2020 | Reported %YoY   | %Organic YoY   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|\n| ARPU (EUR)                  |        14.8 |   12.8 | (13.2%)         | (12.0%)        |\n| Prepay                      |         7.4 |    7.5 | 0.3%            | 1.6%           |\n| Contract  (2)               |        24.9 |   22.1 | (11.0%)         | (9.8%)         |\n| Data ARPU (EUR)             |         8.6 |    9.7 | 12.8%           | 14.3%          |\n\n(1) In December 2019, 665 thousand mobile contract accesses were reclassified as wholesale accesses. This affected ARPU calculations, as they relate to average retail accesses only (which are calculated on a monthly basis). In order to make ARPU calculations for 2020 and 2019 comparable, the calculation of the 2019 monthly average number of accesses was revised in accordance with such reclassification (so as to exclude such 665 thousand accesses for the whole year). (2) Excludes IoT.\n\nOIBDA  totaled  2,064  million  euros  in  2020,  decreasing  by 2.4%  in  reported  terms,  down  2.4%  in  organic  terms, affected by the pandemic.\n\nDepreciation and amortization totaled 389 million euros in 2020, decreasing by 67.7% year-on-year in reported terms, mainly  as  a  result  of  the  reclassification  of  assets  that  fall within the scope of the agreement with Liberty Global plc as held  for  sale  starting  on  May  1,  2020  (with  such  assets ceasing  to  accrue  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses\n\nsince  then).  Excluding  the  impact  of  such  reclassification (-64.9  p.p.)  and  the  effect  of  the  depreciation  of  the  pound sterling (-0.4 p.p.), depreciation and amortization decreased by 2.3% year-on-year in organic terms mainly due to a lower depreciation and amortization in intangibles.\n\nOperating income totaled 1,675 million euros in 2020, up by 84.0% in reported terms, mainly impacted by the  decrease in depreciation  and  amortization  as  a  result  of  the reclassification referred to above (+85.8 p.p.) and, to a lesser",

Narrowband and data accesses (which were previously included in 'Internet and data accesses') are directly included in \"Retail Accesses\" and are not separately shown. 2019 figures included in this section have been revised accordingly for comparative purposes.\n- (3) 2020 \"Mobile accesses\" show \"IoT\" accesses as an independent category within \"Mobile accesses\" due to its increasing weight. \"IoT\" accesses include both postpay and prepay IoT accesses and, therefore, are not comparable to the \"M2M\" accesses reported in prior years, which only included postpay accesses (given the limited relevance of prepay accesses in prior years). 2019 figures included in this section have been revised accordingly for comparative purposes. (4)\n\nIn  2020,  Telef\u00f3nica  Germany  had  a  good  performance despite  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  with  trading  dynamics recovering  to  close  to  pre-pandemic  levels  by  the  end  of 2020  and  churn  reaching  historical  low  levels. This performance was supported by network quality improvements.  In  a  dynamic  competitive  environment,  the O2 Free portfolio continued to show positive momentum and visible ARPU-accretive effects, while COVID-19-related travel restrictions impacted roaming revenues.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  Germany's  key  milestones  in  2020  were  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The  company  announced  the  spin-off  and  sale  of approximately 10.1 thousand mobile sites to Telxius for a total  purchase  price  of  1.5  billion  euros,  gaining  further financial flexibility.\n- \u00b7 The  company's  5G  network  became  operational  in  15 cities, targeting more than 30% and approximately 50% population  coverage  by  the  end  of  2021  and  2022, respectively,  and  close  to  full  coverage  by  the  end  of 2025.\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica Germany's network was awarded for the first time  a  'very  good'  rating  in  the  most  relevant  network test of \"Connect magazine\" and also was ranked #1 in the Connect magazine's shop test.\n\nThe total access base grew 1.1% year-on-year and stood at 48.8 million at December 31, 2020, mainly driven by a 1.0% increase  in  the  mobile  accesses  base,  which  reached  44.3 million.\n\nThe contract  mobile  customer  base grew  4.6%  year-on-\n\nyear and reached 23.6 million accesses, increasing the share over  the  total  mobile  accesses  base  to  53.3%.  Net  adds reached  1.0  million  accesses  mainly  driven  by  the  good performance  of  the  O2  Free  tariff  portfolio,  which  features popular tariffs, continued data usage and churn improvement. O2 contract churn registered historical lows.\n\nThe prepay  mobile  customer  base decreased  4.0%  yearon-year  to  19.3  million  accesses,  reflecting  the  ongoing prepay  to  contract  migration  trends  in  the  market.  The prepay segment posted a net loss of 0.8 million customers in 2020.\n\nThe broadband accesses reached  2.3  million  accesses  (up 2.5% y-o-y) and increased by 55 thousand accesses in 2020, as  a  result  of  the  continued  robust  demand  for  VDSL,  with net adds of 146 thousand accesses in 2020 (+30.8% y-o-y).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Restructuring costs totaled 37 million euros and 22 million euros in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n- \u00b7 Spectrum sales: the organic variations exclude the gains on spectrum sales in 2020 (5 million euros in OIBDA).\n- \u00b7 Spectrum acquisition: the organic variations exclude the impact of spectrum acquisitions on CapEx, which in 2019 amounted  to  1,425  million  euros.  During  2020  no spectrum acquisitions were made.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  was  the result  of  increased  handset  sales  and  higher  mobile service  revenues,  despite  the  continuing  impact  of COVID-19,  which  affected  roaming  revenues  due  to  the ongoing travel restrictions.\n- \u00b7 Handset  revenues amounted  to  1,423  million  euros, increasing  5.7%  y-o-y  in  reported  terms  due  to  the continued  strong  demand  for  high  value  handsets  and the recent launch of the iPhone 12 5G.\n- \u00b7 Fixed  revenues were  785  million  euros,  increasing  by 6.0%  year-on-year  in  reported  terms,  on  the  back  of  a larger customer base driven by strong VDSL demand.\n\nMobile  ARPU was  9.9  euros  (-1.2%  y-o-y),  while  contract ARPU stood at 13.6 euros (-4.4% y-o-y), mainly as a result of the  decrease  in  roaming  revenues  and  lower  commercial activity and demand for prepay packages due to higher Wi-Fi usage at home. Data ARPU was 5.9 euros (+0.2% y-o-y).\n\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA GERMANY   |   2019 |   2020 | Reported %YoY   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|-----------------|\n| ARPU (EUR)           |   10   |    9.9 | (1.2%)          |\n| Prepay               |    6   |    6.1 | 1.6%            |\n| Contract  (1)        |   14.3 |   13.6 | (4.4%)          |\n| Data ARPU (EUR)      |    5.9 |    5.9 | 0.2%            |\n\nOIBDA totaled 2,309 million euros in 2020, down 0.8% y-o-y in  reported  terms.  In  organic  terms,  OIBDA  increased  by 0.1% year-on-year.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 2,394 million euros in 2020, decreasing 2.8% year-on-year mainly due to certain  property,  plant  and  equipment  reaching  the  end  of their useful lives.\n\nOperating loss totaled 85 million euros in 2020 as compared to 137 million euros in 2019. In organic terms, operating loss improved year-on-year mainly due to the lower depreciation and  amortization  expense,  the  improved  revenue  mix,  and the  continued  implementation  of  cost  efficiency  measures, offset  in  part  by  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic, which  is  estimated  to  have  contributed  approximately  58 million euros to the operating loss in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Narrowband and data accesses (which were previously included in 'Internet and data accesses') are directly included in \"Retail Accesses\" and are not separately shown. 2019 figures included in this section have been revised accordingly for comparative purposes.\n- (3) 2020 \"Mobile accesses\" show \"IoT\" accesses as an independent category within \"Mobile accesses\" due to its increasing weight. \"IoT\" accesses include both postpay and prepay IoT accesses and, therefore, are not comparable to the \"M2M\" accesses reported in prior years, which only included postpay accesses (given the limited relevance of prepay accesses in prior years). 2019 figures included in this section have been revised accordingly for comparative purposes.\n\nIn  2020,  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  maintained  its  leadership  in  the higher  mobile value segments, leading the contract segment as  of  December  31,  2020  (source:  ANATEL),  which  has allowed  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  to  support  its  mobile  service revenues (in local currency) and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the fixed business, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil continued  to  focus  on  the  implementation  of  strategic technologies,  such  as  fiber,  which permitted  it  to  capture high-value clients in the Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and partially offset the continued decrease in the traditional fixed business.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  Brazil  reached  95.2  million accesses as  of December 31, 2020, 1.5% higher than as of December 2019, due  to  the  sustained  growth  in  the  mobile  business,  both postpay and prepay, UBB and IPTV, which more than offset the decline in the fixed voice business (due to the continued migration  from  fixed  to  mobile,  driven  by  unlimited  voice offers in the market), the contraction of the lower-value fixed broadband customer base and the loss of DTH customers as a result of the discontinuation of legacy technologies.\n\nIn  the mobile  business ,  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  maintained  its leadership in terms of total accesses, with a market share of 33.6% as of December 31, 2020 (source: ANATEL), growing both  in  terms  of  contract  customers  (+4.1%  year-on-year) and prepay accesses (+7.2% year-on-year). Telef\u00f3nica Brazil continued  to  strategically  focus  on  high-value  customers, reaching a market share of 37.7% in the contract segment as\n\nof December 31, 2020 (source: ANATEL). Contract commercial  offers  focused  on  data  plans,  with  improved quotas  and  roaming  terms  (Vivo  Travel  World).  The  Vivo Selfie  plan  was  also  launched,  with  a  25GB  data  allowance plus  25GB  for  use  in  our  customers'  favorite  app  (Spotify, Rappi,  Netflix  or  Premiere).  High-value  customers'  offer  is focused on family plans, which remained unchanged. In the prepay  segment,  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  offers  unlimited  off-net minutes, unlimited WhatsApp use, and extra data allowances (VIVO pre-turbo).  All  of  this  has  been  supported  by  the interaction  with  customers  through  our  virtual  assistant AURA  in  the  Meu  VIVO application,  transforming  customer attention channels to improve user experience.\n\nIn  the fixed  business, Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  maintained  its strategic  focus  on  fiber  deployment,  reaching  24.5  million premises passed with FTTx as of December 31, 2020 and 5.1 million  connected  homes,  which  increased  1.2%  y-o-y, compensating  in  part  for  the  decrease  in  fiber  to  the  curb (FTTC)  with  the  growth  of  fiber.  Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  is implementing alternative  deployment  models  to  accelerate fiber expansion with lower CapEx requirements and a shorter \"time  to  market\" period.  Following  the  agreement  with American  Tower  Corporation  in  Minas  Gerais  and  the development  of  a  \"franchise\" model  in  smaller  cities, Telef\u00f3nica  Brazil  reached  an  agreement  with  Phoenix  Fiber (Group  Phoenix  Towers)  in  the  states  of  Minas  Gerais, Esp\u00edrito  Santo  and  Goi\u00e1s  for  the  joint  development  of  the FTTH network. Telef\u00f3nica Brazil reached 3.4 million premises\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  organic terms,  revenues  decreased  2.6%,  mainly  as  a  result  of  the effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  we  estimate affected  revenues  by  approximately  302  million  euros  in 2020,  mainly  due  to  lower  handset  sales  and  service revenues.\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile  business  revenues amounted  to  4,891  million euros  in  2020,  a  24.7%  decrease  in  reported  terms, mainly due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real (-23.9 p.p.).  Excluding  this  impact,  mobile  business  revenues decreased  0.9%.  The  mobile  business  was  significantly affected by the decline in handset sales (-30.6% y-o-y in reported  terms  (-8.5%  y-o-y  in  local  currency)),  mainly due  to  the  closure  of  stores  and  the  lockdown  of population  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Limitations  on  mobility  also  led  to  a  shift  from  mobile data  usage  to  Wi-Fi  networks.  In  organic  terms,  service revenues remained stable due to the fast recovery of the prepay segment, the higher weight of contract customers\n\nand the higher use of data and connectivity services.\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed  business  revenues amounted  to  2,531  million euros, decreasing 28.4% in reported terms, mainly due to the impact of the depreciation of the Brazilian real (-22.7 p.p.). Excluding  this  effect,  fixed  business  revenues decreased by 5.7% mainly as a result of the decrease in voice  revenues,  as  a  result  of  lower  traffic  due  to  the fixed-mobile substitution, as well as the lower commercial emphasis on legacy technologies (ADSL and DTH). The decrease was offset in part by the increase in broadband  (+3.0%  year-on-year  in  local  currency), supported by the growth of fiber revenues, driven by the growth of ARPU and a higher penetration.\n\nMobile ARPU decreased year-on-year by 26.5% in reported terms, mainly due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real. In local  currency,  mobile  ARPU  decreased  by  3.2%  year-onyear,  as  a  consequence  of  the  erosion  of  contract  ARPU, offset  in  part  by  the  increase  in  prepay  ARPU  in  local currency terms due to the leveraging of data surpluses.\n\n| TELEF\u00d3NICA BRAZIL   |   2019 |   2020 | %YoY    | %Local Currency YoY   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|---------|-----------------------|\n| ARPU (EUR)          |    6.4 |    4.7 | (26.5%) | (3.2%)                |\n| Prepay              |    2.9 |    2.2 | (22.2%) | 2.5%                  |\n| Contract  (1)       |   11.6 |    8.4 | (27.4%) | (4.3%)                |\n| Data ARPU (EUR)     |    5.1 |    4.1 | (20.1%) | (2.8%)                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  evolution  was  partially  affected  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic, which took its toll on commercial activity.\n- \u00b7 Prepay accesses decreased by 1.6% year-on-year, with a net loss of 1.1 million accesses at December 31, 2020, decreasing in Peru (-660 thousand accesses), Chile (-476 thousand  accesses),  Mexico  (-226  thousand  accesses) and  Venezuela  (-151  thousand  accesses),  offset  in  part by  the  increases  in  Ecuador  (+346  thousand  accesses) and Argentina (+153 thousand accesses). This evolution was  mainly  the  result  of  the  line  disconnection  of accesses  with  no  top-up  activity  and  the  migration  of prepay  accesses  to  postpay  accesses  in  the  Chilean market.\n\nFixed accesses stood at 7.8 million as of December 31, 2020 (-11.0%  year-on-year)  with  a  net  loss  of  969  thousand accesses due to the continued erosion of the traditional fixed business.\n\nFixed  broadband  accesses amounted  to  5.5  million  as  of December  31,  2020  (-2.1%  year-on-year).  The  penetration of  FBB  accesses  over  fixed  accesses  stood  at  69.5%  (+6.3 p.p. y-o-y), as a result of the focus on Ultra Broadband (UBB) deployment  in  the  region  reaching  3.7  million  connected accesses  (+13.7%  y-o-y)  and  12.0  million  premises.  The penetration of UBB accesses over fixed broadband accesses stood at 67.8% (+9.4 p.p. y-o-y).\n\nPay  TV  accesses stood  at  2.9  million  as  of  December  31, 2020, decreasing by 5.3% as a result of the net loss of 158 thousand  customers,  negatively  impacted  by  the  lower Direct-To-Home  (DTH)  technology  accesses  due  to  the change  in  focus  (-326  thousand  accesses)  and  lower  cable access base (-74 thousand accesses at December 31, 2020), partially  offset  by  the  increase  in  IPTV  (+242  thousand accesses), in which the Company is placing strategic focus.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This decrease was driven in part by the foreign exchange effects (-7.3  p.p.)  and  the  reported  variation  of  companies  in hyperinflationary  countries  (-4.4  p.p.).  In  organic  terms, revenues  decreased  by  6.2%  year-on-year,  principally impacted by the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which  we  estimate  decreased  revenues  by  approximately 670 million  euros  mainly  due  to  lower  handset  revenues,  a decrease in voice fixed revenues, broadband and TV revenues and  mobile  service  revenues,  mainly  related  to  the  prepay segment, and lower handset sales, which were influenced by the decline in the commercial activity due to the pandemic. There was also a decrease in the customer base.\n\nMobile business revenues amounted to 5,070 million euros in  2020,  decreasing  18.4%  year-on-year  in  reported  terms. This decrease was affected by foreign exchange effects (-7.5 p.p.) and the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary  countries  (-4.4  p.p.).  In  organic  terms, mobile  business  revenues  decreased  by  6.4%  year-on-year mainly  due  to  lower  prepay  revenues  and  handset  sales, resulting  from  the  decline  of  the  commercial  activity.  The performance by country was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 In Chile, mobile revenues amounted to 926 million euros in  2020,  decreasing  15.6%  year-on-year  in  reported terms,  affected  by  the  foreign  exchange  effects,  which reduced growth by 12.5 percentage points. Excluding this impact,  mobile  revenues  decreased  by  3.0%  year-onyear  due  to  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  significantly  increased  competition  in  the  market, partially offset by higher handset sales.\n\n- \u00b7 In Peru, mobile revenues amounted to 764 million euros in  2020,  decreasing  24.1%  year-on-year  in  reported terms, impacted by the foreign exchange effects, which reduced growth by 6.9 percentage points. Excluding this impact,  mobile  revenues  decreased  by  17.2%  year-onyear, mainly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decrease in handset sales, due to the significant reduction in commercial activity, and in service revenues, which  were  adversely  affected  by  the  discount  policies adopted during 2020 and lower commercial activity.\n- \u00b7 In  Colombia,  mobile  revenues  amounted  to  764  million euros  in  2020,  decreasing  12.7%  year-on-year  in reported terms, mainly impacted by the foreign exchange effects, which reduced growth by 12.5 percentage points. Excluding  this  impact,  mobile  revenues  decreased  by 0.2%  year-on-year,  mainly  driven  by  the  decrease  in handset sales, lower prepay revenues and B2B (Businessto-Business)  postpay  revenues,  offset  in  part  by  higher B2C (Business-to-Customer) postpay revenues due to a larger customer base and higher interconnection mobile revenues.\n- \u00b7 In  Mexico,  mobile  revenues  amounted  to  1,033  million euros  in  2020,  decreasing  16.9%  year-on-year  in reported terms, mainly as a result of the depreciation of the  Mexican  peso  (-10.8  p.p.).  Excluding  this  impact, mobile revenues decreased by 6.1% year-on-year, due to",

This  decrease  was  mainly  driven  by  the  foreign  exchange effects,  which  decreased  growth  by  6.8  percentage  points, and by the impact of the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries (mainly Argentina), which reduced  growth  by  4.4  percentage  points.  Excluding  these impacts,  these  revenues  decreased  by  6.2%  year-on-year mainly  due  to  the  decline  in  voice,  broadband  and  TV revenues,  due  to  a  smaller  customer  base,  despite  the improvement  in  commercial  plans  and  higher  broadband speed.\n\nOIBDA reached 990 million euros in 2020, decreasing 51.3% year-on-year in reported terms (-13.2% in organic terms).\n\nDepreciation and amortization reached 2,274 million euros in  2020,  up  0.3%  year-on-year  in  reported  terms  (-2.4%  in organic  terms),  due  to  the  reduction  in  the  useful  lives  of certain  assets  of  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00e9xico  as  a  result  of  the transformation  of  the  operating  model  (310  million  euros), partially offset by the exchange rates.\n\nOperating loss was 1,284 million euros in 2020 compared to an  operating  loss  of  235  million  euros  in  2019.  This  result was  negatively  affected  mainly  by  the  impairment  of goodwill in Argentina, the reported variation of companies in hyperinflationary countries, the accelerated depreciation and amortization  in  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00e9xico  (as  a  result  of  the transformation  of  its  operational  model),  and  foreign exchange  effects,  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in restructuring costs in the region. In organic terms, operating income decreased by 68.7% year-on-year, mainly driven by the  decrease  in  revenues  as  a  result  of  the  impact  of  the COVID-19  pandemic  (estimated  to  be  approximately  429 million euros).\n\nBelow is additional information by country:\n\n- \u00b7 In  Chile,  operating  income  reached  141  million  euros  in 2020, decreasing 42.4% year-on-year in reported terms, affected by the foreign exchange effects, which reduced growth by 8.5 percentage points. The performance was mainly affected by the lower fixed and mobile revenues mainly  as  a  result  of  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, while depreciation and amortization remained relatively unchanged.\n- \u00b7 In Peru, operating loss reached 84 million euros in 2020 (operating loss of 71 million euros in 2019), mainly as a result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  led  to  lower service revenues and an increase in bad debt.\n- \u00b7 In Colombia, operating income reached 113 million euros in  2020,  decreasing  33.9%  year-on-year  in  reported terms,  affected  by  the  foreign  exchange  effects,  which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreduced growth by 9.5 percentage points. This performance  was  mainly  driven  by  the  lower  handset revenues and the lower tower sales gains (as compared to  2019),  which  was  partially  offset  by  the  lower depreciation and amortization.\n\n- \u00b7 In  Mexico,  operating  loss  reached  606  million  euros  in 2020  (operating  loss  of  613  million  euros  in  2019), mainly  impacted  by  the  depreciation  of  the  Mexican peso, offset by the higher depreciation and amortization in the period.",

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. In accordance with IFRS 5, the companies included  within  the  scope  of  the  transaction  have  been recognized as a disposal group held for sale as of December 31, 2020. Non-current assets ceased to accrue depreciation and amortization expenses since December 31, 2020.\n\nIn the Tower business , Telxius Group acquired 1,909 towers in Brazil in February 2020, doubling the size of Telxius Group in  the  country,  and  establishing  a  solid  platform  to  capture the expected growth of the Brazilian market.\n\nAdditionally,  Telxius  Group  announced  in  June  2020  the acquisition of nearly 10,100 sites from Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland  for  1,500  million  euros,  along  with  the commitment  to  build  2,400  additional  build-to-suit  (BTS) sites in Germany, the largest market for telecommunications\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin  Europe.  The  transaction  was  structured  in  two  phases, with the first tranche of approximately 6,000 sites executed in the third quarter of 2020, and the second tranche, for the remaining  sites,  expected  to  close  in  August  2021. These towers are included within the scope of the agreement with American Tower Corporation referred to above. See \"Note 29 - Other  information  - Commitments  - \"Agreements  for  the sale by Telxius of its telecommunications tower divisions in Europe and Latin America\" for additional information.\n\nIn  addition,  Telxius  Group  has  carried  out  other  inorganic transactions,  expanding  its  land  management  optimization program, strengthening its DAS (Distributed Antenna System)  activities,  amplifying  cellular  signals  in  open  or closed  high  density  environments,  and  reinforcing  and diversifying its business in the different geographies where it operates.\n\nExcluding inorganic transactions, during 2020 the portfolio of towers grew by 457 additional sites (net of decommissions) reaching  26,765  towers  as  of  December  31,  2020  (+45.9% year-on-year) and the number of tenants (excluding anchor tenants)  grew  by  466  additional  tenants,  achieving  a 'tenancy  ratio'  of  1.37x  excluding  acquisitions  and  1.28x including acquisitions.\n\nThe following table shows  certain key performance indicators  of  Telxius  Group  as  of  December  31,  2019  and 2020:\n\n## TELXIUS GROUP\n\n| Units              | 2019   | 2020   | %Reported  YoY   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|------------------|\n| Towers             | 18,348 | 26,765 | 45.9%            |\n| Tenants            | 24,911 | 34,318 | 37.8%            |\n| Non anchor tenants | 6,563  | 7,553  | 15.1%            |\n| Tenancy ratio      | 1.37x  | 1.28x  | (0.08x)          |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- - Non anchor tenants refers to tenants other than anchor tenants.\n\nIn the Cable business , average traffic levels of approximately 14 Tbps were reached during 2020 (+36.5% compared to the average of 2019), partially as a result of the higher traffic demand  resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  which  had  a  positive  effect  on  revenues.  In addition,  the  good  commercial  momentum  continued  in 2020, especially in respect of MAREA, a 6,600 km submarine cable  with  200Tbps  capacity  connecting  Spain  (Sopelana) and  the  United  States  (Virginia  Beach),  and  the  renewal  of contracts with relevant carriers, mainly in Latin America. In particular,  during  the  third  and  fourth  quarter  of  2020, contract renewals were signed with various clients, increasing their aggregate estimated net full contract value by approximately 620 million U.S. dollars, despite causing a temporary  negative  effect  on  revenues  and  OIBDA  (as  a result  of  the  decrease  in  annual  fees  set  forth  in  the agreements).\n\nFinally, during 2020, Telxius Group joined the supply contract with Subcom to build the South Pacific Subsea Cable System, as  an  additional  purchaser  together  with  Am\u00e9rica  M\u00f3vil,  to build  a  new  cable  system  in  the  Pacific  from  Guatemala  to Chile,  with  additional  landing  points  in  Ecuador,  Peru  and Chile, with a view to renewing and upgrading Telxius Group's cable infrastructure and achieving significant savings.",

The year-onyear comparison was also affected by the exceptional sale of capacity recorded in the first half of 2019.\n\nRevenues totaled 826 million euros in 2020 and decreased 1.9%  in  reported  terms  impacted  by  exchange  rates  (-2.9 p.p.).  In  organic  terms,  revenues  increased  1.0%  y-o-y  as  a result of the increase in revenues in the Tower business (410 million euros; +21.1%), mainly as a result of the increase in the  number  of  towers,  partially  offset  by  the  decrease  in revenues in the Cable business (411 million euros; -13.6%) due  to  the  decrease  in  annual  fees  following  the  contract renewals  referred  to  above  and  the  exceptional  sale  of capacity registered in the first half of 2019, which adversely affected the year-on-year comparison.\n\nOIBDA  totaled  520  million  euros  in  2020,  growing  3.1%  in reported terms (+6.6% in organic terms).\n\nDepreciation  and  amortization amounted  to  269  million euros  in  2020,  increasing  7.8%  year-on-year  in  reported terms,  impacted  by  the  construction  and  acquisition  of towers  (mainly  in  Germany,  Brazil  and  Peru),  and  offset  in part by exchange rates.  In organic terms, depreciation and amortization grew 12.4% year-on-year.\n\nOperating  income reached  251  million  euros  in  2020, decreasing  1.6%  in  reported  terms  impacted  by  exchange rates (-3.1 p.p.), partially offset by the reported variation of companies  in  hyperinflationary  countries  (+0.3  p.p.).  In organic  terms,  year-on-year  variation  was  +1.0%  due  to tower  business  revenues  growth  and  cable  business  costs control.\n\nCapEx totaled  348  million  euros  in  2020,  increasing  by 22.5%  in  reported  terms,  despite  the  impact  of  exchange rates  (-15.1  p.p.).  In  organic  terms,  the  year-on-year evolution  was  +37.4%  and  was  mainly  related  to  the acquisition  of  towers,  real  estate  rights  and  DAS and  the construction of the Pacific cable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Digital inclusion GRI 102-2\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur purpose as a company is to ensure connectivity for all and that is why we are working to deploy innovative and more efficient networks.\n\nThe World Benchmarking Alliance has acknowledged us as the world's second largest operator in the digital technology (ICT) sector for our commitment and work towards digital inclusion.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, we have focused our efforts on ensuring full, reliable, stable and secure connectivity. In addition, we have been donating equipment and reinforcing educational content and free and open online learning platforms.\n\nBeyond  the  traditional  business  models  and  families  of digital  services that are enabling us to expand our business and  create  value,  our Purpose: ' to  make  our  world  more human  by  connecting  people's  lives' has  become  more relevant than ever this year.\n\nWe know that connectivity and digitisation are key factors now and even more so in the future- in the recovery and reconstruction  process  that  we  will  have  to  tackle,  and  we must ensure that this process is carried out in a sustainable and  inclusive  way  by  facilitating  access  for  the  majority  of the population to technology and the opportunities that the digital world provides.\n\nWe believe that the opportunities are enormous and we need to  harness  all  the  capabilities  that  technology  offers  to improve  people's  quality  of  life  and  well-being,  generate economic development and deliver innovative digital solutions  that  contribute  to  achieving  the  Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations.\n\nThe  world  has  changed  forever  and  this  pandemic  is transforming us into a more digital society. Let us therefore ensure that this change does not deviate towards inequality and instead ensure a just and inclusive digital transition.\n\n## 1.9.1 Digital inclusion\n\nDigital  inclusion, defined  as  the  expansion  of  global connectivity  and  the  adoption  of  Internet  services,  offers significant  economic  and  social  benefits  to  previously unconnected populations.\n\nIn this context  generated  by  COVID-19,  inequality  of opportunities  and  the  deepening  of  the  digital  divide  are some of the most significant challenges we are facing. The reliance on digital services for the functioning of societies from  commerce  to  education-  has  accelerated.  It  is precisely this situation that has  shed  light  on  how unprepared some sectors of society and the economy are for the digital transformation.\n\nDuring  the  first  waves  of  the  pandemic  we  focused  on securing and guaranteeing connectivity services and increasing  our  capacity  to  respond  to  growing  traffic.  Since then  we  have  continued  to  strengthen  our  commitment  to ensuring access to services.\n\nFor example, in Spain we were able to cope with an increase in  bandwidth  demand  of  almost  40%,  mobile  data  traffic growth  of  50%  and  mobile  voice  growth  of  25%  -  a situation  quite  similar  to  the  other  countries  in  which  we operate.  But  we  have  also  strengthened  access  to  our educational  content  for  teachers,  parents  and  students, bringing digital education closer so that no one is left behind.\n\nBut this in itself is not enough; we need to continue to work to  ensure  that  all  people  and  organisations  have  access  to technology  and  can  benefit  from  the  opportunities  offered by the new digital world.\n\nWe promote a more inclusive connectivity in which we bring digitisation to all people and boost the social and economic development of the communities in which we are present\n\nPart of our Purpose is to bring the best connectivity and the latest technology to everyone. We advocate people-centred digitisation  and  the  implementation  of  a  strategy  to  tackle inequality of opportunity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Digital solutions have shown that they can go where the social fault lines are and contribute to positively transforming\n\ncommunities  and  productive  and  economic  models.  The deployment  of  next  generation  broadband  networks, together  with  measures  to  boost  digitisation,  have  a  direct impact on the socio-economic development of entire regions and on the lives of many people who gain access to services and opportunities that were previously unavailable to them.

The deployment of 4G and 5G broadband mobile networks, together with the marketing of smartphones and growth  in  the  use  of  mobile  data  and  the  deployment  of fibre, have made it possible for many people and companies to benefit from the digital society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WE  ARE  MOVING  FORWARD  ON  TWO LINES OF ACTION\n\n## > A. Connecting the unconnected\n\nWe are making a special effort to deploy our networks in disconnected areas because we know  that guaranteed access to basic services such as communications  is  a  key  pillar  for  socio-economic development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMillions of people are in the position where either they still do  not  have  access  to  the  Internet  or  the connectivity available to them is very limited, and this is especially true in rural or hard-to-reach regions. That is  why we launched the Internet for All project in the Latin America region a few years ago. We started with Peru,  where  we  have  already  connected  more  than 4,000 communities in remote areas, thereby benefiting more than one million people. In countries such  as  the  United  Kingdom,  a  plan  has  been announced  to  expand  and  share  infrastructure  with other operators in order to provide mobile broadband service in rural areas.\n\n## > B. Improve and adapt old networks to new social demands\n\nWe  are  evolving  older  communications  networks  to meet the demands of an increasingly digitised society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand economy. The features demanded by new digital services  require  an  extra  effort  to  ensure  that  all people  have  infrastructure  that  can  support  use  of these  services  and  thereby  avoid  a  widening  of  the digital  divide.  This  gap  becomes  more  significant  in rural areas in both developing and developed countries, where inequalities between urban and rural municipalities become larger, generating social impacts such as depopulation.\n\nFor  this  reason,  we  have  sought  to  upgrade  our networks  and  deploy  state-of-the-art  technologies that offer ultra-broadband access capabilities such as 4G, 5G or fibre optic networks, not only in urban areas, but also in rural municipalities.\n\nProof of this aim is the fact that we have achieved 4G coverage of  more  than  90%  of  the  population  in  the four main countries in which we operate, as well as the commitment  we  have  made  to  achieve  100%  fibre optic  coverage  in  Spain  by  2024.  In  addition,  we managed  to  bring  5G  to  76%  of  the  population  in Spain in 2020. Another example is the ongoing effort in Germany to cover all rural areas with high-capacity LTE  technology  and  to  try  to  reach  99%  of  the population,  as  well  as  the  effort  to  boost  fibre deployment  in  rural  municipalities  in  collaboration with other partners.\n\n## 1.9.3. Inclusive digital access: Ensuring access to and use of digital services\n\nHuman-centred digitisation must focus on building confidence in the use of technology and be based on values and the ability to use technology responsibly, so that no one is  left  behind  due  to  lack  of  access.  Therefore,  once  the appropriate  infrastructure  is  in  place  to  be  able  to  offer services, there may still be other major barriers that hinder or prevent  access  to  technology  for  millions  of  people.  These barriers pose new challenges to the organisation and require an  additional  commitment  to  addressing  them  in  a  crosscutting and consistent manner.\n\n## 1.9.3.1. Accessibility: So that all people can make use of digital services\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is committed to minimising the barriers to making use  of  digital  solutions.  Currently,  many  people  with disabilities do not have access to services in the online world, such  as  e-commerce,  financial  solutions,  health  services, entertainment, etc.\n\nFor this reason, we are working on several lines that facilitate access  to  the  digital  services  we  offer,  such  as  television, devices, mobile applications and web portals.\n\nThanks to this work, millions of people can access adapted content on television through the Movistar+ 5S functionality, which has more than 5,000 pieces of content including films and  programmes adapted for people with  hearing  or  visual disabilities.  We  also  work  with  handset  manufacturers  to promote  new  capabilities  in  mobile  devices  that  make",

Ensuring that everyone can have access to basic communication services\n\nThe deployment of connectivity always entails a cost that is passed on in the prices of the services offered. Although the take-up  costs  of  fixed  broadband,  and  especially  mobile broadband, have fallen significantly over the last decade, we are  continuing  to  work  on  new  business  models  that  will allow  us  to  offer  increasingly  affordable  rates  and  thereby ensure universal access to communications services.\n\nPay-as-you-go mobile services, specific broadband packages and service packages for small businesses and entrepreneurs are  just  some  of  the  key  tools  we  use  at  Telef\u00f3nica  to facilitate  access  to  telecommunications  services  for  the entire population.\n\nIn  addition  to  our  efforts  to  create  a  simple,  accessible  and innovative  offering,  we  contribute  to  the  Universal  Service Fund  in  seven  countries.  This  is  a  public  investment  fund whose  objective  is  to  guarantee  services  for  all  users regardless of their geographical location, in compliance with quality standards and at an affordable price.

Projects  such  as Digital mobil im Alter (Digital Mobile  for  Seniors)  in  Germany  and  the  GURU  business programmes  offered  in  several  countries  serve  as  contact points  for  helping  our  customers  by  responding  to  all  their doubts, questions and fears about new digital technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.9.4.2. Training in digital skills\n\nWe  are  committed  to  adapting  people's  training  to  the changes imposed by the digital revolution, which is why at Fundaci\u00f3n  Telef\u00f3nica  we  develop  programmes  aimed  at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our commercial activity, from our Foundation and through  the  solutions  offered  by  Telef\u00f3nica  Educaci\u00f3n Digital, we  work  to  help  people  gain  the  necessary knowledge and skills  to  be  able  to  access  the  Internet  and make use of new services. We offer everything from training in  basic  digital  skills,  such  as  how  to  use  mobile  phone applications,  to  training  in  new  digital  technologies  and  Big Data to improve people's ability to access the new areas of demand in the labour market.\n\nTwo levels for achieving this:\n\nExamples: Making calls, setting up the phone, using messaging applications, etc.\n\n## Facilitates access to technologies\n\nExamples: Mobile app programming, Big Data, creation of software, use of advanced technical tools.\n\n## Improves employability\n\nimproving the employability of groups at risk of exclusion in an  increasingly  competitive  employment  scenario  that demands new digital skills.  Among  these  initiatives  we  can highlight the Conecta Empleo and Proyecto 42.\n\nConecta Empleo, one of the most  highly regarded employability  programmes, offers  free  online courses, programmes  and  digital  tools  to  train  for  the  most  indemand ICT jobs. In addition, the programme has two tools aimed  at  facilitating  users'  decisions.  These  are  the 'Employment  Map' ,  which  helps  users  choose  courses  by showing the most in-demand digital jobs, and the virtual career  coach,  a  chatbot  based  on  artificial  intelligence and  Big  Data  that  advises  participants so  that  they  can design  their  own  most  suitable  professional  path.  The programme also includes the 'Lanzaderas Conecta Empleo' shuttles: Lanzadera  Conecta  Empleo  (LCE),  Sat\u00e9lites  de Empleo (SE) and Alfabetizaci\u00f3n Digital (AD) .  Their aim is to adapt career guidance to the challenges of the digital age and the ever-changing labour market.",

Based  on  an  innovative  methodology  with  proven effectiveness in other countries, Proyecto 42 offers free and open training. Its educational model is based on peer-to-peer learning,  it  is  participatory,  gamified  and  is  developed through the implementation of projects in different branches of  programming.  Each  student  sets  his  or  her  own  pace  of learning and the emphasis is on collaborative work in order to  teach  values  such  as  effort,  tolerance  of  frustration,  the ability  to  improve  and  teamwork.  Proyecto  42  is  currently active in the city of Madrid and in Urduliz, Vizcaya, and will soon open its doors in Malaga and Alicante.\n\nMore information on e-skills education and its impact can be found in the Chapter on Contribution to Communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Contribution to communities: Impacts & SDGs\n\n## 1.9.5. Innovative digital content and services\n\nThe last (but far from the least important) barrier to ensuring that everyone can reap the benefits of the digital revolution is  the  ability  to deliver  solutions,  services  and  content that add value to people's daily lives .\n\nThe  development  of  these  types  of  solutions  and  content also  allows  us  to  respond  to  social  challenges  related,  for example, to health, education, rural economic development and security, among other issues.\n\nIn this regard, we offer new ranges of services, of which we can highlight, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Services that facilitate access to loans and insurance through mobile financial products (Movistar Money).\n- \u00b7 Services that bring health closer and offer direct contact with health  professionals  through  products  such  as  Movistar Salud.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Smart  Agro  solutions  that  inform  farmers  about  factors such as soil moisture and soil water consumption, allowing them to optimise irrigation and thus improve crop yields. These  also  include  a  solution  designed  to  drive  a  more sustainable model of agriculture capable of coping with the challenges of climate change and the growing demand for food  by  facilitating  crop  management  and  efficiency  for farmers,  while  at  the  same  time  increasing  their  digital skills through the use of innovative digital solutions.\n- \u00b7 Data solutions for solving social or environmental problems (Big Data for Social Good) with applications for monitoring infectious  diseases  or  analysing  air  quality  in  large  urban environments\n- \u00b7 Content accessibility services such as Movistar +5S, which allows  people  with  any  visual  or  hearing  impairment  to enjoy television services.\n- \u00b7 Eco Smart services to aid more sustainable development in the management of energy, waste, reduction of emissions, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Responsibility with the environment",

In addition, they have enabled us to improve our networks and telephone support during peak traffic.\n\nDespite the pandemic, at Open Innovation we have completed our strategy by launching Wayra Builder, Wayra X and Tech Ventures and have continued to invest in startups: : 42 new investment this year.\n\nInnovation has been part of Telef\u00f3nica's DNA since the very beginning.  We  consider  that  being  able  to  anticipate  the future,  understand  the  Company's  needs  and  work  to continue  to  be  pioneers  in  the  digital  world  are  key.  To achieve  this,  we  leverage  both  in-house  innovation  and external  innovation  developed  by  third  parties  we  invest  in and with whom we work closely.\n\nIn  our  innovation  areas,  most  of  our  work  focuses  on identifying future opportunities for our business, adapting to a  changing  technological  environment  and  seeking  new spaces  in  which  to  develop  our  activity  and  offer  new products  and  services,  either  through  our  own  solutions\n\n(Core  Innovation)  or  through  agreements  with  third  parties (Open Innovation).\n\nThis enables us to ensure our ability to anticipate the specific needs  of  our  clients  and  the  new  demands  of  society  in general.\n\nWe also promote the development of sustainable solutions whose objective is not only to obtain economic benefits, but also  to  generate  a  positive  impact  on  the  social  and economic development of the  regions  in  which  we  operate and protect our natural environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  want  to  be  always offering our customers better solutions while exploring new technologies,  projects  and  businesses  that  provide  us  with the  ability  to  reinvent  ourselves  in  the  medium  and  long term.\n\nA  significant  part  of  these  innovation  activities  are  carried out  by  research  and  development  teams  from  the  Core Innovation  area.  This  area's  mission  is  to  improve  our competitiveness  by  analysing  Telef\u00f3nica's  own  assets, platforms  and  services,  such  as  connectivity,  data  and entertainment platforms.\n\nWork  is  also  being  carried  out  on  the  development  of  new products and on experimental and applied research projects. It  is  precisely  in  carrying  out  these  functions  that  this  unit collaborates with other public and private organisations and national  and  international  universities,  with  the  aim  of promoting new technologies.\n\nThe working model of the Core Innovation units is based on the use of Lean Startup methodology. This methodology has been adapted for use by large companies in a model known as  Lean  Elephant,  and  makes  it  possible  to  speed  up  the innovation and design process, making it more efficient and maintaining a clear customer focus throughout.\n\nThe process is divided into four phases that run up until the commercial launch. In each phase, various milestones must be reached in order to determine whether the project should continue or be discarded.\n\n## We divide our processes into 4 phases\n\nto  ensure  the  deployment  of  future  businesses  with  a greater likelihood of success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother  of  the  main  pillars  of  in-house  innovation  is  the creation of a culture of intra-entrepreneurship and innovation.  For  this  purpose,  the  global  'IN\\_Prendedores' programme provides funds and resources to the best ideas and  projects  presented  by  employees  in  response  to different  challenges  that  regularly  affect  issues  considered strategic for the Company.\n\n## Key innovation indicators\n\n*These figures have been calculated using the OECD guidelines.\n\n|                                                    | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Investment in R&D and innovation  (million euros)  | 6,114  | 5,602  | 4,626  |\n| Investment in R&D and innovation /  revenue (%)    | 12.6%  | 11.6%  | 10.7%  |\n| Investment in R&D (million euros)                  | 947    | 866    | 959    |\n| Investment in R&D / revenue (%)                    | 1.9%   | 1.8%   | 2.2%   |\n| Annual increase/decrease in  investment in R&D (%) | 9.9%   | (8.6%) | 10.7%  |\n| Industrial property rights portfolio               | 601    | 477    | 440    |\n| New patents registered                             | 22     | 27     | 14     |\n\n## Investment in R&D by region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New assets generated in 2020\n\n| Assets              | Scope                                           |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 14 patents          | 10 European patents 4 international PCT patents |\n| 1 industrial design | EUIPO                                           |\n| 1 industrial design | European Union Intellectual  Property Office    |",

        "page_content": "## 1.10.1.1. Innovation in connectivity\n\nConnectivity is  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  our  business.  The aim of this innovation unit is to bring Telef\u00f3nica's networks closer to the end user, making them more accessible, open and programmable while discovering new ways to equip the networks with cutting-edge technology so as to make them smarter and more efficient.\n\nThis line of activity includes four main areas of work:\n\n## Cloud networking\n\nNew  communication  needs  demand  adaptive  network structures  that  can  simplify  the  highly  complex  tasks associated with traditional networks and allow operators and organisations to deploy localisations in minutes and operate distributed  networks  that  offer  unprecedented  levels  of network control.\n\nWe  are  working  on  implementing  cloud  networking infrastructures  to  facilitate  the  rapid,  versatile  creation  of new services. One of the first examples of this is the creation of  an  extended  local  area  service  that  will  simplify  a company's  management  of  the  connectivity  between  local area networks on different sites.\n\n## Services over 5G networks\n\nThe advent of 5G technology introduces a paradigm shift in network  deployment  models  for  telecom  operators  and enterprises.  The  new  capabilities  of  this  technology  will enable  the  development  of  new  services  that  leverage  the high  performance  of  the  new  networks.  In  practical  terms, this  means  that  the  networks  can  be  adapted  to  the requirements of the services.\n\nWe are working on creating vertical applications on different deployment models and architectures through the creation of  5G  private  networks.  Our  approach  to  this  type  of innovation is to collaborate with companies to develop real cases that are enabled only by the use of these technologies. Such actions include the launch of several pilots funded by the Spanish government under the call for 5G pilots.\n\n## Edge computing services\n\nA  pioneering  service  is  being  developed  to  replace  mobile realisation and production units with a simple connection to Telef\u00f3nica's edge. The starting point is a collaboration with RTVE and the Polytechnic University of Madrid as part of a pilot project funded by the European Commission called 5G Media, in which all three parties are involved.\n\nThe  service  improves  current  TV  production  processes, making  them  simpler  and  speeding  up  response  times  for event  coverage.  This  is  achieved  by  replacing  the  usual technical and human deployment involved in TV production that takes place via mobile units with a simple connection of cameras  and  sound  equipment  directly  into  Telef\u00f3nica's edge.\n\n## Videogames\n\nThe  constant  development  of  the  video  game  sector combined  with  the  influence  of  gamers  has  revolutionised\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe online entertainment market and Telef\u00f3nica seeks to be part  of  this  revolution.  We  are  innovating  to  improve  the gaming  experience  on  our  networks.  This  would  include improving  the  way  games  run  over  our  networks  and developing  video  game  streaming  services  based  on  edge computing technologies.\n\n## 1.10.1.2. Innovation in Cognitive Marketing GRI 103\n\nThis  area  studies  new  ways  to  harness  cognitive  digital marketing  opportunities  by  applying  artificial  intelligence algorithms to Telef\u00f3nica's data. The aim is to achieve better marketing  results  by  striking  a  balance  between  consumer privacy  and  the  need  for  businesses  to  understand  their customers.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  activity,  we  are  already  commercialising the  first  versions  of  products  that  design  programmatic advertising  campaigns.  First  off,  we  have  created  solutions for online advertising and outdoor advertising media.\n\n## 1.10.1.3. Entertainment\n\nThe  evolution  of  the  video  industry,  which  is  constantly generating new  business  opportunities, has made  it necessary to develop new solutions to satisfy people's video demands. This area  explores  new  horizons  and  possibilities for video experiences and the resulting businesses.\n\nDuring the year, we completed development on a solution for producing television content from remote locations, something that was key to keeping up the pace of content production  during  the  periods  of  home  lockdown  brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWe  also developed and launched two services to complement Telef\u00f3nica's video platforms. On the one hand, we created an education/entertainment service based on the Movistar+  television  platform  in  Spain.  On  the  other,  we developed  a  content  discovery  service  on  the  VivoPlay service in Brazil.\n\n## 1.10.1.4. Research: Disruptive, applied and experimental innovation\n\nTo  be  at  the  cutting  edge  of  business  and  technology,  we need to be constantly looking beyond our boundaries to stay abreast  of  the  latest  discoveries.  We  must  keep  on  top  of what is happening in the worldwide scientific community and be able to move forward with cutting-edge technology if we are  to  position  ourselves  as  pioneers  in  the  world  of technology.\n\nIt is important to highlight the work carried out in the area of artificial  intelligence,  which  enabled  us  to:  improve  the operation of our networks; enhance the ability of the voice recognition  technology  used  by  Aura,  our  customer  service module,  to  identify  mood;  and  facilitate  the  study  of COVID-19 propagation through analysis of mobile phone call patterns.",

This is done by supporting the growth of ideas, projects  and  companies  while  at  the  same  time  detecting talent at any stage of maturity.\n\nOur  hubs  provide  startups  with  unique  access  to  large corporate partners, investors, governments, public institutions  and  relevant  entrepreneurs.  In  addition,  having public  and  private  partners  means  we  can  strengthen  the global entrepreneurship ecosystem by expanding our range of  services  and  offering  entrepreneurs  in  our  ecosystem access to events, competitions and financing rounds.\n\nDuring  the  challenging  year  that  was  2020,  we  completed Telef\u00f3nica's Open Innovation strategy through the launch of three  new  vehicles:  Wayra  Builder,  to  leverage  Telef\u00f3nica's internal talent and technology; Wayra X, to invest globally in 100%  digital  startups;  and  Tech  Ventures,  to  invest  in cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2020 we maintained our investment activity by investing \u20ac11.4M  in  42 companies  through  Wayra  and  Telef\u00f3nica Ventures,  and  continued  to  rotate  our  portfolio,  generating \u20ac3.4m  through  the  sale  of  18  startups.

They  also  collaborate  with  startups  in our  ecosystem  to  increase  the  Group's  efficiency  or  offer new solutions to our customers.\n\n## 1.10.2.1. Open Future\n\nThis is a strategic regional programme developed in alliance with public and private partners to support local early-stage startups.\n\nIn  particular,  we  have  worked  with  our  partners  to  create Open  Future  hubs,  which  offer  a  workspace,  a  mentoring service  and  access  to  exclusive  offers  from  commercial partners,  etc.  Any  company  that  does  not  yet  have  a minimum viable product or generate business is a potential candidate for this programme.\n\nAt present, we have 35 hubs in 4 countries across Europe and Latin America; in 2020 we collaborated with local governments  to  open  2  new  hubs  in  Ceuta  and  Melilla.  In 2020 we also accelerated more than 200 companies, helping to generate more than 700 jobs.\n\n## 1.10.2.2. Wayra\n\nWayra is the main programme that connects Telef\u00f3nica with the  entrepreneurial  ecosystem  around  the  world.  Wayra provides a unique, seamless interface between entrepreneurs and our network of companies, governments and other partners, adding value to the ecosystems in which we are present and investing in startups.\n\nWayra's  programme  currently  has  various  lines  of  work comprising the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Wayra  Hubs: There  are  7  hubs  in  Europe  and  Latin America,  serving  9  countries.  The  aim  is  to  invest, accompany and support entrepreneurs as they grow to a global  scale,  as  well  as  to  connect  innovators  with Telef\u00f3nica's business units to generate joint opportunities.\n\nWayra  invests  in  startups  that  have  the  capacity  to generate business with the Group (FIT) and where working with them could have a significant impact for our clients or the  Company's  results.  We  invest  in  startups  that  are ready  for  scaling,  with  a  preference  for  the  following sectors:  entertainment  (gaming  and  video),  IoT  and  Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, eHealth, Edtech and Fintech.\n\nThis  year  Wayra  has  managed  to  continue  growing  as  a leader  in  the  entrepreneurial  ecosystems  in  which  it operates  thanks  to  agreements  with  significant  local partners  such  as  Renfe  in  Spain,  Novartis  in  the  UK,  El Cubo/Ita\u00fa  in  Brazil  and  the  IDB  in  HispAm,  all  of  which provide us with a quality deal flow. We have also signed an agreement with Telef\u00f3nica HispAm to continue operating in the region.\n\n- \u00b7 Wayra X: Wayra X was launched in November 2020 as a hub  for  investing  in  startups  with  mass-market  digital products.  It  is  the  Company's  first  100%  digital  hub designed to invest globally in full-remote startups that will develop  mass-market  digital  products  able  to  reach millions of users anywhere in the world. Wayra X focuses on  projects  related  to  5G,  e-health,  e-learning,  digital home,  entertainment,  mobility  and  the  future  of  work, among others, with a prototype or product on the market. In just two months we closed the first three investments in startups and tested their services for pre-installation on O 2 and Movistar handsets in Spain.\n- \u00b7 Wayra  Builder: At  Wayra  Builder  we  capitalise  on  the efforts of our technological talent, the patents developed internally and other Telef\u00f3nica assets to create innovative startups  that  respond  to  market  needs  which  aren't  yet fully catered for. The result is purely digital startups with a global focus  which,  despite  having  emerged  within Telef\u00f3nica,  operate  independently  so  they  can  develop more quickly.\n\nAt  Wayra  Builder  we  started  the  year  by  setting  up  the Deeder  team,  our  first  startup.  It  is  a  platform  for companies to interact with their customers on WhatsApp, enabling contracts to be signed and products and services to  be  paid  for  without  leaving  the  channel.  Halfway through the year, with the first MVP ready, we conducted the first concept tests with real customers. Today we are at  an  advanced stage in discussions with major clients in the consumer credit sector. We ended the year by signing two new startups: the first, Tech4Safe (T4S), is a tool for monitoring  worker  movements  in  a  factory,  registering contacts,  generating  heat  maps  and  proposing  an  action plan in case of a positive COVID-19 test result; the second startup, Shadow, is a platform for companies to generate invisible watermarks  on  PDF  documents  to  prevent information  leaks  that  are  so  damaging  to  a  company's economy and reputation.",

Sustainable innovation\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we approach sustainability as a cross-cutting process  throughout  the  organisation.  We  particularly  focus on  solutions  that  contribute  to  social  and  environmental transformation,  taking  into  account  the  major  global challenges we are facing today. In addition, our commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals provides us with a particular framework in which technology and digitisation can add value.\n\nFrom this perspective, the main issues are associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 Inclusive connectivity : Ensuring that we bring connectivity and new digital services to everyone without leaving anyone behind.\n- \u00b7 Developing  more  sustainable  societies :  Implementing solutions that improve the quality of life of individuals and communities.\n- \u00b7 The  development  of  new  products  that  contribute  to protecting  the  planet : Implementing  solutions  that reduce emissions and waste and improve energy efficiency at the Company and for our customers.\n\nIn  this  regard,  in  recent  years  we  have  sponsored  the development  of  new  lines  of  activity,  such  as  new  IoT solutions aimed at protecting natural ecosystems, solutions that  make  technology  more  accessible  to  people  with disabilities  and  Big  Data  for  Social  Good  initiatives  that include research and studies on Smart Agro, the evaluation of pandemics and environmental pollution.\n\nIn  2020  took  place  the  5th  edition  of  the  Sustainable Innovation  Initiative.  During  that  event,  262  projects  were presented from 10 countries. Employees, startups from the Open  Innovation  ecosystem,  universities  and  Telef\u00f3nica Group suppliers presented ideas that addressed some of the lines of activity related to bringing connectivity to everyone, protecting  the  planet  and  developing  more  sustainable societies,  while  at  the  same  time  presenting  a  profitable business model for the Company. The top three best projects have  been  financed  and  helped  along  internally,  and  are either currently in pilot testing phase or have been launched commercially.",

It acts as a pointer for us to behave and make decisions based on integrity, transparency and commitment.\n\nOur Responsible Business Plan is approved and overseen at the highest level. This Plan translates our code of ethics into concrete objectives and KPIs, which are then incorporated into the Company's Strategic Plan.\n\nWe have made sustainability an unwavering part of our organisational culture through several lines of action: variable remuneration based on ESG factors, training and awareness-raising.\n\n## 2.1.1 Sustainability governance\n\nGRI 103, 102-16, 102-20, 102-26, 102-30, 102-31, 102-32, 102-33\n\nThe  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  code  of  ethics  are  our  Business Principles,  which  establish  the  three  basic  pillars  of  the Company's management: integrity, commitment and transparency. It is structured around ten topics:\n\n- 1. Ethical and responsible management\n- 2. Our commitment to customers\n- 3. Our commitment to employees\n- 4. Corporate governance and internal control\n- 5. Respect for privacy rights and freedom of expression\n- 6. Our commitment to information security\n- 7. Responsible communication\n- 8. Responsible management of our supply chain\n- 9. Our commitment to the environment\n- 10. Our commitment to the societies in which we operate\n\nTo guarantee that our Business Principles are the common thread  running  through  everything  we  do, we  have  a Responsible Business Plan in place that includes objectives and projects concerning the ethical and responsible management  of  the  Company,  respect  for  human  rights, customer  responsibility,  our  commitments  to  privacy, freedom of expression and information, security, the ethical use of artificial intelligence and the responsible management of  technology,  sustainable  supply  chain  management,  our climate  change  and  environmental  strategy,  the  promotion of diversity, the safety and well-being of our employees and a  business  strategy  focused  on  developing  products  and services that contribute to addressing society's major social and environmental challenges (sustainable innovation).\n\nWe incorporate the objectives of the Responsible Business Plan into the Company's Strategic Plan , in which nonfinancial indicators reported on in this report are reflected. Some of the major objectives of the Responsible Business Plan are also incorporated into the variable remuneration of all employees, including members of the Executive Committee.\n\n## The following are the main governing bodies overseeing sustainability:\n\n| Approval    | Board of Directors                                           |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Supervision | Sustainability & Quality Committee Audit & Control Committee |\n| Follow-Up   | Responsible Business Office                                  |\n|             | Implementation  Corporate Business and Support Areas         |\n|             | Country Operators                                            |\n\nThe Board of Directors approves the Business Principles and the  Responsible  Business  Plan;  it  also  approves  the  most relevant policies associated with the latter, such as the AntiCorruption, Environmental Management, Privacy and Sustainable  Supply  Chain  Management  Policies.  Together, these form our ethical and responsible business framework and the roadmap for all employees.\n\nThe Board's  Sustainability  and  Quality  Committee oversees  the  implementation  of  the  Responsible  Business Plan  at  its  monthly  meetings.  The Audit  and  Control Committee also plays an important oversight role in ethics and sustainability  as  it  supervises  the  compliance  function, the risk analysis and  management  process  and  the Company's reporting processes.",

Culture aligned with Ethical and Sustainable Management GRI 102-27\n\nBesides  ensuring  ethical  behaviour  and  the  responsible management  of  our  business,  our  ultimate  goal  is  to incorporate corporate sustainability activities and strategies as a key part of our organisational culture, bringing internal behaviours,  processes  and  objectives  in  line  with  the Company's purpose and values.\n\nOur basic maxim is to ensure consistency between what we say and what we do, so that this shared vision is transferred from  our  employees  to  our  customers  and  from  our customers  to  society  in  general.  Culture  is  strengthened when we bring who we are on the inside into line with how we present ourselves on the outside.\n\nTo  further  align  internal  culture  with  ESG  factors,  we systematically connect all aspects of sustainability to longterm business value and ensure that every internal process or  activity  is  consistent  with  this  vision.  Moving  the organisational culture forward and including commitment to sustainability  is  a  long-term  task  that  requires  a  shared vision and commitment at every level of the organisation.\n\nWe highlight several work streams that offer a practical view of  what  we  are  doing  to  help  the  organisation  progress towards sustainability:\n\n- \u00b7 Training  and  awareness-raising: Firstly, building  an organisational culture of sustainability requires guaranteed  training  for  all  our  employees.  Therefore,  we are  continuously  training  our  entire  workforce  on  our Business  Principles  and  human  rights  (see  Chapter  2.2 Ethics and Compliance for more information). In addition, specific  strategic  training  is  given  annually  on  key  issues such  as  privacy,  digital  security,  ethics  and  artificial intelligence, accessibility and diversity. Training is accompanied by intensive internal communication campaigns and awareness-raising events.\n- \u00b7 Internal  processes  and  activities: Our  aim  is  for  every employee to understand that sustainability is part of our daily activity. Sustainability is a concept that brings value and differentiation to the various areas of the business. For example,  in  2020  we  systematically  incorporated  ethical and  sustainability factors into product  and  service development  processes.  In  that  context,  we  provided employee  training  on  specific  ethical  and  sustainability issues related to the design of our products and services, such  as  the  impact  on  human  rights,  eco-design, accessible  products  and  services,  the  social  impact  and data  ethics  (for  more  information,  see  the  Chapter  on Customers).\n- \u00b7 Alignment  with  business  priorities : Furthermore,  to ensure internal  alignment  with  ESG  factors,  the  business case must be shown. This means systematically linking all aspects  of  sustainability  to  business  value.  Sustainable businesses must be measurable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Control processes and indicators: It is essential for us to be  on  the  front  foot  and  ensure  the  robustness  of  nonfinancial  indicator  control  processes  in  order  to  foster organisational alignment.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration scheme: Employee performance appraisals  must  include  sustainability.  Therefore,  as mentioned  above,  we  have  incorporated  sustainability objectives into the variable remuneration scheme offered to our employees.\n- \u00b7 Alignment  between  brand  and  culture: Brand  and culture  alignment  is  key.  Our  aim  is  to  align  Telef\u00f3nica's behaviour,  processes  and  objectives  with  the  Company's purpose and values (see the Chapter on Mission, Purpose, Values).",

Introduction\n\nEthical and responsible behaviour is key to gaining the trust of  our  stakeholders,  thereby  ensuring  the  sustainability  of our  business.  For  this  reason,  the  Business  Principles,  our code of ethics, are a basic pillar of Telef\u00f3nica's strategy and culture  that  must  be  complied  with  by  all  employees, including,  in  particular,  senior  management.  Failure  to comply will result in disciplinary action.\n\n## Main ethical issues regarding our stakeholders\n\nCustomers\n\nSimplicity, transparency and integrity in our products and services. Responsible communication. Data transparency.\n\nEmployees\n\nTraining on our Business Principles and human rights. Clear guidelines for ethical and non- discriminatory behaviour. Promotion of diversity and talent management. Confidential and anonymous reporting channel.\n\nSuppliers\n\nRequirements for our suppliers to comply with ethical standards and respect human rights in our supply chain. Identification and prevention of conflicts of interest.\n\nInvestors\n\nTransparency, integrity and materiality with regard to reports and information. Proactive commitment to ethical issues.\n\nSociety\n\nProtection and promotion of human rights. Zero tolerance of corruption and anti-competitive practices. Political neutrality. Responsible fiscal behaviour and fiscal transparency. Ethical commitment through the Responsible Business Channel.\n\n## 2.2.2. Ethics & compliance strategy and governance\n\nOur  strategy  to  meet  the  expectations  of  our  stakeholders (see  table  above)  is  based  on  a  culture  of  ethics  and compliance,  driven  and  directed  from  the  highest  levels  of the  Company, with  clear  lines  of  responsibility  and  a  firm commitment  to  best  business  and  ethical  practices.  The Board of Directors therefore approves the Business Principles,  the  Responsible  Business  Plan  and  associated policies.  The  Board  also  has  several  Committees,  which specifically monitor issues related to ethics and compliance, through the heads of the Corporate Ethics and Sustainability, and Compliance and Internal Audit areas.\n\n## Ethics governance and compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Lines of action GRI 103, 102-16\n\nIn  ethics  and  compliance  management,  we  follow  several lines  of  action  to  ensure  ethical  behaviour  throughout  our Company, based on zero tolerance of corruption and bribery. The system is based on legal compliance, employee training, and the establishment of internal mechanisms for reporting potential non-compliance. It is accompanied by principles of fair  competition, political neutrality, fiscal transparency and responsible  communication,  and  is  monitored  by  the Company's internal control processes.\n\n## 2.2.3.1. Compliance GRI 205-2\n\nThe  Global  Compliance  area,  more  specifically,  the  Chief Compliance Officer of the Telef\u00f3nica Group, reports directly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto  the  Board  of  Directors  through  the  Audit  and  Control Committee. The starting point for compliance management is  risk  assessment  and  the  protection  of  integrity.  In  this regard,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Compliance  Function Charter was updated in 2020. Accordingly, although its basic principles  have  been  maintained,  some  major  aspects  were reviewed  in  order  to  adapt  them  to  the  evolution  of  the Telef\u00f3nica Group's Compliance Programme.\n\nOne of the aspects reviewed involved the matters identified as particularly relevant from the point of view of compliance, which, following this review, are as follows:\n\n## Subjects of the Compliance Programme*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *This Chapter addresses the following topics: (a) anti-corruption (integrity); (b) competition (relations with competitors); and (c) money laundering.\n- **Regulated areas: This refers to compliance with the legislation applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies, and pension fund and investment fund\n\nmanagement companies.\n\nThe Compliance function, according to the current Compliance Function Charter, is deployed on two levels:\n\n- \u00b7 Preventive control: This activity is aimed at generating a culture  of  compliance,  and  involves  carrying  out  training and  awareness-raising  actions  on  matters  such  as  anticorruption,  criminal  prevention  and  sanctions,  as  well  as supporting  other  training  that  may  be  developed  on  the other matters described in coordination with the internal areas responsible for them. Another of the basic elements on  which  preventive  control  is  based  is  the  continuous assessment of compliance risk.\n\nLikewise, within this preventive function of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's  Compliance  Programme,  it  is  worth  highlighting the consultancy activity conducted through channels that allow  employees  to  make  queries  related  to  compliance issues  (mainly  queries  related  to  the  application  of  the Anti-Corruption  Policy  and  other  implementing  internal regulations).  Special  mention  must  also  be  made  of  the protocols  for  assessing  suppliers  and  business  partners from the point of view of compliance, the implementation of which is carried out in an environment of continuous and gradual  improvement  of  our  Compliance  Programme.  In\n\nthis  respect,  the  valuation  protocols  performed  in  the context of corporate transactions (mergers and acquisitions)  are  particularly  noteworthy,  especially  from an anti-corruption risk point of view.\n\nFinally,  it  is  worth  mentioning  other  activities  within  this preventive  control  function,  such  as  internal  regulatory monitoring, the preventive control model, management of conflicts of interest and criminal prevention.\n\n- \u00b7 Reaction  and  response: The  reaction  function  refers  to the action protocols to be followed in situations in which there are sufficiently relevant indications of noncompliance. The response function refers to the correction of the consequences of possible non-compliance by acting on  two  fronts:  (i)  mitigating  all  the  consequences associated  with  a  possible  breach  or  a  breach  already evidenced  and  (ii)  ensuring  the  consistent  application  of consequences for said breaches, as well as promoting the recognition  of  employees  with  outstanding  behaviour  in terms of their commitment to compliance.",

This course, aimed at all areas of the Company, is delivered in the main countries in which  we  are  present,  except  in  Germany  and  the  United Kingdom, where we have specific or related training courses.\n\nIn addition, the Group has certain guidelines for participation in industry organisations and meetings with competitors, in which clear rules are laid down to ensure compliance with competition  law  regarding  the  exchange  and  assurance of confidentiality of information . In some countries, this is complemented by specific competition compliance programmes in accordance with local legislation (e.g. Chile).\n\nIn 2020, 1 material ongoing court proceeding was identified for  infringement of competition law and no fines were paid (0) for anti-competitive practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the Chapter on Annual Report on Annual Accounts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Money laundering compliance\n\nWith  regard  to money  laundering , the  Company  has payment  controls  in  place:  for  example,  due  diligence procedures on suppliers and business partners defined from a compliance standpoint, or controls on payments to certain countries classified as high risk. This in turn is complemented by  activities  specifically  aimed  at  compliance,  with  the requirements  given,  where  applicable,  in  the  legislation  of each country, and/or, where applicable, by certain regulations in this area applicable to the type of company or entity  in  question  (in  those  cases  in  which  the  same  is considered by said local legislation to be a regulated entity in this  area).  In  particular,  in  2020,  as  part  of  its  continuous improvement  strategy,  Telef\u00f3nica  analysed  the  need  to reinforce the corresponding controls.\n\n## 2.2.3.2. Training GRI 205-2, 412-2\n\nA  key  element  in  promoting  a  culture  of  ethics  within  the Company  and  ensuring  compliance  with  our  Business Principles is training.\n\nTraining in the Business Principles and human rights is aimed at  all  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  employees  and  is  mandatory.  It  is specifically  monitored  by  the  Responsible  Business  Office. This course had  reached  103,934 employees,  which represents  93%  of  the  workforce,  by  31  December  2020. During the reporting period, 10,770 employees were trained, i.e. 10% of the total number of employees at the end of the year.  A  total  of  207,868 hours  of  this  course  have  been taught since its launch, of which 17,010 hours correspond to the year 2020.\n\nWe  have  trained  93% of  staff  in  anti-corruption. Anticorruption training includes the following courses:\n\n- \u00b7 The  course  on  the Business  Principles (mentioned above),  which  includes  anti-corruption  aspects  in  the specific section of the course called 'Ethical and responsible management'.\n- \u00b7 A  global  course  on  the Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act (FCPA), in  online  and  in-person  format.  This  course  is aimed  at  certain  areas  of  the  Company  that  present  a higher  potential  risk  due  to  their  greater  exposure  to officials  and  authorities.  Since  2017  (the  year  it  was launched),  it  has  been  implemented  progressively  at  a global level in the Telef\u00f3nica Group. So far, in addition to Telef\u00f3nica S.A. and the other global units, it has been given in  the  operations  and  businesses  of  Spain,  Brazil,  Mexico and  Telxius (2017); Uruguay,  Argentina,  Nicaragua, Panama,  Costa  Rica,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  Colombia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador (2018); Venezuela and the United Kingdom  (2019).  In  2020,  online  training  in  this  area continued.\n\n\u00b7",

In  addition  to  the  global  anti-corruption training  mentioned  above,  in  most  of  the  countries  in which  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  present,  there  is  other specific  training  (including  aspects  relating  to  criminal prevention): in some cases, this training is in-person and/ or is aimed at certain groups of employees whose activity may  present  a  greater  potential  risk.  In  this  regard,  it  is worth  mentioning  the  training  in  criminal  liability  that exists in Spain and Peru, launched in Argentina, Chile and Ecuador in 2020.\n\nFinally, as regards anti-corruption training, we regularly train all  members of our Board of Directors in anti-corruption. In 2019  we  trained  100%  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors  in  person.  In  2020,  an  online  training  was developed  so  that  the  two  new  members  of  the  Board  of Directors who joined during the year could complete it by the beginning of the 2021 financial year.\n\nSpecific  training  has  also  been  given  in  subjects  other  than integrity,  but  which,  for  the  purposes  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group's  Compliance  Programme,  are  relevant  from  the compliance point of view; some examples would be training in  digital  security,  competition  law  and  privacy.  In  addition, awareness-raising  activities  have  been  initiated  in  certain areas of the Company on international sanctions programmes.\n\nTraining is also reinforced by intensive internal communication,  awareness  and  sensitisation  campaigns, which address different  issues  such  as  conflicts  of  interest, gifts  and  invitations,  responsible  purchasing,  environment, privacy, our Customer Promise, etc.\n\n## Employees trained in the course on our Business Principles and Human Rights*\n\nNumber of employees trained in the course on Business Principles and human rights\n\n103,934\n\nPercentage of employees trained in the course on Business Principles and human rights\n\n93%\n\nHours of training in the course on Business Principles and human rights\n\n207,868\n\n*Since its launchment in 2018\n\n## Employees trained in anti-corruption\n\n| Number of employees trained in anti-corruption*   | 104,522   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Number of employees trained in anti-corruption*   | 93%       |\n\n*Includes the courses on Business Principles (since 2018), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (since 2017) and local anti-corruption courses (since 2019).

Complaint and remedy mechanisms: the Whistleblower channel and the Responsible Business channel\n\nGRI 103, 102-17, 205-3, 403-2, 406-1\n\n## Whistleblower Channel\n\nAt  Telef\u00f3nica we have a Whistleblower Channel that allows employees and stakeholders to make a complaint anonymously or personally to report any alleged irregularity or act contrary to the law or internal regulations.\n\nAs  a  new  feature,  since  the  end  of  2020,  it  has  been accessible through a form on our website to give access to all stakeholders  and  thus  comply  with  the  European  Directive on the Protection of Persons Reporting Breaches of EU Law and also with the update of the Good Governance Code for listed companies.\n\nManagement of the Complaints Channel is governed by the principles of confidentiality of the data provided, i.e. respect, substantiation and completeness. In cases where irregularities are identified, the Audit and Control Committee, which reports to the Board of Directors, is informed.\n\nComplaints may fall into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Labour disputes\n- \u00b7 Labour conditions\n- \u00b7 Information security/privacy\n- \u00b7 Acts contrary to the integrity of the Company\n- \u00b7 Asset fraud\n- \u00b7 Favourable treatment\n- \u00b7 Financial reporting\n- \u00b7 Regulatory/contractual/legal non-compliance\n\nThe above categories also include any irregularities relating to  accounting  matters,  auditing  matters  and/or  internal control  over  financial  reporting  in  compliance  with  section 301 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other requirements in this regard.\n\nAfter  sending  the  complaint,  the  system  will  provide  a username  and  password  that  will  allow  the  status  of  the complaint to be consulted at any time, using the anonymous Communication  Channel.  New  information  can  then  be added  and  the  auditor  in  charge  of  the  analysis  can  be contacted.",

Responsible communication\n\nFollowing  our  Business  Principles  and  as  a  technology, information  and  communication  company,  we  promote freedom of expression, pluralism and diversity, and assume a commitment to truthful information, education and inclusion.  As  a  company  dedicated  not  only  to  facilitating communication,  but  also  to  generating  entertainment, cultural,  sporting,  advertising  and  other  content  that  can have  an  impact  and  influence  on  society,  we  assume  our responsibility  to  promote  responsible,  ethical  and  quality communication in line with our Responsible Communication Policy. This Policy defines general guidelines for: communicating  with  our  customers;  communicating  with other  stakeholders;  using  our  social  networks;  generating content;  generating  our  own  advertising;  and  broadcasting third-party advertising.\n\nBased on this  Policy,  in  2019  at  Movistar+  we  developed  a specific Responsible Communications Code for this television platform.  This  Code  was  approved  by  the  Executive Committee  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Spain  in  2020  and  the  following lines of action were established:\n\n- \u00b7 Publication  in  different  public  media  for  consultation  by any user.\n- \u00b7 Implementation:  It  has  been  shared  with  all  Movistar+ stakeholders so that it can be accepted and respected in their  daily  work.  These  are  employees,  suppliers  and external collaborators, analysts, customers and society in general.\n\nPossible  complaints/enquiries  are  channelled  through  the Responsible Business Channel.",

It  is  regulated  in  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  Internal  Audit  Function  Charter,  which states that Internal Audit is the area in Telef\u00f3nica responsible  for  confirming,  through  timely  evidence,  the proper functioning of the internal control and risk management  structures  and,  where  appropriate,  detecting possible  inefficiencies  or  non-compliance  with  the  control system established by the Group through its processes. The main  areas  of  action  performed  by  the  Internal  Audit  unit include the coordination of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's Regulatory Framework by supervising the process of defining internal regulations and promoting actions that favour their updating  and  communication.  In  addition,  we  detect  the needs  and  opportunities  for  improvement,  modification  or\n\nupdating of existing internal rules, proposing lines of action to  those  responsible  for  internal  rules.  We  also  provide support  and  advice  to  the  internal  standards  manager  in relation to the drafting and implementation of the standard.\n\nIn  2020,  Internal  Audit  issued  503 reports  at  global  level, divided into the following categories:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Protection of minors:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe manage content responsibly and have preventive, safe advertising and awarenessraising measures.",

The Strategy is published on the corporate website and can be accessed at: https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/ responsible-business/our-commitments/taxes\n\n## Governing body approving the Tax Strategy\n\nThe  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  Tax  Strategy  is  designed  as  a permanent  concept.  Independently,  and  in  order  to  ensure that it  fulfils  its  purpose  at  all  times,  it  is  subject  to  annual review by the Group's Tax department and may be amended when  circumstances  so  advise,  subject  to  approval  by  the Board of Directors.\n\n## Regulatory compliance in the Telef\u00f3nica Group\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  committed  to  complying  with  all  national  and international  tax  legislation,  regulations  and  obligations, respecting  both  their  letter  and  their  spirit.  To  meet  this commitment, it dedicates adequate and sufficiently qualified human and material resources, takes appropriate measures to  make  a  reasonable  interpretation  of  the  regulations, taking  into  account  the  intention  of  the  legislator  in accordance with the interpretative criteria established by the competent  tax  authorities  and  case  law,  and  adopts  the necessary  control  mechanisms  to  ensure  compliance  with these regulations as part of appropriate business management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Relationship between taxation, sustainable development and business\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is committed to ensuring that all tax positions are taken for commercial and business reasons, taxed according to their true legal nature and economic substance, avoiding abusive tax planning schemes or practices. In this regard, the tax  component  of  any  transaction  cannot  be  justified separately from the commercial and business reasons for the transaction in question.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  also  applies  the  'arm's  length'  principle  in  its transactions  with  related  entities,  aligning  taxation  in  each country and territory according to its business there and the generation of value, in  accordance with local tax legislation and the international taxation standards established by the OECD.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  taxation  is  based  on  our  Responsible  Business Principles, which are a set of guidelines for our daily activities and  define  how  we  conduct  our  business.  Accordingly,  at Telef\u00f3nica  we  are  committed  to  acting  honestly  and  with respect for the law in managing our tax affairs, having been recognised as one of the top IBEX-35 companies in terms of fiscal transparency by Fundaci\u00f3n Compromiso y Transparencia (the Commitment and Transparency Foundation).\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  committed  to  complying  with  the  OECD Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises  to  ensure  strict compliance with its tax obligations. For all these reasons, it is and  will  be  a  benchmark  in  the  fulfilment  of  its  tax obligations,  guaranteeing  that  it  contributes  faithfully  and loyally to sustaining the public finances of the countries and territories in which it operates. To this end, and in line with our commitment to fiscal transparency and compliance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we publish our total economic and social tax contribution on our  corporate  website  at:  https://www.telefonica.com/en/ web/responsible-business/our-commitments/taxes\n\nIn  this  sense,  the  statements  contained  in  this  GRI  207 standard  enable  Telef\u00f3nica  to  achieve  some  of  the  SDG targets it has set itself.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Identification, management and monitoring of tax risks\n\nAs stated in the \"Tax Risks and Best Practices\" section on the corporate  website,  tax  risk  is  managed  at  Telef\u00f3nica  to prevent  and  reduce  tax  litigation  as  far  as  is  necessary  to defend the tax positions legitimately adopted by the Group.\n\nTo this end, Telef\u00f3nica has a Risk Management Model based on COSO (the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, of the Treadway  Commission),  which  facilitates  the  identification, assessment and management of the different risks.",

        "page_content": "Under this Model, the Group has defined four risk categories: business,  operational,  financial  and  legal,  and  compliance. Accordingly, the latter category includes tax risks.\n\n## Typology of tax risks and associated controls\n\nIn relation to their origin, risks of a fiscal nature are classified as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk: Relating to compliance with tax obligations  (filing  of  returns,  information  requirements, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Interpretative risk: The possibility of interpreting tax laws differently from the Administration's criteria.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory  risk:  Associated  with  legislative  activity  and regulatory volatility and complexity.\n- \u00b7 Reputational  risk:  Related  to  the  current  context  of demands and public scrutiny in terms of transparency and perception  of  fair  compliance  with  the  Companies'  tax obligations by the different stakeholders.\n\n## Identification, assessment and management of tax risks\n\nThe Corporate Risk Management  Model  covers  risk identification, risk assessment,  risk  response  and  risk monitoring.\n\nAlthough  risk  identification  is  a  continuous  process  and requires  the  involvement  of  the  entire  organisation,  in  the case of tax risks, the Corporate Tax department will promote and coordinate the identification and regular updating of tax risks at least quarterly.\n\nThe fiscal control, evaluation and risk management policy is outlined in the Fiscal Control Policy document, which can be accessed at: https://www.telefonica.com/\n\ndocuments/1258915/1261681/fiscal-control-\n\npolicy-2016.pdf/4227d388-765f-4521-7c7a-60ddebbb5b1b\n\n## Reporting obligations\n\nOn a quarterly basis, those responsible for the Fiscal Control function in each Group company shall inform the Group Tax department  through  the  regional  Tax  departments  of  the main conclusions of the process for identifying and assessing tax  risks,  as  well  as  external  tax  audits  and  the  inspections carried out by the tax authorities.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  also  has  a  regular  process  for  identifying  and reporting Group risks in its main operations. In this respect, those  responsible  for  the  Tax  function  of  each  subsidiary should  report  on  tax  risks,  including  information  on  the following issues:\n\n- \u00b7 Litigation in court/arbitration.\n- \u00b7 Litigation  in  administrative  proceedings  prior  to  judicial proceedings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Transactions  with  implicit  risk  that  may  be  examined  by the tax authorities.\n\nThe Tax department is responsible for reporting the situation and evolution  of  tax  risks  to  the  heads  of  the  Group's  Risk Management function (Internal Audit) (without prejudice to the specific identification of compliance risks to the heads of the Compliance function) and, as a last resort, to the Audit and Control Committee.\n\nFurthermore, as a consequence of the entry into force of DAC 6,  the  Group  has  developed  a  procedure  for  detecting  and reporting notifiable mechanisms.\n\nFinally,  on  an  annual  basis,  the  Group's  Tax  department reports  on  its  Fiscal  Governance  and  Control  Framework  to the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones Sustainability indices.\n\n## d. Assessment of compliance with the Fiscal Governance and Control Framework\n\nTogether with the Group's Tax department and the regional Tax  departments,  the  Internal  Audit  department  conducts any analyses and verifications deemed appropriate to verify the  correct  application  of  the  matters  contained  in  the Group's Tax Strategy and Fiscal Control Policy, as well as to guarantee the control objectives established by the Group.\n\nThe Internal Audit department will perform such checks on a regular  basis  and  may  request  as  much  information  as necessary from the subsidiaries' tax managers.\n\nThe Tax department will report the situation and evolution of tax risks to the heads of the Group's Risk function (Internal Audit)  (without  prejudice  to  the  specific  identification  of compliance  risks  to  the  heads  of  the  Compliance  function) and ultimately to the Audit and Control Committee.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  as  indicated  in  the  Annual  Corporate Governance  Report,  each  year  Telef\u00f3nica  validates  its compliance with the content and commitments of the Code of Good Practices and, therefore, that it is complying with its governance framework.\n\n## Reporting of unethical or illegal conduct\n\nAs  described  in  section  2.8.5.  of  the  Statement  of  NonFinancial Information, Telef\u00f3nica has complaint and remedy mechanisms  in  place:  our  Consultation  and  Whistleblower Channels.\n\nSuch  mechanisms  may  be  used  to  report  concerns  about unethical or illegal behaviour and the organisation's integrity in relation to taxation. For further information, please refer to that document.\n\n## Verification process\n\nThe verification of the content on taxes has been completed as  part  of  the  external  verification  process  carried  out  by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L.",

Stakeholder engagement and management of tax concerns\n\nRelationship with tax authorities\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is committed to fostering a cooperative relationship with tax authorities inspired by the principles of collaboration,  trust,  good  faith,  loyalty,  professionalism, mutual respect and dialogue.\n\nSince  2010,  and  in  order  to  apply  the  highest  standards  of fiscal transparency, Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. has adhered, by resolution of the Board of Directors, to the Code of Good Tax Practices drawn up by Foro de Grandes Empresas (the Forum for  Large  Enterprises)  in  conjunction  with  the  Spanish  Tax Administration.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  proposals  for  the  reinforcement  of good corporate tax transparency practices established in the Code  of  Good  Practices,  based  on  the  principles  of transparency and mutual trust, the Company has voluntarily submitted  Transparency  Reports  to  the  Spanish  Tax Administration since the 2016 financial year, pre-authorised by the Audit and Control Committee, as part of its functions delegated by the Board of Directors.\n\nMore information on this subject can be found in the \"Good Tax Practices\" section of Telef\u00f3nica's website.\n\nOur  approach  to  matters  relating  to  the  Spanish  Tax Administration  also  applies  internationally.  In  this  regard, Telef\u00f3nica  participates  in  various  international  forums  to promote and develop the OECD's best practice recommendations.  It  also  participates  in  the  co-operative compliance programme in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Contribution to legislative initiatives in the tax area\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  actively  participates  in  the  Forum  for  Large Enterprises,  which  allows  it  to  intervene  in  tax  legislation initiatives,  highlight  current  problems  that  may  arise  in  the application of the tax system and propose new tax measures to increase legal certainty.\n\nWe  contribute  to  the  committees  of  telecommunications industry organisations such as ETNO (the European Telecommunications  Network  Operators  Association)  and GSMA (an association representing the mobile industry).\n\nWe  participate  actively  in  various  industries  and  economic forums,  such  as  DigitalES (the  Spanish  Association  for Digitisation)  and  Adigital  (the  Spanish  Association  of  the Digital Economy).\n\nThe  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  also  actively  involved  in  tax  policy through the respective committees of the CEOE (the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations) and the DET3 (the Digital Economy Taxation Think Tank).\n\nStakeholder dialogue\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  stakeholder  engagement  strategy  is  based  on increasing  transparency  and  effective  dialogue  to  build relationships of trust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis relationship makes it possible to identify which aspects are considered most relevant and which are the new trends in  the  field  of  sustainability.  In  this  way,  we  set  our objectives, define the strategic plan and, in addition, assess our ability to meet society's expectations.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is in contact and actively collaborates with various non-governmental  organisations,  such  as  Intermon  Oxfam, F undaci\u00f3n  Compromiso  y  Transparencia and Fundaci\u00f3n Impuestos  y  Competitividad , whose  contributions  have shaped our goal of achieving the highest standards of fiscal transparency.\n\n## 2.2.4.4. Country-by-country reporting\n\nThe following is a breakdown of the jurisdictions in which the Telef\u00f3nica  Group  carries  on  its  main  business  as  a telecommunications  services  provider.  Other  jurisdictions where the Group is present and in which its activities are not the  Group's  core  business  are  included  under  \"Other\".  All amounts  are  given  in  euros  and  refer  to  the  financial  year 2019.\n\nThe main companies in the Telef\u00f3nica Group and their main businesses  can  be  consulted  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements 2020, Appendix I: Consolidation perimeter.\n\nFor  reconciliation  purposes  with  the  figures  reported  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements, consolidation adjustments and eliminations of intercompany transactions between  Group  companies  in  different  countries  are  also included under \"Other\".\n\nHowever, there are differences with the Group's Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  which  are  explained below:\n\n- \u00b7 The Annual Accounts only include information on sales to third  parties,  whereas  the  CbCR  also  includes  intra-group sales.\n- \u00b7 In  relation  to  profit  or  loss  before  tax,  there  is  an adjustment  for  the  accrual  of  coupons  corresponding  to the subordinated perpetual debentures in the Netherlands, and to a lesser extent in Colombia.\n- \u00b7 Differences  in  input  taxes  are  due  to  the  inclusion  in  the Annual Accounts not only of corporate tax (as in the case of  CbCR),  but  also  of  telecommunication  charges,  local taxes,  other  charges  and  licence  and  social  security payments, etc.\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  the  number  of  employees,  the  Annual Accounts refer to the total physical workforce at the end of 2019,  while  the  information  below  (given  in  the  CbCR) includes the average workforce for the year.",

The consolidated financial statements of the Telef\u00f3nica Group are drawn up in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The local accounting regulations applicable in each country in which the Group is present may differ from the standards set by the IFRS.\n- The table above groups together all the Group companies according to the country of their registered office. This grouping does not coincide with the distribution by segment of the Telef\u00f3nica Group. Where applicable, the results by country include the effect of the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The results by country exclude income generated by dividends of Group subsidiaries, as well as the change in the provision for write-downs of investments in Group companies, which are eliminated in the consolidation process. Tax withholdings paid to the various administrations have been allocated to the jurisdiction that ultimately bears the withholdings.\n- (2) Refunds received from different administrations and corresponding to overpayments from previous years are excluded, i.e. \u20ac1,048m in Spain, \u20ac10m in Chile and \u20ac17m in Peru. The last return on the list was not excluded from the non-financial information filed for the financial year 2019, as the information was not available at the time of publication.\n- (4) The number of employees refers to the average number of employees, distributed by tax jurisdiction.\n- (5) Tangible assets related to Central American countries are affected by the provisions of \"Note 30. Operations held for sale\" in the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "Reasons  for  the  difference  between  the  effective  rate and the statutory rate\n\nThe  group  closely  monitors  the  differences  between  the nominal  tax  expense  and  the  effective  tax  expense  on  a monthly basis.\n\nAt  year-end  2019,  the  differences  relate  to  the  permanent differences inherent in the preparation of corporation tax.  In other  words,  they  comprise  all  the  expenses  or  income recorded on the income statement that will not be deductible or  will  not  be  taxed  from  a  fiscal  point  of  view  and  will therefore never be reversed in subsequent periods. The most relevant are: the deductibility of the amortisation of goodwill in  Spain,  the  deductibility  of  the  distribution  of  interest (Juros)  on  capital  in  Brazil  and  the  non-deductibility  of  the inflation  adjustment  recorded  for  accounting  purposes  in Argentina.\n\nIn  addition,  during  2019  there  have  been  extraordinary accounting adjustments in the income tax expense account that justify a significant part of this difference. Accordingly, there  has  been  a  write-off  of  capitalised  and  unused  tax credits  in  Mexico  and  the  recording  of  provisions  for  tax contingencies  in  Peru.  In  Spain,  deductions  have  been capitalised  in  the  year  in  accordance  with  the  expected timetable  for  the  realisation  of  deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities. In addition, indemnity interest received as a result of  the  partially  upheld  ruling  of  the  Central  EconomicAdministrative Tribunal (Spanish abbreviation: TEAC) for the years 2008 to 2011 has been recognised in tax expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.5.

Clients\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis, our mission to \"make our world more human by connecting people's lives\" became even more relevant and therefore we have endeavoured to meet the needs of our customers and society.\n\nIn 2020, customer recommendation grew to 24%, 7 points higher than in 2019, which is a sign of their recognition of our efforts to maintain the best network and address their needs during the pandemic.\n\nWe have incorporated ethical and sustainability criteria as a further requisite in the development of new products and services through the Responsibility by Design approach.\n\n## 2.3.1. Introduction\n\n## GRI 102-42, 103\n\nIn  2020,  our  mission  to  \"make  our  world  more  human  by connecting  lives\" became  more  relevant  than  ever  before. Telef\u00f3nica  was  aware  of  its  responsibility  to  help  alleviate the effects of the health, social and economic crisis triggered by  COVID-19.  Evidently,  one  of  our  priority  areas  of  action was, and continues to be, our customers. Therefore, from the moment  the  crisis  began,  we  sought  commercial  solutions that could meet the new needs that arose out of the sudden change in our life styles.\n\nAnother significant milestone of 2020, which we will go into in  more  detail  later,  was  the  incorporation  of  ethical  and sustainability  criteria  into  the  design  and  development  of new products and services.\n\n## \u00b7 Materiality\n\nOur  challenge  has  always  been  to  meet  our  customers' expectations  and  build  a  relationship  based  on  trust. Therefore, ensuring responsible behaviour towards customers is vitally important for us and for our stakeholders: the materiality analysis highlights it as one of the  most  important  aspects  of  our  business ,  giving  it  a rating of 8.90.\n\nOver  the  course  of  this  Chapter,  we  shall  explain  how  we addressed  this  challenge  from  different  perspectives:  in particular from the perspective of our customers' experience, which we measure through quality and reputation indicators; and from the perspective of our products and services, into which  we  have  incorporated  the  Responsibility  by  Design approach.\n\n## \u00b7 Governance\n\nOur  customers'  experience,  the  quality  plans  designed  to improve  it  and  customer  satisfaction  measurements  are strategic issues for Telef\u00f3nica and are reported on regularly to the Executive Committee.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica has a specific Committee devoted  to Sustainability  and  Quality, which meets  11  times  a  year  to  monitor  in  detail  the  main initiatives developed in this respect at both local and global levels.\n\n## 2.3.2. Responsibility to customers: Our approach and performance GRI 103\n\nAt  Telef\u00f3nica  we  seek  to  build  a  long-term  relationship  of trust with our customers, whether they be the general public, SMEs or large businesses. That is why we work from all areas of the  Company  to  build  a  relationship  grounded  in responsible  behaviour  and  the  values  of our  Customer Promise : integrity, transparency and simplicity.\n\n## Values of our Customer Promise\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Simplicity\n\nWe offer products and services that are easy to use, and we are clear and direct in our communications.\n\nThe yardstick for measuring how successful our management  is  in  these  areas  goes  beyond  fulfilling regulatory  demands.  We  want  to  empathise  with  our customers and build a long-lasting relationship.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 crisis accentuated how important our  services  are. Among  the  general  public,  having  an Internet  connection,  or  not,  made  the  difference  between whether or not people could continue to work, shop, study or communicate  with  family  and  friends.  Among  companies, and  particularly  SMEs,  it  meant  being  able  to  continue operating remotely and keep the business running, or not.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Because  of  this,  in  2020  we  launched  a  number  of commercial initiatives aimed at alleviating the effects of the crisis.\n\n- \u00b7 For  example,  in  Spain we  froze  prices during  the lockdown  and  prolonged  discounts  until  the  state  of emergency ended.\n- \u00b7 We increased capacity at no additional cost :  In Spain, from 1 April Movistar increased capacity from 60 GB to 100 GB for each mobile line on the Fusi\u00f3n plan or on a contract data plan. We implemented similar measures in other markets.\n- \u00b7 In  Spain,  we  increased  our  entertainment  offering  at  no additional  cost, boosting  the  content , particularly children's  content  and  sporting  events , accessible through  the  Movistar+  Lite  app.  In  addition,  we  opened up the Movistar Junior app to our Fusi\u00f3n customers, with special free content for children.\n- \u00b7 For pre-pay customers, we multiplied by two all online top-ups  and  applied  a  50%  discount  to  vouchers. Similar  measures  were  taken  in  the  other  markets  in which we operate. We also extended the validity period by half a year for numbers whose top-up deadline lapsed during the state of emergency. In this way, we made sure that  these  lines  could  continue  to  receive  calls  despite them failing to meet the usual top-up deadlines.\n- \u00b7 We designed and launched free online courses for SMEs, with  a  twofold  goal:  to  help  companies  which  were  not yet online to launch their online business and to provide guidelines  on  how  to  improve  digital  positioning  for companies who already had an Internet presence.\n- \u00b7 For  six  months  we  offered  personalised  support  free  of charge for startups and SMEs in Germany, Spain and the United  Kingdom  through  the Telef\u00f3nica  Activation Programme . The support aimed to boost their technological solutions and accelerate their development through  IoT,  blockchain  and  Big  Data/AI  (artificial intelligence) technologies.\n- \u00b7 We  enabled priority  telephone  helpline services  for information (1004) and faults and breakdowns (1002) for the older population.\n- \u00b7 Finally,  we  placed  particular  focus  on innovation  and development for  technological  projects  based  on  Big Data,  IoT,  and  AI  that  contributed  to  monitoring outbreaks and ensuring safe de-escalation. These include projects  that  analyse  mobility  patterns,  implement temperature-detection software in stores to ensure safe re-opening  and  facilitate  beach  capacity  management during the summer, etc.\n\nCustomer experience: Quality and reputation indicators All  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  operators  conduct  monthly  customer satisfaction surveys to learn how our services are perceived. In  these  surveys,  we  ask  about  the  quality  of  the  network, the  commercial  offering,  the  customer  service  we  provide through  various  channels,  bills,  mobile  top-ups  and  prices,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\namong other things.  One  of  the  indicators  we  extract  from these  surveys  is  the NPS  (Net  Promoter  Score). This information  shows  us  whether  our  products  and  services meet or exceed our customers' expectations and whether or not our customers would recommend us.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is one of our basic commitments and we  have  therefore  included specific customer-related indicators  in  all  our  employees'  variable  remuneration:  the CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) up until 2018 and the NPS as from 2019.\n\nWe  have  been  monitoring  and  reporting  our  NPS as  a recommendation  indicator  for  our  products  and  services since 2018 and we calculate the Group's global NPS based on the  results  obtained  from  each  of  our  operators.  As  from 2020,  following  the  operational  spin-off  of  HispAm,  the overall  calculation  was  performed  based  on  the  results obtained from our four main operators only: Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and Brazil.\n\nThe 2020 - 2019 comparison, including this adjustment for countries, would be as follows:\n\n## NPS Telef\u00f3nica Group (*)\n\n|    | 2019   |   2020 |\n|----|--------|--------|\n| 17 |        |     24 |\n\n(*) Only includes the four main operators (Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and Brazil).\n\nWe closed 2020 with a result of 24% , up 7 points on the result  last  year, and  thereby  beating  the  targets  set  at  a global  level,  thanks  to  the  positive  performance  of  the  four countries  in  which  the  targets  were  met.  This  performance was particularly good in the United Kingdom and Germany, countries that significantly improved their NPS in 2020. The key to obtaining these results is found without doubt in the improvements in  network  perception  -a  factor  that  has  a significant impact on our customers' satisfaction- which is due  both  to  the  network  improvements  made  and  to  how well our network performed during the pandemic.\n\nWhen  broken  down  by  segment,  the  results  were  still exceptional for the year:\n\n## NPS Telef\u00f3nica Group (by segment) (*)\n\n|     |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-----|--------|--------|\n| B2C |     16 |     20 |\n| B2B |     33 |     40 |\n\n(*) Only includes the four main operators (Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and Brazil).",

        "page_content": "We improved by 4 points compared to the result for 2019 in the B2C segment ,  and by 7 points in the B2B segment . This  result  was  thanks  in  part  to  the  exceptional  measures taken  during  the  pandemic,  mainly  in  the  sector  of businesses,  which  were  able  to  keep  operating  owing  to connectivity.\n\n## Reputation indicators\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we have incorporated reputation as a key pillar on  which  to  build  a  vision  that  is  consistent  with  the Company's long-term plans.  This  KPI  allows  us  to  measure society's  (customer  and  non-customer)  perceptions  of  our overall  performance  and  its  expectations.  To  do  this,  we focus  on  four  key  features:  admiration;  esteem;  confidence and  good  impression  (the  RepTrak  Pulse\u00ae  model).  This model also enables us to identify drivers and define specific, practical reputation plans adapted to each country.\n\nThe consolidated RepTrak Pulse\u00ae score for the four main countries (UK, Germany, Spain and Brazil) in 2020 was 66 points out of 100, which is a 10 point improvement on the 2019 result .  This  increase  from  2019  is  essentially  due  to two factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Society's  favourable  assessment  of  the  important  role played by connectivity and all the measures Telef\u00f3nica set in motion in the fight against the pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Consolidation of the new  methodology,  which  was implemented in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Complaints\n\nListening  to  customers  and  resolving  complaints  has  a decisive influence on both customer satisfaction ratings and whether  they  would  recommend  the  service.  Therefore,  at Telef\u00f3nica  all our  operations  have  teams  that  focus exclusively on handling complaints, regardless of the channel through which they reach us.\n\nWe  are  continuously  working  to  bring  the  number  of dissatisfied  customers  down  and  reduce  the  number  of complaints across our operations as a whole.\n\nTo do so, we implement measures such as those given below in all the markets in which we are present.\n\n- \u00b7 We provide various channels via which our customers can  exercise  their  right  to  complain at  any  time,  24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The main channels are our call  centres,  online  channels,  social  media,  stores  and postal mail.\n- \u00b7 We  report  the  number  of  complaints  received  and resolution times to the competent authorities, as well as  other  information  required  about  the  quality  of  the service we provide, in accordance with the guidelines and parameters set by the regulatory body in each country.\n\nThe below table provides the details of our main operations, the corresponding regulatory bodies and the websites where you can find the information we provide:\n\nThis indicator has also been part of the variable remuneration of Group employees since 2019.\n\n## Regulatory bodies of the main countries in which we operate\n\n| Spain           | Secretaria de Estado para el  Avance Digital/CNMT                                             | https://avancedigital.gob.es/es-ES/ Servicios/CalidadServicio/Paginas/ Calidad.aspx                                                                       | https://www.telefonica.es/es/acerca\\_de\\_telefonica/ calidad/calidad-servicio                                                                                          |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United  Kingdom | Office of Communications  (Ofcom)/Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)                           | https://www.ofcom.org.uk/home https://www.fca.org.uk/data/firm- level-complaints-data-sortable-table                                                      | https://www.o2.co.uk/how-to-complain/complaints- figures                                                                                                             |\n| Germany         | Bundesnetzagentur                                                                             | https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/ https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/ DE/Sachgebiete/ Telekommunikation/Verbraucher/ RumitelBeschwerde/beschwerde- node.htm | https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/ Downloads/EN/BNetzA/PressSection/ ReportsPublications/2020/AnnualReport19.pdf? \\_\\_blob=publicationFile&v=1  (pag. 64-75) |\n| Brazil          | Agencia Nacional de  Telecomunicaciones (Anatel)                                              | http://www.anatel.gov.br/ institucional/                                                                                                                  | https://apps.anatel.gov.br/AnatelConsumidor/ DesempenhoPrestadorasHome.aspx                                                                                          |\n| Argentina       | Ente Nacional de  Comunicaciones (ENACOM)                                                     | https://www.enacom.gob.ar/                                                                                                                                | http://datosabiertos.enacom.gob.ar/dashboards/20003/ denuncias-y-reclamos/                                                                                           |\n| Chile           | Servicio nacional del  consumidor (SERNAC) and  Subsecretaria de  telecomunicaciones (SUBTEL) | https://www.sernac.cl https://www.subtel.cl/                                                                                                              | https://www.sernac.cl/portal/619/ articles-62164\\_archivo\\_01.pdf  https://www.subtel.gob.cl/estudios/indicadores-de- calidad-de-red-movil/                            |",

This aims  to  transform  and  standardise  the  way  in  which  we relate  to  customers,  creating  a  unique  DNA  profile  of excellence  in  customer  relations  and  in  service.  This programme seeks to offer the best experience at all points of contact,  from  customer  care  in  stores  to  call  centres,  sales managers,  technical  personnel  who  make  home  visits  and the  relationship  between  employees  who  have  no  direct contact  with  customers.  Some  of  the  initiatives  included  in this programme are:\n\n- \u00b7 DNA  Thermometer:  This  initiative  measures  customer satisfaction  in  a  digital  and  automated  format  in  the moments following their interaction at over 200 points of contact, generating several opportunities for improvement.\n- \u00b7 Root cause Analysis: Based on the results obtained in the DNA  Thermometer  programme,  this  initiative  identifies opportunities  and  problems  and  seeks  out  fast  and efficient  solutions  through  the  engagement  of  different areas of the Company by applying agile methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Projects  to  improve  our  customers'  experience:  These include work on our customer channels, improvements to the  Meu  Vivo  app,  which  offers  an  initial  level  of  digital service to over 16 million unique users, and digitisation of IVR for customers who prefer to call our call centres .\n\nIn Spain, the Service Quality report is published quarterly on the Telef\u00f3nica website, as provided for in Order IET/1090/2014  of  16  June  which  regulates  conditions relating  to  service  quality  in  the  provision  of  electronic communications  according  to  the  guidelines  published  by Spain's Secretariat of State for Digital Advancement (SEAD).\n\nAdditionally, at the end of 2019 we launched the Customer Project , which features two main lines of action: on the one hand,  a  thorough  review  of  which  Company  processes generated  the  most  dissatisfaction  and  complaints  and,  on the other, a review of our communications with customers.\n\nThe reviews of these processes resulted in the implementation of measures such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Projects  focusing  on  transparency  when  dealing  with customers (the introduction of pre-contracts, the implementation of purchase completion elements, improved  roaming  consumption  controls,  alerts  when promotions are ending, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Improvements to certain marketing policies, which led us, for  example,  to  eliminate  the  reinstatement  charge  for first-time  failures  to  pay  and  eliminate  minimum-term requirements in contracts.\n- \u00b7 A  review  of  our  complaints  policies,  which  led  us  to establish a new customer service policy that helped us to reduce  the  percentage  of  complaints  from  48%  in September 2019 to 28% in December 2020.\n\nFollowing our review of communications with customers, we strengthened  the  systems  that  deal  with  complaints,  even launching an automated system to identify the root cause of claims in real time, based on Big Data and AI techniques. This will  enable  us  to  implement  projects  to  reduce  complaints more dynamically in the short term.",

This  is  the  Customer Defence  Service  (SDC  in  its  Spanish  abbreviation),  an  area that is organisationally independent from any other business area,  and  via  which  customers can escalate their complaint to a more senior level if they have not received a satisfactory answer  from  the  front-line  customer  service  area.  The solutions  delivered  by  the  service  are  based  on  criteria  of fairness and independence and are binding on the Company.\n\nIn 2020, the Customer Defence Service recorded over 4,200 complaints  filed ,  an increase  of  1%  compared  to  2019 , thereby maintaining its capacity to manage this service even during  the  pandemic  and  continuing  to  receive  complaints sent by post despite lockdown.\n\nOf  the  complaints  received,  72% were  filed  online , 70% were accepted for processing and 86% were favourable , either partially or totally.\n\nAs  a  result  of  listening  proactively  and  analysing  the  cases relating to the complaints, the service identifies opportunities for improvement in the processes and actions of  the  Group's  companies.  In  2020,  some  of  the  issues brought  to  the  Company's  attention  centred  on  incidents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith  equipment  at  the  customer's  home,  fibre  technology faults  and  analysis  of  the  communications  sent  by  the Company.\n\nSince mid-2020,  in  the  interests  of  digitisation and environmental sustainability, the Service has been encouraging  customers  to  file  complaints  online,  leaving paper-based complaint registration and response communications  exclusively  for  cases  where  that  channel must  be  used  out  of  necessity,  thereby  endeavouring  to ensure  that  no  sectors  of  the  population  go  unheeded (elderly  people,  people  lacking  the  appropriate  resources, etc.).\n\n## 2.3.3. Responsibility by Design GRI 102-29\n\nIn 2020 Telef\u00f3nica systematically implemented the Responsibility  by  Design  approach  in  its  internal  processes for developing products and services. This approach enables us to incorporate ethical and sustainability criteria from the initial idea right through to delivery to the customer . In this way, we are looking to align Telef\u00f3nica's new products and services with its Responsible Business Principles.\n\nThe two pillars upon which Responsibility by design is based are ethics and sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Ethics applied to design\n\nWe  have  incorporated  into  all  our  design  processes  the values  that  form  our  Customer  Promise and  shape  the way we relate to our customers: integrity, transparency and simplicity. Thus, we ensure (1) we fulfil our promises on our promises,  (2)  we  proactively  provide  to  our  customers  all relevant information about our product and services and (3) we  do  so  using  simple  language,  avoiding  acronyms  and initials.\n\nWe also ensure responsible use and ethical application of the algorithms and data associated with our products and services, in order to avoid any possible negative repercussions from their misuse, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Bias in the data and algorithms.\n- \u00b7 Lack  of  transparency  about  how  the  algorithms  make important decisions or about the use of personal data.\n- \u00b7 Lack of human control in automatic systems.\n- \u00b7 False positives and negatives that could have a disproportionate impact on protected groups.\n\nThus,  since  October  2018  when  Telef\u00f3nica  published  its ethical principles regarding artificial intelligence (AI), we have applied these principles to all our products and services that make use of algorithms or data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Go to the chapter on Digital Trust\n\nSustainability applied to design\n\nThis  pillar  ensures  we  assess  the  possible impact  of  our products  and  services  on  society,  people  and  the environment.\n\nWe  ask  ourselves  whether  our  products  or  services contribute  to  improving  people's  lives,  whether  they  are accessible,  and  whether  they  respect  and/or  promote  our customers'  human  rights,  focusing  particularly  on  children and other vulnerable groups.\n\nA  crucial  area  of  responsible  design  is  that  of  incorporating accessibility into our products and services so that anyone, irrespective  of  their  abilities,  can  use  them  satisfactorily, safely and autonomously from the very beginning, especially when they are products and services with some type of web interface or app.\n\nThat is  why  we  are  incorporating  not  only  the  principles  of Universal  Design  into  our  developments  but  also  the  four principles of accessibility included in Directive (EU) 2016/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  when  developing any product or service. We also incorporate the recommendations  of  the  W3C  Web  Accessibility  Initiative (WAI), which are that products and services should be:\n\n- \u00b7 Perceivable,  so  that  users  can  clearly  distinguish  the information.\n- \u00b7 Understandable, so that it is clear how they should be used and what actions are required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Operable, so that anyone can use them.\n- \u00b7 Robust, so that the content can be interpreted by different technologies.\n\nIn  addition  to  accessibility,  applying  sustainability  to  the design  seeks  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  any  negative consequences of our activities and our products and services on  the  environment.  That  is  why  we  apply  ideas  linked  to ecodesign , waste management and the circular economy.\n\nThrough ecodesign we are not only pursuing a reduction in any  potentially  negative  environmental  impacts  from  our products  and  services,  but  we  are  also  seeking  to  enhance the  benefits  that  their  functionalities  may  generate  for  the environment.\n\nOur  work  is  based  on  three  basic  pillars  that  we  adhere  to throughout the life cycle of our products and services:\n\n- \u00b7 Design: When our products have any type of hardware, we prioritise manufacturing them with sustainable materials, we  include  energy-saving  modes,  we  opt  for  long-lasting design with a timeless aesthetic and updateable software, and we make them repairable.\n- \u00b7 Use: Connectivity and digital solutions have great potential for helping our customers perform their activities in a more efficient and sustainable way. Therefore, many of our IoT services  reduce  the  amount  of  resources  our  customers consume  (electricity,  water  or  materials).  Our  Digital Workplace  solutions  make  it  easier  to  work  remotely, thereby  reducing  travel,  fuel  consumption  and  CO 2 emissions; while our Cloud services reduce electricity use and CO 2 as they are housed in highly efficient data centres.\n\nIn the same way, we foster the circular economy through repurchasing terminals.\n\n- \u00b7 End of useful life: If there is a chance that our products or services  will  end  up  as  waste,  we  put  in  place  the necessary measures to manage them properly, informing our customers where to repair or recycle their devices.\n\nOur ambition is for 100% of our products and services to be developed  according  to  the  principles  of  Responsibility  by design as of 2022.\n\nTo meet this target, the implementation of the Responsibility by design model is managed on three levels:\n\nLevel  1: Awareness  and  training in  directly  affected areas and inclusion as one of the requirements within the Company's development processes.\n\nLevel  2: Support  from  experts , who  will  clarify  any queries or questions that may arise at any time, from the design stages to final delivery.\n\nLevel 3: The Responsible Business Office as the last resort in the case of issues which cannot be addressed by the team of experts.",

Measures to ensure customer health and safety GRI 103, 416-1, 416-2\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we do a thorough job of ensuring the security, proper  functioning,  accessibility  and  traceability  of  our products.  That  is  why  we  apply  all  protocols  to  make  sure that 100% of the products and services we market comply with  international  standards  and  local  legislation  for  each market in which we operate.\n\nIn  one  way  or  another,  these  standards  affect  customers' safety,  quality  and  experience  as  users and,  in  many cases,  we  go  beyond  legal  requirements.  No  breaches  of these regulations occurred in 2020 in any country.\n\nThus,  all  mobile  devices  sold  in  our  European  operations carry the CE marking in compliance with European directives on  electrical  safety  and  electromagnetic  compatibility,  etc. However, at Telef\u00f3nica we also require the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances, version 3) certificate from all terminal suppliers, not only for European markets  but  for  all  markets  in  which  we  operate.  This certificate restricts the use of certain hazardous substances (lead, mercury, cadmium, chrome VI, PBB and PBDE, etc.) in electrical  and  electronic  equipment.  We  also  require  the devices  we  sell  to  have  the GCF  (Global  Certification Forum)  certificate .  This  guarantees  that  the  connection with  the  mobile  network  works  correctly,  including  for emergency  calls. We  also  verify the SAR  (Specific Absorption Rate) certificate of  mobile  handsets,  ensuring that  none  of  them  represent  a  health  hazard  for  our customers.\n\nIn addition, we are particularly committed to the security of terminals  and  were  instrumental  in  ensuring  that  all terminals with Android operating systems sold as part of our operations  receive  security  updates  from  Google  for  two years, a period we will extend to three years as of 2021.\n\nAnd  as  Telef\u00f3nica  is  a  sustainable  company,  we  added  our own  grain  of  sand  with  the Eco  Rating, an  indicator  that helps end users to understand how environmentally friendly their  current  or  next  mobile  device  is,  thus  involving  our customers  as  regards  the  importance  of  caring  for  the environment.\n\nAs  for  the  rest  of  the  equipment  deployed  in  residential settings and with access to our fixed network (routers-HGUs, WiFi amplifiers-repeaters, Movistar Home, etc.), we comply, as in the case of the mobile devices described above, with all the  common  international  standards  that  apply  to  these types of devices, such as the CE marking and the RoHS, as well as the local legislation in each of the markets in which we are present.\n\nBut we also go one step further in our commitment to the security  of  our  products  by  directly  conducting  inspections and audits of our manufacturers as part of our E2E process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  this  way  we  guarantee  the  quality  of  the  installations, their  quality  control  processes,  the  use  of  non-hazardous materials,  safety  regulations  at  the  installations  and  the prevention of child and slave labour, etc.\n\nThe four main types of inspections we require are:\n\n- \u00b7 General quality reports (Quality System Audit).\n- \u00b7 General process reports (Quality Process Audit).\n- \u00b7 Supply chain analysis.\n- \u00b7 Pre-shipment inspections:\n- \u00b7 BoM check.\n- \u00b7 Validation of firmware version used.\n- \u00b7 Verification of labels, manuals, cables and PSU.\n- \u00b7 Verification of PCBA version used.\n- \u00b7 Verification of housing used.\n\n## 2.3.5. Technology: The ally of people with disabilities\n\nTechnology has become one of the main allies of people with disabilities. At Telef\u00f3nica we want to build a more accessible world, ensuring everyone has access to the benefits of the digital transformation . This objective is in line with our firm commitment to being a more inclusive company: 'We want to  put  the  customer  at  the  centre  of  everything  we  do, leaving no one behind.\"\n\nAn example of this commitment is Telef\u00f3nica's adherence to the Principles for Driving the Digital Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities promoted by the GSMA, which seek to close the digital  gap  for  people  with  disabilities  through  a  specific action framework for telecoms operators.\n\nThis  commitment  is  reflected  in  the  Company's  global commitment,  which  includes  the  development  of  products and services adapted to the needs of people with disabilities and actions to improve the accessibility of customer service and communication channels.\n\nIn  this  vein,  and  within  the  global Telef\u00f3nica  Accesible project,  we  are  seeking  to  integrate  the  Design  for  All concept into our value chain from the very conception of our products  and  services,  and  we  are  doing  so  through  the Responsibility by design project mentioned above.\n\nSome of the most emblematic solutions that the Company has developed to meet the needs of people with disabilities and older people are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Movistar+ 5S , a feature that allows customers with hearing or visual disabilities to access the contents of the Movistar+ television platform under a triple accessibility system: Spanish sign language, subtitling for the deaf and audio description. In 2020, all Movistar+-produced content was released with this feature.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Mapcesible , a collaborative platform on which people can map the accessibility of the places they have visited and consult scores to plan their daily journeys.\n- \u00b7 Accessible  terminals  for  ONCE  lottery  ticket  sellers , which incorporate text-to-voice conversion systems, special protection systems to withstand falls and adverse weather conditions, a more powerful scanner and bar code reader and a screen using the Braille system, among other accessibility features..\n\nIn addition to training and raising awareness among those working  in  the  areas  responsible  for  these  services, developing  technological  solutions  that  enable  access  to information  for  people  with  disabilities  requires  us  to  work with benchmark associations in the field of disability to gain a  better  understanding  of  the  needs  and  demands  of  this segment.  In  Spain,  we  work  with  Fundaci\u00f3n  ONCE,  Ilunion and CNSE, among others.\n\nAt the same time, we are working to ensure the same user experience for all our customers by improving the accessibility  of  our  online  and  offline  customer  service and  communication  channels .  To  this  end,  we  provided training on accessibility criteria for the teams working in key areas such as Communication, Marketing and Branding.\n\nAdditionally, we improved call centre accessibility in some of our operations. This is the case in Colombia and Spain, where our customers with hearing disabilities can now communicate  via video-interpretation. In Mexico, we included sign language and accessible text and audio in our contract formats.\n\nWe also adapt our stores  to  our  users'  different  capacities. Some examples are the magnetic loop service in use in stores in Spain and the United Kingdom,  and  the  videointerpretation service in stores in countries such as Chile and Brazil. In Argentina we have implemented and developed the inclusive customer care tool API, which uses an app to reduce the barriers to in-store communication with our customers. In  addition,  we  have  trained  our  operations'  salesforce  in specific approaches to serving people with disabilities.\n\nAs far as terminals are concerned, we provide information on the accessibility features of mobile devices in our catalogue. This  means  customers  can  identify  the  best  terminals  for overcoming visual, auditory, cognitive and dexterity difficulties through a set of icons.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.6. Network quality and availability\n\nIt  is  our  responsibility to guarantee maximum access speed and  information  transmission  capacity  24  hours  per  day from any device and place and in any situation.\n\nThis commitment was strengthened more than ever in 2020 as a result of the global crisis triggered by COVID-19 .  The traffic our infrastructures had to support increased by up to 50% at  the  worst  moments  of  the  pandemic  compared  to the traffic recorded the previous year on the same dates. Yet despite this we maintained our levels of quality and service when they were most needed.\n\nEducation, many  working  activities, health care and commercial  activities,  etc.  could  take  place  online  through our networks, demonstrating that our longstanding commitment to achieving one of the world's most efficient and developed broadband infrastructures was worth it.\n\nTo  ensure  quality  and  service  levels,  we  are  constantly evaluating and monitoring them, thus allowing us to respond immediately to any incidents that may arise.\n\nThe  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  defines quality of service as the totality of characteristics of a service that bear on its ability to satisfy the needs of a user of the service.  Our  commitment  to  our  customers  is  to  guarantee an optimal, uninterrupted service and always be transparent with  regard  to  our  network  status,  even  during  the  most adverse situations.\n\nConnectivity constitutes the basis of our business, which is why we invest heavily in quality, resilient infrastructures to ensure that every day more households have the opportunity to access the digital world.\n\nWe publish regular updates on the quality of our services and provide  online  tools  for  users  to  check  the  status  of  our networks in real time.",

Quality information and transparency\n\nIn line with this premise, we regularly report on the quality of the  service  and  the  network;  we  also  have  online  services that show the status of the mobile network in real time on our portals (see more on the Telef\u00f3nica website).\n\nWe are also aware that natural phenomena, external factors, power outages, etc., can cause occasional localised interruptions to the service. We are continuously striving to create  greater  resilience  in  order  to  reduce  the  duration  of these incidents.\n\nThe critical situations that have affected our service over the past year are the following:\n\n## Chart of critical situations by country\n\n|                | CHILE (LOCAL)  February 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Crisis         | Cable stolen (affecting Voice + Internet services)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Type of crisis | Cable stolen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Impact         | There was a growing wave of cables being stolen, impacting the copper network.

In  this  regard,  at  Telef\u00f3nica  we  are committed to putting transparency into practice by including it  as  one  of  the  principles  of  the  Global  Privacy  Policy  and developing different initiatives to implement this principle:\n\n## a. Global Privacy Centre\n\nThe public reference point for our global privacy and security policy and processes. It is where our stakeholders can find all the information they need easily and in a simple format by means of visual and graphic resources.\n\n## b. Operators' Privacy and Security Centres\n\nIn  2020,  new  local  Privacy  and  Security  Centres  were updated  and  created  on  the  commercial  websites  of Telef\u00f3nica Group operators. To roll out this project, we first conducted a study to understand our customers' perception of the use of their data. The study was the result of customer\n\nsurveys,  with  more  than  600  interviews  in  each  of  the  8 countries  covered  in  this  Report.  The  aim  is  for  both  our customers  and  any  stakeholder  to  be  able  to  obtain information, in a simple, digital and understandable way, on the processing of personal data performed by the operators, as  well  as  other  relevant  information  on  privacy  matters, such as the channels and means for exercising their rights, the  security  and  confidentiality  measures  adopted  to process their data and the privacy and security processes we adopt  from  the  design  stage.  These  Centres  also  include other  relevant  information  such  as  the  privacy  terms  and conditions applicable to our products and services, transparency  reports,  our  Artificial  Intelligence  Principles,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand the security and child protection issues that apply in all digital  environments. The Centres are currently available or in the process of being launched in 100% of our operators.\n\n## c. Telecommunications Transparency Report\n\nWe publish an annual report on the requests we receive from the  competent  authorities  in  the  countries  in  which  we operate  on  lawful  interception,  metadata  associated  with communications,  blocking  and  restriction  of  content  and geographical and temporary suspension of services.\n\nWe follow a strict procedure for all requirements as set out in the regulations in response to requests from the competent authorities. This also guarantees fulfilment of our obligations in  terms  of  collaboration  with  the  authorities  and  the protection of the fundamental rights of those affected, as set out in our Chapter on Human Rights.\n\nA total of  4,193,120 requests for customer information from competent  authorities  (lawful  interception  and  access  to metadata) were recorded in 2020. Of these requests, 36,598 were rejected, which means that 99% of the requests were executed.  The  number  of  accesses/customers  affected  is 6,025,744,\n\n## Client empowerment\n\nAs part of our principle of transparency, Telef\u00f3nica provides its  customers with access to the data they generate during the use of our products and services - data that are collected in  the  so-called  'Personal  Data  Space' of  4th  platform  and which are accessible through different channels such as the Transparency Centre in the Mi Movistar app.\n\n2020  saw  the  launch  of  the  Transparency  Centre  in  Spain, which offers all customers access to their privacy preferences  and  the  management  of  data  collected  in  the Personal Data Space, which is currently available to a group of  users  through  the  'My  Movistar'  application  (in  the Security and Privacy section of the User Profile).\n\nIn the Transparency Centre, through the Privacy Permissions section,  customers  can  manage  the  legitimising  grounds relating  to  the  use  of  their  data  for  certain  purposes.  The Access and Download section offers useful views of different types of data, with a user-friendly experience and in keeping with  privacy  criteria.  It  also  has  the  option  to  download  a document with further details of the datasets.\n\nOur intention is to have the Transparency Centre available in all channels by 2021. Our customers will be able to access it from the movistar.es online channel, where both functionalities  will  be  offered,  and  it  will  also  be  accessible from  the  television  for  the  same  groups  of  customers  who currently have these functionalities.\n\nThe  Transparency  Centre  experience  has  been  designed  to be  user-centric,  avoiding  complex  legal  language  and explaining the purpose for which data is processed and the nature  of  that  data  within  Telef\u00f3nica,  providing  clarity, transparency and reinforcing trust.\n\nThe Transparency Centre represents the next step towards",

Strategy\n\nThe  increase  in  the  number  and  complexity  of  security threats,  together  with  their  diversification,  leads  to  the constant application and management of security measures. For this reason,  we  believe  that  security  should  be considered  a  process  of  continuous  improvement,  and understood  as  an  integral  concept  that  encompasses physical  and  operational  security,  information  security including  cyber  security,  business  continuity  and  fraud prevention.\n\nThe security strategy is based on a number of processes and activities  that  reinforce  the  Company's  business  operating processes  and  transformation  initiatives.  This  group  of processes is encompassed in a security management system that  conforms  to  international  reference  frameworks  and standards such as ISO 27001 and NIST.\n\n## 2.4.3.2. Governance\n\nTo  achieve  effective  protection  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's assets,  including  services  and  data,  and  to  ensure  the necessary  resources  and  support,  it  is  essential  for  the Security  area  to  have  the  backing  of  the  Company's management  and  report  to  the  highest  level.  The  Security area  is  indexed  on  a  solid  organisational  structure  starting from  the  Board  of  Directors  through  its  Sustainability  and Quality  and  Audit  and  Control  Committees,  to  the  security structures in the local operators.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.4.3.4. Lines of action\n\nSecurity is one of the pillars on which the Telef\u00f3nica Group's global organisation is built. It is understood as a comprehensive  concept  that  aims  to  protect  assets, interests and strategic objectives, ensuring on the one hand integrity  and  on  the  other  removing  potential  threats  that could damage value, affect confidentiality, reduce effectiveness or alter operation and availability.\n\nIntegral  security  includes  not  only  physical  and  operational security (of people and goods), but also information security, cybersecurity,  information  technology  security,  network security, business continuity, fraud prevention and any other relevant  area  or  function  whose  objective  is  corporate protection against any form of potential damage or loss.\n\nThe security activities carried out by the different organisational  structures,  those  responsible  for  assets  and employees  are  governed  by  the  principles  of  legality, efficiency,  co-responsibility,  cooperation  and  coordination, for whose promotion, management, control and improvement  the  appropriate  mechanisms  are  to  be established.\n\nThe Company's Global Strategic Security Plan, reviewed and approved by the Global Security Committee on 26 November 2020,  aims  to  integrate  security  policy  into  the  broader framework  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  strategy,  and  identifies  and prioritises the main lines of action and associated resources; for  example, Security by Design and Supply Chain Security. In  2020,  security  measures  related  to  remote  access  and teleworking  were  reviewed  and  reinforced  due  to  the situation caused by COVID-19.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's main lines of action in this area are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Digital security or cybersecurity\n- \u00b7 Physical or operational security\n- \u00b7 Security by Design\n- \u00b7 Supply chain security\n\nDigital security or cybersecurity\n\nDigital security is a key element of our business. Its ultimate goal is to ensure our resilience, in other words, our ability to withstand and contain attacks so that our business is either not  affected  at  all  or,  if  it  is  affected,  the  level  is  tolerable. This is applied in practices, processes, tools and capabilities that aim to anticipate and prevent cybersecurity risks.\n\nGiven the current context of cybersecurity and Telef\u00f3nica's status  as  a  digital  operator,  special  focus  is  placed  on  the following processes:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## a.Cyber-intelligence and incident management\n\nWe  have  tools  and  capabilities  for  the  entire  cycle  of potential incidents:\n\n- \u00b7 Anticipation , before it can affect us.\n- \u00b7 Prevention ,  ensuring the protection of both facilities and assets, as well as customer data and identity.\n- \u00b7 Detection , through twelve Security Operation Centres.\n- \u00b7 Response ,  through  a  network  of  15  Incident  Response Centres (CSIRT) working in a coordinated manner at local and  global  level  to  resume  normal  service  as  soon  as possible and with the least possible impact.\n\nOur  approach  to  cyber-intelligence  is  based  on  a  proactive approach, applying knowledge and technology to achieve the required levels of protection by quickly detecting breaches or attacks  on  assets.  We  also  build  the  technical  and  human capabilities needed to respond effectively and quickly to any breach  or  incident  in  order  to  minimise  attacks  and  their consequences.\n\nWe  have  a  bug-bounty  programme  in  place  with  selected industry experts.\n\nWe  have  a  global  network  of  Incident  Response  Centres (CSIRTs) that coordinate to understand and analyse the risks of  potential  cyber-threats,  monitor  the  serious  bugs  in  the most  critical  technological  assets,  establish  relationships with  other  national  and  international  CSIRTs/CERTs  in  the public and private sectors, detect potential security incidents that  affect  the  organisation's  technological  assets  and respond to and manage security incidents.\n\nIn 2020, 1 single high-impact security incident was managed. We  consider  high-impact  incidents  to  be  those that  meet certain  criteria  determined  at  global  level  (e.g.  economic, legal,  service  or  media  impact).  In  the  aforementioned incident there was no leakage of customer data and existing response protocols were followed.\n\nLessons  learned  from  incidents  are  a  major  part  of  the feedback used in security improvement  projects  for processes and technological capabilities and platforms.\n\nThe  CSIRT  Network  CyberExercise  is  an  initiative  by  the global CSIRT that offers an evaluation, training and coaching environment  specifically  designed  for  incident  response teams.  It  involves  teams  from  Telef\u00f3nica's  international CSIRT network.\n\nWe have a global public mailbox via which users can report bugs  or  threats  that  could  affect  Telef\u00f3nica's  technological infrastructure. The mailbox is located in the Global Privacy/ Security Centre. There are also equivalent local mailboxes at each of our locations.\n\nSince  2015  the  Company  has  had  various  insurance programmes in place to soften the impact a large number of risks could have on the balance sheet. In particular, there is cover for cyber-risks that could cause a loss of income, loss",

The  current  global  insurance limits are:\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber-risks insurance: \u20ac 100,000,000\n- \u00b7 Technological errors and omissions insurance: \u20ac 300,000,000 .\n\n## b. Network security\n\nOur approach to networks and communications is based on a good  knowledge  of  our  assets  and  sites,  as  well  as  their characteristics  and  their  importance  for  the  business. Accordingly, our networks are properly planned and executed in keeping with applicable security requirements to minimise the risk of downtimes, unauthorised access or destruction.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's role as a telecommunications operator makes it essential to improve controls for the security of its own fixed and mobile communications networks and infrastructure and the associated service platforms (e.g. video, IoT). Accordingly,  the  aforementioned  security  processes  are applied in an integral manner to manage the risks associated with  attacks  and  the  exploitation  of  bugs  in  networks  and protocols.  This  involves  significant  activity  with  our  main technological  partners  and  international  organisations  (e.g. GSMA) to reduce potential impacts. Examples can be found in  the  work  done  on  4G/LTE,  SS7,  BGP  and  other  critical enabling technologies.\n\nIt  is  also  worth highlighting the importance of the evolution to 5G and the Company's position in actively contributing to making the new networks as safe as or even safer than their forerunners.  The  Company's  technological  developments  in this area, such as the evolution of our network virtualisation platform,  UNICA  NEXT,  network  splitting  and  new  radio access technologies are considering Security by Design.\n\n## Physical and operational security\n\nIn  the  field  of  operational  security,  the  Company  strives continuously  to  improve  its  capabilities  for  the  physical protection of  infrastructures  and  assets.  Accordingly,  it  has several ongoing programmes, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 The interconnection of control centres to create a resilient network that  reinforces  the  availability  of  infrastructures for surveillance and protection services;\n- \u00b7 The  management  of  travel  security  for  Telef\u00f3nica\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npersonnel,  which  substantially  improves  response  time and  mechanisms  for  dealing  with  incidents  occurring during a business trip;\n\n- \u00b7 The  implementation  of  consistent  digital  procedures  and tools for global security monitoring.\n\n## Security by Design\n\nImportance is placed on security from the earliest stages in every business area to make sure it is an integral part of the entire  technology  life  cycle.  The  approach  is  based  on:  the risk management and analysis process; the development of in-house  technologies,  which  make  a  commitment  to innovation  and  national  technology;  employee  awareness; and  the  security  requirements  demanded  of  our  supply chain.\n\n- \u00b7 Design  of  secure  systems:  Security  requirements  are  a consideration  from  the  design  phase  of  applications  and systems,  incorporating  controls  against  known  bugs  and ensuring that there are no security weaknesses at source. This  results  in  systems  and  applications  that  are  more resistant to malicious attacks.\n- \u00b7 Reception by management  bodies  of  consolidated monitoring  and  control  information  for  analysis:  The analysis  is  used  to  define  the  preventive  actions  to  be included  in  the  strategic  plan,  considering  security  by default  and  from  the  design  phase.  It  also  reviews  the aspects  required  in  the  Global  Security  Policy  and regulatory frameworks to take into account the appropriate considerations.\n\n## Supply chain security\n\nFor  some  years  now,  establishing  a  baseline  of  compliance with security requirements for our suppliers, and identifying the risks associated with the provision of a service/product, has been a priority for the Telef\u00f3nica Group. This is why in 2020 we continued to support and evolve the implementation of the Supply Chain Security initiative.\n\nThis year has been essential in this transformation thanks to the  creation  of  a  tool  called  3PS+,  which  allows  the  entire process  of  managing  security  aspects  throughout  the supplier  lifecycle  to  be  digitised.  This  tool  is  an  application that allows the user to have all the information related to the security aspects of a procurement process and its suppliers before  contracting,  during  and  after  delivery.  Its  main characteristics are as follows:",

Business continuity and crisis management\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Business Continuity function integrates various activities and processes aimed at improving the Company's resilience in all its aspects.\n\nIn  this  area,  our  priority  as  a  company  is  to  ensure  the following in the event of a crisis:\n\n- \u00b7 Protect the integrity of people, ensuring the well-being of employees and collaborators.\n- \u00b7 Provide  the  agreed  services  to  our  customers,  with  the agreed availability and quality.\n- \u00b7 Protect  and  look  after  the  interests  of  our  shareholders and institutional investors.\n- \u00b7 Comply with our regulatory and legal obligations.\n- \u00b7 Protect and secure the business from a sustainability point of view.\n\nThe  Business  Continuity  function  is  included  in  the  Global Security Policy. The details of this function are defined in the Global Business Continuity Regulation and in various pieces of  global  and  local  documentation  corresponding  to  each business unit.\n\nTo  ensure  its  continued  evolution  and  support  from  the Company's management, this initiative is included as part of the  Global  Security  and  Intelligence  Directorate's  Strategic Plan in the form of a Global Crisis Management Plan, which in turn  is  composed  of  the  Global  Crisis  Management  Project and the Global Business Continuity Project.",

Thus, with the support of  different entities, it was possible to provide personnel and resources to begin the recovery work. For San Andr\u00e9s, by the third day,  most of the island's services were restored, although due to the damage to a large percentage of the 2G radio base, work began  on a plan to modernise the island's mobile services with the implementation, by 31 December, of 10 new LTE radio bases. In the  case of Providencia, Telef\u00f3nica was the first operator to re-establish communications on Sunday 22 November at 7:00 pm.

Leveraging  internal  knowledge  of  technologies,  networks, systems and digital processes allows us to generate business opportunities and round out our digital service offering to our customers.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  cybersecurity  unit  is  called  ElevenPaths.  We make security more human and give people the confidence and peace of mind they need.\n\nIn 2020, ElevenPaths reached \u20ac448 million in turnover.\n\nAs  providers  of  intelligent  managed  security  services  in  a world  where  cyber-threats  are  inevitable,  we  cover  each phase  of  a  threat  -i.e.  preparation,  prevention,  detection, response  and  recovery-  to  reduce  attacks,  protect  digital assets and services, and thus ensure the cyber-resilience of our customers and their businesses. We anticipate the most sophisticated and frequent attacks.\n\nTherefore, we  need  to  be  increasingly  receptive to cybersecurity measures and redefine our strategy on cyberresilience.  To  this  end,  we  dedicate  all  our  experience  and efforts to creating innovative cybersecurity products in order to stay ahead of the attackers that have become a growing threat in our digital lives.",

To this end:\n\n- \u00b7 We work to develop new security services and capabilities designed  to  help  protect  businesses  and  people  from threats  and  bugs  in  the  environments  in  which  they operate.\n- \u00b7 We collaborate and exchange information about threats in real time with the main agencies and entities, such as the European  Commission,  the  Cyber  Threat  Alliance  (CTA), ECSO, EUROPOL and INCIBE.\n- \u00b7 We  manage  more  than  5  million  endpoints  and  monitor more than 16,500 devices  with  an  integrated  global  SOC operating  from  11 locations  across  Europe  and  the Americas.  Thanks  to  our  intelligent  and  automated platforms,  we  can  act  efficiently.  Telef\u00f3nica's  SOCs  have been strengthened by the formation of the world's largest telecommunications security alliance with Etisalat, Singtel and Softbank, which allows us to position ourselves with a complete portfolio  of  services.  We  have  experts  ready  to help our customers face new digital challenges in a world of uncertainty.\n- \u00b7 We have six Innovation and Development Centres in Spain, Buenos Aires and Miami, where the technology developed internally by ElevenPaths was born.\n- \u00b7 We  created  Telef\u00f3nica  Tech  Ventures  in  2020,  the investment vehicle for startups and companies focused on cybersecurity,  driven  by  ElevenPaths  and  Telef\u00f3nica Innovation  Ventures.  Its  objective  is  to  detect  disruptive innovation  in  cybersecurity,  especially  in  the  fields  of threat  intelligence , cloud  security,  data  protection  and artificial intelligence applied to cybersecurity.\n- \u00b7 Also  in  2020  we  invested  in  established  international companies  such  as  Nozomi  Networks  and  in  Spanish startups such as Alias Robotics.\n\nThanks  to  these  collaborations,  alliances  and  our  own experience, ElevenPaths is present across the security chain of  value  and  has  a  portfolio  of  comprehensive  security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) world, solutions for cloud  security,  identity  and  privacy,  anti-fraud,  industrial cyber-security, secure mobility, digital exposure, risk management and regulatory compliance. All this effort  has earned us the acclaim of being the leading industry analysts in the field.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.4. Artificial intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data are booming. They can be applied to areas as diverse as content recommendations, chatbots,  image  recognition,  machine  translation,  fraud detection,  medical  diagnostics,  autonomous  vehicles,  law, education, transport and logistics, to name but a few. They are  not  only  used  in  business,  but  also  for  social  purposes such  as  better  understanding  and  reducing  the  effects  of climate change, natural disasters, pandemics and migration.\n\nHowever, concerns have recently been expressed about the use of AI, in particular in relation to possible discrimination, the  lack  of  interpretability  of  algorithmic  findings  and  the lack of transparency of personal data used. To address these potential issues, Telef\u00f3nica published its Artificial Intelligence Principles in October 2018 and has since worked on their implementation through the following approach:\n\n- \u00b7 A strategic model (strategy) that gives a strategic vision of how  the  Artificial  Intelligence  Principles  fit  with  the Company's values and objectives.\n- \u00b7 An organisational model (governance) that  defines  the necessary  roles  and  the  relationships  between  them,  in accordance with the corporate structure, to implement the Artificial Intelligence Principles.\n- \u00b7 An operational model (lines  of  action) that  defines  the main  procedures  together  with  the  roles  of  those responsible for the tasks to be carried out.\n\n## 2.4.4.1. Strategy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  has  a  firm  commitment  to  human  rights,  as indicated  in  our  Business  Principles  and  our  Human  Rights Policy.  Technology  must  contribute  to  creating  a  more inclusive society and offer better opportunities for all, and AI can contribute to these goals. In order to guide the Company in  its  application  of  AI  and  Big  Data  across  all  lines  of business,  the  Executive  Committee  adopted  our  Artificial Intelligence  Principles  in  October  2018.  Based  on  these Principles, we undertake to design, develop and use artificial intelligence (1) in a fair and non-discriminatory manner; (2) in  a  transparent  and  explainable  way;  (3)  with  people  as  a priority; (4) with Privacy and Security by Design; and (5) with suppliers and partners that are committed to these or similar ethical standards in the field of artificial intelligence.",

The self-assessment explicitly addresses  the  potential  human  rights  risks  associated  with the  use  of  artificial  intelligence.  This  self-assessment  is embedded in a three-tier governance model supported by a wider  expert  community.  If  a  product  manager/developer (Tier  1)  has  concerns  about  a  possible  adverse  impact  of  a certain product  or  service  after  completing  the  selfassessment, these concerns will automatically be raised to a multidisciplinary expert group of the Company (Tier 2), who together  with  the  product  manager/developer,  will  try  to solve the problem. In case of a potential risk to human rights and/or  the  Company's  reputation,  the  matter  will  be escalated  to  the  Responsible  Business  Office,  which  brings together all  relevant  department heads at global level (Tier 3).\n\n## 2.4.4.3. Lines of action\n\nThe operating model describes the procedures for implementing the responsible AI approach in the Company's day-to-day  business.  Integrated  within  a  broader  vision  of Responsibility  by  Design,  it  includes  a  methodology  called 'Responsible Use of AI' inspired by existing methodologies in Privacy  and  Security  by  Design.  The  operational  model consists, inter alia, of:\n\n- \u00b7 Training  and  awareness-raising  activities:  Telef\u00f3nica  has developed  courses  related  to  AI  and  ethics  that  are accessible to all employees through the corporate portals and in three languages (Spanish, English and Portuguese).\n\n- \u00b7 The online self-assessment questionnaire: Each AI principle is put into practice through a series of questions and  a  series  of  recommendations.  The  questionnaire  is available online in Spanish and English, and is part of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's global Responsibility by Design initiative.\n- \u00b7 A  set  of  technical  tools  to  help  answer  the  questions:  As some of the questions in the questionnaire are impossible to answer  without  specific  tools,  our  methodology includes  both  internal  and  external  (mostly  open  source) tools.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Clients",

When we accept this, we will be able to integrate and adapt our long-standing educational  traditions  to  an  ecosystem  in  which  the analogical arm has lost its hegemony. It is not a question of inventing anything new, but rather of continuing to educate in values, accompanying and setting an example, generating spaces  for  dialogue  and  discovering  the  advantages  and disadvantages of our use of technology together. We need to learn that there are times for connecting to the Internet and times for connecting with other people.\n\nPrecisely  because  of  this,  and  because  Telef\u00f3nica  is convinced  that  it  is  people  who  make  sense  of  technology and  not  the  other  way  round,  we  have  drawn  up  a  global strategy  based  on  the  promotion  of  a  responsible  and intelligent  use  of  the  Internet  and  connected  devices  in  all areas  of  our  lives,  but  with  special  emphasis  on  the protection of children and teenagers.\n\n## 2.4.5.2. Governance\n\nThe  Sustainability  and  Quality  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. is responsible for the development of the Global Responsible Business Plan, which includes  the  responsible  use  of  technology  and  a  special focus on one of the most vulnerable groups: minors.\n\nReflecting  the  Company's  firm  commitment  to  this  group, the  protection  of  children  and  teenagers  is  set  out  in  the Responsible  Business  Principles  and  various  corporate policies,  such  as  the  Diversity  Policy,  the  Responsible Communication  Policy  and  the  Supply  Chain  Sustainability Policy.\n\n## 2.4.5.3. Lines of action\n\nOur  commitment  to  and  strategy  for  protecting  minors  on the Internet and promoting  the  responsible use of technology take the form of six lines of work:\n\n## Alliances with stakeholders\n\nEnsuring a more secure Internet is a task we cannot tackle alone. At Telef\u00f3nica, we work with sectoral and civil society partners to make young people aware that the Internet is an open  window  of  opportunity,  but  also  that  there  are  risks that need to be managed.\n\nIn this regard, we emphasise our collaboration with:\n\n- \u00b7 National law enforcement forces, as well as support for the different national reporting lines (Equipo Ni\u00f1os, Alianza por la  Seguridad  en  Internet,  Safernet,  Te  Protejo,  the  Centre for  Child  Protection  on  the  Internet,  Alerta  Amber  and INADI, etc.)\n- \u00b7 NGOs,  national  associations  (Pantallas  Amigas,  Safernet, UNICEF, Faro Digital, NSPCC, RedPapaz, Argentina Cibersegura, Nativo Digital, Brave Up, Colegium, Fundaci\u00f3n Tecnolog\u00eda  Responsable,  Mam\u00e1  Digital,  Asociaci\u00f3n  de Padres  de  Familia,  Fundaci\u00f3n  Ideas  para  la  Infancia,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nComisi\u00f3n Unidos vs la Trata, Fundaci\u00f3n Sonrisa, Aldeas SOS Ecuador, ChildFund Ecuador, Puntos M\u00e9xico Conectado, El Consejo Ciudadano, Luchadoras AC, Moders, Sin Trata A.C. and FEISS (Fundaci\u00f3n Ecuatoriana por un Internet Sano y Seguro), etc.).\n\n- \u00b7 Actions  with  key  stakeholders  in  the  area  of  online protection  for  children  and  teenagers  (Inhope,  Insafe, ANATEL,  AECI  Asociaci\u00f3n  Ecuatoriana  de  CiberSeguridad, CONNA, UNODC, Asociaci\u00f3n Ecuatoriana de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos, Red  de  Aliados  por  la  Ni\u00f1ez,  Zentrum  f\u00fcr Kinderschutz  im  Internet,  INAI,  ITAIPUE,  Red  Contra  la Pornograf\u00eda Infantil, Capital Humano Social CHS, Comunidad  de  Divulgadores  de  Conocimiento  Cient\u00edfico KUNA, Fundaci\u00f3n Habla, End Violence Against Children and Gobiernos, etc.).\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is also part of the following alliances to promote the  sharing  of  best  practices  and  specific  actions  for  the proper use of the Internet at global level:\n\n- \u00b7 Alliance  with  the  GSMA  to  combat  content  involving  the sexual abuse of minors.\n- \u00b7 The ICT Coalition.\n- \u00b7  Alliance for the greater protection of minors online.\n\nLocally,  the  Company  participates  in  numerous  working groups for the responsible and intelligent use of technology by  young  people:  Digitales  (Spain),  Convivencia  Escolar Working Group - Ministry of Education (Chile), TIC e Infancia Working  Group  (Colombia),  Generaci\u00f3n  \u00danica  UNICEF (Argentina), Accesibilidad y Uso de las TIC Working Group Ministry of Education (Ecuador), Internet seguro para todos y todas Working Group (Mexico).\n\n## Blocking of content\n\nIn the proactive fight against content showing images of the sexual  abuse  of  minors  on  the  Internet,  Telef\u00f3nica  blocks these materials following the guidelines and lists provided by the  Internet  Watch  Foundation  in  the  following  countries: Chile,  Ecuador,  Spain,  Mexico,  Peru,  the  United  Kingdom, Uruguay and Venezuela. Telef\u00f3nica Colombia does the same through  MINTIC  and  DIJIN.  The  procedure  complies  with network  neutrality,  the  right  to  free  expression  and,  above all,  current  regulations  at  all  times,  and  the  blocking  of content  is  also  coordinated  with  the  corresponding  police forces and other public bodies.\n\n## The audiovisual environment\n\nThe way people consume TV content has changed; however, it  is  no surprise to anyone that both children and teenagers make  increasingly  intensive  use  of  audiovisual  content. Screens also play a fundamental part in their personal, social and civic  development,  which  is  why  Movistar believes  it  is vital to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure  that  our  programming  protects  children  from potentially inappropriate content;\n- \u00b7 Establish  the  necessary  tools  to  make  good  use  of",

Some of the functionalities of the application include: children's zone with live TV channels; children's  series  on  demand;  videos  of  activities;  musical content; and parents' zone, from which families can carry out  their  desired  configuration  actions  -  parental  PINs, definition  of  the  age  range  for  which  the  content  will  be available (up to 4 years, from 5 to 7 years and/or from 8 to 12  years),  language  of  the  content,  consumption  times and/or time zone of use.\n\n## Products and services\n\nAlthough  we  firmly  believe  that  nothing  can  replace  the mediating,  educational  work  of  an  adult  in  the  responsible use of technology, when this is not possible, we will always have  the  support  of  technology.  To  this  end,  we  are committed to the  promotion  and  development  of  products and  services  that  help  families  successfully  face  the challenges of the digital world:\n\n- \u00b7 Parental  controls:  Vivo  Filhos  Online  (Brazil),  Qustodio (Spain, Chile), Control Parental Movistar TV (Venezuela).\n- \u00b7 Security  solutions  with  parental  control  functionalities: Smart WiFi (Spain).\n- \u00b7 Other  services  (anti-virus,  personalised  packs):  Conexi\u00f3n Segura  (Spain,  Argentina,  Chile),  O2  Protect  (Germany), Vivo  Protege  (Brazil),  Localizador  Familiar  (Argentina), Seguridad  Dispositivo  (Spain),  Seguridad  Total  (Chile, Colombia),  Seguridad  Total  +  Conexi\u00f3n  Privada  M\u00f3vil (Argentina), McAfee Seguridad Digital (Brazil) and McAfee Mobile Security Plus (United Kingdom).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Working together with our suppliers\n\nTogether with our suppliers, we evaluate the implementation of  the  basic  parameters  for  the  protection  of  minors, especially  in  the  field  of  security,  from  the  design  of terminals to operating systems.\n\nWe  ask  device  manufacturers  and  operating  system providers to ensure the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The  inclusion  of  mechanisms  that  protect  children  and teenagers  (parental  controls,  age  restrictions,  approval systems  for  the  installation  of  applications,  protection systems  for  purchases,  limits  on  the  use  of  applications and devices, etc.);\n- \u00b7 The  incorporation  of  self-monitoring  mechanisms,  known as 'digital well-being', to enable better use of devices and offer user options to reduce dependence; The provision of regular  security  updates  to  protect  customers  from  new risks  and  threats  that  are  constantly  emerging  and endangering  users'  data  and  privacy  while  extending  the lifetime of devices.\n- \u00b7 The inclusion of functionalities that help the user to reduce distractions  due  to  misuse  of  the  mobile  phone  at  the wheel (voice operation, muting of notifications, etc.).\n\n## Education and awareness initiatives\n\nWe  continually  talk  about  the  challenge  of  being  aware  of every technological development that appears on the market today.  This  does  not  just  mean  hearing  about  the  most modern versions of gadgets, the latest in robotics or artificial intelligence,  but,  because  each  advance  puts  us  all,  old  and young alike, before a new educational challenge, it means we need to know how to use technological developments to our advantage.\n\nBeing fully aware of the situation, Telef\u00f3nica is committed to developing training and awareness-raising initiatives for the general  public  in  order  to  facilitate  coexistence  in  an increasingly digital society:\n\nThe Dialogando portal is an example of this. The initiative has been  implemented  in  10  countries  in  which  the  Company operates and helps society at large to reflect on how we use technology in our daily lives thanks to resources prepared by a  committee of experts in different issues related to digital life.\n\nA hundred awareness initiatives have been carried out on the following  topics:  use  of  technology  during  the  pandemic, grooming, sexting, cyberbullying, the digital divide, cybercontrol and violence, tolerance on the Internet, digital well-being,  responsible  driving,  online  fraud,  data  privacy, digital  identity,  fake  news,  eSports  and  gaming,  digital leisure, etc. More than 166 million people have been reached through these actions, with the help of collaborators such as Club  de  Malasmadres,  FAD,  iWomanish,  Gonvarri,  Faro Digital,  RedPapaz,  Sin  Trata  A.C.,  Fundaci\u00f3n  Habla,  CHS Alternativo, NSPCC, among many others.",

Highlights in 2020:\n\n## Internet Governance Forum (IGF)\n\nOur Director of Public Policy and the Internet completed the maximum  three-year  term  as  a  member  of  the  Advisory Group  (MAG)  at  the  end  of  2020.  Its  main  objective  is  to advise  the  Secretary-General  on  the  programme  and schedule of the Forum's meetings.\n\nThis year we participated in the 15th edition of the IGF, held online for the first time in its history under the organisation of the United Nations with the theme 'Internet for Resilience and Human Solidarity', which highlighted the adoption of the Internet as a tool with which to address the crisis associated with COVID-19 and how to address the barriers that limit its adoption  and  have  resulted  in  increased  inequalities  most evident during the pandemic. Among others, we participated in the workshop #128 Global Crises and Socially Responsible Uses  of  Data  and  in  the  Pre-Event  #30  From  Principles  to Implementation:  Artificial  Intelligence  and  the  Role  of  the Private Sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internet Governance Forum in Spain\n\nThis  focused  on  the  debates  surrounding  digitisation  and sustainability in a post-COVID-19 world, the social benefits of data  use,  the  use  of  technology  in  the  fight  against COVID-19, its social impact and how to advance digitisation and  sustainable  development,  and  the  geopolitics  of technology. among others.\n\n## Global Network Initiative (GNI)\n\nWe  have  been  participating  in  this  multi-stakeholder organisation  since  2017  to  advance  the  protection  and promotion of  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy  in  the  ICT industry.\n\nTo  this  end,  we  reach  agreements  on  joint  strategies  and positions on the rights of freedom of expression and privacy. Several online events were organised this year with a special focus  on  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  use  of  tracking technologies  and  government  requests  affecting  the  rights to freedom of expression and privacy in different regions of the world.\n\n## Council of Europe\n\nWe are members of the partnership established in 2017 by digital companies, operators, sectoral organisations and the Council of Europe for the promotion of digital rights. In 2020 we actively participated in the working group established by the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Artificial  Intelligence  (CAHAI)  to prepare  a  preparatory  study  on  the  regulation  of  artificial intelligence in the fields of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, which will serve as a basis for a future proposal of the Council of Europe in this area.\n\n## Internet & Jurisdiction\n\nWe cooperate with this multi-stakeholder organisation that focuses  on  the  jurisdictional  issues  raised  by  the  crossborder  nature  of  the  Internet  by  facilitating  a  structured dialogue  process  among  its  members  to  enable  the development of global standards that facilitate transnational cooperation and policy coherence.\n\nIn  2020,  we  actively  participated  in  the  preparation  of  the regional status report on Latin America that was carried out with  the  Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America  and  the Caribbean  (ECLAC)  and  Die  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). It is the first and most comprehensive report in the region to identify the different policy  trends  surrounding  the  cross-border  nature  of  the Internet  and  how  it  affects  different  stakeholders,  such  as governments, businesses and civil society.\n\n## Cybersecurity Tech Accord\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  a  founding  member  of  this  private  sector initiative.  It  is  the  joint  effort  of  more  than  140  companies from  around  the  world  whose  main  objective  is  to  protect Internet  users  against  the  growing  evolution  of  cyber threats. Raising awareness among users about the adoption of  cyber  health  measures  and  among  governments  about the  need  to  adopt  responsible  cybersecurity  measures  are the other main tasks carried out by the organisation.",

Human Capital GRI 103\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, due to COVID-19, we have had to manage an unprecedented health crisis in which our priority has been people -ensuring the safety and health of the team- as well as caring for colleagues who have come down with the disease.\n\nDespite this adversity, the team has been more motivated and committed than ever. Thus, the eNPS indicator has risen 7 points compared to 2019, now standing at 65%, and peer recognition has increased by 44% globally.\n\nIn 2020 Telef\u00f3nica was listed for the third consecutive year in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, which distinguishes companies committed to gender equality through policy development, representation and transparency.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is immersed in digital disruption and over the last three  years  we  have  intensified  the  transformation  we started  some  time  ago.  As  part  of  the  efforts  made  on transformation,  we  have  reformulated  our  mission  and redefined  our  long-term  strategy.  In  this  context  of transformation, the motivation of people is emerging as the enabler of change and sustainable growth for the Company. To  maximise  the  potential  of  our  people  and  increase motivation  among  our  People  teams,  we  launched  a transformation  programme,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Way, to change the way we work and develop.\n\nIn  2019  we  made  steady  progress  with  implementing  our transformation strategy. The People 2020 agenda was also aligned with the Telef\u00f3nica Way. But this year the reality has far  exceeded our level of ambition as an area. This year, as we  moved  forward  in  delivering  our  strategy,  we  had  to manage  new  elements:  we  have  been  supporting  the creation of the New Telef\u00f3nica, a company for the next 100 years;  creating  new  legal  entities;  spinning  off  businesses and  people  from  many  companies;  working  on  Telef\u00f3nica's largest corporate operation, among other tasks. And we have had  to  face  and  continue  to  face  an  unprecedented  and world-changing crisis: the COVID-19 crisis. This has taken us into  uncharted  territory  and  demands  that  we  adjust  to changing  needs,  ensuring  personal  health  and  safety  and business continuity.\n\nOur  priority  from  the  beginning  of  the  COVID-19  crisis has been people -ensuring the health and safety of the team above all else- and caring for all colleagues who have contracted the disease.\n\nThe  section  on Employee  health  and safety details  the actions carried out within the Group to guarantee the health and safety of our teams as well as the action plan designed to  ensure  the  progressive  and  safe  return  to  the  different work centres.\n\nThis Chapter also refers to the impact that COVID-19 has had on the different areas of people management activities in the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\n## 2.5.1. Diversity and inclusion GRI 103, 102-15\n\nA core pillar of our internal transformation process is the management of diversity and inclusion. We need to have a diverse workforce and foster an organisational culture of equity, plurality and inclusion, where our employees' unique skills, abilities and ways of help us make the best decisions for the business.\n\nWe  firmly  believe  that  effective  diversity  management,  in addition to adhering to the principles of social justice, helps us  to  achieve  better  business  results.  To  this  end,  we  have designed  initiatives  aimed  at  fostering  the  inclusion  of diverse  talent,  so  as  to  attract  and  retain  high  potential professionals,  get  the  best  out  of  our  employees,  boost innovation  and  become  more  productive.  Only  in  this  way will we be able to empathise with our customers, understand their specific needs and innovate to meet their expectations.\n\n## 2.5.1.1. Diversity management challenges during the COVID-19 crisis\n\nThe context of the pandemic has made even more apparent the need to create safe, trusting environments and spaces, in which  the  Company  empathises  with  the  situation  of  its employees  and  where  employees  feel  comfortable  about being themselves.\n\nTo  handle  this  situation  of  enormous  uncertainty,  we  have worked  with  experts  and  other  companies,  sharing  best practices.  In  addition,  we  have  analysed  the  personal situation, commitment and motivation of our employees via the  regular  climate  survey  and  other  extraordinary  surveys during the periods of lockdown. Through these anonymous questionnaires,  we  assess  their  mood,  social  relations  with colleagues  and  managers,  and  issues  related  to  work-life balance. In particular, we have conducted extensive analyses of  jobs,  tasks  and  people  in  order  to  adapt  labour  standard compliance  to  teleworking,  thereby  facilitating  employees' ability to balance their work and personal life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.5.1.2. Governance\n\nWe ensure the mainstreaming of our diversity and inclusion strategy  by  including gender  diversity  criteria  in  the variable remuneration scheme for Company employees. In addition, we have internal policies and a structure of internal bodies  and  figures  that  ensure  the  involvement  of  senior management:\n\n## \u00b7 Governance bodies and figures:\n\n- \u00b7 Global Diversity Council , made  up  of  top-level executives.  Its  purpose  is  to  promote  and  monitor  the Company's diversity strategy.\n- \u00b7 The Transparency  Commission , made  up  of  the Chairman  and  four  senior  managers.  It  ensures  the presence  of  both  genders  in  the  shortlists  for  selection processes.\n- \u00b7 Chief Diversity Officer , a figure who supports the Board and the People area functions.\n- \u00b7 Diversity  Champions, who  act  as  internal  agents  of change in all areas of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Internal policies:\n- \u00b7 Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy , approved in 2017 by  the  Board  of  Directors,  which  seeks  to  ensure management free of bias associated with differences.\n- \u00b7 Policy on Appointments and Departures of Executives , which guarantees transparency and meritocracy  in  the  recruitment  and  promotion  of executive talent.\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors Diversity Policy , which ensures that  proposals  to  appoint  and  re-elect  members  of  the Board of Directors are based on prior analysis of needs, expressly encouraging diversity.\n- \u00b7 The  Supply  Chain  Sustainability  Policy , which  lays down the supplier's obligation not to discriminate against any group in its hiring, training and promoting policies.\n\nBeyond  these  corporate  bases,  each  of  our  operations  has different programmes and diversity plans that represent an indisputable  driver  for  making  progress  in  taking  the  best business decisions.\n\n## 2.5.1.3. We establish the basis for a successful strategy GRI 405-1\n\n## Committed to equality\n\nThrough  the  Global  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Policy  we guarantee  equal  opportunities  and  non-discriminatory,  fair and  impartial  treatment  of  people  in  all  areas  of  our Company,  without  prejudice  associated  with  nationality, ethnic origin, skin colour, marital status, family responsibility,  religion,  age,  disability,  social  status,  political opinion, HIV and health status, gender, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith regard to people with disabilities, through this policy we are committed to making further progress towards effective workplace integration, through technical aids and support to reduce and eliminate barriers for employees with disabilities, to ensure that they can participate in a work environment on an equal footing.\n\nWe  promote  equality  of  treatment  and  opportunities between  men  and  women,  as  well  as  between  all  the demographic  groups  present  in  the  Company.  For  this reason,  in  Spain  we  have  an  exhaustive  Equality  Plan  and Action  Protocol  for  cases  of  harassment  in  the  workplace. This  plan  is  backed  up  by  the  internal  reporting  and whistleblowing channel, through which all employees of the Group  can  report,  anonymously  or  in  person,  any  type  of discrimination they may suffer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Go to the chapter on Ethics and Compliance\n\nIn  addition,  in  2019  the  Company  signed  a  pioneering agreement with the most representative trade unions of the different countries in which it is present, by virtue of which it recognises  the  right  of  all  its  employees  worldwide  to disconnect digitally.\n\nDiagnosis and measurement as keys to progress\n\nAs part of this strategy, we monitor a number of indicators and  targets,  both  globally  and  locally.  Examples  of  publicly reported  indicators  are  the  number  of  employees  with disabilities, employees under the age of 30, the gender pay gap and the percentage of female managers.\n\nIn relation to the latter, in 2017 we set ourselves the goal of having  30%  female  executives  by  2020.  However,  the COVID-19  crisis  has  delayed  some  of  the  plans  in  place  to achieve this objective, and so we ended the year with 27.4% of women executives in the whole group - 2.6 p.p. below the target we had set ourselves. Even so, if we take into account leadership  positions,  which  include  executives  and  preexecutive positions, we do reach the target of 30% women, which  provides  an  excellent  starting  point  for  meeting  the initial target for women executives in 2021.\n\nEqual opportunities in recruitment processes\n\nBeyond  our  recruitment  and  remuneration  policies,  which stipulate  merit  and  ability  criteria,  the  specific  actions  and measures  designed  to  ensure  equality  in  recruitment processes merit special attention.\n\nIn  all  our  operations  we ensure  the  presence  of  both genders  in  final  shortlists  of  candidates for  internal  and external  recruitment  processes  for  executive  positions.  The aforementioned transparency committee monitors compliance with this rule.\n\nAdditionally, we encourage the recruitment of female talent, young  talent  and/or  talent  with  disabilities  through  the Talentum grants.  In  the  case  of  people  with  disabilities,  we promote  their  integration  by  supporting  scholarships  with",

In  addition,  we  have  specific  initiatives  for transgender  employees:  in  Brazil  a  formal  protocol  has been created for people in transition, while in the United Kingdom we have a tool to guide managers and directors who have gender transitioning employees on their teams.\n- \u00b7 In  the  area  of  disability,  Telef\u00f3nica  has  ATAM,  a  private social  protection  system  for  the  families  of  Telef\u00f3nica employees with disabilities and dependency. The association offers comprehensive expert advice and direct financial  support.  It  is  worth  highlighting  the  progressive transformation of its care model, which  is giving technologies  such  as  IoT,  cloud  computing,  artificial intelligence  and  Big  Data  a  greater  role,  opening  up  new opportunities for disability care.\n\nOutreach and awareness-raising: An ongoing challenge We  believe  that  education  and  outreach  are  the  path  to follow  to  become  a  more  diverse  and  inclusive  company every day. The value of differences, awareness of unconscious  bias  and  prejudice,  and  the  importance  of inclusive leadership are some of the issues we address during our workshops, manuals and online courses.\n\nFor  this  reason,  we  develop  specific  courses  for  employees and  leaders  based  on  the  premise  that  they  are  a fundamental part of ensuring inclusion within our teams. In addition, we have conducted mandatory diversity workshops for members of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  the  specific  field  of  disability,  at  a  global  level,  we  have\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npublished a guide 'Disability at work: everyone's responsibility', which supports professionals in their dealings with  colleagues  with  disabilities  by  providing  knowledge  of their diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe assume our responsibility as a social benchmark\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we are aware of our responsibility for progress towards a more equal, diverse and inclusive world. We want to  be  the  driving  force  for  these  values  in  the  societies  in which  we  operate,  leveraging  the  value  of  technology  to achieve it.\n\nAlong  these  lines,  in  2020,  we  worked  to  promote  the presence of women and young people in STEM careers and entrepreneurship  through  a  total  of  27 programmes  and initiatives.  Some  examples  are  'Women  and  Engineering', 'Step into STEM', 'Inspiring Girls', 'Technovation Challenge', 'Girls Inspire Tech' and 'Scale Up Women'.\n\n## We seek out alliances to progress faster\n\nIn  order  to  formalise  our  commitment,  and  boost  and  give visibility  to  the  scope  of  the  advances  of  our  Company  as regards  diversity,  we  have  joined  various  global  initiatives which seek to promote the economic and social empowerment of diverse demographic groups, in particular in the employment sphere.",

Adherence  to  these  principles  builds  on  our  previous commitment  to  The  Valuable  500,  through  which Telef\u00f3nica made four specific commitments to strengthen the weight of disability on the global agenda.\n- \u00b7 Telef\u00f3nica  backed  the  United  Nations'  Standards  of Conduct for Business to protect the rights of LGBT people, thus  becoming  one  of  the  first  telecommunications companies in the world to sign.\n- \u00b7 In  Brazil,  Argentina,  Ecuador  and  Colombia  we  joined  the 'Women's  Empowerment  Principles'  initiative,  prepared by UN Women and the United Nations Global Compact. In addition,  at  global  level,  we  joined  'Target  Gender Equality', a Global Compact-led programme to accelerate women's representation and leadership in business.\n\n## Awards\n\nVarious  national  and  international  indices  endorse  and recognise  Telef\u00f3nica's  strategic  commitment  in  this  area. Examples include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Bloomberg  Gender  Equality  Index  (or  GEI)  distinguishes the world's most  committed  companies  to  gender equality.\n- \u00b7 Equality  in  the  Company  Distinction  (DIE)  from  the Institute for Women and Equal Opportunities: Obtained by Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, S.A.\n- \u00b7 The Refinitiv Index takes a more holistic approach, ranking Telef\u00f3nica  as  one  of  the  most  diverse  and  inclusive companies in the world.\n- \u00b7 The  Financial  Times  recognises  Telef\u00f3nica  as  one  of Europe's most inclusive employers in its Diversity Leaders ranking.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5.2. Securing capabilities for the future\n\n## GRI 103, 404-1, 404-2\n\nThe  evolution  of  our  businesses,  the  explosion  of  data  and the technological evolution of our networks require us both to  attract  external  talent  and  to  develop  new  skills  within Telef\u00f3nica's people and teams.\n\nTo  recruit  talent,  we  are  committed  to  new  channels  to ensure the right profiles join us in a more global, digital and efficient way. In addition to the traditional mechanisms, we are  using  different  strategies  to  attract  talent  through technological  solutions  that  build  a  long-term  relationship with the candidates and simplify the recruitment processes. We have a very active  presence  in  digital  job  fairs,  forums, employability  round  tables,  social  media  and  universities with technological specialities.\n\nTo  ensure  we  have  the  strategic  skills  necessary  for  the future  of  the  Company,  and  to  ensure  we  leave  no-one behind in the digital transition, at Telef\u00f3nica we are gearing our  training  policies  towards  mass  reskilling  and  upskilling programmes to adapt and improve the skills of our people, ensuring  their  employability  and  improving  their  future prospects in the working world.\n\nIn  2020  we  launched  the  global  tool SkillsBank for digital skills  identification, via  which  all  professionals  can  assess their  assigned  skills  based  on  their  profile  and  even  add others they have or wish to develop. This makes it possible, through a digitised process and data analytics, to anticipate needs that will arise, recommend vacancies, propose training actions  and  prepare  new  content  -  in  short,  to  personalise development according to the profiles and interests of each person. We already have more than 10,000 employees with profiles  uploaded  to  the  platform  in  Spain,  Brazil  and  the corporate center.\n\nOne  best  practice  is  the  reskilling  programme  launched  in 2020 at Telef\u00f3nica Spain, which fosters a Company culture of learning to keep learning.",

COVID-19's impact on capacity development\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a shift in the distribution of in-person/virtual and online training. We have moved from 30% virtual/online training in 2019 to 92% online training in 2020. The redistribution and adjustment of training activities due  to  the  pandemic  has  meant  that  the  total  number  of training  hours  in  the  Group  has  reduced,  as  online  courses are of shorter duration than in-person courses. However, the number  of  training  actions  has  increased  significantly.  In 2020  our  professionals  completed  more  than  1,5 million courses, with an average of 13,3 courses per employee. That is an increase of almost 30% compared to 2019 data.\n\n## 2.5.2.2. Universitas Telef\u00f3nica\n\nUniversitas Telef\u00f3nica is the corporate university at which the employees of Telef\u00f3nica and other companies work on improving their transformational leadership skills, enabling them to better take on the challenges of the digital revolution in which we live. But Universitas Telef\u00f3nica is much more than that. It is no longer a place, it is an emotion. It is continuous learning. It is collective intelligence. It is the here and now. And with the difficulties of 2020 that we have been living through, it has been that more than ever.\n\nIn  2020,  Universitas  reinforced  its purpose :  to  accelerate Telef\u00f3nica's  transformation,  aligning  priorities  across  the length and breadth of its geography, through the greatness of its people. And it has once again made its mission real: to create learning experiences of the highest standard, surpassing  the  best  business  schools  in  the  world,  always with  relevance  for  the  employee  and  with  the  magic  touch that has characterised Universitas since its launch 10 years ago.\n\nFor  this  purpose,  we  have external  teaching  staff of  the highest  quality,  from  business  schools  and  specialised consultancy services of worldwide relevance, such as the IE Business  School,  IESE,  Oxford  Leadership  Academy  and Singularity University, among others.

All  of  this  is  carefully  coordinated  by our  in-house team , made up entirely of executive education professionals with extensive experience in developing high-impact learning interventions.\n\nIn 2020  we  undertook  a  major  digitisation  journey, virtualising  our  entire  offering,  with  a  particular  focus  on developing resilience, which is so necessary in the turbulent times  we  have  experienced.  We  have  delivered  25 virtual courses,  reaching  12,910 people  across  Telef\u00f3nica.  For  the first  time,  2,700 of  these  participants  were  also  family members  of  our  employees.  We  have  relied  on  more  than 100  internal  facilitators,  keeping  alive  the  Universitas Exponential community launched in 2019, which has allowed us to franchise our model in the Company. More than 5,500 evaluations have been carried out, with an average score of 4.5  out  of  5,  which  have  provided  us  with  valuable  lessons that  allow  us  to  face  2021  with  confidence,  as  that  is  the year  in  which  this  new,  more  digital,  ubiquitous  and democratic  Universitas  will  be  launched.  By  2021  we envisage a Universitas that is accessible to all and digital, in order  to  adapt  to  the  new  environment.  The  training  will continue  to  be  conducted  live  by  the  best  and  most prestigious teachers.\n\n## 2.5.2.3. Building the New Telef\u00f3nica\n\nContributing to the implementation of the Company we want to  be  over  the  next  100  years  was  a  key  project  for  the People areas in 2020, both in terms of relevance and intense activity.  From  the  operational  spin-off  of  HispAm  to  the creation  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Tech,  Telef\u00f3nica  Infra  and  FiberCo  in Germany, to the simplification of the corporate headquarters and  the  joint  venture  with  Virgin  Media  in  the  United Kingdom.  This  has  involved  a  profound  transformation  in existing units, the creation of new legal entities and the spinoff of companies and individuals from many companies. Just to  mention  a  few  figures,  the  creation  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Tech involved  the  installation  of  new  entities  in  8  countries  and the  transfer  of  more  than  2,000  people  from  23  different legal entities with different legal frameworks.\n\n## 2.5.2.4. Agility at Telef\u00f3nica\n\nIn the context of change and uncertainty in which we find ourselves, agility remains a key lever to becoming an organisation that is more flexible and adaptable to changes in our environment, as well as being more focused on delivering value to our customers.\n\nTherefore,  during  2020,  the  adoption  of  agile  ways  of working continued to be promoted in all Group units by the local  Agile  Offices.  These  offices,  which  combine  Business, Digital  Transformation  and  People  teams,  are  the  main drivers  and  enablers  of  change,  and  allow  agile  frameworks to  be  adapted  to  the  particularities  of  each  business  and aligned with the strategic priorities of each Unit.\n\nThe  adoption  of  Agile  is  now  a  reality  at  Telef\u00f3nica,  with more  than  400  teams  working  on  Agile  initiatives  in  all\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncountries,  including  Colombia,  where  45%  of  the  operation works in Agile.\n\nOne of the achievements of 2020 was the implementation of scaling  frameworks  in  the  most  mature  units,  launching more than 20 Teams of Teams (trains, tribes, value streams etc.)  structured around quarterly cycles, with targets based on Objectives and Key Results (OKR) methodology.\n\nIn 2021, we plan to consolidate the existing Teams of Teams and extend this way of working to more internal and customer initiatives, leveraging internal capabilities, local agility academies and cross-cutting communities of practice.\n\n## 2.5.3. Our people's commitment and motivation\n\nThe  commitment  of  our  professionals  has  always  had  a prominent  place  on  Telef\u00f3nica's  agenda,  not  only  in  the People area but also in that of our business leaders. In recent years, our indicator for measuring the engagement index was the  global  standard  'Climate  and  Engagement  Indicator', based on the average number of favourable responses in the annual climate survey (on a scale of 5). For years, Telef\u00f3nica has  been  consistently  above  the  benchmarks  of  this indicator.\n\nIn  2019  we  decided  to  adopt  the  Employee  Net  Promoter Score ( eNPS ), which  measures  the  extent  to  which  the Company's  employees  would  recommend  the  organisation by asking the question:\n\nHow likely would you be to recommend your company to people close to you as a good place to work? (1=Would certainly not recommend, 10=Would certainly recommend)\n\nIt enables  us  to  align  ourselves  with  the  customer satisfaction  measurement,  by  using  the  same  logic  as  the Net  Promoter  Score,  which  measures  the  percentage  of promoters  (those  who  award  scores  of  between  9  and  10) minus the percentage of detractors (those who award scores from 1 to 6).\n\nThis  result  is  calculated  directly  for  each  country  and weighted  by  the  number  of  employees  in  each  country  to give the overall figure. In 2020 we have achieved a result of 65%, which is an improvement of 7 percentage points on the 2019 result of 58%.\n\nThis is a very positive result, as external benchmarks indicate that  a  result  of  over  40%  is  considered  excellent  and  very few companies manage to score around 60%.\n\nOur challenge now is to increase our professionals' pride  in belonging to our Company even further, with the conviction that  their  motivation  is  the  multiplier  factor  driving  these results.",

Recommendation programme: Valuable People\n\n2020 was the year in which the awards were detached from the  programme  and  became  part  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  culture. Although  we  did  not  have  the  opportunity  to  see  much  of each  other  in  2020,  at  Telef\u00f3nica  we  have  highlighted  all those  everyday  heroes  we  have  around  us,  all  those colleagues  we  admire  for  being  challenging,  open,  reliable etc.  Or  we  have  simply  showed  them  our  most  sincere gratitude for being there and giving their best at all times. For this  reason,  this  year  we  reached  a  record  number  of 100,000 individual and team awards .\n\nThe recognition culture at Telef\u00f3nica in 2020 has exceeded our expectations and, once again, we have outdone ourselves as a team.\n\n## 2.5.4. How to assess effort: remuneration policy GRI 103, 102-35, 102-36, 404-3\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  is  fully  aligned with  the Company's  long-term  strategic  targets  and  focuses  on meeting  the  targets  and  being  a  driver  for  attracting, retaining  and  motivating  the  talent  Telef\u00f3nica  needs  to continue its transformation.\n\nThe variable remuneration of our entire team encourages growth through increasing operating income and the return on  investment  for  shareholders,  and  efficiency  through improving our OIBDA margin and generating free cash flow. Telef\u00f3nica  is  also  a  company  that  is  fully  committed  to sustainability; therefore, from  2019,  factors  such  as customer  trust,  the  trust  of  society  at  large,  diversity  and contributing  to  the  fight  against  climate  change  have  been given  weighting  in  the  variable  remuneration  of  our  entire team.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  offers  a competitive  and  fair  remuneration package that  can  be  made  up  of  fixed  components,  shortand long-term variables, as well as remuneration in kind and other  social  benefits,  adapted  to  the  local  practices  in  the markets in which it operates.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  a  company  that fosters  meritocracy  and equal  opportunities .  Therefore,  a  significant  part  of  the executive officers' total remuneration is on a variable basis, and payment is linked to achieving financial, business, value creation and sustainability targets. These objectives must be concrete,  measurable  and  aligned  with  the  Company's strategic plan.",

Telef\u00f3nica professionals are remunerated coherently with their level of responsibility, leadership and performance  inside the organisation,  and  we  encourage  the retention  of  key professionals and attraction of the best talent .\n\n## 2.5.4.1 Performance appraisals\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  has  a  worldwide  performance  appraisal  process for  all  the  employees  of  the  Group,  sharing  calendars, guidelines  and  tools  across  all  operations.  The  process  is coordinated  at  a  global  level  even  though  it  is  managed locally.  The  performance  appraisal  model  is  one  and  the same  for  all  employees.  All  Group  employees  who  are  not covered by a collective bargaining agreement are eligible to complete the performance appraisal process.\n\nConcerning  the  performance  appraisal  process  from  March 2019  to  March  2020,  out  of  all  the  eligible  employees, 72,985 professionals were registered on the tool, known as  SuccessFactors,  that  handles  the  process .  Of  these employees, 63% completed  the  process  successfully.  All these employees set targets, which they monitored over the year  through  conversations  with  their  direct  superiors,  and completed the process with a year-end review at which their performance  score  was  reported  to  them.  The  remaining 37% of  the  employees  registered  did  not  complete  the process  either  because  they  did  not  start  the  process  or because some of the prior steps were not completed.\n\nIn general terms, the results obtained are very positive, but it is  necessary  to  keep  on  moving  forward  in  order  to  get  all eligible  employees  on  to  SuccessFactors.  At  the  present time,  efforts  are  being  made  to  keep  improving  the information reporting systems to include information about the employee's gender and job category, by breaking down the details of the data from the performance appraisals.\n\n## 2.5.5. Pay gap and average remuneration GRI 103\n\n## 2.5.5.1. Analysis of the pay gap and average remuneration\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  focuses  on  clear,  transparent  communication when  analysing  the  salary  information  about  men  and women inside the Group. In line with the commitments made and  the  measures  adopted  in  previous  years,  Telef\u00f3nica continues to strengthen its processes in the areas of equal pay, diversity and inclusion.\n\n## What is the gender pay gap?\n\nThe gender pay gap is the comparison between the average total pay for men and the average total pay for women.\n\nThe result of this comparison is much more than a number; it provides  information  on  the  socio-economic  situation,  the labour  structure  and  the  challenges  faced  in  reducing differences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhy does the pay gap exist?\n\nSome of the reasons that help explain these differences  at Telef\u00f3nica are linked with cultural issues in the countries in which  we  operate  and  issues  specific  to  the  nature  of  the Company. Below we highlight some of them:\n\n- \u00b7 A higher proportion of men in leadership positions in the  telecommunications  sector .  At  Telef\u00f3nica  we  have had initiatives in place for years to drive and achieve the objective  of  having  a  higher  number  of  women  in management positions.  The  reality  is  that  there  is  still  a greater proportion of men who occupy executive positions in our sector. However, the trend since 2015 has been that of an  increasing  proportion  of  women  in  executive positions:  in  2015,  19%  of  our  senior  management  were women  and  in  2020  this  percentage  had  increased  to 27.4%.\n- \u00b7 An  increased  proportion  of  women  with  flexible working arrangements (reduced working hours, leave of absence  to  care  for  children  or  other  family  members, etc.). At Telef\u00f3nica we have numerous measures in place in this respect,  promoting  and  encouraging  flexible working arrangements that are extended to employees of both genders; 3% of the workforce benefits from reduced working hours. However, 7 out of every 10 employees who have a reduced working timetable are women.\n- \u00b7 A greater  demand  by  men  for  degrees  in  technical subjects  and,  consequently,  a  reduced  presence  of women  in  careers  in  the  STEM  group (Science, Technology,  Engineering  and  Mathematics).  We  have, therefore,  implemented  various  initiatives  within  our society  to  foster  improved  access  by  women  and  young people to STEM careers.\n\nHow is the gender pay gap calculated?\n\nWhen starting  the  analysis,  the  most  important  thing  is  to know how the comparison is made, what items are included and how  the  difference between  the  average  total remuneration of men and women is measured.\n\nAverage  total  remuneration  includes  all  items  related  to salary, benefits and other short- and long-term incentives.\n\nIf we compare only the average total pay between men and women,  without  taking  into  account  factors  other  than gender,  we  are  talking  about  the gross  pay  gap .  When,  in addition  to  gender,  we  take  into  account  country,  legal entity,  professional  category,  functional  area  in  which  each employee works, seniority and working time scheme (full or part-time), then we are talking about the adjusted pay gap .\n\nAs a consequence of the analysis that has been carried out and the improvement in the quality and quantity of the data reported  at  the  global  level,  additional  factors  have  been incorporated  year  after  year  that  allow  us  to  explain  the adjusted  salary  gap  in  more  detail.  The  objective  is  to continue identifying factors that support the possible salary differences between men and women at Telef\u00f3nica.",

(See details at the end of this Chapter).\n\n## What is Telef\u00f3nica doing?\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  annual  gender  pay  gap  analysis  aims  to determine  the  wage  gap  between  men  and  women  and  to identify  average  salaries  broken  down  by  gender,  level  and age. (See details at the end of this Chapter).\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are proud of the path we have followed in recent  years  and  the  commitment  we  have  taken  on  as  a company,  but  we  still  have  work  ahead  of  us  and  the responsibility  of  meeting  the  challenges  we  have  set ourselves.\n\nUnderstanding  the  reasons  behind  the  data  allows  us  to focus  our  efforts  on  better  addressing issues  of  diversity and gender inclusion . We will therefore continue to work on initiatives to improve  the  governance  of  our  internal processes.\n\nWe  will  continue  to  be  committed  to  measures  that guarantee equal opportunities for all, through selection and promotion  processes  based  on  criteria  that  guarantee transparency and objectivity.\n\nWe also have actions in the area of continuous training and professional development that promote gender equality and facilitate  the  incorporation  of  women  into  positions  of responsibility.\n\nWe  are  developing  and  promoting  the  pipeline  of  female talent and fostering a flexible working culture that promotes awareness-raising  and  outreach.  (For  more  details  see  the section on Diversity management).\n\n## At Telef\u00f3nica, diversity is what makes us stronger and\n\nmore competitive , which is why we will continue to work on actions to achieve a balance between men and women.\n\n## 2.5.6. Social dialogue GRI 103, 403-4, 407-1, 404-2\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica we are committed to the core standards of the International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  particularly  with regard to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in all our companies in all the countries in which we operate. We ensure that worker representatives receive fair  treatment  free  of  discrimination  and  that  they  have  all the  facilities  to  be  able  to  perform  their  representative duties.  In  both  2019  and  2020,  100%  of  Telef\u00f3nica's employees  were  covered  by  a  labour  framework  that regulates their working conditions.\n\n## 2.5.6.1. Trade union activity\n\nAs  a  company,  we  reaffirm  the  important  role  played  by trade  unions  in  defending  the  interests  of  workers  and  we recognise  the  UNI  Global  Union  and  the  European  Works Council as key partners in worldwide labour management.\n\nIn  the  same  way,  at  local  level,  we  understand  that management  of  Works  Councils  is  guided  through  policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  rules  established  by  their  legal  entity;  therefore  the procedures  to  report,  consult  and  negotiate  have  different meanings,  but  are  always  in  line  with  Telef\u00f3nica's  guiding principles.\n\nMaintaining  a  neutral  position  with  regard  to  trade  union activity  is  essential  to  ensuring  a  free,  open  environment which  allows  the  right  to  association  to  be  exercised.  If workers  wish  to  become  members  of  a  trade  union, Telef\u00f3nica  will  recognise  trade  unions  which  meet  the conditions regarding organisation under ILO Convention 87, and always in accordance with local legislation. In addition, we ensure that worker representatives receive fair treatment that  is  free  of  discrimination  and  will  have,  in  turn,  all  the facilities to be able to perform their representative duties. In addition,  all  collective  agreements  include  occupational health and safety clauses adapted to local legislation.\n\n## Outplacement programs\n\nSince  the  beginning  of  2016  there  is  an  outplacement program to help on the relocation of employees leaving the company. The program is offered to all employees who leave the Company well as a result of a dismissal or as a result of voluntary redundancy schemes.\n\nThe  programs  have  an  initial  duration  of  six  months  and consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Individual work sessions.\n- \u00b7 Group sessions and workshops.\n- \u00b7 Technological platform to search new job opportunities.\n\nIn  addition,  the  program  is  oriented  not  only  to  job  search, but also on helping those people who want to start their own business.\n\n## 2.5.6.2. Trade union coordination for COVID-19 return plan\n\nThe plan to return to work centres -in Spain, Brazil and the HispAm countrieshas been addressed jointly by Telef\u00f3nica  and  the  main  trade  unions  in  Spain  (UGT  and CC.OO.), as well as the UNI Global Union.\n\nThe global agreement reached in May sets the objective of joining forces and ensuring the collaboration of everyone to guarantee  the  health  and  safety  of  all  Telef\u00f3nica  Group employees at all times.\n\nThe  return  plan  establishes  teleworking  as  a  priority  and preferential  act  until  such  time  as  the  World  Health Organisation  (WHO)  and  the  competent  governments  or local  authorities  rule  that  the  pandemic  has  been  brought under control.\n\nThe  return  of  workers  to  the  workplace  will  be  progressive and  phased.

The  companies  have  negotiated  with  the  trade union  organizations  the  possibility  of  reducing  the  working day,  between  25%  and  50%  and  up  to  70%.  Since  May 2020,  a  maximum  of  13,650 employees  (in  the  month  of July) have been affected by this reduction in working hours, a figure  that  has  been  gradually  reduced  until  closing  in December 2020 with only 677 employees with a reduction in working hours of 25%.\n\n## 2.5.7. Work-life balance GRI 103\n\nTelef\u00f3nica understands that balance is key to attracting and retaining talent, and is committed to this. To this end, we are working  on  new  working-hour  organisation  models  that increase  commitment,  satisfaction  and  the  productivity  of our teams.\n\nWe have  made  great  progress  in  consolidating  teleworking models  in  almost  all  the  geographies  in  which  we  operate, relying  on  digital  tools  that  enable  secure  teamwork  and information sharing.\n\nThe  progress  made  so  far  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  has allowed  us  to  move  to  a  maximum  of  95%  teleworking activity during worse months of lockdown, taking maximum care  of  the  professionals  who  carry  out  field  activities  and guaranteeing the continuity of the business and services at all times. At the end of December 2020, the teleworking level is 70%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5.8.

Although  in  the  last  20 years  we  have  managed  complex  crises  resulting  from natural  disasters  (earthquakes,  floods,  hurricanes),  the current context exceeds any crisis known so far.\n\n## 2.5.8.1. How do we approach crisis management?\n\nSince  there  was  no  equivalent  precedent,  we  considered making initial decisions and then making adjustments as the real situation started to offer us further clues.\n\nAfter  the  first  months  of  lockdown  and  the  subsequent easing of it, we realised that this was not a sustained crisis, so  we  decided  to  adopt  actions  adaptable  to  changing realities in the short term.\n\n## 2.5.8.2. Action plan: objectives\n\nThe objectives of the action plan we designed are: to protect people, to support our customers  (ensuring service, customer  care  and  quality)  and  to  help  society  via  all  the means at our disposal.\n\nThe people elements of the plan were as follows:\n\n## Health and safety\n\n- \u00b7 We  produced  content  on  COVID-19  protection  measures and actions.\n- \u00b7 We relied on our occupational risk prevention staff and our healthcare partners.\n\n## Continuous communication\n\n- \u00b7 In  all  countries  in  which  we  are  present,  we  coordinated and  launched  in  record  time  an  occupational  health microsite  on  the  main  communication  channels  with employees (intranet and workplace).\n\n## Reskilling\n\n- \u00b7 We accelerated a plan focused on training in both the use of  digital  tools  and  the  management  of  remote  teams, with material organised in the form of webinars and online training sessions.\n\n## Tools\n\n- \u00b7 Transferral of up to 95% of the workforce to teleworking (performing  activities  that  can  be  managed  remotely), currently  70%.\n- \u00b7 Maximum  care  and  protection  of  equipment  during  field activities.\n- \u00b7 Training  support  to  ensure  digital  disconnection  and emotional health.\n- \u00b7 Employee surveys to ascertain the impact of the measures implemented and identify areas for improvement.",

Action plan: Steps for a progressive return\n\nActions to meet these objectives have varied throughout the different stages: lockdown, easing of lockdown and intermittent periods of return to normality.\n\nNo matter the stage, our return plan has always had people as our top priority, aligning our actions with the objectives of guaranteeing  the  safety  and  protecting  the  health  of  our employees, while ensuring business continuity.\n\nIt is structured into three stages , linked to clear milestones based on the evolution of the pandemic and criteria based\n\n## Post-COVID-19 employee return plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe time planning is different in each country and is subject to  many  variables:  key  indicators  of  the  country,  active Company cases in this location, conditions for return.

Content on health, safety and business continuity.\n- \u00b7  Courses  on  our  online  platform  prior  to  returning  to  inperson work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nData model for decision making:\n\nWe decided to choose a set of measurable key indicators in all  countries  in  which  we  are  present.  We  monitor  these indicators  on  a  daily  basis  and  assess  whether  we  need  to correct  any  decisions  on  in-person  presence  in  our  offices, customer relations or flexibility measures.\n\n## Quantitative data:\n\n- \u00b7 Key  indicators  at  country  level:  Cumulative  incidence  of cases per 100,000  people,  hospital  pressure,  virus replication rate and positivity rate.\n- \u00b7 Key indicators in the Telef\u00f3nica domain: Number of active cases,  hospitalised  cases,  recovered  cases,  quarantine cases  due  to  close  contact,  existence  of  outbreaks  in  a work centre.\n- \u00b7 The  Group's  internal indicators are recorded in a dashboard  on  Power  BI.  We  review  this  scorecard  on  a daily basis to make decisions.\n\n## Qualitative data:\n\n- \u00b7 We exchange experiences between multinational companies of similar stature to the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n- \u00b7 We  participate  in  forums  in  which  we  can  discuss  and reflect  on  the  best  ways  to  address  the  crisis  from  a tactical  and  operational  perspective,  including  spaces  in which WHO experts participate.\n\nThe processing and management of our employees' health data has taken on special significance. Coordinated teamwork between many areas (Legal, Compliance, Institutional Relations, DPO,  Digital Security, Physical Security) has made it possible to have real-time information with maximum privacy and security considerations.\n\nWe  have  a  protocol  for  data  management  and  deletion  in accordance with local data protection laws in each country. Our objective is to have real-time information that allows us to trace a positive case and identify potential close contacts to avoid contagion.\n\n## Current situation\n\nAs  regards  people,  we  have  made  a  major  effort  to  protect our employees by ensuring safe and healthy workplaces. The result has been a significantly low number of positive cases compared to the real situations in the countries in which we are present. In-person presence in offices, in countries where it was possible, was not the cause of an increase in cases. On a sustained basis over time we have seen that the number of active  cases  was  higher  for  employees  with  100%  remote working. During the easing process, we observed percentages between 50% and 70%.",

(1) To improve the quality of the data, we have reported data related to occupational diseases based on two criteria: 1. On the basis of\n- a global definition, based on the list of occupational diseases from the International Labour Organization (ILO); 2. On the basis of local legislation, regulations and rules, as in previous years. This distinction is necessary in order to understand the differences between countries, e.g., the employment regulations in the United Kingdom contain a larger number of occupational diseases (e.g., stress) than the rest of the regions in which Telef\u00f3nica operates, and therefore the rates associated with occupational diseases are higher in the United Kingdom. Additionally, in 2020 in Argentina, according to local legislation, Covid is being considered as an occupational disease.\n- (2) Based on the list of occupational diseases from the ILO.\n- (3) Based on the list of occupational diseases in local legislation, regulations and rules.\n- (4) In 2019 and 2020, HispAm comprised: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, M\u00e9xico, Per\u00fa, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n- (5) Not including deaths.\n\n## Health and Safety Management Systems in 2020\n\n| Indicators (*)                                                                 | Total  Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                                | (%)            |\n| Health and Safety management systems implemented and certified under ISO 45001 | 49%            |\n| Safety and Health management systems implemented without certification         | 50%            |\n| Health and Safety management systems implemented                               | 99%            |\n\n(*) The indicators (calculated on the basis of the physical workforce by region) reflect the percentage of employees covered by a certified Health and Safety management system (ISO 45001 standard, or in the case of the United Kingdom, which also has more than one certification), or with a management system in place but not certified.\n\n99% indicates the sum of the percentage of employees who are covered by a certified or uncertified management system.",

Factors such as country, occupational category, functional area in which the employee works, seniority, legal entity and working time pattern (full-time or part-time).\n\n## Calculation of the pay gap\n\nTo calculate the gross pay gap, the average total remuneration of men minus the average total remuneration of women was divided by the average total remuneration of men.\n\nThe average total remuneration includes all pay items paid during the year under analysis. These remuneration items are:\n\n- \u203a\u203a Annualised Base Salary\n- \u203a\u203a Short-term Variable Remuneration: Bonuses, commissions, commercial incentives and other variable remuneration items paid.\n- \u203a\u203a Benefits in kind, including social benefits, accrued in the year.\n- \u203a\u203a Long-term variable remuneration: Incentives (shares) paid. The scope of this analysis considers all active employees of the Telef\u00f3nica Group at 31 December of the corresponding year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Suppliers\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nWe work together with our suppliers to ensure the smooth functioning of the network, customer connectivity and high standards of sustainability in our supply chain.\n\nWe help our SMEs during the difficult times arising as a result of the coronavirus, for example, through advance payment of their invoices.\n\nWe collaborate with other Telcos on industry initiatives to enhance our positive impact on the sustainable transformation of the ICT supply chain as a whole.\n\n## 2.6.1. Introduction\n\n## GRI 103, 102-9, 204-1, 308-1, 414-1\n\nIdentifying  and  managing  risks  in  the  supply  chain  is  an inherent  responsibility  for  every  company,  but  is  of  even greater  significance  for  large  companies  in  the  ICT  sector, where many of the sustainability risks are not in a company's own  operations  but  in  its  supply  chain.  Thus,  while  taking care  of  its  own  employees,  Telef\u00f3nica  works  with  its suppliers to achieve high standards of social and environmental  management,  promoting  and  monitoring respect  for  human  rights.  These  standards  have  become even more important during the current global pandemic.\n\nThis new reality has meant that we are all having to face a continuous  situation  of  uncertainty,  and  are  adapting  our management  models  to  cope  with  different  scenarios depending  on  the  country.  Therefore  from  the  very beginning of the pandemic, in order to guarantee supplies we have  been  continuously  monitoring  the  stocks  in  our warehouses  with  a  special  focus  on  the  ability  of  our suppliers  to  keep  their  delivery  commitments  despite  the\n\ndifficult situation they have been facing, and always ensuring that  they  comply  with  social  and  environmental  standards. We  have  also  been  working  closely  with  our  service providers, who support us directly to ensure connectivity for our  customers  (via  network  deployment  and  maintenance, call centres, customer premises, etc.) so that at such critical times  they  have  access  to  the  benefits  of  digitisation,  but with special care for anti-COVID-19 practices in all provision activities.\n\nFor  these  reasons  we  continue  to  apply  a  procurement management  model  for  the  entire  Company  that  is characterised  by  global  purchasing  management  from Telef\u00f3nica  Global  Services  in  coordination  with  the  local purchasing teams in each country. The model is aligned with our  Business  Principles  and  is  based  on  transparency, equality of opportunities, objective decision-making and the sustainable  management  of  our  supply  chain.  All  the necessary  information  is  available  to  suppliers  on  our Supplier Portal (https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/ about\\_telefonica/suppliers).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Strategy and governance\n\nGRI 103, 102-9, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's purchasing strategy is mainly based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Global  management  by  Telef\u00f3nica  Global  Services,  an organisation  that  leads  negotiations  for  products  and services that require greater specialisation/technical knowledge  and  proximity  to  the  business.  Telef\u00f3nica Global Services is supported by the operators' purchasing teams, which help them anticipate demand and supervise contract execution and supplier performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Supplier diversity, which entails anticipating and preventing risks throughout the supply chain - a concept that has become particularly relevant in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Internal and external efficiency, supported by the digitisation and simplification of all source-to-pay processes.\n\nThis  is  complemented  by  a  commitment  to  sustainability that is present throughout our supplier relationship processes and is developed under our sustainable management  model.  It  is  also  part  of  our  Responsible Business Plan, which is approved by the Board of Directors and implemented under supervision of the Sustainability and Quality Committee.\n\nAs  part  of  our  sustainable  management  model,  we  pay special attention to supply chain issues with a high social and environmental impact.

Initially,  securing  the  necessary supplies  to  meet  our  needs,  both  internally  and externally, required us to focus our efforts on factories and logistics services in the most affected geographical  areas  as  the  pandemic  progressed  and borders began to close.\n\nWe  also  brought  forward  the  payment  of  our  SMEs' May and June invoices to April in order to help these companies, which were having cash flow difficulties as a  result  of  the  crisis  generated  by  the  coronavirus outbreak.  In  Spain  alone  this  measure  affected  more than 200 suppliers and involved more than \u20ac20 million for more than 3,300 invoices.\n\nDuring  the  year,  the  lockdowns  put  in  place  by  the different governments made connectivity an essential service for preventing people from being isolated and at the same time allowing them to perform their jobs remotely. To this end, we have been working with our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsuppliers to ensure our customers' connectivity, while always  preserving  the  health  of  their  employees.  We shared  our  internal  COVID-19  health  and  safety protocols  with  our  contractors  and  subcontractors who  had  to  work  on  the  streets,  in  stores  or  at  our customers'  homes.  We  supported  our  call  centre service providers by promoting extensive teleworking among their employees.\n\nThrough  our  audits,  we  have  incorporated  specific controls into our risk management to verify compliance  with  the  new  protocols  established  in respect  of  the  coronavirus  (labour  standards,  but especially occupational health and safety aspects).\n\n## 2.6.3.

Minimum standards required\n\nWe  require  100%  of  our  suppliers to  conduct  their activities  under  similar  ethical  standards  to  ours.  This requirement ensures  respect  for  core  human  and  labour rights and protection of the environment .\n\nTherefore, all Telef\u00f3nica suppliers must accept the following when they register and/or renew on the Supplier Portal:\n\n- \u00b7 The Supply Chain Sustainability Policy;\n- \u00b7 General conditions for the supply of goods and services;\n- \u00b7 The Anti-Corruption Policy (certified).\n\nPrior  acceptance  of  these  minimum  conditions  means  that successful  suppliers  are  evaluated  in  relation  to  the  social and environmental impacts set out in our regulations.\n\nWe  have  a  new  version  of  our  Supply  Chain  Sustainability Policy, which was approved by our Board of Directors in early 2020. In it, we have incorporated new relevant aspects and reinforced  some  of  the  existing  ones  on  human  rights, violence and harassment in the workplace, use of refrigerant gases,  reduction  of  single-use  plastics,  diversity,  nondiscrimination, freedom of expression, etc. They are all part of  the  Minimum  Responsible  Business  Criteria  that  each  of our suppliers must meet and implement in their own supply chain.",

Identification of high-risk suppliers We focus on those suppliers that are most relevant in terms of  their  level  of  risk  and  the  impact  they  have  on  our business, given the volume of purchases awarded.\n\nIn  accordance  with  our  risk  analysis  methodology,  we perform  the  following  evaluation  to  analyse  the overall sustainability risk of our suppliers :\n\n- \u00b7 First criterion: An initial assessment of the possible level of risk  is  made  based  on  the following specific aspects of sustainability  in  our  supply  chain ,  as  set  out  in  our Minimum  Responsible Business Criteria : working conditions,  health  and  safety,  environmental  processes, human  rights  (child/forced  labour),  conflict  minerals, privacy and data protection and customer promise.\n- \u00b7 Second criterion: An analysis of the potential risk is then performed, taking into account the origin of the service or product (and its components). In this analysis we also now incorporate  the  impact  of  potential  risks  associated with the current pandemic by country of origin.\n- \u00b7 Third criterion: Finally, we assess the potential impact on Telef\u00f3nica's  reputation , should  the  analysed  risks materialise .\n\nTaking this global risk analysis into account, we have 1,700 suppliers that provide us with products or services identified as potentially high risk in terms of sustainability .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStep 3. Evaluation of our suppliers' performance In  the  next  step,  we  check  possible  financial  and  nonfinancial  risks  associated  with  those  potential  high-risk suppliers identified in the initial analysis. To do this we rely on two external tools that are integrated into our purchasing platform. They allow our customers in the different countries to consult the information provided online. These tools are:\n\n## \u00b7 EcoVadis:\n\nWe  evaluate  the  overall  sustainability  performance  of  our main  high-risk  suppliers  via  the  EcoVadis  self-assessment platform,  which  provides  a  360\u00b0 evaluation  based  on  21 sustainability criteria that cover ethical, social, environmental  and  supply  chain  management  aspects, including conflict minerals.\n\n## Performance-based actions\n\n| Performance  sustainability                                                                                                           | Action            | Action       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| LEADING \u00b7                                                                                                                             |                   |              |\n| Collaborate with the supplier to identify  possible improvements or share best  practices.                                            | ADVANCED MODERATE |              |\n| \u00b7 Request a commitment from the supplier  to implement an improvement plan in  the coming year, with the aim of  exceeding 44 points. | PARTIAL           | PARTIAL      |\n| \u00b7 Preventive blocking of the supplier in the purchasing system.                                                                       | INSUFFICIENT      | INSUFFICIENT |\n\nBy the end of the year, we had assessed a total of 1,157 suppliers according to sustainability aspects (58% updated their assessment last year).\n\nThese suppliers account for 68% of the high-risk suppliers identified in our overall risk analysis.",

This  check  is performed  during  the  supplier  registration  process  and  the annual renewal of existing suppliers. In general, we perform a screening  of  both  platforms.  Thanks  to  this  tool,  we  can identify  possible  risks  related  to  ethical  behaviour  and corruption, thus reinforcing the processes already in place in order to comply with the Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\nIf a supplier does not  reach the required standards -in either  EcoVadis  or  the  Dow  Jones  Risk  &  Compliance Service -or is unable to provide the information requested, we  require  a  commitment  from  them  to  implement improvement plans to ensure compliance with our standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  extreme  cases,  when  this  is  not  feasible,  all  additional business  with  the  supplier  is  blocked  until  they  prove  they have  corrected  the  situation,  as  stated  in  the  conditions signed by both parties. As this Report was being finalised, 9 suppliers were blocked in our database for reasons of noncompliance with ethical or sustainability aspects (100% of the suppliers identified for social or environmental reasons who  have  not  yet  remedied  the  situation  or  shown  their commitment to implementing improvement plans to ensure compliance with our standards).\n\n## Step 4. Audits on high-risk suppliers\n\nThe  performance  appraisals  are  complemented  by  our Annual Audit Plan, which is focused on verifying compliance with  the  critical  aspects  identified  according  to  (i)  type  of supplier, (ii) service and product provided and (iii) the risks of each region or country.\n\nThe audits  are  complemented by the various improvement plans  agreed  with  100% of  those  suppliers  that  do  not comply  with  any  of  the  aspects  that  may  have  a  negative social or environmental impact.\n\nIn  2020  we  conducted 16,105  administrative or on-site audits . Based on the results of these audits, at the end of the year we had 560 suppliers with improvement plans (6% of awarded suppliers).\n\nAs shown in the table below, our audits allow us to verify the level  of  compliance  of  our  high-risk  suppliers  in  the  various aspects  of  sustainability  we  require  of  them,  including respect for human rights.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Details  of  JAC  audits  (product  manufacturers): We participate in the Joint Audit Cooperation sector initiative with  17  other  telecommunications  operators.  We  join forces to verify, evaluate and develop the implementation of  sustainability  standards  (with  a  focus  on  working conditions,  environmental  processes,  human  rights  and ethical  principles)  in  factories  run  by  common  suppliers, mainly  in  risk  areas  such  as  Asia,  Latin  America  and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2020, 60 audits were carried out on Telef\u00f3nica suppliers and/or manufacturers in the supply chain.\n\nBeyond  the  impacts  directly  related  to  the  exceptional situation  surrounding  COVID-19,  and  taking  into  account the  possible  social  or  environmental  impacts  of  the  risks identified, the most relevant findings were the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The  most  significant  social  impacts  mainly  concern labour issues related to working hours and days off and health  and  safety  issues  regarding  emergency  exits, lights and personal protective equipment.\n- \u00b7 Environmental  impacts  include  the  management  of hazardous  substances  and  waste,  as  well  as  the reduction of GHG emissions.\n\n## \u00b7 Details of corporate audits within the Allies programme (labour-intensive services):\n\nWe have maintained  our  high  standards  and  focused  our audit process, which is promoted at corporate level within the Allies Programme, on four of the highest risk countries (a  total  of 65 labour-intensive suppliers). We achieved an overall compliance level of 90% (+4% compared to 2019, taking  into  account  the  four  countries  audited  in  both periods).  This  growing  trend  is,  once  again  this  year,  the result  of  our  partners'  active  search  for  continuous improvement in the various aspects, with a special focus on working  conditions  and  health  and  safety  in  view  of  the type of service they provide. These are aspects which, in a pandemic year such as the one we have just experienced all around the world, have become even more relevant.\n\nNo significant changes were found vis-\u00e0-vis the distribution of the risks detected, with the health and safety aspect still returning the highest number. However, there was a 37% reduction in the number of findings identified in this area compared to the previous year.\n\nSome of the most common risks were detected in:\n\n- \u00b7 Working conditions: The relation with and management of  personnel,  the  induction  process,  training  and  work climate and accessibility;\n- \u00b7 Health  and  safety:  Industrial  health  and  safety, verification and implementation and operation.\n- \u00b7 Environmental processes: The environmental management system and waste management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaking into account the potential social and environmental (1) impacts  of  the  risks  identified,  the  most  relevant  findings were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The  most  significant social impacts  are  mainly concentrated in the verification, industrial hygiene and safety, and implementation and operation sections.\n- \u00b7 Meanwhile the environmental impacts are concentrated in the noise section.\n\n## RESULTS OF CORPORATE AUDITS\n\nAverage score obtained by suppliers according to subject matter (% compliance)\n\n|                     | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Business Principles | 90 %   | 90%    |\n| Human resources     | 89 %   | 93%    |\n| Health and safety   | 88 %   | 93%    |\n| Environment         | 89 %   | 89%    |\n\n## 2.6.3.2. Engagement with suppliers\n\n## GRI 102-9\n\nWe strive  to  understand  the  importance  of  material  issues for  our  suppliers,  as  well  as  their  perception  of  Telef\u00f3nica's performance in relation thereto.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Materiality\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is firmly committed to open collaboration with its suppliers. Our commitment to them is based on establishing relationships  that  enable  us  to  have  a  joint  positive  impact on  our  surroundings  through  close  collaboration  and  the sharing  of  good  practices,  fostered  thanks  to  different initiatives and meetings with our suppliers.\n\nWe  work  to  manage  emissions  in  the  supply  chain,  both globally  and  locally.  Globally,  we  continued  our  climate change  partnership  programme  with  key  suppliers  for another  year,  to  understand  the  state  of  their  climate strategies  and  help  them  set  more  ambitious  emissions reduction  targets.  In  addition,  Telef\u00f3nica  joined  the  1.5\u00b0C Supply  Chain  Leaders  initiative  to  reduce  CO2  emissions  in its  small  and  medium-sized  suppliers.  This  initiative  will enable  us  to  strengthen  our  role  in  the  value  chain  to accelerate  the  decarbonisation  of  the  global  economy  (for more  information  see  the  Chapter  on  Energy  and  Climate Change).  Locally,  in  the  United  Kingdom,  for  instance,  we continued requesting contractually agreed carbon reduction programmes from our suppliers, or plans to include them in our major contracts.",

We  also  establish  communication  channels, organise in-person discussion forums and provide training.\n\n## Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC)\n\nWe continue working to ensure the highest number of audits possible  in  ICT  manufacturing  centres  through  the  Joint Audit Cooperation sector initiative.\n\nAmong all operators, 668 audits were carried out from 2010 to 2020 (89 audits in 2020), of which 68% were carried out in Tier 2, Tier 3 and even Tier 4 factories. During this period, a total  of  1,397,139 employees were affected by such audits (128,590  employees  in  2020)  and  a  total  of  4,169  nonconformities  were  identified  and  resolved  in  the  ICT  supply chain (610 non-conformities identified and resolved in 2020).\n\nBy  participating  in  this  initiative,  we  reinforce  our  Annual Audit  Plan  and  our  commitment  to  society,  fostering  longterm sustainability in the different levels of our supply chain.\n\nSome  of  the  most  notable  projects  we  took  part  in  during 2020 were the following:\n\n- \u00b7  JAC Academy: For the fourth year in a row, together with Orange,  Vodafone  and  Deutsche  Telecom,  we  delivered training sessions to our suppliers' employees.  We promoted  our  sustainability  audit  standards  and  the definition  of  indicators,  which  allowed  them  to  measure and monitor the performance of their own supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Direct feedback  from  our  suppliers'  employees:  In collaboration  with  Elevate,  we  invited  the  employees  of common suppliers to participate in an anonymous survey from  their  mobile  phones.  Thus,  we  evaluated  issues related to working conditions, especially those concerning the  number  of  hours  worked,  rest  periods,  harassment, discrimination,  treatment  by  and  relationship  with  their direct managers, overtime, treatment of chemical materials, etc.\n\nIn 2020, surveys were conducted in 13 factories, delivering responses  from  more  than  22,687  employees  at  these suppliers.\n\n- \u00b7  Collaboration beyond audits: We participate with the other Telcos  in  various  working  groups  on  specific  topics  (e.g. climate change, human rights, etc.), to jointly enhance our positive  impact  on  the  sustainable  transformation  of  the ICT supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supplier Development Programme\n\nThe Supplier Development  Programme  is  a  training programme for key suppliers beyond direct suppliers (Tier 1), which  we  run  with  other  telecommunications  operators. Based  on  a  gap  analysis,  suppliers  are  supported  for  two years to improve their sustainability performance. Participation in this programme enables Telef\u00f3nica to adopt a  consistent  sustainability  approach  towards  its  suppliers. Telef\u00f3nica joined the programme in 2019 with a view to longterm participation in conjunction with other partners in the telecommunications sector.\n\n## Conflict minerals\n\nAlthough we do not have direct business relationships with smelters or refiners, we work actively to strengthen controls over the use of these minerals across our value chain.\n\nWe adopted a Company policy based on the guidelines set out  in  the  OECD  Due  Diligence  Guidance  for  Responsible Supply Chains for Minerals from Conflict-Affected and HighRisk Areas. Our policy considers the five stages set out in the Guidance and transfers them to our suppliers.\n\nFurthermore,  as  a  company  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock Exchange, we comply with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n\n## 1. Traceability of 3TG minerals\n\nAll  suppliers  who  present  offers  to  us  must  fulfil  the minimum  requirements  outlined  in  our Supply  Chain Sustainability Policy and the Telef\u00f3nica Group General Conditions  for  the  Supply  of  Goods  and  Services in regard to 3TG minerals.\n\nWhere  necessary  and  when  possible,  we  encourage  our suppliers to conduct effective due diligence processes to ensure  the  traceability  of  3TG  minerals  from  conflict zones  and  the  mitigation  of  associated  risks,  such  as human rights violations.\n\n## 2. Supplier assessment\n\nWe  assess  our  suppliers'  performance  via  the EcoVadis platform. We  use  the  supply  chain management assessment module to analyse high-risk suppliers in this area.\n\n- \u00b7 79% have a policy on minerals from conflict zones.\n- \u00b7 82% implement actions  to  identify  or  mitigate  the risks.\n\n## \u00b7 50% publish a report on due diligence.\n\nIn  addition,  we  request  our  key  suppliers  to  submit  the Conflict  Minerals  Reporting  Template  (CRMT)  from  the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) in order to increase transparency on the smelters and refiners used throughout the supply chain.",

Commitment initiatives\n\nWe  support  and  take  part  in  major  international  and industry  initiatives  designed  to  reduce  this  type  of  risk, such  as  the Responsible  Minerals  Initiative and  the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA).\n\n## 4. Complaints\n\nWe have set up a Responsible Business Channel, through which  our  stakeholders  can  send  us  queries,  and  a Whistleblower  Channel,  through  which  they  can  send complaints.\n\n## 5. Information\n\nWe report on the due diligence of the supply chain.\n\n## Occupational risk prevention\n\nWe foster  best  practices  regarding  health,  safety  and  wellbeing  in  our  supply  chain,  with  a  particular  focus  on contractors  who  assist  us  in  network  deployment  and maintenance  -  the  activities  where  the  main  risks  are concentrated (working at height, electrical risk and confined spaces).\n\nThrough our Supply Chain Sustainability  Policy,  we  set  out the minimum obligations that all our suppliers must meet in this area.\n\nIn 2020, in addition to the usual risks, we have incorporated the  impact  of  COVID-19  into  our  processes,  including  the possible psychosocial consequences for workers in situations of high uncertainty.\n\nTo this end, we have relied on different initiatives, depending on the needs in each of the countries:\n\n- \u00b7 More  intensive  and  targeted  communication  aimed primarily at technicians in contracting companies.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion  in  the  usual  communication  channels,  such  as the Allies Newsletter, of support information for companies to consider measures to mitigate, for example, the  risks  associated  with  teleworking,  ensuring  action  on the  physical  (workplace),  cognitive  (emotional  support) and organisational (tools) axes.\n- \u00b7 Adaptation  of  occupational  health  and  safety  audits  in some of the countries, in order to verify compliance with the  new  prevention  and  safety  protocols  established  to avoid infection.\n- \u00b7 Follow-up and monitoring of possible infections among our collaborators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Training and communication\n\nIn 2020  we  conducted 3,425 in-person  courses and 284,142  online courses involving  more  than 461,851 participants from  partner  companies  in  Latin  America  and Spain.\n\nWe also maintained in-person and online training (SuccessFactors,  Movistar  Academy,  ICampus,  etc.)  for  our internal  managers  and  suppliers,  addressing  the  specific needs in each country and the most critical issues according to the service they provide us with. For example, in Mexico, we  worked  with  27  suppliers  in  the  area  of  waste management  to  train  them  specifically  on  environmental policy and sustainability policy in the supply chain, as well as on  waste  management  on  the  GReTEL  platform,  via  which the Company has digitised the waste reporting process (see the Chapter on Circular Economy).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Circular Economy\n\nThis  awareness-raising  is  even  more  significant  in  our customer service providers, where we specifically train those who have direct contact with our customers (call centres and home installation and maintenance, etc.).\n\nWe also promote continuous communication as a key lever to  fostering  their  motivation  through  different  channels, such  as  our  quarterly  newsletter  to  Allies,  the  Allies'  Portal and  the  Supplier's  Portal.  In  the  latter  you  can  find  all  our global policies as well as specific requirements at local level. You can also find a confidential channel for queries related to compliance with our Minimum Responsible Business Criteria.\n\nWe  also  organise  and  participate  in  in-person  and  online events (global and local) with suppliers, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Allies  2020  Workshop in  Colombia,  an  event  that was attended by more than 40 representatives of 28 Allied companies and commercial agents from different cities in the  country.  Major  issues,  such  as  the  importance  of sustainability in the supply chain, with a special focus on diversity,  were  discussed  during  the  conference,  and  the growth opportunities for diverse and inclusive companies were shared with attendees. We  also welcomed participation from representatives of the Global Compact, with whom we held a workshop on human rights policies.\n- \u00b7 The 11th Telef\u00f3nica Global Energy and Climate Change Workshop , an annual meeting between the leaders of the Company's energy transformation and the main collaborating companies in the field. In this edition, which due  to  the  pandemic  was  conducted  online , more  than 1,600  people  came  together  to  review  the  Company's climate change  objectives. Once  again  the  Energy Efficiency and Climate Awards were presented to our best partner  of  the  year  (see  the  Chapter  on  Energy  and Climate Change).",

In  addition,  the  event included  a  roundtable  discussion  between  the  main operators  in  the  sector,  in  which  they  clearly  stated  the need to maintain the collaborative relationship in this area that  has  allowed  them  to  have,  for  example,  a  Telco training agreement with common minimum standards for all  technicians and homogeneous protocols for COVID-19. All  of  our  partner  companies'  commitments  and  efforts throughout this year have been aligned with the common goal of working towards #cerosiniestralidad (#zerofatalities).\n\nOnce again this year, the Excellence in Prevention Award was presented at the closing of the event in recognition of the company with the best results.\n\n- \u00b7 The  9th  CSR  Forum (held  in  Macao,  China)  which  we participated in as a member of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) sectoral initiative. This time the predominant theme was  the  circular  economy.  The  roundtables  focused  on topics  such  as  zero-waste,  decarbonisation  of  energy, ecodesign  and  supply  chain  engagement.  The  event  was attended  by  sustainability  and  purchasing  professionals from  leading  telecommunications  operators,  ICT  sector suppliers,  CSR  institutions,  NGOs  and  researchers.  At  the end  of  the  event,  awards  were  presented  to  those companies that had demonstrated the greatest commitment to leadership, innovation and achievement of tangible results through the application of best practices in circular economy issues.\n- \u00b7 A virtual  meeting  in  Argentina,  organised  together with UNICEF and ELA ,  on  the  role  of  companies  in  care policies and how their implementation can have a positive impact on their employees in their role as caregivers and their  families.  The  19  suppliers  in  attendance  were  also introduced to UNICEF's free digital platform, which allows each  company  to  learn  about  the  status  of  care  and  to make progress on improvements. Telef\u00f3nica Movistar took part in the implementation of this digital platform.\n- \u00b7 A virtual awareness-raising workshop on the NCh3262 Standard on Gender Equality Management and Work-Life Balance,  with  our  partner  companies  in  Chile.  We introduced  them  to  the  standard  and  showed  them  how they  can  start  promoting  and  implementing  the  good practices  it  outlines.  In  addition,  advice  and  guidelines were  shared  that  will  enable  them  to  differentiate  and detect undesirable practices within companies -such as stereotyping, unconscious bias, mistreatment and workplace and sexual  harassment -and to promote positive  action  related  to  work-life  balance  and  coresponsibility between men and women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Two  virtual  events  where  we  recognised  the  good work  of  our  contractors'  technicians  in  Colombia. At the first one, held in August, we recognised 67 employees from  9  suppliers  for  meeting  reiterative  and  childhood indicators  for  fibre  and  copper  in  the  first  months  of  the COVID-19  contingency.  At  the  second  event,  held  in December, we recognised 61 employees from 8 suppliers for  meeting  indicators  and  providing  good  customer service.\n\n## Summary of key indicators\n\n|                        | Indicators                                                                      | 2019    | 2020    |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                        | Volume of purchases  awarded                                                    | 25,274M | 24,268M |\n| Activity               | Suppliers awarded                                                               | 9,973   | 9,038   |\n|                        | % of purchases awarded  locally                                                 | 83%     | 77%     |\n|                        | High-risk sustainability  suppliers identified in our  global analysis          | 1,969   | 1,700   |\n|                        | High-risk suppliers  assessed on  sustainability aspects by  EcoVadis           | 1,131   | 1,157   |\n| Ethics and  Compliance | % suppliers evaluated by  Dow Jones Risk &  Compliance Service                  | 100%    | 100%    |\n|                        | Suppliers blocked for non- compliance with ethical or    sustainability aspects | 15      | 9       |\n|                        | Total audits on suppliers                                                       | 18,359  | 16,105  |\n|                        | High-risk suppliers with  improvement plans                                     | 687     | 560     |",

The objective of these global impact assessments  is  to  identify  what  impact  our  activities/ business  relationships  and  products/services  have  on  all existing human rights and, on this basis, identify the human rights  issues  that  are  most  salient  to  our  business  activity. Based on these global assessments and the material issues identified in them, annual risk assessments are conducted for all our markets/countries in accordance with Telef\u00f3nica's enterprise risk management process. In addition, thematic or market/country  specific  impact  assessments  (integrating the local perspective) are carried out where particular risks/ concerns  have  been  identified  (see  the  section  on  specific impact  assessments  below).  Together,  these  insights  from the  impact  assessments  provide  the  basis  for  adapting  our internal  policies/processes  with  a  view  to  preventing, mitigating and/or remedying potential human  rights impacts.\n\nOur human rights due diligence process can be broken down into the following five steps:\n\n## Our due diligence process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe approach and actions of each of these steps are outlined below:",

Privacy, freedom of expression and information\n\nIn  addition  to  the  privacy  issue,  which  is  discussed  in  more detail in the Chapter on Digital Trust, freedom of expression and  information  is  a  key  human  rights  issue  for  any telecommunications  company.  Like  our  peers,  we  receive requests from competent authorities (i.e. judges and courts, law enforcement agencies and other governmental administrations or bodies empowered by local legislation) in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The interception of communications.\n- \u00b7 The provision of metadata associated with communications.\n- \u00b7 The  blocking  of  websites,  and/or  restriction  of  certain content.\n- \u00b7 Geographical or temporary suspensions of service.\n\nWe  have  a  Global  Rule  on  Requests  made  by  Competent Authorities (Global Rule) in place, which sets out a uniform procedure for all companies within the Group to follow when assessing and responding to these requests. The Global Rule ensures  compliance  with  legal  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  the competent  authorities  in  the  respective  countries,  while  at the  same  time  protecting  the  fundamental  rights  of  the people affected. Requests are rejected if they do not come from competent authorities empowered by local legislation (e.g.  requests  from  private  third  parties)  or  do  not  comply with legal processes established in the country in question. Requests  which  need  escalating  as  a  result  of  their exceptional  nature  are  raised  within  the  Company  and processed  accordingly  (for  more  information  on  the  Global Rule see the summary in the Privacy Centre/Privacy section of the Telef\u00f3nica website).\n\nAs  part  of  our  commitment  to  privacy  and  freedom  of expression, we publish information on these requests in our annual  Transparency  Report,  which  is  available  in  the Responsible Business section of the Telef\u00f3nica website. The Report provides the following information for each country in which we operate:\n\n- \u00b7 The  local  legislative  framework  that  grants  competent authorities the legal power to make such requests.\n- \u00b7 The  names  of  the  competent  authorities  that  have  the legal power to make such requests.\n- \u00b7 The total number of requests received and rejected during the reporting year.\n- \u00b7 The total number of accesses affected by the requests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Digital Trust for 2020 data\n\nWe have received recognition twice recently for our activities regarding freedom of expression and privacy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Global Network Initiative (GNI):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTestament to our commitment to the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and privacy is our membership of the  Global  Network  Initiative  (GNI),  whose  Principles  on Freedom of Expression and Privacy have greatly influenced the development of our human rights approach in general and  our  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy  practices  in particular.  In  2019,  we  successfully  passed  our  first independent GNI evaluation process. The multistakeholder board of directors of the GNI determined that Telef\u00f3nica was striving in good faith to implement the GNI Principles  on  Freedom  of  Expression  and  Privacy  with improvement  over  time.  The  positive  assessment  of  the GNI was based on a report from an independent external adviser (Deloitte), which assessed the capacity of Telef\u00f3nica's  policies,  processes  and  governance  model  to safeguard  the  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy  of  its customers.\n\n- \u00b7 Ranking Digital Rights:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe ranked first among all telecommunications companies in  the  2021  edition  of  the  Digital  Rights  Ranking  (RDR), which  assesses  companies'  commitments,  policies  and practices regarding customers' freedom of expression and privacy, including governance and supervisory mechanisms. In this edition, the methodology was revised by  integrating  indicators  on  targeted  advertising  and algorithmic decision-making systems.",

Artificial Intelligence and Big Data\n\nTechnology must aid the creation of a more inclusive society and better opportunities for all; artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data can contribute to these goals. In order to guide the Company in its application of AI and Big Data across all the lines of our business, the Executive Committee adopted our Artificial Intelligence Principles in October 2018.\n\nIn  2020  we  worked  on  implementing  these  Principles through a specific training and governance model to ensure that human rights are respected whenever AI is used in/by Telef\u00f3nica.  Our  approach  is  outlined  in  greater  detail  in  the Chapter on Digital Trust.\n\n## Human rights issues in network deployment\n\n## 1. Human rights and the workplace\n\nHuman rights compliance in the Company's immediate environment includes managing issues relating to health and safety, working conditions, discrimination and diversity management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Human rights and society\n\nSociety-related human rights issues include those of privacy, freedom of expression, our relations with local communities and indigenous peoples, and bridging the digital divide between rural and urban areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also have cross-cutting tools  that  help  to  minimise  the negative impacts and maximise the positive ones:\n\n- \u00b7 Human  rights  training  for  professionals  in  all  process phases.\n- \u00b7 Provision of complaint channels in all process phases.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing dialogue with local communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.7.3.3. Network deployment GRI 103\n\nIn  2020  we  developed  guidelines  for  responsible  network deployment  and  implemented  them  through  awareness raising  and  training  measures  to  make  sure  that  they  were properly  followed  by  all  countries  when  deploying  the network. These guidelines were developed in close collaboration with our local teams in the different countries, and establish a set of recommendations to be followed in the following phases of network deployment: a) Justification of deployment;  b)  Deployment  planning;  c)  Deployment  and field  operations;  d)  Network  operations  and  maintenance; and e) Network removal. Each of these phases involves four major blocks of priority human rights:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.\n\n## Human rights and the supply chain\n\nHuman rights issues in the supply chain are those that are affected directly or indirectly by the activity of Telef\u00f3nica's business partners. They are mainly related to non-compliance in the workplace and environmental or social issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Human rights and the\n\nenvironment\n\nEnvironment-related human rights issues are those affected by negative impacts on the environment, such as deforestation and soil and water contamination, as well as impacts on biodiversity or visual impacts. The latter two occur mainly in the network deployment and maintenance phases, although they are closely related to the planning phase, where all potential impacts originate but where they can also be avoided or minimised.\n\n## 2.7.3.4. Children and minors GRI 103\n\nIn 2020 we continued to strengthen our defence of children's rights by analysing the impact of our activity on minors. We took the Child  Rights  and  Business  Principles  developed  by UNICEF (in collaboration with the Global Compact and Save the  Children)  as  our  starting  point  and  used  its  MO-CRIA (UNICEF Mobile Operator Child Rights Self-Impact Assessment  Tool)  to  systematically  analyse  the  impact  of our  activity  on  aspects  such  as:  access  to  inappropriate",

These  measures  are fundamentally related to specific training plans in the area of children's  rights,  the  strengthening  of  age  verification procedures  across  the  value  chain  and  the  adaptation  of terms and conditions to children and teenagers for products and services designed specifically for them, etc.\n\n## 2.7.3.5. Supply chain\n\nAs described in more detail in the Chapter on Suppliers, we require 100% of our suppliers to carry out their activities in accordance with ethical standards similar to our own, which ensure compliance with human rights. Thus, all our suppliers sign up to our Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, which sets out  human  rights  compliance  obligations.  In  addition,  we perform a risk analysis to identify those suppliers that may carry  a  high  risk  in  terms  of  sustainability  in  general  and human rights in particular,  on  the  basisi  of  the  products  or services  supplied.  We  assess  the  compliance  of  these  highrisk  suppliers  through  the  EcoVadis  platform  and  verify  the compliance  of  the  most  critical  suppliers  through  on-site audits - for example, through the audits we carry out as part of  our  participation  in  the  Joint  Audit  Cooperation  (JAC) initiative,  where  issues  such  as  forced  labour,  child  labour and/or minerals from conflict zones are specifically addressed. In addition, we foster human rights best practices in  our  supply  chain  through  a  number  of  collaborative initiatives.\n\n## Supplier management in regard to human rights issues\n\n| Step 1   | All our suppliers must accept and sign up to our  minimum human rights standards (e.g. on forced and/ or child labour, minerals from conflict zones).   |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Step 2   | Risk analysis and identification of high-risk suppliers.                                                                                                |\n| Step 3   | Third-party assessments and/or audits (administrative or on-site) of high-risk suppliers.                                                               |\n| Step 4   | Engagement with suppliers to improve their due diligence on human rights issues.                                                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spotlight on human rights and COVID-19\n\n## We conducted a human rights impact assessment of COVID-19 in our corporate areas. We analysed:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe potential impacts of COVID-19 on the human rights of the following actors: our employees, our suppliers and our customers/ society in general;\n\nThe possible prevention or mitigation measures we had already taken or should implement to manage the impacts identified.\n\nThis human rights-based approach helped us to systematise our response to COVID-19 and formed the basis for several of the measures taken by the Group: https://www.telefonica.com/ext/\n\nseguimosconectados/\n\n## 2.7.4. Human Rights by Design GRI 102-29\n\nWe  assess  the  potential  human  rights  impacts  of  new products  and  services  through  a  Human  Rights  by  Design approach, i.e. from the very beginning of the design and/or marketing process.\n\nTo be more concrete, product managers use an online tool to perform  a  self-assessment  of  new  products  and  services during  the  design  phase  in  order  to  identify  and  address potential human rights impacts evident in the design phase itself. The human rights issues addressed in this questionnaire  include  privacy,  freedom  of  expression,  nondiscrimination, artificial intelligence and impact on vulnerable groups such as children and minors, etc.\n\nIf  human  rights  risks  are  identified  after  completion  of  the self-assessment, the product/service in question is subjected to further analysis with the help of human rights experts at the  Company.  This  is  to  address  possible  adverse  human rights impacts on the development of the product/service in the future.\n\nThis  Human  Rights  by  Design  approach  forms  part  of Telef\u00f3nica's  broader  Responsibility  by  Design  approach, which is outlined in the Chapter on Customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Clients",

        "page_content": "## 2.7.6. Specific human rights training\n\nIn 2020 specific workshops were held for employees whose work  has  a  major  impact  on  human  rights.  The  areas  that received training were:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal,  Compliance  and  Data  Protection  Officers: The workshops  covered  privacy  and  freedom  of  expression issues from a human rights perspective, with emphasis on the  GNI  Principles,  the  requests  made  by  competent authorities  and  the  human  rights  issues  to  be  taken  into account in merger, acquisition and divestment agreements.\n- \u00b7 Public  Affairs,  Institutional  Relations  and  Operations : On  the  one  hand,  the  workshops  promoted  privacy  and freedom  of  expression  through  policy  advocacy  with external  stakeholders  (e.g.  governments,  international organisations, NGOs). On the other hand, they familiarised the  operations  group  with  the  manual  for  incorporating human rights into all phases of network deployment.\n- \u00b7 Product  managers  and  developers: These  workshops aimed  to  ensure  integration  of  Human  Rights  by  Design particularly for products and services that incorporate new technologies such as artificial intelligence.\n\n## 2.7.7. Relations with communities: Electromagnetic fields GRI 103\n\nOne  of  our  greatest  concerns  is  to  establish  appropriate communication with the communities in all the countries in which we operate. Therefore, one of the impacts we consider in our human rights impact assessments is the impact of our operations  on  the  right  of  the  affected  communities  to  be informed and participate in network deployment and, more specifically, their right of access to information on electromagnetic fields.\n\nThere  are  comprehensive  international  guidelines  that govern  exposure  to  radio  waves,  including  the  frequencies proposed  for  5G.  The  limits  have  been  established  by independent scientific organisations, such as the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and include substantial safety margins so  as  to  protect  all  persons  from  all  known  hazards.  These guidelines have been widely adopted in standards around the world  and  are  endorsed  by  the  World  Health  Organisation (WHO).\n\nWe comply with these limits in all the countries in which we operate. We also have internal indicators for monitoring our compliance in all operations. In 2020 all the measurements we  took  at  our  base  stations  were  below  the  levels recognised  by  the  world's  leading  standardisation  and normalisation organisations such as the International Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  and  the  ICNIRP,  among others.  In  the  majority  of  countries  in  which  we  operate, these measurements are audited and available to the public.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditionally,  all  terminals  and  equipment  that  provide  our services comply with the international standards established in  the  Specific  Absorption  Rate  (SAR)  parameter.  This parameter  is  established  by  the  various  regulatory  bodies and health agencies duly authorised for this purpose.\n\n## 2.7.7.1. Dialogue with our stakeholders\n\nWe have a Manual of Good Practices that acts as a guide for our teams and lists all the initiatives taken within the Group in  the  different  countries  in  which  we  operate.  All  these practices  have  a  common  interest  in  establishing  a  proper relationship with the communities we intend to serve, most of the time through our institutional partners.\n\nWe  have  grouped  together  our  success  stories  in  the following  sections:  We  converse  with  communities,  We cooperate  with  institutions,  We  cooperate  with  research, Commitments  with  other organisations and Building awareness  among  our  employees.  The  Manual  can  be consulted  via  the  Responsible  Business  section  of  the Telef\u00f3nica website.\n\nIn this context, we have procedures in place for dialogue with communities,  allowing  us  to  measure  effectiveness  in resolving disputes.\n\n## 2.7.7.2. The 5G standard\n\nThe electromagnetic frequencies used for 5G are part of the radio  frequency  spectrum,  which  has  been  researched extensively  in  terms  of  its  impact  on  health  over  decades. Over 50 years of scientific research has been conducted on the  possible  health  effects  of  radio  signals  used  for  mobile phones, base stations and other wireless services, including planned frequencies for 5G exposures.\n\nThe data from these research findings has been analysed by many expert review groups. They all conclude that there is no evidence linking exposure below the guidelines set by the ICNIRP to known health risks for adults or children.\n\nThe  same  limits  that  protect  people  also  protect  the environment. The corresponding German  government agency says there is no reliable scientific evidence of a risk to animals and plants exposed to radio signals at levels below the limits set by international guidelines.\n\nWe make it our job to know the results of scientific research in all fields and on all population groups, especially children, pregnant women and more susceptible groups. That is one of our  challenges:  to  embark  on  the  so-called  fifth  generation technology,  and  to  ensure  that  it  is  as  safe  as  the  earlier generations.\n\n## 2.7.7.3. Commitment to research\n\nScientific  research  in  this  field  is  a  priority  issue  on  the WHO's  research  agenda.  The  research  programme  of  the European Union also includes different projects in this area that aim  to  address  the  possible  health  effects  of electromagnetic fields. At Telef\u00f3nica we follow these projects closely.",

In order  to  help  society  feel  less  apprehensive  and  better understand how the new 5G mobile networks work, we have generated  materials  that  show  how  5G  networks  are designed to minimise power and use a new, advanced, highly efficient  radio  architecture  resulting  in  optimised  levels  of exposure  to  electromagnetic  fields.  They  can  be  consulted via  the  Responsible  Business  section  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica website.\n\nThese  materials  also  show  how  smart  antennas  (Massive MIMO)  work:  they  enable  power  to  be  aimed  only  in  the required  direction,  minimising  power  and  leading  to  lower exposure levels than current technologies (2G, 3G and 4G).\n\nWe  believe  that  reporting  is  fundamental  to  society  being able  to  break  down  the  myths  related  to  electromagnetic fields and  understand  how  telecommunications  work. Therefore, we publish useful links, information from experts in the field and FAQs that we update regularly.\n\n## 2.7.7.5. We make our employees aware\n\nAll  Telef\u00f3nica  employees  have  access,  through  an  online training tool, to the Mobile Telecommunications and Society course  in  Spanish,  Portuguese  and  German.

Introduction\n\nWe are witnessing a world in transition: a global society and a global  economy  facing  major  challenges  and  rapid  change. Equality and the end of poverty remain unfinished business, while  climate  change  and  the  loss  of  essential  natural resources  exert  increasing  pressure.  All  this  against  the backdrop of a technological revolution that is set to redefine the working world and the economy as a whole, and a global health  crisis  -stemming  from  COVID-19-  which  has accelerated  the  transformation  of  a  large  part  of  our productive sector in a very short space of time.\n\nGlobal  economic  development  demands  greater  social  and environmental responsibility to ensure more inclusion, more protection of ecosystems and biodiversity, and more shared wealth for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\nAll  this  has  been  accompanied  by  the  awakening  of  an awareness of social and environmental responsibility among all  social  players;  it  has  also  permeated  the  business world, even  spreading  through  to  the  very  development  of businesses and the day-to-day life of employees.\n\nAt  Telef\u00f3nica,  as  a  leading  company  in  the  technology  and communications sector, we have decided to be a key player in this transformation and use the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda as a strategic  framework  to  guide  our  commitments  to  society and environmental protection.\n\nMoving  forward  in  line  with  the  2030  Agenda  ensures  the sustainability  of  our  business  and  our  ability  to  transform and  respond  to  major  social  challenges,  new  economic markets and an ever-changing context.\n\n## 2.8.1.1. Our contribution during COVID-19\n\nIf  our  Company's  contribution  to  progress  and  society  has always  been  important,  during  the  health  crisis  we experienced in 2020 it has proved even more so.\n\nCOVID-19  has  made  it  clear  how  fundamental  information and communication technologies (ICTs) are to societies and economies around the world.\n\nThe Chapters of this Report highlight the main contributions Telef\u00f3nica has made in all areas, from aid through donations and the purchase of medical equipment, to the work carried out by all the Company's units to guarantee communications,  develop  innovative  solutions  that  enable\n\npublic administrations, health teams and other companies to deal  with  the  consequences  of  the  pandemic,  and  support digital education.\n\nIn such an extraordinary and wholly unexpected situation as this,  telecommunications  networks  have  become  essential. Our  close  collaboration  with  health  authorities  and  social partners to provide a reliable response to all our stakeholders has  effectively  contributed  to  minimising  the  damage  the pandemic has caused.\n\n## 2.8.1.2. Identifying our contribution and impact\n\nWe have conducted a careful study to  identify  those  goals and  targets  of  the  2030  Agenda  to  which  we  have  the greatest potential to contribute, based on our technical and commercial capabilities and the geographic regions in which we  are  present.  As  a  result, SDG  9  (Industry,  Innovation and  Infrastructure) was  identified  as  the  main  goal  for which  we  are  generating  value  through  the  deployment  of communications infrastructures and our continued commitment to innovation and the promotion of entrepreneurship.\n\nWe have a work agenda that revolves around Goal 9, to which we contribute by deploying sustainable, resilient and quality infrastructure and by harnessing our capacity for innovation to address major global challenges\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contribution and impact assessment models GRI102-29\n\nThe SDGs are not only a tool for ensuring the evolution and resilience  of  our  business  model;  they  also  give  us  a framework  for  monitoring,  evaluating  and  communicating the  contribution  our  activity  makes  to  the  communities  in which we are present. Our contribution goes beyond strictly financial results, and for this reason we evaluate our overall contribution and the impact we are making in different areas of capital: productive, human, social and environmental.\n\nAll of this has the strategic objectives of:\n\n- \u00b7 Maximising  our  contribution to the socio-economic development of the regions in which we are present.\n- \u00b7 Minimising the negative impact our industrial activity and the  products  and  services  we  develop  can  have  on  the environment and society.\n\nWe  have  developed  a  comprehensive,  two-pronged  impact analysis model that allows us to:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitor the performance of our main indicators;\n- \u00b7 Evaluate our contribution to the 2030 Agenda;\n- \u00b7 Detect and monitor the risks and adverse impacts of our business;\n- \u00b7 Facilitate  decision-making  to  improve  our  business  and increase our contribution to society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.8.2.1. Value analysis model\n\nThis model offers a global vision of the value that Telef\u00f3nica as  a  company  generates  beyond  strictly  financial  aspects. The analysis follows the framework defined in the Social & Human Capital Protocol and includes an assessment of each of  the  external  factors  identified  in  the  materiality  matrix. Various tools are used to perform this exercise, among which we can highlight:\n\n- \u00b7 The  True  Value  impact  quantification  model , which monetises  the  external  factors  identified  in  each  of  the four areas of capital evaluated (productive, social, human and environmental).\n- \u00b7 The Total Impact quantification model (based on inputoutput tables), which assesses Telef\u00f3nica's contribution to gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  employment  in  the main countries in which we operate.\n- \u00b7 Natural Capital Protocol , which assesses our impact on biodiversity and the environment.\n\n## 2.8.2.2. Product and service evaluation model\n\nWe use this model to carry out in-depth evaluations of the main  products,  services  and  projects  that  are  developed  in the Company's operations and commercial areas. This allows us  to  understand  the  social,  economic  and  environmental impact  that  the  projects  analysed  may  generate.  The measurement tools used depend on the type of project to be evaluated:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Impact  Management  Project  model studies  socioeconomic impacts.\n\n## Our lines of action and the SDGs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Helping society to prosper                                                                                                                                              | Helping society to prosper                                                                                                                                              | Building a greener future                                                                                       | Leading by example                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Promote more inclusive connectivity by bringing digitisation to all people and boosting the social and economic development of the communities in which we are present. | Promote more inclusive connectivity by bringing digitisation to all people and boosting the social and economic development of the communities in which we are present. | Increase our contribution to society and the environment for more  sustainable and planet-friendly development. | Build trust through our actions and commitments, promoting and fostering inclusion and equality for all, and ensuring confidence in digitisation and driving sustainability among all stakeholders. |\n|                                                                                                                                                                         | Provide faster and better  Internet for people and  businesses.                                                                                                         | Implement a more efficient  telecommunications network  (fibre and 5G) powered by  100% renewable electricity.  | Be a leader in inclusion to drive  equality and equity.                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                         | Boost the digitisation of SMEs.                                                                                                                                         | Become a leading provider of  solutions that help our  customers reduce their CO2  emissions.                   | Enhance trust through the  ethical and responsible use of  technology, and safeguard the  security and privacy of our  customers' data.                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                         | Promote education in digital  skills.                                                                                                                                   | Promote the circular economy  in the use of electronic devices  through ecodesign, re-use and  recycling.       | Commit to the highest  standards of business  principles and ethics,  promoting sustainability in our  supply chain.                                                                                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The environmental impact assessment for Eco Smart solutions is used in collaboration with CarbonTrust to calculate the emissions avoided by our services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the the chapter on Environmental Responsibility\n\n## 2.8.2.3.

Our LTE networks reach virtually the entire population in the regions of Europe in which we are present, and we are also rolling out fibre.\n\nMeanwhile,  we  have  connected  a  number  of  people  in isolated  or  remote  areas  thanks  to  our  'Internet  for  All' initiatives.\n\nBut beyond infrastructure, our work to promote innovation and entrepreneurship through programmes such as Telef\u00f3nica  Venture  Capital  or  Wayra  is  proving  to  be essential  to  preventing  the  flight  of  young  talent  to  other parts  of  the  world,  and  is  becoming  a  driving  force  for innovation and economic development in many regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Go to the the chapter on Innovation\n\nMain  lines  of  action  around  SDG  9: Provide  faster  and better Internet for people and businesses.\n\nTARGET  9.1  - Strengthen  and  invest  in  the  very  high capacity networks that have proven to be critical for future competitiveness.\n\n- \u00b7 Increase high-speed mobile network coverage (LTE) and drive the deployment of new 5G networks.\n- \u00b7 Increase the coverage of ultra-broadband (fibre) networks in all regions.\n\nTARGET  9.5  Foster innovation and  technological entrepreneurship through our Open Innovation programmes.\n\nTARGET 9.c (UNSTATS indicator 9.c.1) - Bring connectivity to places where it is lacking, connecting millions of people in rural or remote areas who have no or very limited access to the Internet.\n\n## Contribution to SDG 9\n\n| Target   | Indicator                                                                                                       |             |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 9.1      |                                                                                                                 |             |\n|          | Investment in infrastructure and applied  services  (total investment of the Telef\u00f3nica Group  (million euros)) | 5,861       |\n|          | Pre-paid penetration                                                                                            | 49.4%       |\n|          | Universal Service                                                                                               | 174         |\n| 9.5      |                                                                                                                 |             |\n|          | R&D investment (million euros)                                                                                  | 959         |\n|          | Industrial property rights portfolio  (includes patents)                                                        | 440         |\n| 9.c      |                                                                                                                 |             |\n|          | Number of people connected via the  Internet for All project                                                    | 1,800,000   |\n|          | 4G/LTE mobile coverage                                                                                          | 82.5%       |\n|          | UBB - Ultra Broad-band (passed units)                                                                           | 134,769,000 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 8 - Drive digitisation for a more sustainable society and economy\n\nThe impact that telecommunications and broadband have on economic  development  has  been  well  documented  in different international studies, which conclude that we are a strategic player for the economic growth of the countries\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total operating subsidies received by Telef\u00f3nica in 2020 amounted to 17 million euros  (\u20ac22 million  in  2019)  which includes  the  receipt  of  capital  subsidies  and  subsidies  for other income..\n\nThus, for every 100 euros of Company turnover, 18.9 euros were paid in taxes (5.3 for taxes paid and 13.6 for taxes collected).\n\n## Tax contribution by country\n\n| Million euros   | Contribution by  country to  consolidated Group  profit before tax (1)  2019   | Contribution by  country to  consolidated Group  profit before tax (1)  2020   | Total taxes paid 2020   | Total taxes collected  2020   | Totals 2020   |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Germany         | 314                                                                            | 281                                                                            | 215                     | 828                           | 1,043         |\n| Argentina       | (894)                                                                          | (51)                                                                           | 148                     | 408                           | 556           |\n| Brazil          | 1,027                                                                          | 1,434                                                                          | 318                     | 1,829                         | 2,147         |\n| Central America | 35                                                                             | 179                                                                            | 22                      | 27                            | 48            |\n| Chile           | 42                                                                             | 113                                                                            | 6                       | 150                           | 154           |\n| Colombia        | 38                                                                             | 66                                                                             | 103                     | 120                           | 222           |\n| Ecuador         | (22)                                                                           | 43                                                                             | 91                      | 64                            | 156           |\n| Spain           | 826                                                                            | 108                                                                            | 790                     | 1,917                         | 2,706         |\n| Mexico          | (707)                                                                          | (767)                                                                          | 169                     | 84                            | 253           |\n| Peru            | (180)                                                                          | (167)                                                                          | 52                      | 155                           | 207           |\n| United Kingdom  | 1,437                                                                          | 675                                                                            | 300                     | 234                           | 534           |\n| Uruguay         | 94                                                                             | 136                                                                            | 18                      | 19                            | 37            |\n| Venezuela       | 7                                                                              | 73                                                                             | 3                       | 10                            | 13            |\n| Other           | 231                                                                            | 215                                                                            | 67                      | 16                            | 83            |\n| TOTAL GROUP     | 2,248                                                                          | 2,338                                                                          | 2,301                   | 5,859                         | 8,160         |",

The local accounting regulations applicable in each of the countries in which the Group is present may differ from the standards set by the IFRS.\n\nThe table above groups together all companies of the Group according to the country of their registered office.

Additionally, the refund in Spain of 132 million euros for the 2017 tax year is also excluded, as are the refunds of 10 million euros in Chile and 17 million euros in Peru. This last refund was not excluded from the 2019 non-financial statements, as that information was lacking at the time of publication.\n\nThe taxes paid to the different authorities are attributed to the country of jurisdiction of the corresponding tax authority.\n\n(*) As a result of their sale in 2019, Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Guatemala, Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles de Nicaragua and Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Panam\u00e1 were disinvested at different dates (and therefore excluded from the consolidation perimeter).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 4 - Address inequalities by investing in digital skills\n\nEducation is  a  key  tool  for  ensuring  inclusion  and  fostering growth  and  progress.  The  speed  of  change  generated  by technology is affecting all parts of society, but it also offers us new opportunities if we are able to adapt and prepare for the new context.\n\nIn this context, the rapid digitisation of the economy requires an increasing number of professionals who can manage and drive  its  development,  and  education  plays  a  key  role  in bridging  the  digital  divide .  In  addition,  the  experience  of COVID-19  in  2020  has  demonstrated  the  value  of  online education  in  ensuring access  to  education  for  many children , especially in critical situations.\n\nThrough a variety of programmes, Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica and Telef\u00f3nica  Educaci\u00f3n  Digital  are  promoting  educational innovation and working to bring quality digital education to every corner of the world.\n\nSpecifically,  programmes  such  as  Profuturo,  developed  in conjunction with the \"la Caixa\" Foundation and launched in 2016, have aimed to reduce the education gap in the world by providing quality digital education  to  children  in vulnerable  environments  in  Latin  America,  Africa,  Asia  and the Caribbean.\n\nThe  promotion  of  training  through  online  courses  available on  the  MiriadaX  platform  has  also  enabled  millions of students  enrolled  in  MOOCs  to  improve  their  skills;  the ScolarTIC  programme  has  trained  thousands  of  teachers  in new skills.\n\nOther programmes developed by Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica such as  Conecta  Educaci\u00f3n,  Code.org,  Conecta  Empleo  and Proyecto 42 are contributing decisively to the development and training of young people, helping them to improve their digital skills and thus open the doors to a labour market that is increasingly demanding these types of profiles.\n\nFinally,  enlightED,  a global  conference  on  education, technology  and  innovation organised by Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica,  IE  University,  Fundaci\u00f3n  Santillana  and  South\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This working approach also allows us to leverage decarbonisation  opportunities ,  be  more  competitive  and offer  our  customers  low-emission  connectivity,  decoupling the growth of our business (incorporation of new technologies  such  as  5G  or  fibre  deployment)  from  the greenhouse gas emissions evolution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 7 - Develop the most efficient telecommunications network powered by renewable energies\n\nWe  reduce  our  impact  on  climate  change  through  the decarbonisation  of  our  business,  working  to  decouple  the growth  of  our  network  traffic  from  greenhouse  gas emissions.\n\nThe  aim  is  to  align our efforts with the level of decarbonisation  required  to  limit  global  warming  to  below 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nOur carbon footprint comes  mainly  from  electricity consumption, from  2019  our  consumption  has  been 100%  renewable  in  Europe  and  Brazil and  we  are committed  to transferring  this  to  all  our  operations  by 2030 . Coupled with an ambitious energy efficiency programme, this has meant that our carbon emissions have decreased significantly in recent years.",

Responsibility with the environment GRI 103\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to deploying the most efficient telecommunications networks (fibre and 5G) powered by 100% renewable energy and to achieving net zero emissions by 2025 in our main markets.\n\nWe are working to become a leading supplier of solutions that help our customers to reduce their CO 2 emissions. By 2025, thanks to us, 5 million tCO 2 a year will be avoided by our customers.\n\nWe promote the circular economy in the use of electronic devices through ecodesign, reuse and recycling, as we move towards the status of a zero-waste company.\n\nThe past year was unquestionably marked by an unprecedented global health crisis, but also by an increase in awareness  about  the  impact  caused  by  environmental damage on all that surrounds us, health and the economy, etc. Biodiversity protects us, economic activity depends on a sustainable environment and, in short, our own wellbeing is absolutely  interlinked  to  that  of  the  environment.  Against this backdrop,  there  are  leaders  in  governments  and companies  who  are  focussing  on  a  new  paradigm  that modifies the economic model and places the environment at the  heart  of  policies  and  decisions  such  as  the  European Green Deal.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica wants to be part of this shift and our activities, as those  of  any  other  company,  are  dependent  on  the environment. We are therefore striving to ensure our impact on  the  environment  is  minimal  and  are  committed  to decoupling the growth of our business from our environmental footprint.\n\nDigitalisation is a crucial tool in the face of these environmental challenges. Some of our products and services already  provide  solutions  for  climate  change,  waste,  water, air pollution and biodiversity.\n\nWe  are  working  to  achieve  a  world  in  which  digital technology contributes to protecting the planet. We have a global environmental strategy and act in alignment with our business  strategy  at  all  levels  of  the  organisation.  The environment  is  a  central  issue  throughout  the  Company, involving both operations and management areas, as well as business and innovation areas.\n\nIn  2020  we  set  ourselves  ambitious  new  goals  which  go further than the Paris Agreement. We will be a company with net  zero  emissions  in  our  main  markets  by  2025  and, including our value chain, by 2040 at the latest. In order to achieve this, we will reduce emissions in line with the 1.5\u00baC scenario and neutralise residual emissions through projects based on nature. In this way, we will reduce our emissions by 70% by 2025 (90% in our main markets) and emissions in\n\nour  value  chain  by  39%.  We  will  also  continue  working  to become  a  company  with  zero-waste,  thereby  helping  to create a more circular economy by fostering the ecodesign, reuse and recycling of electronic equipment.\n\nIn  a  digital  world  there  are  also  more  opportunities  for ecoefficiency  and  a  decarbonised  and  circular  economy; therefore,  we  want  to  play  our  part  in  the  transition  to  a green  economy.  Through  connectivity  and  our  digital services, we will help our customers to prevent the emission of 5 million tCO 2 a year by 2025.\n\nAs  part  of  integrating  the  environment  into  the  Company's strategy, in 2020 we issued another Green Bond -the first hybrid  in  the  sector-  based  on  our  Sustainable  Financing Framework,  under  which  the  Company  had  already  issued the  first  Green  Bond  for  the  telecommunications  sector globally in early 2019.\n\nThe  funds  from  the  hybrid  Green  Bond  (500  million  euros) have  served  to  finance  projects  aimed  at  increasing  the Company's  energy  efficiency  through  the  process  of transforming the copper network into fibre optic (85% more efficient)  in  Spain.  The  issuing  of  the  bond  has  made  it possible  to  save  50  GWh  just  between  the  months  of  May 2019 and August 2020, which means avoiding the emission into the atmosphere of 10,075 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the  carbon  sequestered  by  165,000  trees.  In  addition,  the deployment  of  fibre  has  allowed  us  to  close  hundreds  of technical  buildings,  re-using  much  of  the  equipment  and recycling all the material as part of our commitment to the circular economy. The Company's goal is to have 100% of its retail customers in Spain using fibre by 2025.\n\nSustainable financing contributes to Telef\u00f3nica's decarbonisation strategy and its goals of reducing emissions and energy consumption.",

We  currently  have  fully  comprehensive  insurance  and coverage for all risks, material damages and loss of profit, in order to cover any material losses, damage to assets and loss of  income  and/or  customers,  among  other  problems,  as  a consequence of natural events. We also have environmental liability  insurance  to  cover  the  environmental  liabilities  set out  by  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  Both  insurance policies  are  based  on  limits,  sub-limits  and  cover  that  are appropriate  to  the  risks  and  exposure  of  Telef\u00f3nica  and  its Group of companies.\n\nIn addition, we specifically analyse and manage the risks and opportunities  deriving  from  climate  change  in  accordance with  the  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  ClimateRelated  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD),  with  regard  to  both physical and transitional risks. These are explained specifically in the chapter '2.10. Energy and Climate Change'. In addition,  the  Appendix  2.13.10  contains  the  TCFD references.\n\n## 2.9.4. Environmental management\n\n## GRI 103, 102-11, 102-29\n\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS) ISO 14001 is the model  that  we  chose  to  ensure  the  protection  of  the environment.  In  2020  we  continued  to  have  100%  of  our operators  certified  under  the  requirements  of  the  standard (Venezuela is out of the scope).\n\nWe have a set of global standards that incorporate the life cycle  perspective.  We  also  incorporate  the  life  cycle perspective into the various aspects of our value chain  and we  pay  particular  attention  to  involving  our  partners  in environmental management.\n\nHaving  a  certified  EMS enables  us  to  ensure  that  we successfully  control  and  comply  with  the  environmental legislation  applicable  to  each  operation  and  it  is  the preventive  model  of  compliance  is  associated  with  the Company's overall compliance process. We were not subject to any significant environmental penalties in 2020.\n\nIn addition, we maintained the Energy Management Systems (ISO 50001)  certification  for  our  operations  in  Spain  and Germany and are working to expand it to other operations, such as Brazil (the EcoBerrini headquarters has already been certified).\n\n## 2.9.4.1. Responsible network and biodiversity\n\nWith  the  goal  of  providing  top  quality  service  while  at  the same  time  promoting  care  for  the  environment,  we adequately  monitor  the  environmental  risks  and  impacts related to managing the network throughout its life cycle.  In 2020 we invested around 24 million euros towards this goal (similar to the investment in 2019).\n\nThe main environmental aspects of the network are energy consumption and waste generation, although we manage all\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthese  aspects  through  our  EMS,  such  as  noise  and  water consumption.\n\nAn example of the responsible management of the network is the fact that 98% of our waste was recycled in 2020.\n\nIn order to minimise the impact of network deployment we implement best practices, such as noise insulation measures when  necessary and the sharing of infrastructures. Therefore,  whenever  possible  during  installation  of  our facilities we share space with other operators. This makes it possible  to  keep  the  occupation  of  land,  the  visual  impact, energy consumption and waste generation to a minimum.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE NETWORK LIFE CYCLE\n\n## PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION\n\nEnvironmental licences and permits\n\n5,334\n\nVisual impact reduction measures\n\n484\n\nBase stations with renewable energy\n\n436\n\n## OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\n\nEnergy efficiency projects\n\n173\n\nRenewable energy (%)\n\n87.5\n\nEmissions (scopes 1+2) (tCO2eq)\n\n743,366\n\nNo. of measurements of electromagnetic fields\n\n48,956\n\nEnergy consumption by traffic (MWh/PB)\n\n78\n\nDISMANTLING\n\nNetwork equipment reused\n\n855\n\nHazardous waste (t)\n\n4,872\n\nTotal waste recycled (%)\n\n98 %\n\nWith  regard  to  biodiversity,  the  impact  of  our  facilities  is limited,  although we conduct environmental impact studies and implement corrective measures when necessary, such as in protected areas.\n\nIn order to analyse the impact of the Group's infrastructure on  biodiversity  in  more  detail,  a  Geographic  Information System (GIS) was used to put together the area occupied by each type of infrastructure and different layers of information  about  protected  spaces  and  species  obtained from  renowned  international  organisations,  such  as  the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This information  has  enabled  us  to  establish  the  quality  of  the habitats in which some type of the Company's infrastructure is present (classifying them into five levels, from very low to very  high)  and  assess  the  potential  impact  on  biodiversity (destruction of vegetation or habitat disturbance in the area of influence, such as fragmentation, alteration or introduction  of  invasive  species).  As  a  result,  it  has  been observed that practically all  facilities  are  in  low  or  very  low value  habitats,  and  none  are  in  habitats  with  a  very  high value; therefore, the potential impact on biodiversity is very limited.",

Our emissions are 61.1%% lower than in 2015.\n\nDigititalisation is essential for decarbonising other sectors. In 2020 we avoided 9.5 million tCO 2 for our customers thanks to the high penetration of digitisation during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe intensive use of energy in the current economic model is one of the main causes of climate change. Energy is also an essential  resource  in  developing  our  business.  Due  to  this link,  we  have  created  a  strategy  that  includes  managing energy and climate change.\n\nClimate change is one of the major challenges we face, as its impact  is  increasingly  evident  in  society,  the  economy  and the environment. Scientists have shown us that this decade is key, and we have to cut emissions by half and achieve net zero by 2050 at a global level. Organisations like the World Economic Forum identify climate change as one of the major risk  factors  for  the  world's  economy  and  the  investment world  is  increasingly  aware  of  the  need  to  focus  on sustainable  investments  that  are  transparent  about  the climate risks and do well in a decarbonised economy.\n\nOur  energy  and  climate  change  strategy,  aligned  with  the business  strategy,  enables  us  to  cover  every  aspect  of  this global phenomenon;  we  take  on  mitigation,  leverage opportunities and adapt by managing the risks.\n\nWe implemented the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  to  meet  the demands  of  our  main  stakeholders  and  the  transparency required in this area. The TCFD reference information can be seen in the point 2.13.10. on the  Appendix Chapter.\n\nOur sector is demonstrating that it is increasingly important for the decarbonised economy, and Telef\u00f3nica is committed to  preventing  the  digitaliisation  process  from  leading  to  an increase in CO 2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, for the seventh consecutive year, we were given the highest  ' A ' rating  by  the  CDP  with  regard  to  climate change .  The  A  List  includes  companies  that  meet  the  top criteria  in  terms  of  strategy,  targets  and  actions  related  to the risks and opportunities of climate change. Our efforts to reduce emissions in our supply chain were also acknowledged  as  we  received  an  \"A\" rating  in  the  Supplier Engagement Rating (SER) 2020 from the CDP.\n\nWe can identify opportunities in a low carbon economy for both internal energy management and business growth, by selling products that reduce our customers' carbon emissions\n\n## 2.10.1. Climate change governance\n\nThe  energy  and  climate  change  strategy  is  part  of  the Responsible Business Plan, headed by the Board of Directors. The  Sustainability  and  Quality  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors  supervises  the  implementation  of  the  strategy, revises the risks related to climate change and monitors the climate goals. This Committee meets monthly.\n\nThe Global Energy Efficiency and Climate Change Office is in charge  of  implementing  the  strategy.  It  comprises  global areas  like  Operations,  the  Environment  and  Procurement, and has been operational for over 10 years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The event  was  held  virtually  and  brought  together  more than  1,000  people.  The  aim,  once  again,  was  to  take advantage of the current opportunities in this field and foster  innovation  to  reduce  energy  consumption  and our carbon footprint globally. In addition, the Telef\u00f3nica  Energy  Efficiency  and  Climate  Change Awards were presented during the course of the event.\n\n## 2.10.2. Energy and climate change strategy: Moving towards net zero\n\nOur  energy  and  climate  change  strategy  centres  on mitigating our impact, leveraging opportunities and adapting ourselves by managing climate risks.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we are committed to reducing our own carbon footprint,  and,  more  significantly,  we  deliver  solutions  to reduce our customers' emissions.\n\nGiven its  transversal  and  global  nature,  climate  change  has been integrated into the management of the core aspects of the  Company,  such  as  governance,  strategy,  risks  and targets.\n\nWe  have  ambitious  targets  and  plans  for  transforming  the Company to achieve them. The main ones are:\n\n- \u00b7 More efficient transformation of our telecommunications networks\n- \u00b7 The Renewable Energy Plan\n- \u00b7 The incorporation of carbon pricing\n- \u00b7 The emission neutralisation strategy\n- \u00b7 A portfolio of products with environmental benefits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.10.2.1. Emission neutralisation strategy\n\nThe Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has defined the concept  of  \"net  zero  emissions\" as  achieving  a  balance between  the  amount  of  emissions  released  by  a  company and those it removes or eliminates from the atmosphere.\n\nThe commitment to achieving net zero emissions, according to this organisation, includes two premises:\n\n- \u00b7 Reducing our CO 2 emissions in line with the 1.5 \u00baC scenario of the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 Neutralising remaining emissions through capturing or permanently absorbing an equivalent amount of CO 2 from the atmosphere through carbon credits.\n\nAt  Telef\u00f3nica  we  subscribe  to  this  definition and  we  are committed to reducing the emissions of our entire value chain in line with the 1.5 \u00baC scenario and to neutralising the  remainder  by  purchasing  CO 2 absorption  carbon credits, preferably through nature-based solutions .\n\n## Carbon credits\n\nThe carbon credits we rely on to neutralise emissions must meet  a  number  of  criteria  that  we  have  established internally:\n\n- \u00b7 Carbon  sequestration  projects  (permanent  fixing  of  CO 2 from the atmosphere) should preferably use nature-based solutions.\n- \u00b7 There should be a demonstration of additionality.\n- \u00b7 There should be a demonstration of permanent impact.\n- \u00b7 There should be alignment with social and environmental co-benefits,  in  line  with  the  Sustainable  Development Goals contributed to by Telef\u00f3nica.\n- \u00b7 There should be use of reputable standards.\n- \u00b7 There should be verification by an accredited third party.\n- \u00b7 It should preferably have territorial anchorage with regard to the geographical regions in which Telef\u00f3nica is present.\n\nOur  operation  in  Brazil  was  the  first  to  compensate 100% of its remaining emissions in 2020 through carbon credits  (not  neutralising).  The  projects  that  generate  these credits are backed by reputable certificates and support local projects  for  both  conserving  ecosystems  and  fostering renewable energy. Brazil will move towards carbon neutrality over  the  next  few  years  with  projects  that  meet  the aforementioned conditions.",

        "page_content": "## 2.10.2.2. Carbon pricing\n\nDeriving  from  our  commitment  to  achieving  net  zero emissions, we use carbon pricing related to the price of the carbon  credits  purchased  in  each  region,  which  helps  us  to make investment and equipment purchase decisions so as to move towards being a net\\_zero emissions company.\n\nIn  addition,  when  purchasing  energy-intensive  equipment, we apply the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). This enables us to bear in mind not just the purchase price but also the price of  the  energy consumed during the equipment's useful life, which helps us to acquire the most efficient equipment and therefore equipment with lower associated carbon emissions.\n\n## 2.10.3. Risks and opportunities of climate change\n\nOur global risk management model enables us to specifically analyse exposure to the potential risks and opportunities of climate  change.  We  perform  the  analysis  under  different scenarios  of  CO 2 concentration  in  the  atmosphere  and different time  scales,  in  accordance  with  the  TCFD's recommendations.\n\nThis analysis enables us to incorporate climate change into long-term business decisions, minimising risks and maximising opportunities for our business.\n\n## 2.10.3.1. Risks\n\nClimate  change  is  one  of  the  basic  risks  in  the  Company's Risk Management Model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the Chapter on Risk management and control model\n\nWe  analyse  our  business's  exposure  to  physical  risks  and also  risks  arising  from  the  transitioning  to  a  decarbonised economy.\n\nTo  this  end,  we  analyse  the  probability  and  impact  of  two CO 2 concentration scenarios, the Representative Concentration  Pathway  (RCP)  2.6  and  8.5,  and  on  several medium-term and long-term time scales.\n\nWith  regard  to  physical  risks,  we  study  the  consequences that  gradual  changes  to  the  climate  (temperature,  rainfall, sea  level)  and  extreme  climate  events  can  have  on  our infrastructures and operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegarding the global transition to a decarbonised economy, we  consider  the  risks  that  can  arise  from  changes  in regulation, technological innovation, and those associated to changes in current markets or reputational aspects.\n\nThe  results  of  this  scenario  analysis  indicate  that  in  the RCP2.6  scenario  the  risks,  and  particularly  the  most significant  opportunities  that  would  affect  our  business, relate to the transition - for example, due to the tightening of  the  measures  that  would  be  needed  to  limit  GHG emissions. Given the characteristics of Telef\u00f3nica's business and  our  ambitious  climate  strategy,  this  scenario  would above  all  mean  significant  opportunities  for  our  business, mainly  associated  with  growth  in  our  customers'  needs  for digital solutions to decarbonise their activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the Chapter on Digitalisation and Eco Smart Services\n\nBy contrast, in the RCP8.5 scenario the major risks would be those associated with climate variables, whether temporary (increase in extreme weather events) or chronic (increase in temperature,  variation  in  rainfall).  In  this  scenario,  the  risk associated with the increase in the temperature would entail a greater financial impact for Telef\u00f3nica, as it could generate a significant increase in the power consumed by our network in  order  to  prevent  equipment  breakdowns  which  would impair  the  service.  In  addition,  this  could  be  aggravated  by the  possible  increase  in  the  cost  of  energy  mainly  in countries which rely on hydropower in the event of episodes of drought.\n\nIn  order  to  manage  these  risks,  we  have  lines  of  work  that help  increase  our  resilience  to  climate  change.  Thus,  our strategy  includes  measures  to  adapt  to  both  the  physical changes  and  the  changes  arising  from  a  low  carbon economy.  The  main  measures  are  the  business  continuity plans  for  climate  disasters  and  the  energy  efficiency  and renewable  energy  plans,  which  enable  us  to  reduce  power consumption,  fossil  fuel  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions,  and  ready  us  for  all  the  risks  of  transition: regulatory, technological, market and reputational risks.",

Since 2015, we have managed to stabilise energy consumption, reducing it by 2.4% despite the  fact  that  the  traffic  managed  by  our  networks  has increased more than 5.1 times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 More  renewable  energy:  To  continue  using  100%  of electricity  from  renewable  sources  in  our  main  markets, promoting development through long-term contracts and self-generation (HispAm 100% renewable by 2030).\n- \u00b7 To  help  our  customers  reduce  emissions  by  5  million tonnes of CO 2 per year through connectivity and our Eco Smart services in our four main markets.\n\nIn  2020,  total  energy  consumption  per  traffic  dropped  by 80.9% compared to 2015. This was achieved by focusing on energy efficiency and our network transformation process. In addition,  our  electricity  came  entirely  from  renewable sources in Europe, Brazil and Peru (87.5% at a global level).\n\nAll  of  this  led  to  a  61.1% reduction  in  our  Scope  1+2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2015. In addition, our Scope 3 emissions fell by 26.8% compared to 2016.",

Energy efficiency\n\nTo optimise the power consumption of our network, in 2010 we compiled the Energy Efficiency Plan. Since then, we have rolled  out  1,036 projects;  these  have  generated  savings  of more than 772 million euros and  6,678 GWh, with 2,049,590 tCO2eq avoided, thanks to the Global Energy Centre, which was created in 2015 to accelerate efficiency, with managers responsible  for  encouraging  energy  efficiency  projects  in each country.\n\nIn  2020  we  undertook  173 initiatives  in  our  networks  and offices, thanks to which we saved 192GWh (692,507GJ) and avoided the emission of over 43,727 tCO2eq.\n\nThe  global  initiatives  include  modernising  our  network  to increase its efficiency, for example by replacing copper with fibre  optic;  power  plants  and  HVAC  equipment  renovation projects;  using  free  cooling  to  cool  with  air  directly  from outside;  shutting  down  legacy  networks;  implementing power saving  features  in  the  access  network;  and  reducing fuel  consumption  by  implementing  hybrid  stations  with photovoltaic solar energy.\n\n## Energy saving in energy efficiency projects\n\nTOTAL 192.4 GWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Network transformation\n\nClimate control\n\nModernization of network equipment\n\nLighting\n\nPower Saving Features\n\nOthers\n\nThis  effort  is  reflected  in  an  80.9% improvement  in  our energy  consumption  to  traffic  ratio  compared  to  2015.  In 2020 we transmitted 87,770 PB through our networks and\n\ncontinued  on  the  path  to  decoupling  the  growth  of  our services  from  energy  consumption.  In  2020  we  also presented  the  results  of  a  real  measurement  study  which showed that 5G technology is up to 90% more efficient than 4G  in  terms  of  energy  consumption  per  traffic  unit  (W/ Mbps). The study was carried out on the access network for the 5G NSA pilot projects deployed in Brazil (S\u00e3o Paulo and R\u00edo)  and  Spain  (Segovia),  and  at  the  5G  NSA  sites  already installed  in  Germany  (Berlin  and  Munich),  where  a  team  of experts has measured the energy consumption of 5G using equipment from the main suppliers of the industry in various traffic  and  network configuration scenarios. In addition, the activation  of  new  energy  saving  functionalities  for  5G,  also known  as  power  savings  features  (PSF),  showed  us  a potential saving of between 20% and 30% of consumption in low-traffic periods.\n\nWe also implemented a disruptive model in Colombia, using the Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, which enables us to reduce fuel consumption and pay with the savings achieved. This project will enable us to increase the autonomy of the batteries at 170 sites and will reduce diesel consumption by more than 70%. This means a saving of nearly 500,000 litres of  diesel  a  year,  reduced  maintenance  costs  and  greater availability for customers.\n\n## Renewable Energy Plan\n\nTo reach the point of decarbonisation of the Company, not only do we need maximum efficiency in energy usage but we also need the energy to come from renewable sources.\n\nTo do this, Telef\u00f3nica has a Renewable Energy Plan, whereby 100% of our electricity in Europe, Brazil and Peru and 87.5% worldwide comes from zero emissions sources. Our goal is to go  further  than  100%  in  our  main  markets,  and  achieve 100% in  HispAm  in  2030  or  even  before.  By  \"further  than 100%\", we are referring to our endeavours to contribute to increasing  the  renewable  energy  mix  in  the  countries  in which  we  operate,  through  self-generation  or  by  fostering the  construction  of  new  parks,  facilitated  by  our  mediumand long-term consumption commitments.\n\nSimilarly,  switching  to  clean  energy  also  reduces  our operating costs and makes us less dependent on fluctuations in  fossil  fuel  prices.  Our  Renewable  Energy  Plan  projects  a potential savings of around 25% on energy OpEx by 2030.\n\nThe Plan includes all types of solutions -self-generation, the purchasing  of  renewable  energy  with  a  guarantee  of  origin",

This  also  allows  us  to  avoid  using  fuelpowered generators in isolated base stations, thus achieving a reduction in fuel consumption of between 70% and 100%. It  is  important  to  highlight  the  role  that  each  country's regulations can play in fostering these types of facilities.\n\nIn Spain,  we  have  implemented  photovoltaic  electrical energy  self-generation  systems  in  several  buildings,  where solar production is used for self-supply (without excess being sent  to  the  grid)  under  two  models,  the  first  with  our  own CapEx and the second under a service model where we pay for the electricity generated at a lower rate than the market rate, obtaining OpEx savings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, a total of 4,918 GWh of our consumption came from renewable energy. This enabled us to avoid the emission of around  911,070 tonnes  of  CO 2 ,  which  demonstrates  that renewable energies are key to achieving the decarbonisation of our activity and reducing our carbon footprint in absolute terms.\n\n100% of the power consumed in Europe, Brazil and Peru comes from renewable sources, 87.5% at global level\n\n## 2.10.6. CO 2 emissions in detail\n\nGRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5\n\nWe  calculate  and  reduce  our  carbon  footprint  every  year, including direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions from electricity consumption  (Scope  2)  and  other  indirect emissions  related  to  our  value  chain  (Scope  3).  Our calculation method is based on the GHG Protocol and the ISO 14,064 standard.\n\nOur targets for 2025 are to reduce Scope 1+2 emissions by 90%  in  our  main  markets  (70%  globally),  reduce  Scope  3 emissions by 39% and, finally, to achieve net zero emissions by  2040,  (2025  for  our  main  markets  and  our  own operations)\n\n.",

Scope 1\n\nOur  Scope  1  emissions  come  from  two  main  sources:  fuel consumption  and  fugitive  emissions  of  refrigerant  gases from  air  conditioning  units.  We  reduce  these  through different initiatives, such as replacing fuel-powered generators with renewable self-generation and cooling units with free cooling or with other units whose refrigerant gases have lower warming potential. Through these measures we have reduced emissions of this Scope by 28.4% compared to 2015,  which  represents  a  reduction  of  84,359 tonnes  of CO 2 eq emissions in 5 years.\n\n## 2.10.6.2. Scope 2\n\nScope 2 emissions, from power consumption, are the most significant  in  our  business.  The  actions  we  carry  out  to reduce  them  are  based  on  implementing  energy  efficiency projects  and  on  transitioning  to  a  greater  proportion  of renewable  electricity.  Through  these  actions,  in  2020  we reduced our Scope 2 emissions by 67.1% compared to 2015,\n\nwhich represents a reduction of 1,084,462 tonnes of CO 2 eq in 5 years.\n\n## Without our Renewable Energy Plan, Telef\u00f3nica's emissions would have more than doubled\n\n## 2.10.6.3. Scope 3\n\nThe main Scope 3 emissions of our value chain come from the  categories  related  to  purchases  from  our  supply  chain, and  usage  of  the  products  and  services  we  sell  to  our customers. In 2020, these emissions amounted to 1,909,321 tCO 2 eq, 26.8% less than in 2016.\n\n56% comes  from  our  supply  chain  due  to  purchases  of products and services and acquisitions of capital goods.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Categories  with  a contribution of under 5% to the total emissions of our value chain are not considered relevant.\n\n## Reducing the emissions of our value chain\n\nWith  the  goal  of  reducing  our  Scope  3  emissions,  we  have been working with our most important suppliers in terms of emissions for 2 years on the Supplier Engagement Programme. The suppliers who participate in this programme are selected on the basis of the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of their emissions (contribution to our Scope 3).\n- \u00b7 Degree of maturity in their handling of climate change.\n- \u00b7 Strategic importance for Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nThe aim of the programme is to gather information from our suppliers  so  as  to  understand  the  maturity  level  of  their climate  strategies  and  help  them  set  more  ambitious emissions  reduction  targets  through  specific  webinars  and recognition of the advances they have made.\n\n- In  2020,  we  invited  more  suppliers  to  participate  in  the programme and ran workshops with them to inspire them to take  action.  In  addition,  we  developed  a  forum  for  best practices to foster innovation and  the  exchange  of experiences.\n\nThe suppliers included in this programme represent 66% of the  emissions  from  our  supply  chain  and  37%  of  our  total Scope 3 emissions.\n\nEach  new  supplier  defined  targets  relating  to  managing  its footprint  on  different  topics  such  as  energy,  emissions, transport,  product  (life-cycle  analysis),  carbon  pricing  and \"100\" initiatives.  We  continued  to  support  suppliers  which had  already  made  this  commitment  in  succeeding  in  their reduction  projects  and  we  also  began  joint  collaboration projects in this area.\n\nIn  2020,  we  created  a  new  sector-based  working  group  as part of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) initiative, in order, as  a  telecommunications  sector,  to  drive  climate  action  in our supply chain. We assessed the climate-related maturity of the strategic suppliers of the 17 companies who are part of  the  conglomerate  and  began  working  along  several different lines in order to increase their level of ambition, as well  as  providing  training  in  collaboration  with  CDP  and GSMA for the major Chinese companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother significant action in 2020 related to our commitment  to  working  with  the  supply  chain  was  to  join the \"1.5 \u00baC Supply Chain Leaders\" initiative, which advocates reducing the emissions of the small and medium enterprises that are part of our value chain. This programme enables us to  reinforce  our  role  in  the  value  chain  and  accelerate  the decarbonisation of the global economy.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  working  to  reduce  emissions  from  the products and services we sell to our customers, mainly due to  the  electricity  consumed  by  routers  and  television decoders in their homes. We are going to continue working on ecodesigns for these devices. Currently, our HGU (Home Gateway Unit) consumes 30% less energy than our earlier solutions.",

We recycle 98% of our waste.\n\nWe promote the circular economy in the use of electronic devices through ecodesign, re-use and recycling, as we move towards the status of a zero-waste company. Since 2015, we have increased the re-use of equipment by more than 451%.\n\nWe encourage the circular economy by placing more value on the materials we remove during our network transformation process, so that they are re-introduced into the production model. Last year, these efforts led to revenues of over 131 million euros for Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n## 2.11.1. Strategy and lines of action\n\nThe circular economy is a different way of understanding the economy;  it  focuses  on  improving  efficiency  in  the  use  of resources,  reducing  dependence  on  raw  materials  and mitigating  climate  change,  while  contributing  economic value  and  growth.  This  concept  not  only  revolutionises conventional  paradigms  but  also  provides  challenges  and opportunities for digitalisation, as it needs a hyperconnected society to achieve it.\n\nWe integrate this philosophy throughout the life cycle of our Company.  We  focus  on  optimising  the  consumption  of resources  and  promoting  the  return  of  used  goods  to  the production  cycle;  to  achieve  this,  we  mainly  focus  on  our purchases,  efficient  management  of  the  network  and provision of customer services for this purpose.\n\nWe undertake to promote the circular economy in the use of electronic equipment through ecodesign, re-use and recycling,  and  we  have  set  a  main  goal  of  moving  towards being a zero-waste company .\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica's principles for promoting the circular economy:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting  the  development  of  an  enabling  regulatory framework for the circular economy.\n- \u00b7 Reducing  waste  generation  and  fostering  reuse  and recycling.\n- \u00b7 Guaranteeing  proper  processing  with  controls  on  our supply chain.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- \u00b7 Offering  our  customers  environmental  information  about their telephone purchases (ecorating) and alternatives for the disposal of their used devices.\n- \u00b7 Promoting the best ecodesign by manufacturers.\n\nIn accordance with these principles, we implement actions to foster the circular economy in our internal eco-efficiency and in our relations with customers and suppliers. The principles are the following:\n\n## Lines of action\n\n| Internal eco- efficiency        | Customers                                    | Suppliers                                 |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Water Paper                     | Ecodesign in products and services           | Global Waste  Management  System (GReTel) |\n| Single-use plastics             | Repurchase and refurbishing of mobile phones | Eco-efficient  purchasing                 |\n| Reuse of  electronic  equipment | Repurchase and refurbishing of mobile phones | Eco-efficient  purchasing                 |\n| Waste                           | Ecorating                                    | Eco-efficient  purchasing                 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Water GRI 303-5\n\nOur water consumption is mainly due to sanitary use and, to a lesser extent, its use in air conditioning. We adopt specific\n\nmeasures to achieve more efficient consumption, especially in areas where the water stress is greater and in accordance with local limitations and regulations.\n\nIn 2020, our overall consumption was 2,785 ML ( 2.8 Hm\u00b3), with water consumption in high-water-stress areas amounting  to  750 ML,  which  means  27% of  total  water consumption for all areas.\n\nMeasures to reduce water consumption in high-waterstress areas\n\nThe series of measures set out by each country depending on  its  environmental  characteristics,  includes  measures  to",

Paper\n\nWe  have  established  guidelines  to  reduce  the  impact  of paper consumption. Thanks to these, 79% of the paper that we  consumed  in  our  offices  last  year  was  of  recycled  or certified origin (FSC or PEFC).\n\nAnother example of eco-efficiency is the digitalisation of our customers'  invoices.  In  2020,  98 million  customers  chose paperless  invoices.  We  therefore  generated  more  than 912 million electronic invoices, which avoided the consumption of 4,562 tonnes  of  paper  and  the  felling  of  approximately 77,546 trees.\n\n## 2.11.2.3. Single-use plastics\n\nInitiatives  were  implemented  in  every  country  to  eliminate single-use plastics, from plastic bags in stores to single-use plastic  cups  and  other  plastic  packaging  in  offices.  At  our headquarters alone (Distrito Telef\u00f3nica, in Madrid), through the elimination of more than nine tonnes of single-use plastic from  plastic  cups  at  drinking  fountains  and  in  vending machines,  and  replacing  coffee  stirrers  with  compostable alternatives,  we  prevented  the  emission  of  23,476  kgCO 2, which  is  equivalent  to  the  consumption  of  over  2  million smartphones.",

        "page_content": "## 2.11.2.4. Re-use of electronic equipment GRI 301-3\n\nTaking  into  account  the  waste  hierarchy  of  waste  in  the circular  economy,  our  main  commitment  is  to  prevent  and reduce waste generation, mainly by supporting the re-use of used  equipment,  as  the  best  waste  is  the  one  that  is  not produced. All this enables us to be more competitive, reduce our expenses and increase our revenue, whilst reducing our footprint  on  the  environment  and  complying  with  the applicable legal regulations.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, it is estimated that by 2040 carbon emissions from the production and use of electronic devices will represent 14% of total emissions. To reduce its impact,  Telef\u00f3nica  extends  the  useful  life  of  its  devices  by reusing  them  whenever  possible  and  if  they  cannot  be reused,  the  best  option  is  to  recycle  them,  because  each device  contains  precious  metals  such  as  gold,  copper  and nickel,  which  can  be  used  as  resources  in  a  new  product. According  to  the  International  Telecommunication  Union (ITU), there  is  100  times  more  gold  in  a  tonne  of smartphones than in a tonne of gold ore.\n\nDue to this, out of the total amount of electronic equipment collected  in  2020,  74% went  to  be  recycled  and  25% was reused,  while  nearly  0.1% was  incinerated  or  destined  for landfill. Thanks to this measure, we were able to give new life to 4 million communication equipment units, thus preventing 3855 tonnes of CO 2 from being emitted. Due to the COVID-19  situation, we  collected less electronic equipment at our stores in  2020.  However,  since  2015,  we have increased the re-use of equipment by 451%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.11.2.5. Waste GRI 306-2, 301-3\n\nWhen  re-use  is  not  an  option, recycling  is  the  best alternative for the treatment of waste. Network infrastructure maintenance is our main generator of waste, along with the administrative activities that we carry out at our offices and, to a lesser extent, our commercial activities with our customers. In 2020 we generated 46,912 tonnes of waste and we managed to recycle 98% of this total.\n\nAbout  89% of  the  waste  we  generate  comes  from  our network  transformation  process,  when  we  migrate  from copper  cables  to  fibre  optics.  In  2020,  this  transformation process  was  accelerated  thanks  to  the  Granada  Plan  for closing stations in Spain and the Vivo Mar\u00eda do Carmo Project in Brazil, thus increasing the value of the waste reported by 12% in  the  last  year.  Of  the  total  amount of waste, almost 77% was cable waste.\n\nCables  cannot  be  reused  but  they  can  be  retrieved  and recycled.  We  are  thus  promoting  the  circular  economy  by giving value to the materials we remove so that they can be re-introduced  into  the  production  model.  Thanks  to  these efforts,  Telef\u00f3nica  generated  revenues  of  over  131 million euros.",

Customers\n\nOne of the Sustainable Development Goals we would like to emphasise is the development of a sustainable consumption and  production  model.  We  are  therefore  developing  new products and initiatives that our customers can use to reduce their  environmental  impact  and  join  the  challenge  of  the circular economy.\n\n## 2.11.3.1. Ecodesign in products and services\n\nEcodesign criteria help us to reduce the use of raw materials in  manufacture,  reduce  the  energy  consumption  of  the product  and  avoid  emissions.  The  main  projects  we  are undertaking in this respect are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Smart  Wifi  Router: Thanks  to  the  integration  of equipment and a reduction in components, our Smart WiFi Router weighs 40% less than a conventional router due to its  using  less  plastic,  metals  and  other  elements.  In  this way,  we  reduce  the  emissions  associated  with  the extraction of these materials by reducing its consumption. Another way to reduce the emissions associated with our routers  is  by  improving,  by  design,  the  device's  energy efficiency  during  use.  Thanks  to  this,  our  HGU  (Home Gateway  Unit)  uses  30%  less  energy,  thus  reducing  the carbon emissions produced by our customers (Scope 3).\n- \u00b7 Half SIM Card: We have cut by half the amount of plastic used  to  manufacture  SIM  cards.  In  2020,  this  measure averted the manufacture and consumption of 121 tonnes of plastic, signifying savings of 413 tonnes of CO 2 .  It  also represents  an  improvement  in  the  efficiency  of  the logistics process,  as  it  reduces  the  volume  of  the containers used for their transportation and storage. The\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHalf  SIM  Card  format  has  already  been  implemented  at eight of our operations and is consolidating its position as the main SIM card format in the Group.\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability applied to Responsibility by Design: We integrate ecodesign from the conception phase through to the  development  and  the  finalisation  of  products  and services  in  order  to  reduce  their  impact  on  the  planet during their entire life cycle. This integration is organised around  three  basic  pillars:  design,  use  and  end  of  useful life. Thanks to this, we can incorporate criteria such as how repairable  the  hardware  we  offer  is,  sturdiness,  energy efficiency, waste  management  and  sustainability  of materials from the very first phase of creating a product or service. (More information is available in the Responsibility section in the Chapter on Customers).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Clients\n\n## 2.11.3.2. Repurchase and refurbishing of mobiles\n\nWith our policies to extend the useful life of communication equipment (both those devices belonging to customers and our  own  equipment),  we  have  managed  to  reduce  the consumption  of  resources  and  energy  by  avoiding  the manufacture of new equipment. We offer our customers the option of repurchasing and refurbishing mobile phones.\n\nThrough  this  initiative,  our  customers  can  hand  in  their unused  mobile  devices  to  give  them  a  second  life  or  be recycled without damaging the environment. In 2020, thanks to these programmes we collected 209,388 mobile phones. Furthermore,  we  facilitated  the  reuse  of  mobile  phones through the leasing or sale of used handsets in some of our markets, such as in the United Kingdom with the O 2 Refresh programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spain: An integral management service for repairing electronic devices (Zeleris):\n\nIn line with the Right to Repair of the European Green Deal, our company, Zeleris, launched a repair services for electronic devices under warranty and outside warranty for individuals and companies in Spain. This technical service offers a significant advantage and follows a comprehensive management model that encompasses initial contact with the customer through to collection of the device, repair and delivery. Thanks to this repair service, Zeleris helps its customers foster the circular economy in their homes and reduce waste generation by increasing the useful life of their connected devices, which have grown constantly in number in recent years.",

        "page_content": "## 2.11.3.3. Ecorating\n\nWhen  purchasing  a  new  telephone,  our  customers  can consult  the  ecorating  of  the  different  handsets  in  the catalogue. This is a seal which rates the device's environmental  sustainability  level.  The  score  is  based  on methodology that assesses the environmental impact of the life  cycle  of  the  devices,  including  indicators  such  as  global warming, the use of raw materials and ease of recycling.\n\nIn 2020, we managed to obtain the ecorating seal for 86% of our portfolio, with an average score of 3.2. To date, we have provided information about the ecorating of our devices in 10 countries.  This  information  serves  to  foster  innovation  and the implementation of the most favourable practices for the environment throughout the production cycle, and especially among our suppliers.\n\n## 2.11.4. Suppliers in the circular economy GRI 308-2\n\nWe have integrated the philosophy of the circular economy into  our  relationship  with  our  suppliers,  who  are  essential allies in this transition. We  focus  on  optimising  the consumption  of  resources  and  stimulating  the  return  of materials to the production cycle.\n\nFurthermore,  we  are  promoting  the  reduction  of  GHG emissions by our suppliers and we are working with them on this challenge (more information is available in the Scope 3 section of the Chapter '2.10.6. CO 2 emissions in detail').\n\n## 2.11.4.1. Global Waste Management System (GReTel)\n\nThe  GReTel  platform  is  a  digital  corporate  tool  that centralises, facilitates and  simplifies  the  entire  waste management  operation  in  a  single  place,  while  improving traceability in management and identifying opportunities to foster the circular economy. Examples of this are recognising the  best  processing  options  available  per  territory  and generating  economic  value  through  the  sale  of  recoverable waste.\n\nThanks to the configuration of the platform, we enable our waste  management  providers  to  create  reports  with  the necessary  technical  specifications  for  reporting  to  the  local public  authorities,  as  the  tool  adapts  to  the  regulatory requirements where the waste is located.\n\n## 2.11.4.2. Eco-efficient purchasing\n\nWe  are  aware  of  the  opportunities  available  during  the acquisition of products and services to minimise the impact that these could have on the environment. Therefore, within the  framework  of  our Global  Supply  Chain  Sustainability Policy , we  have  incorporated  environmental  and  circular economy  criteria  such  as  the  compulsory  incorporation  of preventive  measures  and  life  cycle  analysis  (LCA)  when supplying Telef\u00f3nica with products or services. One example of this is the inclusion of criteria regarding the elimination of single-use plastics in the packaging of products and services supplied to Telef\u00f3nica United Kingdom.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurthermore, in this area we have introduced guidelines for reducing  the  impact  of  refrigerant  gases  on  our  carbon footprint.  For  this  purpose,  the  recharging  of  CFC  or  HCFC gases that deplete the ozone layer has been limited, ahead of the  deadlines  dictated  by  international  agreements,  giving preference  to  gases  that  have  lower  global  warming potential.\n\nTo  achieve  our  target  of  consuming  100%  renewable electricity,  the  purchase  of  renewable  energy  plays  a  key role;  it  is  implemented  by  means  of  the  acquisition  of renewable energy guarantees of origin and by signing longterm  contracts  (Power  Purchase  Agreements  - PPA).

Digitalisation and Eco Smart Services\n\n## KEY PIOINTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDigitalisation will be crucial for decarbonising other sectors of the economy.\n\nIn 2020 we avoided 9.5 million tCO 2 for our customers, three times more than the previous year, thanks to the high penetration of digitalisation during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIn 2020 we launched the Eco Smart seal, validated by AENOR, to encourage our customers to progress in their environmental challenges.\n\n## 2.12.1. Strategy and objectives\n\nCOVID-19 has demonstrated the fragility of our society in the face of such global threats as climate change. This generates and fosters a large number of problems, many of which are of a similar magnitude to the coronavirus pandemic, or greater: extreme climate events, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, health problems, climate-driven migrations, etc.\n\nThe experts and the latest scientific studies are of one mind: the best vaccine we have for the future is to protect nature.\n\nTelecommunications  are  part  of  the  solution  to  this challenge  as  they  can  help  other  companies  to  transform digitally and to carry on their activities more sustainably. For this reason, the latest data published by the World Economic Forum  and  the  Exponential  Roadmap  indicate  that  digital technologies  can  help  reduce  worldwide  emissions  by between 15% and 35% in the next 10 years.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, we are committed to achieving a world in which technology contributes to protecting the planet\n\nDue to this, after  reducing  the  impact  of  our  operations  on the  environment  as  much  as  possible,  the  second  driver  of our  environmental  strategy is  to  boost  digitalisation  and connectivity  as  key  levers  that  help  our  customers  to become more efficient and sustainable .\n\n## 2.12.1.1.  Objectives  to  help  our  customers  to decarbonise their activities\n\nOur digital and connectivity services -based on one of the most efficient and cleanest telecommunications networks in the  sector-  enable  our  customers  to  optimise  their consumption  of  resources  such  as  energy  and  water;  they facilitate remote working; they improve traffic planning and air quality in cities; and they promote the circular economy.\n\nIn  order  to  continue  our  progress  in  this  strategy,  we  have increased  our  ambitions  and  set  ourselves  the  target  of helping  our  customers  avoid  the  emission  of  5  million  tCO 2 by 2025 through our products and services. This target was calculated on the basis of a return to normal. In a situation without  COVID-19,  our  results  for  2020  in  our  four  main markets would have been 3 million tCO 2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Eco Smart products and services\n\nOur business strategy centres on the digital revolution, which is  why  we  provide  services  based  on  connectivity,  the Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  the  Cloud  and  Big  Data.  Most  of these are what we call Eco Smart solutions, as they promote the  digital  transformation  of  our  customers  and  also generate significant environmental benefits in their production  processes  or  daily  activities,  enabling  them  to carry on their business more efficiently and sustainably. For example,  IoT  services  make  it  possible  to  enhance  the efficiency of the use of resources such as energy and water; with Big Data we are helping to improve traffic planning and air  quality;  and  with  drone-based  services  and  connectivity we can improve fire responses.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  launched  the  Eco  Smart  seal  to  identify  the environmental  benefits  generated  by  our  products  and services following implementation. In this way, we help our customers  to  incorporate  sustainability  criteria  into  their purchasing  decisions  so  that  they  can  contribute  to  the transformation to a more sustainable society.\n\nThe  environmental  benefits  that  are  generated  by  our services  and  represented  by  the  seal  have  been  externally validated  by  AENOR,  thereby  verifying  that 52%  of  the services  we  provide  to  large,  medium  and  small enterprises in Spain generate environmental benefits for these customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  Tech was  created  in  2019  to  be  the  unit responsible  for  the  Cloud,  Cyber  Security,  and  IoT  and  Big Data businesses in the B2B segment at the Telef\u00f3nica Group.

Connectivity\n\nWe are  committed  to  digitalisation  as  a  tool  for  protecting the planet. Our networks form the basis of the connectivity and  other  digital  solutions  we  offer  our  customers.  This  is why  our  sustainability  strategy  focuses  on  transforming them so that their capacity can always increase efficiently. This  enables  us  to  offer  the  best  services  with  the  least environmental impact.\n\nWithin this transformation, we have focused on fibre optics as  a  replacement  for  copper  -  a  shift  geared  towards improving the capacities of our customers at a technological level  and  one  that  consumes  85%  less  energy  as  well.  It  is with this same  vision that we are executing the transformation at the core of the communications network, making  it  more  sustainable  through  two  crucial  tools: consumption of renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nThanks  to  this,  we  can  offer  one  of  the  sector's  most sustainable  networks  as  a  basis  from  which  to  expand  the digital  economy,  thereby  strengthening  its  benefits  to  the environment and assisting the transition to a decarbonised society\n\nBased  on  this  connectivity,  we  offer  digital  solutions  as products. These include broadband, fibre, and Digital Work Place, Cloud, IOT and Big Data solutions.\n\n## 2.12.2.2. Digital Work Place\n\nProductivity and collaboration solutions allow people inside the organisation and outside it (customers, suppliers, etc.) to be  able  to  connect  and  work  remotely.  Therefore,  these solutions enable remote and flexible working, which generate considerable environmental benefits by reducing travel and cutting fuel consumption and office HVAC. All this translates into  lower  CO 2 emissions  and  an  easing  of  traffic  on  the roads, thereby helping to reduce air pollution in cities.\n\n## 2.12.2.3. The Cloud\n\nCompanies are increasingly trusting in the Cloud to carry out an  endless  number  of  processes  that  help  them  become more  agile,  flexible  and  efficient.  The  Cloud  offers  them  a place  to  safely  integrate  all  their  networks  and  services, provides  instant  access  to  critical  information  and  greater control  of  their  business,  and  increases  the  engagement among their employees.\n\nWe are committed to offering customers the solutions that best  meet  their  needs  and  therefore  we  have  a  complete portfolio  of  global  services  -enhanced  through  worldwide agreements  with  the  main  hyperscalers,  including  AWS, Google and Microsoft Azure- which enables us to offer the service each company needs, wherever they need it.",

Medium PUE in our main Data Center was 1,7 in 2020. Due to this, the migration by  companies  to  the  Cloud  translates  into  a  significant reduction  in  carbon  emissions  in  the  area  of  information technology,  promotes  greater  circularity,  and  fosters  more sustainable products and services. It makes it possible to do more with less, which leads to an eco-friendlier balance and a greener planet.\n\n## 2.12.2.4. Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, artificial intelligence and blockchain\n\nTechnologies  like  IoT,  Big  Data,  artificial  intelligence  and blockchain are essential to reactivating the economy, but not only  for  the  recovery  of  companies  and  bodies;  they  also have  a  considerable  impact  on  other  aspects  of  daily  life, which  will  enable  the  transformation  of  society  towards  a greener model.\n\nBy combining IoT with Big Data and artificial intelligence, the possibilities  are  infinite.

All this can be seen in services like:\n\n- \u00b7 Smart energy meters for  our  customers,  such  as  in  the case  of  Spain  and  the  United  Kingdom  where  Telef\u00f3nica manages millions of connected gas, water and electricity meters.\n- \u00b7 Solutions for smart cities ,  based  on  optimising  lighting, use  of  parking  spaces,  and  waste  management  and collections.\n- \u00b7 Energy  efficiency  solutions, telemetry  and  remote management  of  energy  consumption  at  the  offices, factories  or  buildings  of  companies  with  many  widely geographically dispersed sites,  such  as  hotels,  banks  and supermarkets, among others.\n- \u00b7 Agricultural management solutions such as Smart Agro, which  enables  innovation,  digitalisation  and  analysis  of data  on  such  crops  as  coffee  and  cotton  with  the  aim  of optimising the use of resources.\n- \u00b7 E-health  solutions to  facilitate  remote  health  care through  mobile  devices  and  apps  that  enable  the monitoring  of  patient  symptoms,  prevent  unnecessary trips  to  healthcare  centres  and  enablie  early  detection  of problems that could lead to a hospital admissions.\n- \u00b7 Solutions  for  the  transport  sector which  help  to optimise planning of transport systems and infrastructure planning  through  greater  understanding  of  travellers, timetables and routes, thereby adapting plans to the real needs of travellers with maximum budgetary control and minimal environmental impact.\n- \u00b7 Mobility  solutions ,  such  as  our  fleet  management  and asset tracking solutions .\n- \u00b7 Solutions for retail through which our business customers  can  improve  customer  experience  while understanding their business better and managing it more efficiently in every respect (for example, stock management and enhanced store layout).\n- \u00b7 Solutions for Industry 4.0 , in which private networks (5G or  LTE)  and  associated  solutions  (for  example,  AGV, drones, predictive maintenance, asset control and operator  safety)  take  the  manufacturing  and  mining industries and management of ports and airports to a new level of operation, flexibility, productivity and efficiency.\n\nIn  addition,  the  inclusion  of  the  technological  capacities  of blockchain in many of the use cases mentioned above leads to  improvements in traceability, transparency and security, enabling  faster  and  more  efficient  forms  of  doing  things. Example of this are its application in the areas of document management  (for  example,  eliminating  the  use  of  paper when managing invoices, official certificates, contracts, and so on), and logistics (providing complete traceability of foods or medication, in manufacturing and throughout the supply chains of all types of goods, etc.), thus boosting the circular economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also look for  innovative  ways  of  using  the  data  to  help develop society. Several projects have been rolled out in this area:\n\n- \u00b7 Prediction  and  analysis  of  high  granularity  of  the  air pollution in cities :  The  use  of  Big  Data  on  mobility  data generated  by  the  mobile  network  is  proving  to  be  an instrument with great potential and high complementarity with sensors that measure air quality and traffic. Artificial intelligence  techniques  even  make  it  possible  to  predict future  pollution  levels.  In  this  way,  the  authorities  are provided  with  tools  with  which  to  prepare  contingency plans. This project was implemented as a pilot in cities like Madrid  (Spain).  In  2020,  in  addition,  a  platform  and  tool were  designed  that  are  capable  of  measuring  pollution caused by mobility through a portable measuring station in vehicles, which  facilitates  a  much  more  precise diagnosis, at street level, of the most problematic pollution focal points.\n- \u00b7 Using  Big  Data to  reduce  emissions  in  the  livestock sector: Telef\u00f3nica and the Food and Agriculture Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  are  working together  on  the  \"Climate-Smart  Agriculture\" project  in Ecuador.  The  aim  is  to  provide  small-  and  medium-sized farmers with information and training on how to improve the sustainability of their crops.\n\n## 2.12.3. Results 2020\n\nThanks  to  the  efficiencies  generated  by  the  products  and services we provide to our customers, the emissions avoided in  2020  exceeded  9.5 million  tonnes  of  CO 2 .  This  figure  is triple the figure of the emissions avoided the previous year, thanks  to  the  high  penetration  of  digitalisation  during  the COVID-19  crisis.  The  result  for  the  four  main  markets:  8.1 million tCO 2\n\nThe carbon saved is equivalent to planting a forest with 158 million trees and shows the capacity of new technologies to accelerate  the  transformation  of  the  economy  into  a  more sustainable model.",

The numbers of people working from home increased exponentially during the months of the lockdown. The most recent studies on the subject reveal that this will be a  longlasting  trend,  as  it  is  expected  that  the  percentage  of  the population working remotely on a permanent basis, once the pandemic is over, will be between 20% and 30%, according to Global Workplace Analytics.",

Structure and consolidation perimeter of non-financial information\n\nGRI 102-10, 102-45, 102-48, 102-49\n\n## The origin of non-financial information\n\nNon-financial information for the group is reported excluding Central America, unless specifically reported.\n\n## Economic and financial information\n\nIt comes  from  the  same  sources  that  produce  the information  included  in  the  Group's  Consolidated  Annual Accounts Report, audited by PwC.\n\n## Innovation\n\nThis is consolidated  through  the  corporate  areas  of Innovation in R&D and open innovation. The source data in these  chapters  comes  from  purchasing  systems  and  is consolidated without proportionality criteria.\n\n## Customers\n\nThis  comes  from  the  management  control  systems  of Telef\u00f3nica  S.A.  and  from  operations  in  the  countries.  The number of the  Company's  total  accesses  does  not  have  to coincide with the partial sum, country by country, since the Corporate  Management  Control  area  uses  consistency criteria to standardise certain access counting criteria.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe  figure comes  from  Corporate  Human  Resources management systems and local management areas. In cases where  consolidated  information  is  given,  the  number  of persons is used as a factor of proportionality.\n\n## Environment and Climate change\n\nThe information comes from the global and country-specific Environment and Operations areas via online questionnaires and  other  IT  support.  Environment  and  energy  data  is consolidated by simple addition and, in the case of climate change,  calculated  by  multiplying  the  activity  data  by  the emission  factor  and  then  adding  by  simple  addition.  The sources  of  the  emission  factors  are  of  recognised  prestige (GHG  Protocol,  DEFRA,  Ministries,  etc.)  and  have  been validated by an independent third party (AENOR).\n\nThe  historical  environmental  and  climate  change  data  are reported without Central America, therefore having the same scope  as  the  2020  information.  Additionally,  to  ensure comparability  with  the  information  reported  in  previous reports,  a  table  has  been  included  which  contains  the  main environmental  KPIs  incorporating  Central  America  for  the year.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nThis comes from the system for awarding contracts through the  Purchasing  areas.  The  information  is  consolidated without  applying  any  criteria  as  a  factor  of  proportionality and it is shown according to country. The chapter containing this information covers the entire economic perimeter of the Telef\u00f3nica  Group.  It  is  important  to  note  the  difference between the figures on supplies in the consolidated financial statements (in accordance with the accrual method and the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Group's accounting consolidation perimeter) and the criterion of purchases awarded used in different sections of  this  report,  which  refers  to  purchases  approved  in  the period  regardless  of  the  method  used  for  accounting  and accrual as an expense.\n\n## Other information\n\nA  list  of  the  companies  comprising  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group, their names, main corporate purpose, country, share capital, percentage  of  effective  ownership  by  the  Group  and  the company  or companies through which the Group's shareholding is obtained can be found in Annex I to the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAll  information  in  this  report  is  given  in  euros,  unless otherwise stated. The exchange rates applied coincide with those  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  Group's  consolidated financial  statements  to  facilitate  the  integral  relationship between financial and non-financial variables.\n\n## 2.13.6. Principles for preparing the Statement of Non-Financial Information / (EINF)\n\nGRI 102-12, 102-32, 102-46, 102-54\n\nThis  Statement  of  Non-Financial  Information  forms  part  of Telef\u00f3nica's  Management  Report  2020  and  includes  the progress made at the Company during the year in economic, social  and  environmental  matters  across  its  value  chain, together  with  its  strategic, development  and  market positioning  so  that  readers  can  better  understand  the sustainability  of  our  business  model  and  its  materiality,  its capacity  to  generate  value  in  terms  of  capital  and  the interaction with stakeholders.\n\nThe  statement  has  been  evaluated  and  approved  by  the Board of Directors since it is part of Telef\u00f3nica's Management Report 2020.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  provides  all  its  stakeholders  with  all  its  public information in order to provide reliable, material, concise and comparable information on the Company's performance, its business  model,  its  value  levers  and  its  strategies  for  the coming years.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica reports non-financial information according to the following standards:\n\n- a. Following the recommendations of the IIRC (International Integrated Reporting Council) and under the general principles of the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (Full Conformity option). (See Table 2.13.11)\n- b. In  accordance  with  Law  11/2018,  of  28  December, which amends the Commercial Code, the consolidated text  of  the  Corporations  Act  approved  by  Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, of 2 July, and Law 22/2015, of  20  July,  on  Accounts  Auditing  and  non-financial information  and  diversity.  Both  compliance  with  the law and the GRI option have subsequently been subject to external verification by PwC. (See Table 2.13.11)\n- c. Following the SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) Telecommunication Services",

The environmental report follows the recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  ClimateRelated  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  (see  section 2.13.10)\n- e. The review of the EINF by PwC has also been conducted under the principles defined by the AA1000AS Standard with values that seek to \"guarantee the quality of the organisation's  Sustainability  Report  and  that  of  the processes,  systems  and  competencies  that  stand  as the basis for application by the entire organisation\".\n\nAdditionally,  Telef\u00f3nica  provides  information  about  its commitment to the following International Regulations:\n\n- a. United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n- b. United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDG) (see Chapter 2.8).\n- c. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n- d.

Principles for the preparation of the Report\n\n## Inclusion of stakeholders\n\nThe chapter on 'How we relate to our stakeholders' identifies these groups and explains how, within reason, Telef\u00f3nica has responded to their expectations and interests.\n\n## Context of sustainability\n\nTelef\u00f3nica contributes to the progress of the communities in which  it  operates  and  their  social  and  environmental sustainability  throughout  its  value  chain  and  at  local, regional, national and international levels: from working with our  suppliers  to  respecting  consumer  rights,  including marketing sustainable products and services.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThis addresses issues that reflect the Company's significant economic, environmental and social effects and substantially influence  our  stakeholders'  assessments  and  decisions.  To this  end,  a  materiality  analysis  has  been  performed  at corporate,  local  and  regional  level  from  a  dual  perspective: relevance to our stakeholders and impact on communities.\n\n## Completeness\n\nWe indicate the material aspects and their coverage, scope and time to show their significant economic, environmental and social effects. This makes it possible for stakeholders to examine  Telef\u00f3nica's  performance  in  the  period  under analysis.\n\n## Impact\n\nWe  show  the  Company's  impacts  on  society  and  the environment of the communities in which we operate.",

Reasonable Assurance\n\n## 2.14.1.Strengthening the control of Non-Financial Information\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  is  aware  of  the  growing  importance  of  nonfinancial  information  to  its  stakeholders.  This  is  not  only  a growing demand from our customers and society as a whole, but also from investors and regulators. Specifically, in Spain, the  revision  of  the  Code  of  Good  Governance  in  June  2020 recommends  strengthening  the  powers  of  the  audit committee by assigning it the supervision of the control and management systems for non-financial risks, ensuring that the  internal  control  policies  and  systems  are  effectively applied in practice, in line with the guidelines established in 2017 with the CNMV's Technical Guide 3/2017.\n\nFor  this  reason,  in  2019  Telef\u00f3nica  began  to  design  the System  of  Internal  Control  over  Non-Financial  Information (\"SCIINF').  The  project  covers  risk  management,  control activities,  information  and  communication  processes  and oversight  activities  for  the  entire  non-financial  reporting process.  The  aim  is  to  provide  a  control  framework  for  the Non-Financial  Information  to  be  reported  in  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group's Consolidated Management Report.\n\nThis  project  has  materialised  during  2020  in  obtaining  a reasonable assurance report from the external verifier, PwC, for six indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 High-risk  suppliers  identified  in  the  internal  risk  analysis (No.)\n- \u00b7 High-risk suppliers assessed (%)\n- \u00b7 Suppliers blocked due to ethical and sustainability issues (No.)\n- \u00b7 Net Promoter Score (NPS) (%)\n- \u00b7 Severe digital security breaches with impact on customers (No.)\n- \u00b7 Privacy and data protection fines (No.)\n\nAs referred to in chapter \"2.13.6. Principles for preparing the Statement of Non-Financial Information /(EINF)', Telef\u00f3nica reports non-financial information following the GRI and SASB standards and reference frameworks.\n\nThe  reasonable  assurance  procedures  performed  by  the external  verifier covered  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  main operators in Spain, Brazil, Germany and the United Kingdom for  the  purposes of the Telef\u00f3nica Group Integrated Report as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Company will continue with the implementation of this project in order to strengthen its SCIINF.\n\n## Indicators included in Reasonable Assurance 2020\n\n| Indicator                                                            |   Value (1) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| High-risk suppliers identified in the internal risk  analysis (No.)  |         662 |\n| High-risk suppliers assessed (%)                                     |          63 |\n| Suppliers blocked due to ethical and sustainability  issues (No.)    |           9 |\n| Net Promoter Score (NPS) (%)                                         |          24 |\n| Severe digital security breaches with impact on  customers (No.)     |           0 |\n| Privacy and data protection fines (No.)                              |          13 |\n| of which they are the result of a security breach  or incident (No.) |           0 |\n\n(1) Aggregate data for the companies Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, Telef\u00f3nica Germany, Telef\u00f3nica UK and Telef\u00f3nica Brazil and their subsidiaries, the scope of consolidation of which can be consulted in 'Appendix I Scope of consolidation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 2020'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The segments differ according to the reporting country. Main segments include: mass market, corporate, SME, large accounts, Blau, O2, B2P, fixed line residential, prepaid mobile, postpaid mobile\n- \u00b7 Segment  NPS:  according to  the needs  of  each  country  and  to  guarantee a  better  representativeness  of  the sample, the shares in the study are sub-segmented according to the variables of total revenues of the previous year and accesses.\n\nThe reported NPS refers to the moving average of  the last  quarter of the year except for the country segments outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Spain: The 'key accounts' segment refers to the annual moving average.\n- \u00b7 Brazil: The 'companies' segment refers to the annual half-yearly average.\n\nIn addition, for specific cases where the required samples of a given segment are not reached, half-yearly averages are used to ensure the representativeness of the samples.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n## *Sample size calculation:\n\nTo calculate the sample size needed in the NPS study for each of the segments, the following formula should be considered:\n\n## Where:\n\n- \u00b7 n: sample size\n- \u00b7 K = 1.96 (Reliability Factor associated with a confidence level of 95%)\n- \u00b7 V ARNPS: Variance of NPS\n- \u00b7 C.I. Desired Confidence Interval.\n\nThe calculation of the variance of the NPS is given by:\n\n## Where:\n\n- \u00b7 %P: the percentage of Promoters, %N: the percentage of Neutrals and %D: the percentage of Detractors\n- \u00b7 NPS = %P - %D\n\nThe segment level formula to be applied to calculate the standard error of the NPS is as follows:\n\n## Where:\n\n- \u00b7 EE: Standard Error\n- \u00b7 s: sample standard deviation. It is also the square root of the variance\n- \u00b7 n: Sample size\n\nThe Standard Error for the weighted country total is calculated from the standard error of each segment and the respective segment weights:\n\n## Where:\n\n- \u00b7 W: Weight of the segment in the country total\n- \u00b7 EE: Standard Error",

This framework has been implemented homogeneously throughout  the  Group's  main  operations,  so  that  the Company  Managers,  within  their  scope  of  action,  can perform  a  timely  identification,  assessment,  response  and monitoring of the main risks\n\nThis model, which is inspired by best practices, facilitates the prioritization and  development  of  coordinated  actions against  risks,  both  from  a  global  Group  perspective,  and  a specific focus on its main operations.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica's Business Principles specifically state that:\n\n## ' We establish appropriate controls to evaluate and manage all relevant risks to the Company'\n\nExtract from Responsible Business Principles of Telef\u00f3nica\n\nIn this sense, the Company has a Risk Management Policy, approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  a Corporate  Risk Management  Manual, both  based  on  experience,  best practices and Good Corporate Governance recommendations; contributing to the continuous improvement in business performance.\n\n[1] COSO ERM framework, 'Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance', released in September 2017 by the Committe of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commision (COSO). COSO is one of the most importance reference on internal control, enterprise risk management, and fraud deterrence\n\n## 3.1.2. Risks and strategy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  Risk  management  remains  embedded  in  our planning process and is fully aligned with our strategy, in line with the requirements of COSO ERM 2017\n\n'The main risks are linked to the strategic objectives of the Company Program'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo to the chapter on Strategy\n\nSome  of  the  risks  most  directly  related  to  the  Company's strategy  relate  mainly  to  the  need  for  anticipation  and adaptation, in an appropriate time, to constant technological changes and new forms of connectivity (e.g. IoT, \"Internet of Things\"), as well as changes in customer preferences in the industry.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks and Opportunities\n\nWe  are  a  technology  company  that  is  at  the  heart  of  the digital revolution that we are living because the driving force behind that revolution is then connectivity we provide for our customers. Increasingly we are witnessing radical changes in a  short  time,  this  means  that  we  encounter  opportunities that  will  allow  Telef\u00f3nica  to  provide  better  services  and improve  the  societies  where  it  operates  and  for  all  the stakeholders  with  which  it  relates.  Some  examples  of potential opportunities are highlighted bellow:\n\n- \u00b7 Data  traffic  will  continue  to  grow  exponentially  and  this places  infrastructure  at  the  heart  of  this  transformation and speaks to the relevance of our networks.\n- \u00b7 We are living in a unique moment because never before in the history of humankind has technology advanced at this speed.  It  brings  together  virtual  and  augmented  reality, the  explosion  of  connectivity,  the  Internet  of  Things, biotechnology, robotics,  blockchain,  the  softwarization  of everything and the ramping-up of artificial intelligence.\n- \u00b7 Need  to  accelerate  digitalization  across  all  economic\n\nsectors  (cloud,  industry,  remote  working,  education, health\u2026) drives acceleration of 5G and Fiber.\n\n- \u00b7 In  a  context  of  stricter  environmental  regulations,  the transition  towards  a  greener  economy  presents  a  clear opportunity  for  Telefonica,  specifically  in  the  positive impact  from  telecommunications  products  and  services over  our  clients'  processes,  allowing  companies  to  save CO2 emissions by helping them optimize their operations, reducing waste and improving carbon footprint.\n- \u00b7 Education  also  becomes  a  tool  available  to  many  people and a key piece in reducing the social-digital divide.\n\nAll  this  opens up a world of opportunities for our Company. However,  this  digital  revolution  has  also  highlighted  the associated risks, that require new governance, for example, the proliferation of digital activity redoubles the importance of the debate about data ownership and privacy protection in the new digital age, as well as opening up new avenues for cyber threats and attacks, among other risky aspects.",

        "page_content": "## Supervision of the Risk management system\n\nThe Regulations of the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, SA, establish  that  the  primary  duty  of  the  Audit  and  Control Committee shall be to support the Board of Directors [2] in its supervisory  duties;  including  the  supervision  of  the  risk management  framework,  including  tax  risks.  With  respect thereto, it shall be responsible for proposing to the Board of Directors a risk control and management policy, which shall identify  at  least  the  following:  the  types  of  risk  facing  the company;  the  setting  of  the  risk  level  that  the  Company deems acceptable;  the  measures  to  mitigate  the  impact  of the identified risks, should they materialize; and the control and information systems to be used to control and manage the above-mentioned risks.\n\nAs  a  support  for  the  development  of  these  oversight activities  by  the  Audit  and  Control  Committee,  a  risk management  function  has  been  established,  within  the Internal  Audit  area,  independent  of  the  management,  in order  to  promote,  support,  coordinate  and  monitor  the implementation of the provisions of this Policy both at Group level and in its main operations.\n\n[2] The profile of the Directors and their competences in the different matters are detailed in the Annual Corporate Governance Report.\n\nFor the purpose of ensuring an adequate supervision of the Telef\u00f3nica's  risk  management  framework  by  the  Audit  and Control  Committee,  various  sessions  are  held  within  that committee, through:\n\n- \u00b7 Overall presentations on the risk management model and the  situation  of  the  main  risks,  carried  out  by  Internal Audit. Specifically, during 2020, two general presentations on  risks  have  been  made  to  the  Audit  and  Control Committee of Telef\u00f3nica.\n- \u00b7  Specific  presentations  of  the  main  risks  made  by  those responsible  for  their  management.  Thus,  during  2020, monographic sessions on strategic risks have been held, as well  as  in  the  areas  of  Systems  and  Network,  People, Cybersecurity, Tax, Finance, Litigation and Privacy.\n\nLikewise,  the  Audit  and  Control  Committee  periodically reports on these matters to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Risk Owner\n\nRisk  owners  actively  participate  in  the  risk  strategy  and  in the  important  decisions  about  their  assurance  and  control. To  this  end,  each  of  the  identified  risks  will  be  assigned  a person (normally a Director) accountable for the risk and its management, preparing a plan for its assurance and control (measures  to  avoid,  mitigate  or  partially  transfer  the  risks) and effectively monitoring its evolution.\n\nSpecifically,  with  respect  to  fiscal  risks,  the  Group's  Fiscal Directorate performs the fiscal control function through the Regional  Fiscal  Directorates,  and  the  local  fiscal  control officers  in  the  different  subsidiaries  in  accordance  with  the principles  defined  in  the  Group's  Fiscal  Control  Policy,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napproved by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.1.6.Tolerance or risk apetite\n\nThe Company has a level of risk tolerance or acceptable risk established at corporate level; which means its willingness to assume a certain level of risk, to the extent that allows the creation  of  value  and  the  development  of  the  business, achieving an adequate balance between growth, performance and risk.\n\nFor  the  risk  assessment,  the  different  typology  of  the  risks that  could  affect  the  Company  is  considered,  as  described below:\n\n- \u00b7 In general, tolerance thresholds are defined for all risks, by combination of impact and probability of occurence. These thresholds are updated annually based on the evolution of the main financial figures, both for the Group as a whole and for the main Telefonica companies.\n- \u00b7 In the case of risks related to reputation, sustainability and compliance, a zero tolerance level is established.\n\n## 3.1.7. Risk management process\n\nThe risk management process takes the Company's strategy and  objectives  as  a  reference  for  the  identification  of  the main  risks  that  could  affect  its  achievement.  The  process consists of four stages, which are described below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Materialized risks\n\nThe  Company  tracks  materialized  risks.  The  strategy  and management  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  activities  tend  to minimize  the  impact  of  materialized  risks,  as  well  as  to counterbalance the negative effects of some issues with the favourable evolution of others.\n\nDuring this year, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our risk profile,  affecting  various  areas,  although the  most  important  aspects  have  been  identified  within  a separate Covid-19 Pandemic risk in the Risk Factors Section, which gives an overview of the related uncertainties and their impact on the Group.

In  case  of  goodwill,  the potential loss of value is determined by the analysis of the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (or group cashgenerating of units) to which the goodwill is allocated to at the  time  it  is  originated.  By  way  of  example,  in  2020 impairment  losses in  the  goodwill  and  other  assets  of Telef\u00f3nica Argentina were recognized for a total of 894 million euros.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3. Risk factors\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  affected  by  a  series  of  risk  factors that  affect  exclusively  the  Group,  as  well  as  a  series  of external factors that are common to businesses of the same sector. The main risks and uncertainties faced by Telef\u00f3nica, which could affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows are set out below and must be considered  jointly  with  the  information  set  out  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThese risks are currently considered by the Telef\u00f3nica Group to be material, specific and relevant to consider in making an informed  investment  decision  in  respect  of  the  Company. However, the Telef\u00f3nica Group is subject to other risks that have  not  been  included  in  this  section  based  on  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  assessment  of  their  specificity  and materiality  depending  on  the  Group's  assessment  of  their probability  of  occurrence  and  the  potential  magnitude  of their impact.\n\nRisks  are  presented  in  this  section  grouped  into  four categories  (according  to  the  definitions  included  in  section 3.2. above):\n\n- - Business\n- - Operational\n- - Financial\n- - Legal and compliance\n\nThese categories are not presented in order of importance. However,  within  each  category,  the  risk  factors  are presented in descending order of importance, as determined by Telef\u00f3nica at the date of this document. Telef\u00f3nica may change its vision about their relative importance at any time, especially if new internal or external events arise.\n\n## Risks related to the business activities.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica's competitive position in some markets could be affected by the evolution of competition and market consolidation.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group operates in highly competitive markets and it is possible that the Group may not be able to market its products and services effectively or respond successfully to  the  different  commercial  actions  carried  out  by  its competitors, causing it to not meet its growth and customer retention plans, thereby jeopardizing its future revenues and profitability.\n\nIn  addition,  market  concentration,  including  as  a  result  of mergers, acquisitions, alliances and collaboration agreements with third parties (e.g., the possible integration of  companies in the content/entertainment sector, such as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe mergers of FOX and Disney, and AT&T and Time Warner), could affect the competitive position of Telef\u00f3nica, as well as the efficiency of its operations.\n\nThe  reinforcement  of  competitors,  the  entry  of  new competitors, or the merger of operators in certain markets, may  affect  Telef\u00f3nica's  competitive  position,  negatively affecting the evolution of its revenues and market share. In addition,  changes  in  competitive  dynamics  in  the  different markets  in  which  we  operate,  such  as  in  Chile  and  Peru, where  there  are  aggressive  customer  acquisition  offers, including  unlimited  data  and  discounts  on  certain  services, among others,  can  affect  the  competitive  position  and  the efficiency of Telef\u00f3nica's operations.\n\nIf  Telef\u00f3nica  is  not  able  to  successfully  face  the  challenges posed  by  its  competitors,  the  Group's  business,  financial condition,  results  of  operations  and/or  cash  flows  could  be adversely affected.\n\n## The Telef\u00f3nica Group's strategy which is focused on driving new digital businesses and providing databased services, increases its exposure to risks and uncertainties arising from data privacy regulation.\n\nThe  Telef\u00f3nica Group's commercial  portfolio includes products  and/or  services  which  are  based  on  the  use, standardization  and  analysis  of  data,  as  well  as  the deployment of advanced networks and the promotion of new technologies related to Big Data, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity,  Artificial  Intelligence  and  the  Internet  of Things (\"IoT\").\n\nThe large amount of information and data that is processed throughout the Group (approximately 345.4 million accesses associated with telecommunications services, digital products and services and Pay TV and 112,797 employees as of December  31,  2020),  increases  the  challenges  of complying with privacy regulations. Moreover, there is a risk that measures adopted in response to these regulations may stifle innovation. Conversely, the Group's efforts to promote innovation  may  result  in  increased  compliance  risks  and costs.\n\nOne  of  the  most  important  pieces  of  regulation  for  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  operations  in  the  European  Union  is Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  of  the  European  Parliament  and Council  of  April  27,  2016,  on  the  protection  of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (\"GDPR\"), which content has  become  a  benchmark  for  all  countries  where  the Telef\u00f3nica Group operates. In addition, progress continues to be  made  on  the  proposal  for  a  future  European  regulation concerning the respect for privacy and protection of personal data in electronic communications (\"e-Privacy Regulation\"),",

If approved, this proposal could establish additional and more restrictive rules than  those  established  in  the  GDPR,  which  may  increase compliance risks and costs.\n\nMoreover,  on  July  16,  2020,  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the European Union issued a judgment which annulled, without granting a grace or transition period, the European Commission's Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of July 12, 2016 on the  adequacy  of  the  protection  provided  by  the  EU-U.S. Privacy  Shield.  Accordingly,  such  framework  is  not  a  valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States. As a result of that decision, the Telef\u00f3nica Group  has  been,  among  other  measures,  reviewing  and where  applicable  revising,  in  a  short  period  of  time, international  data  transfers  being  made  by  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group companies from the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") to  suppliers  located  in  the  United  States  with  a  view  to minimizing the risk of breach of the GDPR. However, due to the complexity and uncertainties coming from the aforementioned judgement there can be no assurance that any  such  measures  have  been  or  will  be  fully  effective  in preventing a breach of the GDPR. In addition, there can be no assurance  that  the  transfers  which  began  under  the framework of the EU-U.S.  Privacy  Shield  did  not  result  in  a breach of the GDPR.\n\nIn  addition,  the  following  recent  and  prospective  regulatory developments  may  be  material  to  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's operations:  (i)  in  the  United  Kingdom,  its  exit  from  the European Union means that the Group must monitor how its operations and business in the United Kingdom are affected in  terms  of  applicable  privacy  regulations  and,  specifically, the flow of data to and from the United Kingdom. The Trade and  Cooperation  Agreement  between  the  United  Kingdom and  the  European  Union  reached  on  December  24,  2020, which has been applied provisionally pending ratification by the  authorities  of  the  European  Union,  contains  a  Final Provision according to which, from January 1, 2021 and for a period of four months, extendable by two more months, the transmission  of  personal  data  from  the  EEA  to  the  United Kingdom will not be considered a transfer to a third country in  accordance with the GDPR. The Final Provision will cease to be  in  effect  if, during  this  period,  the  European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in relation to the United Kingdom. If the European Commission fails to adopt such  a  decision  during  this  period,  or  if  such  adequacy decision contains terms which are more onerous than those currently  in  place,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  may  face  similar challenges  as  it  is  currently  facing  with  respect  to  data transfers to the United States and may have to review and, where  appropriate,  revise  the  transfers  of  personal  data  to the  United  Kingdom;  and  (ii)  in  Latin  America,  Law  No. 13,709  (LGPD)  in  Brazil  imposes  standards  and  obligations similar to those  required  by  the  GDPR,  including  a sanctioning regime which will be in force from August 2021, with  fines  for  non-compliance  of  up  to  2%  of  the  Group's income in Brazil in the last financial year subject to a limit of 50  million  Brazilian  reals  (approximately  8  million  euros based on the exchange rate as of  December 31, 2020) per\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninfraction.  In  other  countries  of  Latin  America  where  the Group operates, such as Ecuador, Argentina and Chile, there are regulatory proposals to bring regulation more in line with the  provisions  set  forth  in  the  GDPR,  which  may  increase compliance risks and costs.\n\nData  privacy  protection  requires  careful  design  of  products and services, as well as robust internal procedures and rules that can be adapted to regulatory changes where necessary, all  of  which  entails  compliance  risk.  Failure  to  maintain adequate data security and to comply with any relevant legal requirements  could  result  in  the  imposition  of  significant penalties, damage to the Group's reputation and the loss of trust of customers and users.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  reputation  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the digital  trust  it  is  able  to  generate  among  its  customers  and other  stakeholders.  In  this  regard,  in  addition  to  any reputational  consequences,  it  is  important  to  note  that,  in the European Union, very serious breaches of the GDPR may entail  the  imposition  of  administrative  fines  of  up  to  the larger of 20 million euros and 4% of the infringing company's overall  total  annual  revenue  for  the  previous  financial  year. Furthermore,  once  it  is  approved,  the  e-Privacy  Regulation may set  forth  sanctions  for  breaches  of  it  similar  to  those provided for in the GDPR.\n\nAny  of  the  foregoing  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and/or cash flows of the Group.\n\n## The Group requires government concessions and licenses for the provision of a large part of its services and the use of spectrum, which is a scarce and costly resource.\n\nThe telecommunications sector is subject to laws and sectorspecific  regulations.  The  fact  that  the  Group's  business  is highly  regulated  affects  its  revenues,  operating  income before depreciation and amortization (\"OIBDA\") and investments.\n\nMany  of  the  Group's  activities  (such  as  the  provision  of telephone services, Pay TV, the installation and operation of telecommunications networks, etc.) require licenses, concessions or authorizations from governmental authorities,  which  typically  require  that  the  Group  satisfy certain  obligations,  including  minimum  specified  quality levels, and service and coverage conditions. If the Telef\u00f3nica Group  breaches  any  of  such  obligations  it  may  suffer consequences  such  as  economic  fines  or,  in  a  worst-case scenario, other measures that would affect the continuity of its business. Exceptionally, in certain jurisdictions, the terms of  granted  licenses  may  be  modified  before  the  expiration date  of  such  licenses  or,  at  the  time  of  the  renewal  of  a license, new enforceable obligations could be imposed or the renewal of a license could be refused.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  could  be  affected  by  the regulatory actions of antitrust authorities. These authorities could  prohibit  certain  actions,  such  as  new  acquisitions  or specific  practices,  create  obligations  or  impose  heavy  fines.",

For example, on February 22, 2019, the European Commission started an investigation  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Deutschland  in  respect  of  the Group's compliance with its commitments undertaken in the merger  with  E-Plus  in  2014.  In  this  context,  Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland  has  adjusted  the  conditions  of  4G  wholesale services.\n\nAny  of  the  foregoing  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and/or cash flows of the Group.\n\nAccess to new concessions/ licenses of spectrum.\n\nThe Group requires sufficient spectrum to offer its services. The  Group's  failure  to  obtain  sufficient  or  appropriate spectrum capacity in the jurisdictions in which it operates, or its  inability  to  assume  the  related  costs,  could  have  an adverse  impact  on  its  ability  to  maintain  the  quality  of existing services and on its ability to launch and provide new services, which may materially adversely affect Telef\u00f3nica's business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and/or cash flows.\n\nThe intention of the Group is to maintain current spectrum capacity and, if possible, to expand it, specifically through the participation  of  the  Group  in  spectrum  auctions  which  are expected to take place in the next few years, which will likely require  cash  outflows  to  obtain  additional  spectrum  or  to comply  with  the  coverage  requirements  associated  with some of the related licenses.\n\nIn  Europe,  two  auction  processes  are  expected  in  the  near term:  (i)  in  Spain,  on  December  23,  2020,  the  Ministry  of Digital  Transformation  published  the  conditions  of  the auction  of  two  national  10  MHz  (TDD)  concessions  in  the 3.4-3.6  GHz  band,  which  will  take  place  on  February  22, 2021.  The  allocation  of  this  spectrum  is  a  preliminary  step for  the  reorganization of the entire 3.4-3.8 GHz band in the first quarter of 2021. As for the 700 MHz band, a consultation was launched on the conditions  of  an  auction,  expected  to take place during March 2021, for a total of 75 MHz; and (ii) in the United Kingdom, an auction for the 700 MHz and the 3.6-3.8  GHz  bands  is  expected  to  take  place  in  March  of 2021, although such auction could be delayed.\n\nIn  Latin  America,  several  auction  processes  are  expected  in the  near  term:  (i)  in  Brazil,  on  February  5,  2020,  ANATEL published  the  proposal  for  the  5G  public  auction.  It  is expected that the auction of 20 MHz of the 700 MHz band, 90 MHz of the 2.3 GHz band, 400 MHz of the 3.5 GHz band and 3,200 MHz of the 26 GHz band will take place in 2021; (ii) in  Colombia,  the  \"5G  Plan\" as  well  as  the  2020-2024 Spectrum  Public  Policy  and  the  2020-2024  Spectrum Allocation  Framework  Plan  were  published.  These  policy documents  announced  actions  to  auction  the  remaining spectrum in the 700 MHz, 1,900 MHz and 2,500 MHz bands, without  indicating  a  concrete  time  frame.  Additionally, spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band is planned to be assigned in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe second quarter of 2021; however, this auction could be postponed  until 2022. Telef\u00f3nica has requested  the Ministerio  de  las  Tecnolog\u00edas  de  la  Informaci\u00f3n  y  las Comunicaciones  (MinTic)  to  delay  the  spectrum  auction  in the  3.5  GHz  band,  considering  that  the  market  is  not  yet sufficiently prepared. It has also proposed the revision of the spectrum  valuation  methodology  downwards,  in  order  to align  costs  with  the  spectrum  value  generation  capacity. Finally,  although  it  is  in  favor  of  increasing  the  spectrum caps, Telef\u00f3nica has requested additional measures to avoid resource monopolization by the dominant operator; and (iii) in  Peru,  auctions  were  announced  for  the  bands  1,750  1,780 MHz, 2,150 - 2,180 MHz and 2,300 - 2,330 MHz, which may  take  place  during  2021. In  addition,  the  Ministry  of Transportation  and  Communications  has  started  a  public consultation regarding 5G and an auction model for the 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz bands.\n\nExisting  licenses:  renewal processes  and  modification  of conditions for operating services.\n\nThe  revocation  or  failure  to  renew  the  Group's  existing licenses, authorizations or concessions, or any challenges or amendments  to  their  terms,  could  materially  adversely affect  Telef\u00f3nica's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nIn  Germany,  Telef\u00f3nica's  and  other  parties'  legal  actions against Decisions III and IV adopted by the German regulator on the conditions of use of frequencies and the rules of the spectrum of the 2 GHz and 3.4-3.7 GHz bands auction, that ended  on  June  12,  2019,  are  pending.  With  its  appeals, Telef\u00f3nica is challenging in particular the imposed coverage obligations  and  the  requirement  to  negotiate  on  network access.  Other  parties  inter  alia  claim  that  the  obligation  to negotiate with other operators is not strict enough. It is yet unclear to what extent these different actions will affect the regulator's Decisions III and IV.\n\nWith respect to Latin America:\n\nIn  Brazil,  the  publication  by  ANATEL  of  two  regulations  for the development  of  Law  13,879/2019  regarding  the migration  from  the  concession  regime  to  the  authorization regime are pending. ANATEL is working on the methodology for calculating the migration balance and there is a risk that consensus will not be reached between the parties regarding the  migration  calculation.  If  a  decision  is  made  not  to migrate, the Telef\u00f3nica Servicio de Telefon\u00eda Fija Conmutada (STFC) concession will remain in force until 2025. In addition, Telef\u00f3nica could lose its right to operate spectrum in the 450 MHz  band,  granted  in  certain  cities,  if  Telef\u00f3nica's  appeal against a decision adopted by the regulator in June 2019 is not successful. Furthermore, regarding the extension of the 850 MHz band authorizations, ANATEL agreed to extend the current  authorizations  for  the  use  of  radio  frequencies  in Bands A and B, proposing their approval, on a primary basis, until  November  29,  2028,  if  the  legal  and  regulatory requirements are met. However, Telef\u00f3nica has appealed the regulator's  decision  related  to the  amount  due  for  the extension, arguing that it should be calculated based on net",

Nevertheless,  Telef\u00f3nica  del  Per\u00fa S.A.A. holds other concessions for the provision of fixed-line services that allow it to provide these services beyond 2027. The renewal of the 1,900 MHz band in all of Peru (except for Lima  and  Callao),  which  expired  in  2018,  and  of  other telecommunications  services  were  requested  by  the  Group and  a  decision  by  the  MTC,  is  still  pending.  Nevertheless, these  concessions  are  valid  while  the  procedures  are  in progress.\n\nIn Colombia, the period to request the renewal of the license to  use  15  MHz  in  the  1,900  MHz  band,  will  expire  in  April 2021. Unless it is renewed, the license will expire on October 18,  2021.  MinTic  must  establish  the  renewal  conditions  in accordance  with  law  1978/19,  which  implies  market  prices conditions, extends the license periods to a maximum of 20 years  and  allows  paying  up  to  60%  of  the  price  of  the spectrum through obligations to do or take action.\n\nIn Chile, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling on the 700 MHz tender, Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles Chile returned 50 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band to the State in two regions in the south of the country and auctioned 10 MHz of the 1,900 MHz band, the result of which was announced on December 21, 2020.\n\nIn  Argentina,  in  connection  with  Decree  of  Necessity  and Urgency  690/2020  (\"DNU  690/2020\"),  Telef\u00f3nica  de Argentina,  S.A.  and  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles  Argentina,  S.A. (collectively,  'Telef\u00f3nica  Argentina')  has  filed  a  lawsuit against  the  Argentine  State,  in  connection  with  a  series  of contracts for licenses to provide services and spectrum use authorizations  entered  into  between  Telef\u00f3nica  Argentina and the Argentine State, including the licenses resulting from the  2014  spectrum  auction.  Such  contracts  and  their regulatory  framework  stated  that  the  services  provided  by Telef\u00f3nica Argentina were private and prices would be freely set  by  Telef\u00f3nica  Argentina.  However,  DNU  690/2020,  by providing that the services will be \"public services\" and that prices will be regulated by the Argentine State, substantially modifies  the  legal  status  of  those  contracts,  affecting  the performance of their obligations and substantially depriving Telef\u00f3nica  Argentina  of  essential  rights  derived  from  those contracts.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Group's  consolidated  investment  in spectrum acquisitions and renewals amounted to 126 million euros  (1,501  million  euros  in  2019,  1,425  million  euros  of which  corresponded  to  spectrum  acquisition  in  Germany), representing 0.3% of the Group's consolidated revenues for 2020  (3.1%  in  2019).  In  the  event  that  the  licenses mentioned above are renewed or new spectrum is acquired, it would involve additional investments by Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nFurther  information  on  certain  key  regulatory  matters affecting  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  and  the  concessions  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlicenses  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  can  be  found  in  the Appendix VI of the Consolidated Financial Statements: \"Key regulatory issues and concessions and licenses held by the Telef\u00f3nica Group\".\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica depends on its suppliers.\n\nThe  existence  of  critical  suppliers  in  the  supply  chain, especially in areas such as network infrastructure, information systems or handsets with a high concentration in  a  small  number  of  suppliers,  poses  risks  that  may  affect Telef\u00f3nica's operations. This may cause legal contingencies or damages to its image in the event that a participant in the supply  chain  engages  in  practices  that  do  not  meet acceptable  standards  or  that  otherwise  fail  to  meet Telef\u00f3nica's  performance  expectations.  This  may  include delays  in  the  completion  of  projects  or  deliveries,  poorquality execution, cost deviations and inappropriate practices.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group  depended  on  three handset suppliers (one of them located in China) and eight network  infrastructure  suppliers  (two  of  them  located  in China),  which,  together,  accounted  for  87%  and  80%, respectively, of the aggregate value of contracts awarded in 2020  to  handset  suppliers  and  network  infrastructure suppliers, respectively. One  of  the  handset  suppliers represented  54%  of  the  aggregate  value  of  contracts awarded in 2020 to handset suppliers.\n\nThese  suppliers  may,  among  other  things,  extend  delivery times,  raise  prices  and  limit  supply  due  to  their  own  stock shortfalls and business requirements or for other reasons.\n\nIf  suppliers  cannot  supply  their  products  to  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group  within  the  agreed  deadlines  or  such  products  and services  do  not  meet  the  Group's  requirements,  this  could hinder the deployment and expansion plans of the network. This  could  in  certain  cases  affect  Telef\u00f3nica's  compliance with the terms and conditions of the licenses under which it operates,  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  business  and operating  results  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group.  In  addition,  the possible  adoption  of  new  protectionist  measures  in  certain parts  of  the  world,  including  as  a  result  of  trade  tensions between the United States and China, and/or the adoption of lockdown  or  other  restrictive  measures  as  a  result  of COVID-19  or  any  other  crisis  or  pandemic,  may  have  an adverse impact on certain of Telef\u00f3nica's suppliers and other players in the industry. The imposition of trade restrictions and any disruptions in the supply chain could result in higher costs and lower margins or affect the ability of the Telef\u00f3nica Group to offer its products and services and could adversely affect  the  Group's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nDuring  2020,  specific  monitoring  has  been  carried  out  and action plans have been developed by the Group with respect to the supply chain challenges resulting from the pandemic, as  well  as  the  potential  discontinuation  of  use  of  some suppliers  as  a  result  of  the  US-China  conflict.  These developments  may  adversely  affect  the  Group's  business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Telef\u00f3nica operates in a sector characterized by rapid technological changes and it may not be able to anticipate or adapt to such changes or select the right investments to make.\n\nThe  pace  of  innovation  and  Telef\u00f3nica's  ability  to  keep  up with its competitors is a critical issue in a sector so affected by  technology  such  as  telecommunications.  In  this  sense, significant  additional  investments  will  be  needed  in  new high-capacity  network  infrastructures  to  enable  Telef\u00f3nica to offer the features that new services will demand, through the development of technologies such as 5G or fiber optic.\n\nNew products and technologies are constantly emerging that can  render  products  and  services  offered  by  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group,  as  well  as  its  technology,  obsolete.  In  addition,  the explosion  of  the  digital  market  and  the  entrance  of  new players  in  the  communications  market,  such  as  mobile network  virtual  operators  (\"MNVOs\"),  internet  companies, technology companies or device manufacturers, could result in a loss of value for certain of the Group's assets, affect the generation  of  revenues,  or  otherwise  cause  Telef\u00f3nica  to have to update its business model. In this respect, revenues from  traditional  voice  business  are  shrinking,  while  new sources of revenues are increasingly derived from connectivity and digital services. Examples of these services include video, IoT, security, Big Data and cloud services.\n\nOne  of  the  technologies  currently  being  developed  by telecommunications operators, including Telef\u00f3nica (in Spain and  Latin  America),  is  the  new  FTTx  type  networks  which allow  the  offering  of  broadband  accesses  over  fiber  optics with  high  performance.  However,  the  deployment  of  such networks, in which the copper of the access loop is totally or partially replaced by optical fiber, necessitates high levels of investment.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  in  Spain,  fiber coverage reached 25.2 million premises. There is a growing demand for the services that these new networks can offer to the end customer. However, the high levels of investment required by these networks  result in the need to continuously  consider  the  expected  return  on  investment, and no assurance can be given that these investments will be profitable.\n\nIn addition, the ability of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's IT systems (operational and backup) to adequately support and evolve to  respond  to  Telef\u00f3nica's  operating  requirements  is  a  key factor to consider in the commercial development, customer satisfaction and business efficiency of the Telef\u00f3nica Group. While  automation  and  other  digital  processes  may  lead  to significant  cost  savings  and  efficiency  gains,  there  are  also significant risks associated with such transformation processes. Any failure by the Telef\u00f3nica Group to develop or implement IT systems that adequately support and respond to  the  Group's  evolving  operating  requirements  could  have an  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  business,  financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nAll  of  this  forces  Telef\u00f3nica  to  continuously  invest  in  the development  of  new  products,  technology  and  services  to continue  to  compete  effectively  with  current  or  future competitors,  and,  for  this  reason,  the  Group's  profit  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmargins could be reduced or such investment could not lead to the development or commercialization of successful new products or services. To contextualize the size of the Group's investments, total research and development expenditure in 2020  was  959  million  euros  (866  million  euros  and  947 million  euros  in  2019  and  2018,  respectively).  These expenditures  represented  2.2%,  1.8%  and  1.9%  of  the Group's  consolidated  revenues  in  2020,  2019  and  2018, respectively.  These  figures  have  been  calculated  using  the guidelines established in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") manual.\n\nIf  Telef\u00f3nica  is  not  able  to  anticipate  and  adapt  to  the technological changes and trends in the sector, or to properly select  the  investments  to  be  made,  this  could  negatively affect  the  Group's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica may not anticipate or adapt in a timely manner to changing customer demands and/or new ethical or social standards, which could adversely affect Telef\u00f3nica's business and reputation.\n\nTo maintain and improve its position in the market vis-\u00e0-vis its competitors, it is vital that Telef\u00f3nica: (i) anticipates and adapts to the evolving needs and demands of its customers, and  (ii)  avoids  commercial  or  other  actions  or  policies  that may  generate  a  negative  perception  of  the  Group  or  the products  and  services  it  offers,  or  that  may  have  or  be perceived  to  have  a  negative  social  impact.  In  addition  to harming  Telef\u00f3nica's  reputation,  such  actions  could  also result in fines and sanctions.\n\nIn order  to  respond  to  changing  customer  demands, Telef\u00f3nica  needs  to  adapt  both  (i)  its  communication networks and (ii) its offer of digital services.\n\nThe  networks,  which  had  historically  focused  on  voice transmission, are evolving into increasingly flexible, dynamic and secure data networks, replacing, for example, old copper telecommunications  networks  with  new  technologies  such as  fiber  optics,  which  facilitate  the  absorption  of  the exponential growth in the volume of data demanded by the Group's customers.\n\nIn relation to digital services, customers  require  an increasingly digital and personalized experience, as well as a continuous  evolution  of  the  Group's  product  and  service offering. In this sense, new services such as \"Smart Wi-Fi\" or \"Connected  Car\",  which  facilitate  certain  aspects  of  the Group's  customers'  digital  lives,  are  being  developed. Furthermore,  new  solutions  for  greater  automation  in commercial  services  and  in  the  provision  of the  Group's services  are  being  developed,  through  new  apps  and  online platforms that facilitate access to services and content, such as  new  video  platforms  that  offer  both  traditional  Pay  TV, video on demand or multi-device access. However, there can be  no  assurance  that  these  and  other  efforts  will  be successful. For example, if streaming television services, such as  Netflix  or  others,  become  the  principal  way  television  is consumed to the  detriment  of  the  Group's  Pay  TV  service, the Group's revenues and margins could be affected.",

        "page_content": "In the development of all these initiatives it is also necessary to take into account several factors: on one hand, there is a growing  social  and  regulatory  demand  for  companies  to behave  in  a  socially  responsible  manner,  and,  on  the  other hand,  the  Group's  customers  are  increasingly  interacting through  online  communication  channels,  such  as  social networks, in which they express this demand.  The Company's  ability  to  attract  and  retain  clients  depends  on their  perceptions  regarding  the  Group's  reputation  and behavior.  The  risks  associated  with  potential  damage  to  a brand's  reputation  have  become  more  relevant,  especially due to the impact that the publication of news through social networks can have.\n\nIf Telef\u00f3nica is not able to anticipate or adapt to the evolving needs and demands of its customers or avoid inappropriate actions, its reputation could be adversely affected, or it could otherwise have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition,  results  of  operations  and/or  cash  flows  of  the Group.\n\n## Operating Risks.\n\n## Information technology is key to the Group's business and is subject to cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe risks derived from cybersecurity are among the Group's most  relevant  risks  due  to  the  importance  of  information technology to its ability to successfully conduct operations. Despite  advances  in  the  modernization  of  the  network  and the replacement of legacy systems in need of technological renewal, the Group operates in an environment increasingly prone  to  cyber-threats  and  all  of  its  products  and  services, such as mobile Internet or Pay TV services, are intrinsically dependent on information technology systems and platforms  that  are  susceptible  to  cyberattacks.  Successful cyberattacks  that  disrupt  the  Group's  operations  could prevent  the  effective  provision  of  products  and  services  to customers. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to identify and remedy any technical vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the Group's operating processes, as well as to strengthen its capabilities to detect and react to incidents. This includes the need to strengthen security controls in the supply chain (for example, by focusing on the security measures adopted by the  Group's  partners  and  other  third  parties),  as  well  as  to ensure the security of the services in the cloud. Throughout 2020,  as  a  result  of  the  circumstances  brought  by  the COVID-19  pandemic,  security  measures  related  to  remote access and teleworking of employees and collaborators have been  reviewed  and  strengthened,  but  no  assurance  can  be provided that such security measures will be effective.\n\nTelecommunications companies worldwide face continuously increasing cybersecurity threats as businesses become increasingly digital and dependent on telecommunications, computer networks and cloud computing technologies. Cybersecurity threats may include gaining  unauthorized  access  to  the  Group's  systems  or propagating  computer  viruses  or  malicious  software  to misappropriate  sensitive  information  like  customer  data  or disrupt  the  Group's  operations.  In  addition,  traditional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsecurity  threats,  such  as  theft  of  laptop  computers,  data devices and mobile phones may also affect the Group along with  the  possibility  that  the  Group's  employees  or  other persons may have unauthorized or authorized access to the Group's  systems  and  leak  data  and/or  take  actions  that affect  the  Group's  networks  or  otherwise  adversely  affect the  Group  or  its  ability  to  adequately  process  internal information or even result in regulatory penalties.\n\nIn particular, in the past three years, the Group has suffered several  cybersecurity  incidents.  Attacks  during  this  period include (i) intrusion attempts (direct or phishing), exploitation of vulnerabilities and corporate credentials being compromised for ransomware deployment (through malicious software that encrypts business data); (ii) Distributed  Denial  of  Service  (DDoS)  attack,  using  massive volumes of Internet traffic that saturate the service; and (iii) exploitation  of  vulnerabilities  to  carry  out  fraud  through online channels, usually through the subscription of services without paying for them.\n\nSome  of  the  main  measures  adopted  by  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group  to  mitigate  these  risk  are  vulnerabilities  checks, access  control  measures,  log  review  of  critical  systems, network  segregation  in  zones  and  the  deployment  of protective  systems  such  as  firewalls,  intrusion  prevention systems and virus scanners among other physical and logical security measures. In the event that preventive and control measures  do  not  prevent  damage  to  systems  or  data, backup systems are designed to provide for the full or partial retrieval of information.\n\nAlthough  Telef\u00f3nica  seeks  to  manage  these  risks  by adopting  technical  and  organizational  measures,  such  as those  referred  to  above,  as  defined  in  its  digital  security strategy,  it  cannot  guarantee  that  such  measures  are sufficient to avoid or fully mitigate such incidents. Therefore, the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  has  insurance  policies  in  place,  which could  cover,  subject  to  the  policies  terms,  conditions, exclusions, limits and sublimits of indemnity, and applicable deductibles,  certain  losses  arising  out  of  these  types  of incidents.  To  date,  the  insurance  policies  in  place  have covered  some  incidents  of  this  nature,  however  due  to  the potential severity and uncertainty about the evolution of the aforementioned events, these policies may not be sufficient to cover all possible losses arising out of an individual event.\n\n## Unanticipated network interruptions can lead to quality loss or the interruption of the service.\n\nUnforeseen  service  interruptions  can  be  due  to  system failures, natural disasters caused by natural or meteorological events or phenomena, lack of electric supply, network  failures,  hardware  or  software  failures,  theft  of network elements or cyber-attacks. Any of the foregoing can affect the quality of, or cause interruption to, the provision of the services of the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\nSuch  events,  like  the  one  that  affected  the  mobile  data services provided by O2 UK at the end of 2018 resulting from a  software  failure,  could  cause  customer  dissatisfaction,  a reduction in revenues and traffic, the realization of expensive",

Any adverse developments in this regard, including  exchange  rate  or  sovereign-risk  fluctuations,  may adversely  affect  Telef\u00f3nica's  business,  financial  position, cash flows and results of operations and/or the performance of some or all of the Group's financial indicators.\n\nDuring 2020, Telef\u00f3nica Spain accounted for 28.8% (26.5% in  2019)  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  revenues  (sales  and services),  Telef\u00f3nica  UK  accounted  for  15.6%  of  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  revenues  (14.7%  in  2019),  Telef\u00f3nica Brazil represented 17.2% of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's revenues (20.7%  in  2019)  and  Telef\u00f3nica  Hispam  accounted  for 18.4% of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's revenues (19.9% in 2019). During 2020, 4.0% of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's revenues came from Argentina, 3.8% from Peru and 3.7% from Chile (4.5%, 4.3%  and  4.0%,  respectively,  in  2019). Approximately 23.2% of the Group's revenues in 2020 came from countries that do not have investment grade credit rating (in order of importance,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Ecuador,  Costa  Rica,  El Salvador  and  Venezuela),  and  other  countries  are  just  one grade away from losing this status. Likewise, Venezuela and Argentina are considered to be countries with hyperinflationary economies in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nThe main risks are detailed below, by geography:\n\nIn  Europe,  there  is  the  risk  of  both  a  faster  spread  of  the COVID-19  pandemic  if  the  vaccination  schedule  does  not improve significantly and a tightening of financing conditions for both the private and public sectors that could adversely impact disposable income. Both global factors (including any global economic deterioration) and domestic issues (such as the worsening of the fiscal sustainability in some European countries  (e.g. Spain  or  Italy)) may  affect  economic conditions in the countries where we operate.\n\n- \u00b7 Spain : there are three other main sources of uncertainty. One  of  them  stems  from  the  economic  policies  to  be implemented from 2021 onwards, given the high level of parliamentary fragmentation and the lack of agreement on  key  issues.  This  applies  especially  to  the  European Recovery Fund management. Secondly, there is a risk of wider  negative  economic  impact  from  the  pandemic, resulting in a larger proportion of corporate foreclosures and/or  higher  unemployment  levels.  Finally,  as  one  of the most open countries in the world, from a commercial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npoint  of  view,  being  among  the  top  ten  countries  in respect  of  capital  outflows  and  inflows  globally,  any situation of protectionist backlash could have significant implications.\n\n- \u00b7 United Kingdom :  the formal exit of the United Kingdom from  the  European  Union  on  December  31st,  2020 (\"Brexit\") will entail an economic adjustment regardless of  the  agreement  reached  on  the  new  economic  and commercial  relationship  between  the  two  regions.  The trade and bureaucracy costs of leaving the single market and the customs union (especially those related to nontariff barriers) could weigh on the country's net trade. In addition,  there  are  still  many  gaps  to  be  closed  in  the area  of  services  (particularly,  financial  and  professional services),  so  variables  such  as  investment,  economic activity  and  employment  could  be  among  the  most affected, as well as volatility in financial markets, which could limit or condition access to capital markets. These changes  can  be  costly  and  disruptive  to  business relationships in the affected markets, including those of Telef\u00f3nica with its suppliers and customers. The Group would  also  be  adversely  affected  if  the  pound  sterling were to depreciate.\n- \u00b7 Latin  America: exchange  risk  is  particularly  important. This  risk  is  due  to  both  external  factors  (global  trade tensions,  abrupt  movements  in  commodity  prices  and concerns about growth and financial imbalances in China) and internal factors (challenges relating to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and managing the underlying fiscal deterioration,  see  'Unexpected  and  uncertain  events such  as  the  emergence  of  the  COVID-19  (coronavirus) pandemic significantly affect our operations'):\n- \u00b7 Brazil :  fiscal  sustainability  remains  the  main risk,  which the government  is  currently  tackling  through  its commitment to structural reforms including administration and tax system reforms, which not only seek  to  guarantee  sustainability  but  also  raise  Brazil's potential  growth.  The  fact  that  the  country's  rating  is below  investment  grade  and  that  its  internal  financing needs are high, could create a greater financial risk in the event  of  global  financial  stress  and  increasing  external and  internal  financial  needs,  and  could  also  negatively affect the exchange rate performance.\n- \u00b7 Argentina:  macroeconomic  and  exchange  rate  risks remain high. The challenges the economy is facing, both internally (ongoing process of public deficit reduction in a context of economic recession and high inflation) and externally  (with  significant  refinancing  needs  in  the medium term), make the economy vulnerable to bouts of  volatility  in  the  financial  markets    especially  in  a context  of  narrower  room  for  maneuver.  Further,  the worsening inflation outlook as a result of the exchange rate  split  and  the  unsustainable  price  containment measures that have been adopted, threaten Telef\u00f3nica's profitability.  In  particular,  the  Decree  of  Need  and Urgency (DNU) launched by the government in the third quarter of 2020, declared the Information and",

On  the  domestic  side,  both  the  existing political instability and the possibility of new episodes of social unrest could have a negative impact in the short and medium term.\n\n## Unexpected and uncertain events, such as the emergence of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, significantly affect our operations.\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  and  future  similar  events  may significantly  affect  our  operations.  Such  events  may  cause delays  in  the  supply  chain,  due  to  problems  in  factories  or logistics  services,  affect  employees  or  third  parties  with whom  the  Group  works  during  contagion  or  quarantine periods,  and  affect  global  and  regional  economic  growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, economic growth has been adversely  affected  by  various  adverse  impacts  on  supply (global value chains disruptions, lockdowns and immobilization of productive resources) and demand (deterioration  of  confidence  and  expectations,  negative income  and  wealth  effects)  derived  from  a  substantial deterioration in the financial markets, unprecedented drops in commodity  prices,  sudden  slowdown  in  commercial activity  and  strong  restrictions  on  transportation.  The  final impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  Group's  business  is  difficult  to predict  due  to  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  duration  of the pandemic and the ability of the economy of the countries where the Group operates, to recover.\n\nAccording to prevailing economic estimates, we are facing a pandemic  whose  economic  effects  are  expected  to  be  the largest  drop  in  global  GDP  in  recent  decades.  Despite continuing  to  estimate  a  deep  recession  for  2020,  global growth  expectations  have  been  revised  slightly  upwards (+0.9  p.p.  to  -3.5%  International  Monetary  Fund),  as  the recovery observed in the third quarter of 2020 in countries for  which  information  is  available  shows  generally  better than expected growth.\n\nIn Spain, the decrease in GDP reached 22.2% (in cumulative terms) during the first half of the year 2020 (second quarter -17.8%),  which  led  to  1,359,700  people  losing  their  jobs between  March  and  May.  However,  the  gradual  lifting  of restrictions  on  mobility  and  limitations  on  non-essential activities,  has  allowed  the  Spanish  economy  to  restart  its activity  and  GDP  grew  16.4%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  greatest  variation  in  real  terms  of  its  historical  series. However, the  new  measures  adopted  in  the  last  quarter  of 2020 to contain the advance of the pandemic have slowed GDP  growth  to  +0.4%,  which  resulted  in  an  annual contraction of 11% in 2020.\n\nThis contraction has occurred despite the magnitude of the fiscal  packages  announced  by  the  national  government  of Spain, composed of both direct spending (3.5% of GDP ) and liquidity  guarantees  (14.2%  of  GDP),  whose  aim  is  to maintain  the  productive  structure  and  which,  given  the volume,  raises  concerns  about  debt  sustainability  in  the medium and long term.\n\nWith  regards  to  the  risks  arising  from  the  impact  of  the pandemic  on  Latin  American  countries  (mainly  Argentina, Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia  and  Peru),  the  main  concern  is  the possibility of another lost decade due to the deterioration of the region's per capita GDP and the consequent setbacks in terms  of  poverty  and  social  progress.  A  second  focus  of uncertainty is related to fiscal sustainability. The significant deterioration  experienced  by  sovereign  metrics  during  the pandemic introduces a non-negligible probability of a credit quality cutback, with the consequent increase in the cost of external  financing  which  may  negatively  affect  foreign exchange performance.\n\nGroup  management  estimates  that  the  negative  impact  of the pandemic on Group's revenues in 2020 was approximately  1,905  million  euros,  while  the  impact  on OIBDA  (excluding  goodwill  impairment)  was  approximately 977 million euros.\n\nAdditionally,  the  COVID-19  crisis  has  contributed  to  the depreciation  of  the  main  Latin  American  currencies  against the  euro.  The  change  in  the  exchange  rates  of  the  main currencies  of  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates against the euro is shown below:\n\n|                  | Variation of  closing exchange  rate (12/31/2020  vs 12/31/2019)   | Variation of  average exchange  rate (2020 vs  2019)   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Brazilian real   | (29.0%)                                                            | (24.1%)                                                |\n| Pound sterling   | (5.2%)                                                             | (1.3%)                                                 |\n| New peruvian sol | (16.2%)                                                            | (6.1%)                                                 |\n| Argentine peso   | (34.8%)                                                            | (34.8%)                                                |\n| Chilean peso     | (3.6%)                                                             | (12.9%)                                                |\n| Colombian peso   | (12.6%)                                                            | (12.6%)                                                |\n| Mexican peso     | (13.3%)                                                            | (11.5%)                                                |\n\nThe  exchange  rate  figures  evolution  has  led  to  goodwill impairment losses.

In  the case of goodwill, the potential loss of value is determined by the analysis of the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill is allocated to at the time it is originated. By way of example, in 2020 impairment losses in the goodwill and other assets of Telef\u00f3nica  Argentina  were  recognized  for  a  total  of  894 million  euros. In  2019,  impairment  losses  in  the  goodwill allocated to Telef\u00f3nica Argentina were recognized for a total of 206 million euros.\n\nIn addition, Telef\u00f3nica may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on its statement of financial position to offset future taxable  income.  The  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets depends on the Group's ability  to  generate  taxable  income over  the  period  for  which  the  deferred  tax  assets  remain deductible.  If  Telef\u00f3nica  believes  it  is  unable  to  utilize  its deferred  tax  assets  during  the  applicable  period,  it  may  be required to record an impairment against them resulting in a non-cash  charge  on  the  income  statement.  By  way  of example,  in  2019,  Telef\u00f3nica  M\u00f3viles  M\u00e9xico  derecognized deferred tax assets amounting to 454 million euros. In 2020, deferred tax assets corresponding to the tax Group in Spain amounting to 101 million euros were derecognized.\n\nFurther impairments of goodwill, deferred tax or other assets may  occur  in  the  future  which  may  materially  adversely affect  the  Group's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## The Group faces risks relating to its levels of financial indebtedness, the Group's ability to finance itself, and its ability to carry out its business plan.\n\nThe operation, expansion and improvement of the Telef\u00f3nica Group's  networks,  the  development  and  distribution  of  the Telef\u00f3nica Group's services and products, the implementation  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  strategic  plan  and  the development  of  new  technologies,  the  renewal  of  licenses and  the  expansion  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  business  in countries  where  it  operates,  may  require  a  substantial amount of financing.\n\nThe  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  a  relevant  and  frequent  issuer  of debt  in  the  capital  markets.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the Group's  gross  financial  debt  amounted  to  50,420  million euros (52,364 million euros as of December 31, 2019), and the  Group's  net  financial  debt  amounted  to  35,228  million euros (37,744 million euros as of December 31, 2019). As of December 31, 2020, the average maturity  of  the  debt  was 10.79  years  (10.50  years  as  of  December  31,  2019),\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincluding undrawn committed credit facilities.\n\nA  decrease  in  the  liquidity  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  or  a  difficulty  in refinancing  maturing  debt  or  raising  new  funds  as  debt  or equity  could  force  Telef\u00f3nica  to  use  resources  allocated  to investments or other commitments to pay its financial debt, which could have a negative effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nFunding could be more difficult and costly in the event of a deterioration  of  conditions  in  the  international  or  local financial markets due, for example, to monetary policies set by central banks, including increases in interest rates and/or decreases  in  the  supply  of  credit,  increasing  global  political and  commercial  uncertainty  and  oil  price  instability,  or  if there  is  an  eventual  deterioration  in  the  solvency  or operating performance of Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Group's  gross  financial  debt scheduled  to  mature  in  2021  amounted  to  8,123  million euros, and gross financial debt scheduled to mature in 2022 amounted to 4,243 million euros.\n\nIn accordance with its liquidity policy, Telef\u00f3nica has covered its  gross  debt  maturities  for  the  next  12  months  with  cash and  credit  lines  available  as  of  December  31,  2020.  As  of December  31,  2020,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  had  undrawn committed  credit  facilities  arranged  with  banks  for  an amount  of  13,354  million  euros  (12,466  million  euros  of which  were  due  to  expire  in  more  than  12  months).  As  of December 31, 2020, 6.6% of the aggregate undrawn amount under credit lines was scheduled to expire prior to December 31, 2021.\n\nIn addition, given the interrelation between economic growth and  financial  stability,  the  materialization  of  any  of  the economic, political and exchange rate risks referred to above could adversely impact the availability and cost of Telef\u00f3nica's financing and its liquidity strategy. This in turn could  have  a  negative  effect  on  the  Group's  business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\nFinally, any downgrade in the Group's credit ratings may lead to an increase in the Group's borrowing costs and could also limit its ability to access credit markets.\n\n## The Group's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if it does not effectively manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily in connection with changes in interest rates affecting: (i) financial expenses on floatingrate debt (or short-term debt likely to be renewed); and (ii) the value of long-term liabilities at fixed interest rates.\n\nIn  nominal  terms,  as  of  December  31,  2020,  75.2%  of  the Group's net financial debt plus commitments had its interest rate set at fixed interest rates for periods of more than one year.  To  illustrate  the  sensitivity  of  financial  expenses  to variations  in  short-term  interest  rates  as  of  December  31, 2020:  (i)  a  100  basis  points  increase  in  interest  rates  in  all",

For the preparation of these calculations, a constant position equivalent to the position at that date is assumed, which takes into account the financial derivatives contracted by the Group.\n\nExchange  rate  risk  arises  primarily  from:  (i)  Telef\u00f3nica's international presence, through its investments and businesses  in  countries  that  use  currencies  other  than  the euro (primarily in Latin America and the United Kingdom); (ii) debt  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  that  of  the country  where  the  business  is  conducted  or  the  home country of the company incurring such debt; and (iii) trade receivables or payables in a foreign currency to the currency of  the  company with which the transaction was registered. According to the Group's calculations, the impact on results, and specifically on net exchange differences, due to a 10% depreciation  of  Latin  American  currencies  against  the  U.S. dollar and a 10% depreciation of the rest of the currencies to which the Group is most exposed (mainly the pound sterling) against the euro would result in exchange gains of 55 million euros  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020.  These calculations have been made assuming a constant currency position with an impact on profit or loss for the year ended December  31, 2020, taking into account derivative instruments in place.\n\nDuring 2020, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil represented 23.6% (28.2% in 2019),  Telef\u00f3nica  United  Kingdom  represented  15.3% (14.0%  in  2019),  Telef\u00f3nica  Hispam  represented  7.3% (13.4% in 2019) of the OIBDA of the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n\nIn 2020, the evolution of exchange rates negatively impacted the  Group's  results,  decreasing  the  year-on-year  growth  of the  Group's  consolidated  revenues  and  OIBDA  by  an estimated 6.5 percentage points and 8.0 percentage points, respectively, mainly due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real  (3.1  percentage  points  and  2.2  percentage  points, respectively,  in  2019).  Furthermore,  translation  differences in 2020 had a negative impact on the Group's equity of 5,801 million euros (negative impact of 95 million euros in 2019).\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group uses a variety of strategies to manage this  risk  including,  among  others,  the  use  of  financial derivatives,  which  are  also  exposed  to  risk,  including counterparty  risk.  The  Group's  risk  management  strategies may be ineffective, which could adversely affect the Group's business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and/or cash  flows.  If  the  Group  does  not  effectively  manage  its exposure  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  or  interest rates, it may  adversely  affect  its  business,  financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n## Legal and Compliance Risks.\n\n## Telef\u00f3nica and Telef\u00f3nica Group companies are party to lawsuits, antitrust, tax claims and other\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## legal proceedings.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica and Telef\u00f3nica Group companies operate in highly regulated sectors and are and may in the future be party to lawsuits, tax claims, antitrust and other legal proceedings in the  ordinary  course  of  their  businesses,  the  outcome  of which is unpredictable.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group is subject to regular reviews, tests and audits by tax authorities regarding taxes in the jurisdictions in  which  it  operates  and  is  a  party  and  may  be  a  party  to certain judicial tax proceedings. In particular, the Telef\u00f3nica Group  is  currently  party  to  certain  litigation  in  Peru concerning certain previous years' income taxes, in respect of  which  a  contentious-administrative  appeal  is  currently pending,  and  to  certain  tax  and  regulatory  proceedings  in Brazil,  primarily  relating  to  the  ICMS (a  Brazilian  tax  on telecommunication services) and the corporate tax.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  latter,  as  of  December  31,  2020, Telef\u00f3nica Brazil maintained provisions for tax contingencies amounting  to  282  million  euros,  and  provisions  for regulatory  contingencies  amounting  to  189  million  euros. Although  the  Group  considers  its  tax  estimates  to  be reasonable, if a tax authority disagrees, the Group could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can  be  no  guarantee  that  the  payment  of  such  additional amounts  will  not  have  a  significant  adverse  effect  on  the Group's  business,  results  of  operations,  financial  condition and/or cash flows.\n\nAn  adverse  outcome  or  settlement  in  these  or  other proceedings,  present  or  future,  could  result  in  significant costs and may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and/or cash flows.\n\n## The Telef\u00f3nica Group is exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs.\n\nThe  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  required  to  comply  with  the  anticorruption laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where it conducts  operations  around  the  world,  including  in  certain circumstances with laws and regulations having extraterritorial  effect  such  as  the  US Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010.  The  anti-corruption  laws  generally  prohibit,  among other  conduct,  providing  anything  of  value  to  government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage or failing to keep accurate  books  and  records  and  properly  account  for transactions.\n\nIn  this  sense,  due  to  the  nature  of  its  activities,  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  increasingly  exposed  to  this  risk,  which increases  the  likelihood  of  occurrence.  In  particular,  it  is worth  noting  the  continuous  interaction  with  officials  and public administrations  in  several  areas,  including  the institutional  and  regulatory  fronts  (as  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group carries out a regulated activity in different jurisdictions), the operational  front  (in  the  deployment  of  its  network,  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group  is  subject  to  obtaining  multiple  activity",

Moreover,  Telef\u00f3nica  is  a  multinational group  subject  to  the  authority  of  different  regulators  and compliance with various regulations, which may be domestic or  extraterritorial  in  scope,  civil  or  criminal,  and  which  may lead to overlapping authority in certain cases. Therefore, it is very difficult to quantify the possible impact of any breach, bearing in  mind  that  such  quantification  must  consider  not only  the  economic  amount  of  sanctions,  but  also  the potential negative impact on the business, reputation and/or brand, or the ability to contract with public administrations.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  operations  may  be subject  to,  or  otherwise  affected  by,  economic  sanctions programs and other forms of trade restrictions (\"sanctions\") including  those  administered  by  the  United  Nations,  the European  Union  and  the  United  States,  including  the  US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The sanctions regulations restrict the Group's business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, individuals and entities. In this  context,  the  provision  of  services  by  a  multinational telecommunications  group,  such  as  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group, directly and indirectly, and in multiple countries, requires the application  of  a  high  degree  of  diligence  to  prevent  the contravention  of  sanctions  (which  take  various  forms, including economic  sanctions programs  applicable to countries, lists of entities and persons sanctioned or export sanctions).  Given  the  nature  of  its  activity,  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group's exposure to these sanctions is particularly noteworthy.\n\nAlthough  the  Group  has  internal  policies  and  procedures designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  above  mentioned applicable  anti-corruption  laws  and  sanctions  regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will  be  sufficient  or  that  the  Group's  employees,  directors, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not take actions  in  violation  of  the  Group's  policies  and  procedures (or, otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and  sanctions  regulations) for which  the  Group,  its subsidiaries  or  they  may  be  ultimately  held  responsible.  In this regard, the Group  is  currently  cooperating  with governmental authorities (and, where appropriate, conducting  the  relevant  internal  investigations)  regarding requests  for  information  potentially  related,  directly  or indirectly to possible violations of applicable anti-corruption laws.  Telef\u00f3nica  believes  that,  considering  the  size  of  the Group, any potential penalty as a result of matters relating to those  specific  information  requests  would  not  materially affect the Group's financial condition.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  above,  violations  of  anti-corruption laws  and  sanctions  regulations  could  lead  not  only  to financial  penalties,  but  also  to  exclusion  from  government contracts, licenses and authorizations revocation,  and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's reputation, or otherwise  adversely  affect  the  Group's  business,  financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  regulations  determine  the  action principles of the Board, govern its organization and operation, and set the rules of conduct of its members.\n\nThe principles underlying Telef\u00f3nica's corporate governance are the following:\n\n- a.  the  maximization  of  the  value  of  the  Company  in  the interest of the shareholders,\n- b.  the  essential  role  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  the supervision of the management of the Company, and\n- c.  transparency as regards information in relations with its stakeholders including employees, shareholders, investors and customers, among others.\n\nAs provided in its Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Board will take the necessary measures to ensure: (i) that the Company's management team pursues the creation of value for  the  shareholders,  (ii)  that  such  management  team  is under  its  actual  supervision,  (iii)  that  no  person  or  small group of persons holds a decision-making power that is not subject to checks and balances or controls, and (iv) that no shareholder  receives  privileged  treatment  compared  to  the others.\n\n## 4.1.2. Continuous improvement of Corporate Governance\n\nTelef\u00f3nica is firmly committed to the ongoing improvement of its corporate governance framework, increasing, strengthening and consolidating best practices in this area.\n\nIn  connection  therewith,  the  Company  constantly  analyses and reviews its corporate governance structures and the level of  compliance  with  the  main  existing  good  governance recommendations, considering at all times possible initiatives  for  improvement  in  the  short  and  medium  term and  always  keeping  in  mind  the  search  for  the  governance formula that best defends the interests of the shareholders and the creation of value.\n\nWithin  this  context  and  throughout  2020,  Telef\u00f3nica  has continued to improve and strengthen its corporate governance  framework  by,  among  other  measures:  i)  the\n\nupdating  of  some  of  its  internal  regulations  and  policies,  in accordance with the revised version of the Good Governance Code  for  listed  companies  published  by  the  National Securities Market  Commission  (Comisi\u00f3n  Nacional  del Mercado  de  Valores)  in  June  2020;  ii)  the  renewal, reorganisation and adaptation of the functions of some of its Board  Committees,  particularly  the  reinforcement  of  the Sustainability and Quality Committee; iii) the establishment of  a  Protocol  for  the  succession  of  the  Chairman  and  the Chief Operating Officer, in accordance with the publication of the  above-mentioned  Good  Governance  Code;  iv)  the comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  Corporate  Governance System corresponding to 2020 by an External Consultant, in the  terms  indicated  below  in  this  Report;  and  v)  the  full adaptation, due to the situation caused by COVID-19, of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting and the meetings of the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  Committees  to  remote  or mixed means, with full effectiveness (a very large number of meetings were held in 2020 under these arrangements).\n\nThe  details  of  the  matters  indicated  in  the  preceding paragraph are set out below:\n\n## Changes relating to internal regulations and policies of Telef\u00f3nica\n\n- \u00b7 Amendment  of  the  Regulations  of  the  Board  of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting held on December 16, 2020, and at the proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee (which, as provided in article  3  of  the  Regulations  of  the  Board,  prepared  the respective Supporting Report), approved the partial amendment of the Regulations of the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A.\n\nThe aforementioned amendment consisted of the following: i) adapting  it  to  the  Recommendations  of  the  Good Governance Code amended in June with which the Company currently fully complies; ii) adapt it to certain Recommendations  of  the  Good  Governance  Code  not amended in June 2020 and which the Company had already been complying with; and iii) incorporate some complementary  aspects  or  technical  clarifications.

The Board  of  Directors  was  also  authorized  to  exclude  preemptive rights in whole or in part, as provided in section 506 of  the  Companies  Act.  However,  the  power  to  exclude  preemptive rights is limited to 20% of the share capital on the date on which the resolution is adopted. In accordance with the  above-mentioned  authorization,  as  of  the  end  of  fiscal year  2020,  the  Board  would  be  authorized  to  increase  the share capital by the maximum  nominal  amount  of 2,596,065,843 euros.\n\nFurthermore,  the  shareholders  at  the  Ordinary  General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.,  held  on  June  12, 2020, delegated to the Board of Directors, in accordance with the general rules governing the issuance of debentures and pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  applicable  law  and  the Company's  Bylaws,  the  power  to  issue  debentures,  bonds, notes and other fixed-income securities and hybrid instruments,  including  preferred  shares,  which  may  in  all cases  be  simple,  exchangeable  and/or  convertible  and/or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngrant  the  holders  thereof  a  share  in  the  earnings  of  the Company, as well as warrants, with the power to exclude the pre-emptive  rights  of  shareholders.  However,  the  power  to exclude  pre-emptive  rights  is  limited  to  20%  of  the  share capital on the date on which the resolution is adopted. The aforementioned  securities  may  be  issued  on  one  or  more occasions, within a maximum period of five years as from the date of adoption of the resolution. The securities issued may be debentures,  bonds,  notes  and  other  fixed-income securities, or debt instruments of a similar nature, or hybrid instruments in any of the forms admitted by Law (including, among  others,  preferred  interests)  both  simple  and,  in  the case of debentures, bonds and hybrid instruments, convertible into shares of the Company and/or exchangeable for  shares  of  the  Company,  of  any  of  the  companies  of  its Group  or  of  any  other  company  and/or  giving  the  holders thereof an interest in the corporate earnings. Such delegation also includes warrants or other similar instruments that may entitle the holders thereof, directly or indirectly,  to  subscribe  for  or  acquire  newly-issued  or outstanding shares, payable by physical delivery or through differences.  The  aggregate  amount  of  the  issuance  or issuances  of  instruments  that  may  be  approved  in  reliance on  this  delegation  may  not  exceed,  at  any  time,  25,000 million euros or the equivalent thereof in another currency. In  the  case  of  notes  and  for  purposes  of  the  abovementioned limits, the outstanding balance of those issued in reliance on the delegation shall be computed. In the case of warrants, and also for the purpose of such limit, the sum of the premiums and exercise prices of each issuance shall be taken into account.\n\nFurthermore, under the aforementioned delegation resolution, the shareholders  at  the  Ordinary  General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  resolved  to authorize the Board of Directors to guarantee, in the name of the Company, the issuance of the aforementioned instruments issued by the Companies belonging to its Group of Companies, within a maximum period of five years as from the date of adoption of the resolution.\n\n## Restrictions on the transferability of securities and/ or voting rights\n\nAs  for  the  existence  of  restrictions  on  the  transfer  of securities and/or voting rights, in accordance with article 26 of  the  Company's  Bylaws,  no  shareholder  may  exercise  a number  of  votes  exceeding  10  percent  of  the  total  share capital with voting rights existing at any time, regardless of the number of shares held, all of the foregoing with full and mandatory  submission  to  the  provisions  of  the  Law.  In determining  the  maximum  number  of  votes  that  each shareholder  may  cast,  only  the  shares  held  by  the shareholder  in  question  shall  be  computed,  not  including those  held  by  other  holders  who  have  delegated  their representation to that shareholder, without prejudice to the application of the same percentage limit of 10% to each of the shareholders represented individually.\n\nThe  limitation  established  in  the  preceding  paragraph  shall also  apply  to  the  maximum  number  of  votes  that  may  be",

Telef\u00f3nica  believes  that  this  measure  does  not constitute  a  mechanism  to  block  public  tender  offers  but rather a guarantee that the acquisition of control will require sufficient consensus among all the shareholders since, as is natural and may be seen from experience, potential offerors may condition their offer to the removal of such block.\n\nIn  addition,  and  in  accordance  with  section  527  of  the Companies  Act,  at  listed  companies,  bylaw  provisions  that directly or indirectly establish, in general  terms,  the maximum  number  of  votes  that  may  be  cast  by  a  single shareholder,  companies  belonging  to  the  same  group  or those acting in concert with the foregoing shall cease to have effect  when, following a public tender offer, the offeror has reached a percentage equal to or greater than 70 percent of the capital carrying voting rights, unless such offeror is not subject  to  equivalent  neutralization  measures  or  has  not adopted them.\n\nOn the other hand, the provisions of Law 19/2003, of July 4, on the Legal System of Transfers of Capital and of Financial Transactions  with  Foreign  Countries  (the  \"Law  19/2003\")\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmight  also  apply,  which  provisions  establish  that  the Government  may  decide  the  suspension  of  the  regime  of deregulation  on  foreign  investments  set  out  therein  in  the event  of  acts,  businesses,  transactions  or  operations  that, because of their nature, form or conditions of performance, affect or may  affect  activities  related,  even  if  only occasionally,  to  public  order  or  activities  directly  related  to the  national  defense,  or  activities  that  affect  or  may  affect public order, public safety and public health.\n\nIn addition, account  should  be  taken  of  the  latest amendments to Law 19/2003 (introduced by Royal DecreeLaw 8/2020 of 17 March, Royal Decree-Law 11/2020 of 31 March  and  Royal  Decree-Law  34/2020  of  17  November) which,  in  addition  to  maintaining  the  aforementioned regime,  establishes  the  suspension  of  the  liberalisation regime  for certain investment  operations,  particularly affecting  foreign  direct  investment  in  Spain  in  certain sectors, including the telecommunications sector. Thus, this regime establishes a compulsory process prior to the closure of  certain  operations,  based  on  reasons  of  security,  public order  and  public  health,  which  implies  that  the  closure  of certain  investment  operations  in  Spain  is  subject  to  prior administrative authorisation, when  the circumstances provided for in the aforementioned regulation are met.\n\nThe  shareholders  at  a  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. have not resolved to adopt any neutralization measure in the event of a public tender offer in reliance on the provisions of the Securities Market Act.\n\n## 4.2.2. Significant Shareholders\n\nAccording to the information existing at the Company, there is  no  individual  or  legal  entity  that  directly  or  indirectly, individually or jointly with others, exercises or may exercise control over Telef\u00f3nica on the terms set out in section 5 of the Securities Market Act.\n\nAs of the closing date of fiscal year 2020, there are, however, certain shareholders holding interests that may  be considered  significant  within  the  meaning  of  Royal  Decree 1362/2007, of October 19, and which are the following:\n\n| Name or corporate  name of shareholder     | % of shares carrying   | rights   | % of voting rights through financial instruments   | % of voting rights through financial instruments   | % of total voting   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Name or corporate  name of shareholder     | Direct                 | Indirect | Direct                                             | Indirect                                           | rights              |\n| Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria, S.A.

Shareholders' Rights\n\nThe  Bylaws  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  provide  for  a  single  class  of shares  (common  shares),  giving  all  the  holders  thereof identical  rights.  There  are  no  non-voting  shares  or  shares carrying  more  than  one  vote  or  with  privileges  in  the distribution  of  dividends,  or  reinforced  quorum  or  qualified majorities other than those established by law.\n\nThere  is  no  provision  for  the  shareholders  at  a  General Shareholders' Meeting having to approve decisions entailing an  acquisition,  disposition  or  the  contribution  to  another company of essential assets or similar corporate transactions other than those established by law.\n\nThis  section  describes  some  of  the  main  rights  of  the shareholders of the Company.\n\n## Right to receive information\n\nThe  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  is  called  as  much  in advance as required by law, through a notice published in, at a  minimum,  (i)  the  Official  Gazette  of  the  Commercial Registry or one of the widest circulation dailies in Spain, (ii) the  website  of  the  National  Securities  Market  Commission and (iii) the Company's corporate website.\n\nThe  notice  published  on  the  Company's  corporate  website remains  accessible  on  a  continuous  basis  at  least  until  the holding  of  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting;  the  Board  of Directors may publish notices in other media, if it deems it advisable, in order to ensure public and effective dissemination of the call to meeting.\n\nFrom the date of publication of the notice of the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting, the Company  makes available to its shareholders the documents and information that  must  be  provided  to  them  in  accordance  with  legal  or bylaw-mandated  requirements  in  connection  with  the various  items  included  on  the  agenda;  such  items  and documents are posted on the Company's website from the above-mentioned  date.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, shareholders  may  obtain  such  documents  and  information immediately and free of charge at the Company's registered office, and request that they be delivered or mailed to them free of charge, in the cases and on the terms established by law.\n\nIn  addition,  from  the  date  of  publication  of  the  call  to  the General Shareholders' Meeting and until the fifth day prior to the date set for the holding of the meeting on first call, any shareholder  may  request  in  writing  such  information  or clarifications  or  ask  such  questions  in  writing  as  it  deems relevant concerning the matters included on the Agenda of the call to meeting, or concerning the information accessible to  the  public  that  the  Company  may  have  provided  to  the National Securities Market Commission since the holding of the  immediately  preceding  General  Shareholders'  Meeting, or concerning the auditor's report.\n\nThe Board of Directors will be required to provide in writing, until  the  day  of  the  holding  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting, the requested information or explanations, as well as to reply, also in writing, to the questions asked. The replies to the questions and to the requests for information will be sent through the Secretary of the Board of Directors by any of  the  members  of  the  Board  or  by  any  person  expressly authorized by the Board of Directors for such purpose.\n\nDuring  the  holding  of  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting, shareholders  may  verbally  request  such  information  or explanations  as  they  deem  appropriate  concerning  the matters  included  on  the  Agenda  or  with  respect  to  the information  accessible  to  the  public  provided  by  the Company  to  the  National  Securities  Market  Commission since the holding of the last General Shareholders' Meeting or  concerning  the  auditor's  report.  in  the  event  that  it  is impossible to satisfy the shareholder's right at that time, the Board  of  Directors  will  be  required  to  provide  such information  in  writing  within  seven  days  of  the  end  of  the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  be  required  to  provide  the requested  information  as  described  in  the  two  preceding paragraphs in the manner and within the periods established by  law,  except  in  those  cases  where  (i)  such  information  is unnecessary for the protection of the shareholder's rights or there are objective reasons to consider that it could be used other  than  for  corporate  purposes,  or  the  dissemination thereof would harm the Company or its related companies; (ii)  the  request  for  information  or  explanations  does  not relate  to  matters  included  on  the  Agenda  or,  in  the  case  of paragraph  two  of  this  subsection  (Right  to  Receive Information), to information accessible to the public that was provided by the Company to the National Securities Market Commission since the holding of the last General Shareholders' Meeting; (iii) it is so established in statutory or regulatory provisions. The exception described in subsection (i) above shall not apply if the information was requested by shareholders  representing  at  least  one-fourth  of  the  share capital.\n\nThe replies to shareholders attending the General Shareholders'  Meeting  from  a  distance  electronically  and simultaneously and exercising their right to receive information through such procedure shall be provided, where applicable, in writing, within seven days following the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Supplement to the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting  and  right  to  submit  new  proposals  for agreement\n\nShareholders representing at least three percent of the share capital  may  request  that  a  supplement  to  the  call  to  the Ordinary  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  be  published,\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, and on the terms set forth in section 519 of the Companies Act (Ley de Sociedades de Capital), shareholders representing at least three  percent  of  the  share  capital  may,  within  five  days following  publication  of  the  notice  of  the  call  to  meeting, submit duly substantiated proposed resolutions on matters already  included  or  that  must  be  included  on  the  Agenda. Such rights shall be exercised by means  of duly authenticated  notice,  which  must  be  received  by  the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Law.\n\n## Right to attend and to appoint a proxy\n\nShareholders holding at least 300 shares registered in their name in the respective book-entry register five days prior to the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  and  providing  evidence thereof through the respective attendance card or certificate issued by the Company or by any of the Depositary Entities Members  of  Sociedad  de  Gesti\u00f3n  de  los  Sistemas  de Registro,  Compensaci\u00f3n  y  Liquidaci\u00f3n  de  Valores,  S.A.U.

Proxies may be granted through the proxy forms printed on the attendance cards or in any other manner allowed by law, without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act regarding  cases  of  representation  by  family  members  and the  grant  of  general  powers  of  attorney.  The  documents granting  the  proxy  for  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting shall  include  instructions  concerning  the  direction  of  the vote.  Unless  the  shareholder  granting  the  proxy  expressly states  otherwise,  it  shall  be  deemed  that  such  shareholder issues  precise  voting  instructions  in  favor  of  the  proposed resolutions  submitted  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the matters  included  on  the  Agenda.  If  there  are  no  voting instructions because the shareholders acting at the General Shareholders'  Meeting  could  decide  on  matters  that,  while not included on the Agenda and therefore not known on the date on which the proxy is granted, might be put to a vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting, the proxy shall cast the vote  in  the  direction  the  proxy  considers  best,  taking  into account  the  interest  of  the  Company  and  that  of  the shareholder the proxy represents. The same provisions shall apply when the respective proposal or proposals submitted to a decision of the shareholders at the General Shareholders'  Meeting  were  not  made  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nIt is expressly stated for the record that the notice of call of the  last  Ordinary  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  expressly provided  that  unless  the  shareholder  granting  the  proxy expressly  stated  otherwise,  such  shareholder  would  be deemed  to  issue  precise  instructions  to  vote  against  the respective resolution on any matter that, while not included on  the  Agenda  and  therefore  not  known  on  the  date  on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich the proxy was granted, might be put to a vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIf  the proxy document does not state the specific person to whom the shareholder grants his proxy, it shall be deemed to have been granted to the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company or to the person who may replace him as Chair of the General Shareholders' Meeting. If the appointed proxy should be in a situation of conflict of interest regarding the vote on any of the proposals which, whether or not included on the Agenda, are submitted at the General Shareholders' Meeting  and  the  shareholder  granting  the  proxy  has  not issued precise voting instructions, the proxy shall be deemed to  have  been  granted  to  the  Secretary  for  the  General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nShareholders who are not holders of the minimum number of shares required to attend may also grant a proxy in writing with respect to such shares to a shareholder with the right to attend or form a group with other shareholders in the same situation  until  they  have  the  necessary  number  of  shares, and grant a proxy in writing to one of them.\n\n## Right to vote and adoption of resolutions\n\nEvery  share  present  in  person  or  by  proxy  at  the  General Shareholders' Meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote.\n\nResolutions  shall  be  adopted  by  simple  majority,  meaning that proposed resolutions will be approved when the number of votes in favor of each proposal is greater than the number of votes against it (regardless of the number of blank votes and abstentions), without prejudice to the reinforced voting quorums established in the law and in the Bylaws.\n\n## Rules for amending the Company's Bylaws\n\nThe  Bylaws  and  Regulations  for  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica confer upon the shareholders acting at a  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  the  power  to  approve  the amendment of the Bylaws (articles 15 and 5, respectively), subject to applicable legal provisions for all other matters.\n\nThe  procedure  for  amending  the  Bylaws  is  established  in sections  285  et  seq.  of  the  Companies  Act,  and  must  be approved  at  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  complying with the quorum and majorities required in sections 194 and 201 of the same law.\n\nIn particular, if the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  is summoned  to  deliberate  on  Bylaw  amendments,  including capital  increases  or  reductions,  on  eliminating  or  restricting pre-emptive  rights  in  respect  of  new  shares  and  on  the transformation, merger, spin-off or the global assignment of assets  and  liabilities  and  the  relocation  of  the  registered office  abroad,  then  shareholders  that  own  at  least  fifty percent of the subscribed capital with voting rights will have to be present or be represented by proxy on first call. If there is  no  sufficient  quorum,  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting will be held on second call, in which case at least twenty-five",

This  article  states,  among other  things,  that  when  amendments  are  made  to  the Bylaws,  each  article  or  group  of  articles  which  is  materially different will be voted on separately.\n\n## Corporate Website\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  complies  with  applicable  legislation  and  best practices  in  terms  of  the  content  of  its  website  concerning Corporate  Governance.  In  this  respect,  it  fulfills  both  the technical  requirements  for  access  to  and  content  of  the Company  website, including information on General Shareholders'  Meetings,  through  direct  access  from  the homepage  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.

An effort is made to ensure that the Board of Directors has a  balanced  composition,  with  a  large  majority  of  nonExecutive  Directors  and  an  appropriate  mix  of  Proprietary and Independent Directors, while also endeavoring to ensure that Independent Directors have sufficient weight within the Board of Directors.\n- 2.  The  Board  of  Directors  endeavors  to  ensure  that  the procedures  for  the  selection  of  Directors  favor  diversity  of knowledge, training, professional experience, age and gender, and  are  free  from  any  implicit  biases  that  might  imply  any form of discrimination. All of the foregoing is in order for the Board  of  Directors  to  have  an  appropriate,  diverse  and balanced composition overall, which i) enriches analysis and debate, ii) contributes multiple viewpoints and positions, iii) favors  decision-making  taking  into  account  the  nature  and complexity  of  the  business,  as  well  as  the  social  and environmental context, iv) gives it maximum independence, and  v)  allows  for  compliance  with  legal  requirements  and good governance recommendations in relation to composition  and  suitability  required  to  be  met  by  the members of the various internal oversight Committees of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn particular, the Company's Board of Directors promotes the aim of inclusion of female Directors, as well as measures that promote the Company having a significant number of female senior executive officers based on good  governance recommendations, all without prejudice to the key principles of  merit  and  ability  that  must  govern  all  of  the  Company's staff selection processes.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  regularly  evaluates  the  degree  of compliance and effectiveness of this Policy and, in particular, the percentage of female directors at any given time.\n\nIn  particular,  and  on  the  occasion  of  the  proposal  for  reelection, ratification and appointment of the members of the Board of Directors submitted to the 2020 Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting, both the Nominating, Compensation and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors  verified  compliance  with  the  Policy,  taking  into account,  among  other  issues,  diversity  of  knowledge, training, experience and age.\n\n- 3.  The  process  for  the  selection  of  candidates  to  serve  as Directors  is  also  based  on  a  prior  analysis  of  the  skills required  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  Such  analysis  is conducted  by  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  with  the advice and with the required report or proposal, if applicable, of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.\n- 4.  In  the  case  of  re-election  or  ratification,  the  report  or proposal  of  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee contains an evaluation  of  the  work and effective dedication to the position for the most recent period of time during which the proposed Director has been in that position, as well as the Director's ability to continue to perform satisfactorily.\n- 5.  The  required  report  or  proposal  of  the  Nominating,\n\nCompensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  is published upon the call to the General Shareholders' Meeting at which the ratification, appointment or re-election of each Director is submitted.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee ensure, within the scope of their respective powers, that the candidates chosen for the position of Director are persons of recognized  probity,  competence  and  experience,  who  are willing  to  devote  the  time  and  effort  required  for  the performance  of  their  duties,  exercising  rigorous  care  in  the selection of the persons called upon to serve as Independent Directors.\n\nAccordingly,  all  the  candidates  for  the  position  of  Director shall  be  professionals  of  integrity,  whose  conduct  and professional  career  is  in  line  with  Telef\u00f3nica's  Responsible Business Principles.\n\nAdditionally,  candidates  for  Director  shall  be  considered  in particular if they have professional experience, in telecommunications, technology, consumer awareness, ESG knowledge, marketing, accounting, auditing, risk management (both financial and non-financial) and international experience and team leadership in multinationals will be valued.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  with  regard  to  gender  diversity,  the Company  has  purposely  sought  out  women  who  fit  the required  professional  profile.  In  this  regard,  in  terms  of  the percentage  of  female  Directors  with  respect  to  the  total number of members of the Board of Directors, section 4.1.3 of this Report shows the qualitative leap that the Company has made in this area, having gone from 11.11% in 2016 to 29.41% in 2020.\n\nAll  of  the  measures  and  procedures  that  have  been  agreed upon  and  adopted  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  by  the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee  in  order  to  include  on  the  Board  a  number  of females  that  enables  a  balanced  presence  of  women  and men,  and  to  prevent  the  selection  procedures  from  being affected  by  any  implicit  bias  that  would  hinder  the appointment  of  female  Directors,  have  been  initiated  and implemented by the Company.\n\nThus,  in  the  change  in  the  composition  of  the  Company's Board  of  Directors  that  was  implemented  in  2016,  at  the proposal  of  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors unanimously appointed Ms. Sabina Flux\u00e0 Thienemann as an Independent Director of Telef\u00f3nica. This appointment was ratified by the shareholders at the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica held on May 12, 2016.\n\nSimilarly, in the change in the composition of the Company's Board  of  Directors  that  was  implemented  in  2017,  at  the proposal  of  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors unanimously appointed Ms. Carmen Garc\u00eda de Andr\u00e9s as an Independent Director of Telef\u00f3nica. This appointment was ratified by the shareholders at the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica held on June 9, 2017.",

This  appointment  was  ratified  by  the  shareholders  at  the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Telef\u00f3nica held on June 8, 2018.\n\nLast,  in  2019  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  at  the proposal  of  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee, unanimously appointed Ms. Claudia Sender Ram\u00edrez and Ms. Ver\u00f3nica Pascual Bo\u00e9 as Independent  Directors  of  Telef\u00f3nica.  These  appointments were ratified by the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of  Telef\u00f3nica  held  on  June  12,  2020,  at  which  both  were appointed Directors for the statutory term of four years.\n\nIt  should also be noted that the same criteria and principles that  the  Company  applies  to  the  process  of  selecting  and appointing the members of the Board of Directors are applied to  the  appointment  of  the  Directors  who  are  part  of  the various Committees of the Company's Board of Directors, as well as, with regard to gender diversity, the appointment of female  senior  executive,  all  without  prejudice  to  the  key principles  of  merit  and  ability  that  must  govern  all  of  the Company's staff selection processes.\n\nIn  this  regard,  in  2019  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and Corporate  Governance  Committee  verified  compliance  with the  Diversity  Policy  in  relation  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. and the selection of Directors on the occasion of  the  appointment  of  Ms  Claudia  Sender  Ram\u00edrez  and  Ms Ver\u00f3nica  Pascual  Bo\u00e9  as  Directors  and  the  appointment  of the  members of the  Committees of  the  Board  of  Directors. Likewise,  in  financial  year  2020,  compliance  with  the aforementioned  Policy  was  verified  on  the  occasion  of  the proposal for ratification and re-election of Directors submitted and approved by the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of June 12, 2020, and of the proposal of  appointment  of  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors' Committees.\n\nOn the occasion of the proposed re-election, ratification and appointment  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors, information  was  provided  to  shareholders  on  the  diversity criteria and objectives in the reports prepared by the Board of Directors and the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nLast,  with  regard  to  performance  evaluation,  the  Board  of Directors conducts an annual evaluation of its operation and of  that  of  its  Committees,  assessing  in  particular  the application, in terms of the composition and competencies of the  Board  of  Directors,  of  the  various  aspects  of  diversity included  in  the  aforementioned  Policy,  as  well  as  the performance of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, of the Company's Chief  Executive  Officer  and  of  the  various Directors,  paying  special  attention  to  the  heads  of  the various Board Committees and adopting appropriate measures for their improvement. This assessment is carried out  every  three  years  with  the  assistance  of  an  external consultant, whose independence is verified by the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee.  In  this  regard,  as  indicated  at  the  end  of  this section  under  the  title  \"Evalutation  of  the  Board  and  of  its\n\nCommittees\",  for  the  evaluation  corresponding  to  the financial  year  2020,  the  Company  has  been  supported  by Egon Zehnder as external advisor.\n\nThe Diversity Policy in relation to the Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. Board of Directors and the Selection of Directors is public and may be viewed on the corporate website (www.telefonica.com).\n\nProcedure for the Selection, Appointment, Re-election and Cessation of Directors\n\n## Selection and Appointment\n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  Telef\u00f3nica's  Bylaws  provide  that  the Board of Directors shall consist of a minimum of five and a maximum  of  twenty  members,  who  shall  be  appointed  by the shareholders at the General Meeting.\n\nThe Directors shall hold office for a maximum period of four years and may be re-elected one or more times for periods of the same maximum length. On a provisional basis, the Board of  Directors,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Companies Act and of the Bylaws, may fill existing vacancies on an interim basis.\n\nIn  this  regard,  it  should  be  noted  that  on  certain  occasions, when  it  is  indispensable  because  vacancies  have  occurred after  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  was  held,  and  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act, Directors  are  appointed  on  an  interim  basis,  subject  to ratification at the next General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nOtherwise,  and  in  any  event,  the  proposals  for  the appointment of Directors must comply with the provisions of the Bylaws and of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, must  be  preceded  by  the  corresponding  report  of  the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee and, in the case of Independent Directors, by the corresponding proposal. In any event, the proposals must be accompanied  by  a  supporting  report  from  the  Board  of Directors  assessing  the  competence,  experience  and  merits of the proposed candidate.\n\nIn  this  regard,  and  in  accordance  with  the  responsibilities assigned  to  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance  Committee,  this  Committee  must  evaluate  the skills,  knowledge  and  experience  required  on  the  Board  of Directors, defining the functions and competencies required of the candidates who must fill each vacancy, and evaluating the  specific  amount  of  time  and  dedication  that  will  allow them to perform their duties effectively.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  latter,  and  in  accordance  with  the provisions of Article 29.2 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, those who are members of more than five Boards of  Directors  of  other  companies  other  than  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A. and  its  Group  companies  may  not  be  appointed  to  the Company's  Board.  For  these  purposes,  a)  all  Boards  of Directors of companies that are part of the same Group shall be counted as a single board of directors; and b) those Boards of  Directors  of  asset-holding  companies  or  those  that constitute  vehicles  or  complements  for  the  professional exercise  of  the  Director  himself/herself,  his/her  spouse  or person with a similar relationship, or his/her closest relatives, shall not be counted. As an exception, and for duly justified reasons,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  exempt  the  Director",

Likewise,  it  must  report  on  the proposals for the appointment of the remaining Directors of the Company, whether for their appointment on an interim basis or for their submission  to  a  decision  by  the shareholders  at  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  along with the proposals for their re-election or separation at the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nSimilarly, it shall explain the category of each Director by the Board  of  Directors  at  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  at which the shareholders must make  or ratify their appointment. Furthermore, such category shall be reviewed annually by the Board, after verification by the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, and a summary  of  this  review  shall  be  included  in  the  Annual Corporate Governance Report.\n\nIn any case, and in the event of the re-election or ratification of  Directors  at  the  General  Meeting,  the  report  of  the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee  or,  in  the  case  of  Independent  Directors,  the proposal of said Committee, shall contain an assessment of the work and effective dedication to the position during the last  period  of  time  in  which  it  was  held  by  the  proposed Director, as well as its ability to continue to do so.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Nominating,  Compensation and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  shall  ensure,  within the  scope  of  their  respective  powers,  that  the  candidates proposed  for  the  position  of  Director  are  persons  of recognized  probity,  competence  and  experience,  who  are willing  to  devote  the  time  and  effort  required  for  the performance  of  their  duties,  exercising  rigorous  care  in  the selection of the persons called upon to serve as Independent Directors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  must  endeavor  to  ensure  that  the procedures  for  the  selection  of  its  members  promote diversity  with  respect  to  issues  such  as  age,  gender, disability, knowledge, education and professional experience, and are free from any implicit bias that might imply any form of discrimination, and, in particular, facilitate the selection of female Directors  in  such  numbers  as  to  achieve  a  balanced presence of women and men.\n\nIn  this  regard,  and  as  mentioned  earlier,  at  its  meeting  of November 25, 2015 the Board of Directors approved a Policy for the Selection of Directors, which on December 13, 2017, was updated to include the Diversity Policy applicable to the Board  of  Directors,  such  that  it  was  renamed  the  Diversity Policy  in  relation  to  the  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  Board  of  Directors and the Selection of Board Members. Likewise, on December 16, 2020, the Board of Directors approved an update of this Policy to reflect the most recent regulatory standards and, in particular, to adjust it to the provisions of the Recommendations  of  the  Good  Governance  Code  of  the National  Market  Securities  Commission  (CNMV)  regarding\n\n## diversity.\n\nThe  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee shall verify, on an annual basis, compliance with the  Policy  for  the  diversity  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and selection  of  Directors,  and  shall  include  the  corresponding summary in the Annual Corporate Governance Report and in such  other  documents  as  are  deemed  appropriate.  In addition, the Board of Directors shall periodically evaluate the degree  of  compliance  with  and  effectiveness  of  the  Policy and, in particular, the percentage of female Directors at any given time, and a detailed description of the Policy, as well as the  objectives  set  in  this  respect  and  the  results  obtained, shall be included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. Likewise,  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance  Committee  may  also  propose  to  the  Board  of Directors  any  updates  and  proposed  improvements  of  the Policy it deems appropriate.\n\n## Re-election\n\nThe  Company's  Directors  may  be  re-elected  one  or  more times  for  periods  of  the  same  length  as  that  of  the  initial period.\n\nIn  the  same  way  as  proposals  for  appointments,  proposals for  the  re-election  of  Directors  must  be  preceded  by  the corresponding report of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate  Governance  Committee,  and,  in  the  case  of Independent Directors, by the corresponding proposal.\n\n## Cessation or Removal\n\nDirectors shall cease to hold office when the time period for which  they  were  appointed  expires,  or  when  so  decided  by the  shareholders  at  the  General  Meeting  in  the  exercise  of the powers legally granted to them.\n\nWhen a Director ceases to hold office before the end of his or her  term,  whether  by  resignation  or  by  resolution  of  the General Meeting, the Director must adequately explain in a letter  which  will  be  sent  to  all  members  of  the  Board  of Directors the reasons for leaving office or, in the case of nonexecutive Directors, the Director's views as to the grounds for removal by the shareholders acting at the General Meeting.\n\nIn addition, to the extent material to investors, the Company shall as soon as possible make public the cessation in office, including  sufficient  information  as  to  the  reasons  or circumstances stated by the Director.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall not propose the removal of any Independent Director prior to the end of the bylaw-mandated period for which the said Director was appointed, unless due grounds therefor are present, as acknowledged by the Board at  the  proposal  of  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and Corporate Governance Committee. Specifically, due grounds shall  be  deemed  to  exist  when  the  Director  has  failed  to perform the duties inherent in his position.\n\nThe removal of Independent Directors may also be proposed as a result of Public Tender Offers, mergers or other similar corporate transactions that entail a change in the structure of the company's capital.\n\nLikewise,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  article  12  of",

Mr.  Pablo  de  Carvajal  Gonz\u00e1lez  is  also Telef\u00f3nica's Global Director of Regulatory Affairs.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  has  a  Deputy  Secretary, Mr. Antonio Garc\u00eda-Mon Mara\u00f1\u00e9s, who assists the Secretary and  replaces  him  in  the  performance  of  his  duties  in  the event  of  his  absence  or  inability.  Mr.  Garc\u00eda-Mon  is  also Deputy  General  Secretary  and  Director  of  Corporate  Legal Services.\n\nNeither the Secretary nor the Deputy Secretary of the Board have the status of Directors.\n\n## \u00b7 Committees of the Board of Directors\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, and on the date of issuance of this Report,  the  Board  of  Directors  had  and  has  an  Executive Commission and five advisory or control committees, whose composition,  duties  and  powers  are  described  in  detail  in advance.\n\n## Operation of the Board of Directors\n\nBoth  the  Bylaws  and  the  Regulations  of  the  Board  specify that  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  meet  routinely  once  a month, and, at the initiative of the Chairman, as often as he deems  it  appropriate  for  the  proper  functioning  of  the Company.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2020 the Telef\u00f3nica Board of Directors held thirteen meetings, each lasting between three and one-half and  four  and  one-half  hours,  depending  on  the  topics discussed.  As  a  result  of  the  health  crisis  arising  from  the spread  of  COVID-19,  most  of  the  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors  have  been  held  in  mixed  format,  with  a  small number of Directors attending in person (without exceeding the maximum number allowed in any case, depending on the health  recommendations)  and  the  remaining  Directors attending  by  electronic  means.  At  all  these  meetings,  the Secretary of the Board of Directors attested to the identity of all the attendees.\n\nThe power to call a meeting of the Board of Directors and, if appropriate, to draw up the Agenda of the Board's meetings rests with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who must however  call  a  meeting  when  requested  to  do  so  by  three Directors who indicate the issues to be discussed.\n\nA meeting of the Board of Directors may also be called by at least  one-third  of  its  members,  with  an  indication  of  the Agenda, if, after the submission of a request to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chairman, without just cause, has not called the meeting within a period of one month.\n\nThe  Company  adopts  the  measures  that  are  necessary  in order  for  the  Directors  to  have,  whenever  possible  and sufficiently  in  advance,  the  necessary  information,  which shall  be  drawn  up  and  oriented  specifically  toward  the preparation  of  the  meetings  of  the  Board  and  of  its Committees. In no case shall its compliance be waived on the grounds  of  the  importance  or  confidential  nature  of  the information, except under absolutely exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn  this  regard,  and  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of articles  18  and  20  of  the  Regulations  of  the  Board  of Directors,  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  Committees  shall draw  up  a  calendar  of  the  meetings  to  be  held  during  the year.  Such  calendar  may  be  modified  by  resolution  of  the Board itself or of the corresponding Committee, or pursuant to a decision by its Chairman, in which case the modification must be disclosed to the Directors as soon as possible.\n\nThe Board and its Committees also have an Action Plan that contains  a  detailed  description  and  the  frequency  of  the activities  to  be  carried  out  in  each  fiscal  year,  according  to the powers and duties assigned to them.\n\nSimilarly,  all  of  the  meetings  of  the  Board  and  of  the Committee  have  a  pre-established  Agenda,  which  is communicated at least three days before the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be held, along with the call to the meeting. The Agenda for each meeting clearly indicates the items regarding which the Board of Directors or the Executive Commission must make a decision or adopt a resolution.\n\nWith  the  same  goal,  in  general,  the  documentation associated  with  the  Agenda  for  the  meetings  is  made available  to  the  Directors  sufficiently  in  advance.  In  this regard, and in compliance with the provisions of article 19 of the  Regulations  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chairman  of the Board of Directors organizes the discussions, seeking and encouraging the active participation of all of the Directors in the deliberations, safeguarding the unconstrained statement of  their  viewpoints.  Similarly,  with  the  assistance  of  the Secretary,  the  Chairman  ensures  that  the  Directors  receive beforehand sufficient information to deliberate on the items on  the  Agenda.  He  also  ensures  that  sufficient  time  is devoted to the discussion of strategic issues and stimulates debate during the meetings, safeguarding the unconstrained statement of viewpoints by the Directors.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  provision  of  all  of  the  information  and clarifications  that  may  be  necessary  regarding  some  of  the issues to be addressed, the main officers of the Group attend essentially  all  of  the  meetings  of  the  Board  and  of  its Committees,  along  with  the  speakers  who  are  deemed appropriate, for the presentation of matters lying within their",

The  exercise  of  this  right  of information  is  channeled  through  the  Chairman  or  the Secretary  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  who  handle  requests from the Directors, either providing the information directly to  the  Directors  or  placing  them  in  touch  with  the  proper contact persons at the appropriate organizational level.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  can  validly  hold  a  meeting  when  a majority of its serving members are present or represented at  the  meeting.  The  Directors  must  personally  attend  the meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  If,  under  exceptional circumstances,  they  are  unable  to  do  so,  they  shall  ensure that the proxy they give to another member of the Board of Directors  includes,  insofar  as  possible,  the  appropriate instructions.  Non-executive  Directors  can  delegate  their proxy only to another non-executive Director. Such delegations may be made by letter or in any other way that ensures the certainty and validity of the proxy, in the opinion of  the  Chairman of the Board of Directors (article 19 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors and article 34.4 of the Bylaws).\n\nAll of the Directors were present, either in person or by proxy, in  person  or  by  telematic  means,  at  the  thirteen  meetings held by the Board in 2020.\n\nIn all cases, resolutions are adopted by an absolute majority of the votes of the Directors who are present at the meeting, either  in  person  or  by  proxy,  except  in  those  instances  in which,  for  certain  resolutions  to  be  valid,  the  law,  the  ByLaws or the Regulation of the Board of Directors requires the favorable vote of a larger number of Directors.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nBoth the Bylaws and the Regulations of the Board provide for an  Executive  Commission  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  with general  decision-making  authority  and,  consequently,  with the  express  delegation  of  all  of  the  powers  of  the  Board  of Directors, except for those powers that, by law or pursuant to the Bylaws, cannot be delegated.\n\nThe  Regulations  also  authorize  the  Board  of  Directors  to create one or more advisory or control committees entrusted with the task of examining and continuously monitoring any area  of  special  importance  to  the  good  governance  of  the Company, or performing the specific analysis of any factor or issue  whose  significance  or  magnitude  requires  it.  Such Committees do not have the status of corporate bodies, but rather  are  tools  in  the  service  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  to which  they  convey  the  conclusions  that  they  reach  with regard  to  the  issues  or  subjects  whose  handling  has  been entrusted to them.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, and on the date of issuance of this Report,  the  Board  of  Directors  had  and  has  an  Executive Commission and five advisory or control committees, whose composition, duties and powers are described below.\n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  at its meeting held on December 16, 2020, and at the proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee,  approved  the  partial  amendment  of  the Regulations  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A., which amendment consisted of the following: i) adapting it to the  Recommendations  of  the  Good  Governance  Code amended  in  June  with  which  the  Company  currently  fully complies;  ii)  adapt  it  to  certain  Recommendations  of  the Good Governance Code not amended in June 2020 and which the  Company  had  already  been  complying  with;  (iii) incorporate  some  complementary  aspects  or  technical clarifications. Among other issues, certain aspects relating to the  composition  of  the  Board  Committees  were  modified, and new functions were adjusted and assigned to the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee and the Sustainability and Quality  Committee,  and  the  express  regulation  of  the Strategy  and  Innovation  Committee  was  included  in  the Regulations.\n\nIn  coordination  with  the  amendment  of  the  Regulations  of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, at its meeting held on December 16, 2020, approved the partial amendment  of  the  Regulations  of  the  Audit  and  Control Committee  and  the  Regulations of the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  to include  the  changes  introduced  to  the  Regulations  of  the Board  of  Directors  with  respect  to  the  composition  and duties assigned, respectively, to each Committee.\n\nSimilarly, in the financial year 2020 and in January 2021, the Board of Directors and its committees have approved certain changes  in  the  composition  of  the  committees,  in  order  to continue improving and strengthening their performance and the  advice  and  support  that  they  provide  to  the  Board  of Directors in their respective spheres, in accordance with best international practices and recommendations.\n\nLikewise,  with  regard  to  the  meetings  held  by  the  Board  of Directors' Committees, during financial year 2020, as a result of the health crisis arising from the spread of COVID-19, most of the meetings of the Board of Directors' Committees were held  in  mixed  format,  with  a  small  number  of  Directors attending  in  person  (without  exceeding  in  any  case  the maximum  number  allowed  in  accordance  with  health recommendations) and the remaining Directors attending by electronic  means.  At  all  these  meetings,  the  Secretary  of each Committee attested to the identity of all the attendees.\n\nRegarding the matters addressed by the Committees, and in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  article  20  b)  3.  of  the Regulations  of  the  Board,  a  full  report  is  delivered  to  the Board of Directors so that it will be aware of the said matters for  the  exercise  of  its  responsibilities.  At  the  beginning  of each of the monthly meetings of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of each of the Committees delivers a report on the major matters that were addressed and on the activities and tasks  that  were  carried  out  by  the  respective  Committee, making  available to the Directors the corresponding documentation, so that the Directors  will  be  aware  of  such activities for the purposes  of  the  exercise of their responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, and in the same way as the Board of Directors",

Furthermore, this contracting of services, other than those of the  audit  itself,  is  carried  out  in  strict  compliance  with  the Audit Act, European regulations and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enacted  in the United States and  its implementing regulations. In this respect, and before hiring the auditor, the Audit  and  Control  Committee  analyses  the  content  of  the work  to  be  carried  out,  assessing  the  situations  that  may entail a risk to the independence of the Company's External Auditor, and specifically supervises the percentage represented by the fees paid by the latter of the audit firm's total  revenue.

In  any event,  the  Committee  shall  meet,  at  a  minimum,  on  each date  on  which  annual  or  interim  financial  information  is published.  In  such  cases,  the  Internal  Auditor  shall  be present.

Its purpose in this area is to make the world more human by connecting lives, which means that it  must  always  be  aware  of  how  it  can  contribute  toward generating  a  positive  impact  through  its  products  and services,  while  taking  great  care  to  minimize  any  negative impacts that its activities might cause. This involves being an ethical and responsible company - a concern that is reflected in Telef\u00f3nica's strategy and governance.\n\nThe  Principles  of  Responsible  Business  and  the  Group's Responsible  Business  Plan  reflect,  respectively,  the  ethical framework and the sustainability roadmap, both of which are approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  as  well  as  the  Group's most  relevant  policies  in  this  area  (see  the  policies  in  the chapter on ethics). The Sustainability and Quality Committee also  monitors  the  implementation  of  the  above-mentioned Responsible Business Plan at its monthly meetings.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Audit  and  Control  Committee  plays  an important  supervisory  role  in  the  area  of  ethics  and sustainability,  inasmuch  as  it  oversees  the  Company's compliance function, the risk analysis and risk management process, and the reporting processes.\n\nThe  Group's  Responsible  Business  Plan  includes  goals  and projects involving the ethical and responsible management of the  Company;  respect  for  human  rights;  the  Customer Promise;  commitments  to  privacy;  freedom  of  expression and  information;  security;  the  ethical  management  of artificial  intelligence  and  the  responsible  management  of technology;  sustainable  management  of  the  Supply  Chain; the  strategy  for  addressing  Climate  Change  and  the Environment; the promotion of Diversity; the safety and wellbeing of our employees; and a business strategy focused on generating  products  and  services  that  contribute  toward addressing  the  major  social  and  environmental  challenges facing society (through sustainable innovation).\n\nSome  of  the  most  important  goals  of  the  Responsible Business Plan are taken into account for the determination of the variable compensation of the Company's employees.\n\nTherefore,  through  the  Company's  governance  bodies,  the Responsible Business Plan is presented for its:\n\n| Approval         | BOARD OF DIRECTORS                    | BOARD OF DIRECTORS              |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Super-vision     | Sustainability and  Quality Committee | Audit and Control  Committee    |\n| Monitoring       | The Responsible Business Office       | The Responsible Business Office |\n| Implemen- tation | Corporate Business and  Support Areas | Country OBs                     |\n\nThe  Responsible  Business  Plan  is  monitored  by  the Responsible Business Office, which four times a year brings together  the  senior  managers  in  the  areas  of  Compliance, Audit, Legal Services, People, Corporate Ethics and Sustainability, Communications, Security, Procurement, Operations, Data & Analytics, Telef\u00f3nica Tech and Telef\u00f3nica Infra.  This  Office  reports  to  the  Sustainability  and  Quality Committee  through  the  head  of  Corporate  Ethics  and Sustainability.\n\nThe corporate business support areas, on the one hand, and the  Executive  Committees  of  the  Operators,  on  the  other hand, handle the implementation of the goals set out in the Responsible Business Plan.\n\nMost  important  activities  during  the  fiscal  year  and fulfillment of duties.\n\nOver  the  course  of  the  10  meetings  held  during  fiscal  year 2020, the Sustainability and Quality Committee has analyzed the quality indices for the principal services provided by the companies within the Telef\u00f3nica Group, evaluated the levels of commercial  service  given  to  customers  by  those companies, and has analyzed the Corporate Social Reputation  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group,  including  the  most relevant  issues  in  terms  of  Sustainability  (ethical  behavior, sustainable innovation, digital trust, the supply chain, talent and diversity management, customers, the environment and climate  change),  including  Responsible  Business  Plans  and the Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board and of its Committees\n\nOnce  a  year,  all  of  the  Company's  Directors  evaluate  the performance of the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., of its  Committees  and  of  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting. Furthermore, every three years such evaluation is carried out with  the  assistance  of  an  external  consultant,  whose independence  is  verified  by  the  Nominating,  Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee. Thus, the evaluation of  the  Board  of  Directors for  the  financial  year  2017  was carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  the  external  consultant Villafa\u00f1e  &  Asociados  Consultores,  the  evaluations  of  the financial years 2018 and 2019 were carried out internally by the Company, without assistance of an external consultant, and  for  the  evaluation  corresponding  to  the  financial  year 2020,  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  the  proposal  of  the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee, has had the support,  as  an  external  advisor,  of the consulting firm Egon Zehnder.\n\nThis  evaluation  process  consisted  of  the  completion  of evaluation questionnaires by each of the Directors, as well as individual  interviews  carried  out  by  the  consultancy  Egon Zehnder with each of them in order to assess and ascertain the opinions of the Directors on the issues and aspects that were the subject of the evaluation.",

Thus,  the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, at its meeting  held  on  January  26,  2021,  reviewed  and  analysed the  results  of  said  evaluation,  concluding,  in  general  terms, that the Directors had expressed a high degree of satisfaction with  the  organisation  and  activities  of  the  aforementioned governing  bodies.    Likewise,  the  aforementioned  Report  on the  results  of  the  2020  evaluation  was  presented  by consultant  Egon  Zehnder to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Company at its meeting held on January 27, 2021, and made available to all Directors.\n\nAfter a detailed examination and analysis of the results, the Board  of  Directors,  at  the  proposal  of  the  Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  has established  an  Action  Plan  for  the  implementation  of  the suggestions  and  recommendations  deemed  appropriate,  in order  to  optimise  the  functioning  of  the  Company's corporate governance system.\n\nSpecifically, certain areas of improvement were identified in relation  to  the  functioning  of  the  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors,  in  order  to:  i)  include  in  the  agendas  of  the meetings those issues that are of interest to the Telef\u00f3nica Group, related both to its own business and to the sector in which it operates; and ii) continue working to try to provide the  materials  for  the  meetings  with  greater  and  sufficient advance notice, if possible, with special focus on those points that are most relevant.\n\nOn the other hand, with regard to the General Shareholders' Meeting, and in order to optimise its development in terms of the  level  of  interventions  and  debate,  continue  working  on the  implementation  of  appropriate  means  and  actions  to facilitate  the  development of the Meeting and, at the same time, safeguard the political rights of shareholders, considering external elements such as the situation generated by COVID-19, which led to the holding of a solely telematic General Shareholders' Meeting  in order to safeguard the general interests and the health of shareholders,  employees  and  other  persons  involved  in  its preparation  and  holding.  Likewise,  in  order  to  avoid  undue discrimination  and  ensure  parity  of  treatment  among shareholders, a plurality of channels and means were made available  to  them  to  participate  remotely  in  the  General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nFinally,  with  regard  to  training,  and  taking  into  account  the forthcoming entry into force of regulations that may have an\n\nimpact  on  the  corporate  governance  system  or  others (including  the  Draft  Bill  for  the  Reform  of  the  Capital Companies Act), design and implement the training actions deemed  appropriate, and implement a defined and structured  training  programme  for  the  preparation  and integration of the members of the Board of Directors.  In this regard, it should be noted the ESG training plan provided to all members of the Board of Directors.\n\nOn the other hand, it is noted that consultant Egon Zehnder has  maintained  business  relations  during  the  financial  year 2020 for a total amount of 38,400 euros for the performance of other work for Telef\u00f3nica Group companies.",

The  aforementioned  Code includes  all  the  Company's  management  personnel within the concept of affected persons.\n\nIn accordance with that established in this regulation, the People with Management Responsibilities, their Administrative Personnel and the managers or employees  of  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  who  have  Privileged Information, or participate or have  access  to  or knowledge of a Confidential Operation (as defined in the previous  terms  of  the  internal  conduct  regulations regarding  Stock  Markets)  have  the  obligation  to  (a) remain  loyal  to  the  Group  and  its  shareholders  at  all times, regardless of his/her own or other's interests; (b) refrain from intervening in or influencing decision making that could affect persons or companies with which there is  conflict;  and  (c)  refrain  from  accessing  information classified as  confidential  that  affects  said  conflict. Additionally, these people (except for the members of the Company  Board  of  Directors  who  will  be  governed  in terms  of  communicating  conflicts  under  the  standards established  in  the  regulation  of  the  Board  of  Directors) have the obligation to make the Company aware of these situations, by means of the computer system established by Telef\u00f3nica for this purpose, as soon as possible, that would potentially entail the manifestation of conflicts of interest  because  of  its  activities  outside  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group, its family relationships, its personal assets or any other  reason  with:  (a)  financial  intermediaries  operating with the Group Telef\u00f3nica; (b) professional or institutional investors  who  have  a  significant  relationship  with  the Group Telef\u00f3nica; (c) suppliers of significant equipment or material; or (d) professional service providers or External Advisors.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  is  the  only  company  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group that is listed in Spain, so it is not necessary to have defined the specific mechanisms that would be applied to resolve  possible  conflicts  of  interest  with  subsidiaries listed in Spain.",

Remuneration GRI 102-37\n\n## Remuneration of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A.\n\nThis  section  and  the  following  section  4.9.2  consist  of  the Annual  Report  on  Remuneration  of  the  Directors  of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., which must be prepared and submitted to an advisory  vote  at  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting.  As  last year, this report is published as part of the Annual Corporate Governance Report and will remain accessible on the websites of the company  and  the  Spanish  Securities  Market Commission (CNMV) for the legally stipulated term.\n\n## 4.6.1. Principles of the Remuneration Policy\n\nAt  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  held  on  8  June  2018, Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. ('Telef\u00f3nica' or the 'Company') submitted a Directors' Remuneration Policy for a valid term encompassing\n\n2019,  2020  and  2021  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the 'Remuneration  Policy'). The  Remuneration  Policy  has maintained  the  essential  principles  applied  in  the  previous financial years and was approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting with 88.45% of the votes cast.\n\nThe  main  focus  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  remuneration  strategy  is  to attract,  retain  and  motivate  professionals  of  the  Company, enabling  it  to  achieve  its  strategic  targets  within  the  highly competitive  and  globalised  setting  in  which  it  performs  its business,  by  applying  the  most  appropriate  measures  and practices for such purpose.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the following are the principles of the Remuneration Policy:\n\n|                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Executive  Directors   | Non-Executive  Directors   |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Value creation       | Alignment with the shareholders' interests and the aim of sustainably creating value over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \u00b7                      |                            |\n| Pay for  Performance | A significant part of the total remuneration for the Executive Directors is variable and  receiving it is subject to achieving financial, business, value creation and ESG targets that  are predetermined, specific, quantifiable, and aligned with the Company's corporate plan.                   | \u00b7                      |                            |\n| Flexibility          | The variable remuneration is not guaranteed and is sufficiently flexible so that there is a  possibility of not paying this component.                                                                                                                                                               | \u00b7                      |                            |\n| Competitiveness      | In order to ensure the Company has the best professionals on board, the remuneration  package must be competitive, both in its structure and its overall amount, with respect  to other comparable companies at an international level.                                                              | \u00b7                      | \u00b7                          |\n| Good Governance      | When determining the remuneration for the Directors, the Company takes into consideration the developments taking place in regulations, best practices and  national and international recommendations and trends related to the  remuneration of Directors of companies listed on the stock market. | \u00b7                      | \u00b7                          |\n| Fair Pay             | The professional value, experience, time spent and responsibility of each director is  sufficiently remunerated, ensuring that the remuneration policies and practices  guarantee there is no discrimination for any reason (among others, due to gender, age,  culture, religion and/or race).      | \u00b7                      | \u00b7                          |\n| Suitability          | The amounts are sufficient to remunerate the qualifications, time spent and  responsibility of the Directors, guaranteeing their required loyalty and allegiance to the Company, without compromising the independence of the Non-Executive Directors.                                               |                        | \u00b7                          |\n| Transparency         | The level of transparency in relation to remuneration is in line with the best corporate governance practices in order to create trust among stakeholders, including shareholders  and investors.

conditions  for  the  Executive  Directors,  the  remuneration scheme  applicable  to  the  Company's  employees  has  been taken into account, as follows:\n\nSpecifically the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Remuneration  Policy  for  the  Executive  Directors  is aligned  with  the  policy  for  the  other  employees,  being rewarded for the value they contribute to Telef\u00f3nica and it shares the same principles.\n- \u00b7 The  elements  included  in  the  directors'  remuneration  for their  executive  duties  are  aligned  with  the  components included  in  the  remuneration  package  for  Telef\u00f3nica's executive group",

However,  these  new  items  have  no impact on the aforementioned principles. The new Remuneration  Policy,  provided  that  it  is  approved  at  the General Shareholders' Meeting, will come into force since the date that such meeting is held.\n\n## 4.6.2. What we do\n\n## EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\n\n- \u00b7 Linking the payment of the remuneration to the Company's results ('pay for performance').\n- \u00b7 The weighting of the financial metrics to which the variable remuneration is linked is currently 80%.\n- \u00b7 The  remuneration  is  aligned  with  the  interests  of  the shareholders  and  society  as  a  whole,  since  a  part  of  the variable remuneration is linked to customer trust and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) objectives\n- \u00b7 Long-Term Incentive Plans:\n- -A  minimum  performance  period  of  three  years  for measurement of the objectives.\n- -Delivery in shares.\n- -Linked  to  metrics  aligned  with  Telef\u00f3nica's  long-term strategic objectives.\n- -Inclusion of objectives linked to ESG*.\n- -Holding 100% of the awarded shares for a term of two years. This term is extended to 3 years extension in case of  non-compliance  with  the  permanent  shareholding commitment.\n- \u00b7 Standardisation of the malus and clawback clauses, which are applied to any variable remuneration component*.\n- \u00b7 Requirement  to  permanently  hold  shares  for  a  value equivalent to twice the fixed remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Consideration of the quality of the results in the long-term and any associated risk in the evaluation process of variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Recurrent  external  advice  for  the  purpose  of  considering market  practices  as  an  additional  factor  to  be  taken  into account  in  the  process  of  adopting  decisions  on  the Remuneration Policy's design.\n- \u00b7 No guaranteed variable remuneration.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- \u00b7 Non-discrimination for any reason is guaranteed regarding remuneration (among others gender, age, culture, religion or race). Telef\u00f3nica's staff are remunerated based on their professional  merit,  skills,  experience,  time  spent  and  the responsibility they undertake.\n\n(*) New components, adjustments or developments included in  the  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will be  submitted  for the approval of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021.\n\n## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\n\n- \u00b7 Remuneration  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the responsibilities and duties undertaken by each Director but without compromising the members' independence.\n- \u00b7 The  Non-Executive  Directors  are  not  included  in  the remuneration formulae or systems linked to the individual or Company's performance.\n- \u00b7 The Non-Executive Directors are not paid in shares, options, stock options or any share-linked instruments.\n- \u00b7 The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any longterm  savings  systems,  such  as  retirement  plans,  pension plans and any other welfare systems.\n\n## 4.6.3. The process for determinithe Remuneration Policy and the Company's bodies involved\n\nThe  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee,  the  responsibilities  and  duties  of  which  are stipulated in Article 40 of the Articles of Association, Article 23 of  the  Board  of  Directors'  Regulations  and  Article  4  of  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee's Regulations, plays a crucial role in defining the Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  Remuneration  Policy  and  in  developing and deciding on its components; however the most important decisions must be approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee's mandate, within the scope of remuneration, consists of continuously reviewing and updating the remuneration system applicable to the Directors and Senior Executive  Directors  and  designing  new  remuneration  plans that enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate the most outstanding professionals, aligning their interests  with the Company's strategic targets.",

In  this  respect,  Willis  Towers  Watson  provided advice on the design of this Annual Report on Remuneration of  the  Directors  and  when  the  Remuneration  Policy  was drawn  up  (current  and  proposed).

Therefore,  as  indicated,  this  new  Remuneration  Policy will remain in force until 31 December 2023, even though the Board of Directors may propose a new policy for approval on a previous date, if it is considered appropriate.\n\nAs explained in the following sections, the new Remuneration Policy  is  a  continuation  of  the  policy  in  force  (which  was approved by a very high percentage, i.e. 88.45% of the votes cast  at  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  held  on  8  June 2018),  even  though  it  includes,  as  mentioned  above,  some adjustments that  enable  the  improvement  of  the  alignment with our strategic priorities, the opinion of investors and the good  governance  recommendations.  This  Remuneration Policy has also taken into consideration the contents required according  to  Directive  (EU)  2017/828  of  the  European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  17  May  2017  amending Directive 2007/36/EC as regards the encouragement of longterm shareholder engagement in listed companies.\n\nThe  principles  that  the  new  Remuneration  Policy  would introduce  (which  will  be  submitted  for  the  approval  of  the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021) refer to (i) extending the  applicable  retention  period  for  shares  that,  when appropriate,  are  provided  within  the  scope  of  long-term incentive plans as of 2021; (ii) adapting the commitment to permanently hold shares to the new recommendation 62 in the  Good  Governance  Code,  published  in  June  2020;  (iii) standardising the malus and clawback clauses for any variable remuneration component, whenever certain situations arise; and  (iv)  adding  a  specific  section  related  to  evaluating  the results  and  extraordinary  remuneration where, among other issues,  the  possibility  is  included  for  the  Board  of  Directors, according to a proposal made  by  the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  is authorised  to  agree  on  granting  extraordinary  remuneration to  the  Executive  Directors  if  they  achieve  certain  strategic targets  of  the  Company.  However,  under  no  circumstances may this extraordinary remuneration imply an increase in the maximum  total  remuneration  assigned  to  the  Executive Directors in the Remuneration Policy.\n\nAs mentioned above, the new Remuneration Policy will come into force from the date the General Meeting is held until 31 December 2023.\n\n## 4.6.6.  The Executive Directors' remuneration in 2021 GRI 102-35, 102-36\n\nAs specified above, as of the date of this Report, the Executive Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. are Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez,  Executive  Chairman,  and  Mr.  \u00c1ngel  Vil\u00e1  Boix,  Chief Operating Officer/C.O.O.\n\n## Pay for performance and pay mix\n\nThe remuneration system for Telef\u00f3nica's Executive Directors is  characterised  by  its  competitiveness  and  high  demands. The  variable  remuneration,  which  is  designed  to  incentivise achievement of the Company's short- and long-term targets, is one of the fundamental pillars of this system.\n\nIn  this  respect,  Telef\u00f3nica's  long-term  strategy  is  based  on the  following  three  basic  pillars,  which  are  linked  to  the variable remuneration of Telef\u00f3nica's whole human team:\n\n- (i) Growth, in  the  form  of  Operative  Revenues  and  Total Shareholders Return;\n- (ii) Efficiency, through  improving  the  Operative  Income Before  Depreciations  and  Amortisations  (OIBDA)  margin and generating Free Cash Flow;\n- (iii) Trust. Telef\u00f3nica is a company that is fully committed to sustainability. For such purpose, factors are weighted such as  customer  trust,  society  trust,  gender  equality  or contributing to the fight against climate change.\n\nTherefore, receiving the Short-Term Variable Remuneration is linked to achieving certain financial and business operational targets linked to growth and efficiency, as well as a series of ESG objectives linked to customer and society trust and the responsibility with the environment and the gender equality. Moreover,  the  long-term  variable  remuneration  is  linked  to value creation for the shareholders in the Telef\u00f3nica Group in the medium- and long-term by measuring the growth in the total shareholders return, economic financial targets and ESG (as  determined  in  the  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  2021-2026 that  will  be  submitted  for  the  approval  of  the  General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll the objectives are predetermined, specific, quantifiable and aligned  with  Telef\u00f3nica's  strategic  goals,  strictly  determined and  assessed  by  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and Corporate Governance Committee, which monitors them, so that  their  alignment  with  Telef\u00f3nica's  social  interests  is ensured.",

This  remuneration  is  13.8% lower than the one determined for the position of Executive Chairman prior to his appointment as such.\n\n## Chief Operating Officer ('Consejero Delegado'): \u20ac1,600,000.\n\nThis remuneration is the same as the amount paid when Mr. Vil\u00e1  was  appointed  as  a  Chief  Operating  Officer  of  the Company on 26 July 2017.\n\n## Functioning:\n\nThe  annual  gross  fixed  remuneration  is  paid  on  a  monthly basis in cash. This remuneration is determined by the Board, according to a proposal made  by  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nThis remuneration may be adjusted every year depending on the  criteria  approved  from  time  to  time  by  the  Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee.  The maximum annualised increase during the term of the Policy may  not  exceed  10%  of  the  gross  annual  salary.  In  certain situations, such as, for instance, Telef\u00f3nica Group extraordinary results, change in the size and in the business complexity,  a  change  in  responsibility,  development  of  the duties and/or special needs for retention and motivation, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee  may  decide  to  apply  higher  increases.

As  a  result,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  selected  the quantifiable  and  measurable  metrics  that  best  reflect  the Telef\u00f3nica Group's value creation levers, on a proposal from the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee. These metrics are the same as those determined in 2020, with some change in the relative weight of the nonfinancial  targets  related  to  the  customer  trust  and  ESG targets:\n\n- \u00b7 80% of the targets are operational and financial:\n- \u00b7 30%  of  the  targets  are  linked  to  the  OIBDA,  which reflects  both  the  Group's  growth  and  development  in operational execution.\n- \u00b7 30% of the targets are linked to the Operative Revenue, which  enables  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  growth  to  be measured.\n- \u00b7 20% of the objectives is linked to the Free Cash Flow, the generation of which enables to reduce the debt.\n\n- \u00b7 The  remaining  20%  is  linked  to  non-financial  -  ESG objectives  linked  to  Customer  and  Society  trust, and responsibility for Gender Equality and for the Planet:\n- \u00b7 NPS (40%).\n- \u00b7 GAP NPS (15%).\n- \u00b7 Climate Change - GHG Emissions (25%).\n- \u00b7 Society's Trust - REP Trak (15%).\n- \u00b7 Gender  Equality  - %  of  Women  in  executive  positions 5%).\n\n## Functioning:\n\nThe  aforementioned  targets  are  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors at the beginning of each financial year, according to a  proposal  made  by  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and Corporate Governance Committee. The maximum level of the Short-Term Variable Remuneration target in 2021 remains at 129.5% in the case of the maximum achievement of the predetermined targets.\n\nFor  the  purpose  of  calculating  the  payment  coefficient obtained for each level of target achievement, a performance scale  is  determined  for  each  metric,  which  includes  a minimum threshold below which no incentive is paid. In the case  of  100%  achievement  of  the  targets  set,  the  target Short-Term  Variable  Remuneration  will  be  paid  and,  in  the case of maximum achievement of the targets the maximum Short-Term Variable Remuneration will be received.\n\nInformation  in  greater  detail  is  provided  below  about  the scales  for  achieving  each  of  the  targets  and  how  the stipulated maximum is achieved:\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  such  purpose,  it  applies  the  internal  target assessment rules and procedures set out by the Company for its executives.  When  conducting  this  assessment,  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee  is  supported  by  the  Audit  and  Supervisory Committee,  which  provides  information  about  the  results audited by the Company's external auditor (PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AUDITORES, S.L.) and by the internal audit. The Committee also considers any associated risk for both  setting  the  targets  and  assessing  their achievement.\n\nIn  this  respect,  any  positive  or  negative  economic  effects caused by extraordinary events that could distort the findings of the assessment are disregarded and the long-term quality of  the  results  and  any  associated  risk  are  considered  in  the proposed Short-Term Variable Remuneration.\n\nThe  Short-Term  Variable  Remuneration  is  fully  paid  in  cash providing the targets set for this purpose have been achieved. This  remuneration  will  not  be  paid  until  the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee and the Audit  and  Supervisory  Committee  have  carried  out  the actions  described  above  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  following year.\n\nMoreover,  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee is authorised to make a proposal to the Board of Directors to fully or partially cancel payment of the  short-term  variable  remuneration  if  certain  unforeseen circumstances arise, as described in section [ \u25cf ] of this Report, as well as its partial or full clawback within twenty-four (24) months after the payment thereof.\n\n## C. LONG-TERM VARIABLE REMUNERATION\n\n## Purpose:\n\nTo increase the Executive Directors' and management team's commitment to the Company and its Strategic  Plan,  linking their remuneration to creating value for the shareholders and sustainable achievement of the strategic targets, so that it is in line with the best remuneration practices. In turn, by means of  its  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan,  the  Company  also  aims  at offering a competitive remuneration package that contributes to  retaining  the  managers  who  hold  key  positions  in  the organisation.\n\n## Description:\n\nA new Long-Term Incentive Plan 2021-2026 will be proposed at  the  next  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  consisting  of payment  with  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.'s  shares  aim  to  the  Senior Management of the Telef\u00f3nica Group, including the Executive Directors  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.,  who  meet  the  requirements stipulated for such purpose from time to time, are invited to take part in such Plan.\n\nThe total term of the Plan will be five (5) years divided into three (3) cycles, independent one from the other, of three (3) years  each  (in  other  words,  by  delivering  the  shares corresponding  to  each  cycle  once  three  years  have  elapsed counted from the start of each cycle).\n\n- 1. The  first  cycle  2021-2024:  The  target  measurement period  begins  on  1  January  2021  and  will  end  on  31 December 2023. If the targets are achieved, the shares will be delivered in 2024, once the audited annual accounts for the year 2023 have been drawn up. On the date this report is submitted,  the  grant  of  shares  have  not  been determined  yet  and  this  will  only  take  place  once approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n- 2. The  second  cycle  2022-2025:  The  target  measurement period  will  begin  on  1  January  2022  and  will  end  on  31 December 2024. If the targets are achieved, the shares will be delivered in 2025, once the audited annual accounts for the year 2024 have been drawn up.\n- 3. The third and last cycle 2023-2026: The target measurement period will begin on 1 January 2023 and will end on 31 December 2025. If the targets are achieved, the shares will be delivered in 2026, once the audited annual accounts for the year 2025 have been drawn up.\n\nMoreover, in 2021 the measurement periods for the second and third cycle of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023 will  remain in force, approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting  in  2018,  to  determine,  when  appropriate,  the shares  that  the  members  will  eventually  receive.  The features and terms of this Plan can be seen in the Annual Report  on  Remuneration  of  the  Directors  for  2018  and 2019.\n\n## Metrics  and  functioning  of  the  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan 2021-2026:\n\nThe  metrics  to  be  proposed  for  the  First  Cycle  of  the  LongTerm Incentive Plan 2021-2026 are the Relative TSR (50%), Free  Cash  Flow  (40%)  and  Neutralizing  Emissions  to  reach zero net emissions by 2025 (10%).\n\n(see next page)",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach of these metrics is explained below:\n\n## Relative TSR (50%)\n\nDefinition: The performance of the share taking into account the cumulative variation of Telef\u00f3nica's share value, including the  dividends  and  other  similar  concepts  perceived  by  the shareholder during the cycle in question.\n\nDetermining the level of achievemen t: The evolution of TSR from Telef\u00f3nica S.A.'s shares is measured from the beginning of  the  cycle  (2021)  until  the  end  of  such  cycle  (2023),  in relation  to  the  TSR  from  other  companies  pertaining  to  the telecommunication  sector,  weighted  depending  on  their relevance to Telef\u00f3nica that, for the purpose of the Plan, will be used as the comparison group. The companies included in the  comparison  group  are  the  following:  America  Movil,  BT Group, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telecom Italia, Vodafone Group,  Proximus,  Royal  KPN,  Millicom,  Swisscom,  Telenor, TeliaSonera, Tim Brasil, Liberty Global and Altice Europe.\n\nPerformance  Scale: The  number  of  shares  to  be  provided associated  with  the  achievement  of  this  target  will  be between 15% of the number of theoretical shares, in the case that  the  evolution  of  the  TSR  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  shares  is,  at least,  the  median  of  the  comparison  group  (below  this threshold  no  incentive  will  be  payable)  and  50%  if  the evolution is in the third or higher quartile of the comparison group. The percentage by linear interpolation is calculated for those that are between the median and the third quartile.\n\n## Free Cash Flow (40%)\n\nDefinition: Free cash flow generation (FCF).\n\nDetermining  the  level  of  achievement :  The  level  of  FCF generated by the Telef\u00f3nica Group is measured during each year,  in  comparison  with  the  value  set  in  the  budgets approved by the Board of Directors for each year, considering the  final  level  of  achievement  of  FCF,  the  average  of  the annual  partial results obtained  and  approved  by  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nPerformance  Scale: For  each  cycle,  the  Board  of  Directors, according to a proposal made  by  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, determines  an  achievement  scale  that  includes  a  minimum threshold  of  90%  achievement,  below  which  no  incentive  is paid  and  the  achievement  of  which  implies  20%  of  the theoretical  shares  assigned  being  provided,  and  a  maximum level  of  100%  achievement,  which  implies  40%  of  the theoretical shares assigned being provided.\n\n## Neutralising Emissions to reach zero net emissions by 2025 (10%)\n\nDefinitio n : Neutralisation of Telef\u00f3nica Group CO2 emissions, being  also  necessary  to  reach  certain  level  of  emission reduction of scope 1 + 2, in line with the 1.5\u00baC scenario of the Paris  Agreement  (SBTi)  and  with  the  objective  set  by  the Company net zero emissions by 2025.\n\nEmission  neutralisation  is  the  carbon  credits  purchase  to absorb CO2 of the atmosphere. To become a company with net  zero  emissions  as  many  emissions  as  are  generated should be neutralised (scopes 1+2).\n\nCarbon credits consist of the purchase of CO2 certificates on the voluntary market. These credits are generated by projects that  absorb  CO2  from  the  atmosphere,  which  must  meet international  standards  of  the  highest  quality  and,  as  far  as possible,  have  associated  social  benefits.  This  information  is verified  annually  by  AENOR  in  accordance  with  the  GHG Protocol standard.\n\nScope  1  and  2  emissions  consist  of  direct  and  indirect  CO2 emissions  from  our  daily  activity  due  to  fuel  consumption, refrigerant gas leaks and the electricity use. Net emissions are calculated  as  the  difference  between  scope  1+2  emissions and the purchase of carbon credits.",

Additionally,  it  will  be necessary to reach a minimum level of emission reduction of scope 1 + 2, in line in line with the 1,5\u00baC scenario of the Paris Agreement (SBTi) for payment.\n\nThe  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee  conducts  an  assessment  of  the  targets  on  an annual  basis  and,  once  the  Plan  has  ended,  the  level  of achievement is determined. When conducting this assessment,  the  Committee  is  supported  by  the  Audit  and Supervisory  Committee,  which  provides  information  about the accounts audited by the Company's external auditor. The Committee also takes into consideration any associated risk for both setting the targets and assessing their achievement.\n\nWhen determining the target achievement level, any positive or negative economic impact caused by extraordinary events that could distort the results of the assessment  is disregarded.\n\nRegarding  the  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  2021-2026,  if  it  is approved, it is determined that 100% of the shares provided within  the  scope  of  the  Plan  to  the  Executive  Directors  and other members that are determined by the Board of Directors are subject to a retention period of two years.\n\nThe  foregoing  is  not  applicable  to  the  shares  that  the Executive  Directors  need  to  sell  to  pay  the  costs  related  to their acquisition or, with prior consideration of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee,  to  cover  extraordinary  situations  arising  that require this.\n\nIn order for each of the members to be entitled to receive the corresponding shares, they must have held an employment or commercial  relationship  with  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  on  the date  the  shares  of  each  cycle  are  provided  (subject  to  the exceptions considered appropriate) and they must have been associated with the Telef\u00f3nica Group for at least one year.\n\n## Incentives assigned to the Long-Term Variable Remuneration in force in 2021:\n\nAs mentioned above, the cycles in force in 2021 related to the long-term incentive plans are as follows:\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Second cycle 2019-2022: As shown in the previous table, the  maximum  number  of  shares  that  the  Executive Directors  can  receive  represents,  at  their  grant  value, 185% of their Fixed Remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Third  cycle  2020-2023:  In  2020,  as  a  gesture  of responsibility towards the society, customers, shareholders  and  employees  of  Telef\u00f3nica  due  to  the economic impact derived by COVID-19, it was decided that the  assignment  value  in  this  cycle  would  be  50%  lower than  in  previous  cycles.  This  implies  a  reduction  in  the total target remuneration (considered, for these purposes, as Fixed Remuneration, Short-Term Variable Remuneration and annualised Long-Term Variable Remuneration) of approximately 20%.\n\nTherefore,  the  maximum  number  of  shares  represents,  at their  grant  value,  92.5%  of  the  Fixed  Remuneration  for  the Executive  Chairman  and  82.5%  for  the  Chief  Operating",

In  any  case,  the assignment  will  take  place  in  accordance  with  the maximum limit determined in the Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe number of shares to be provided at the end of each cycle of  the  Plan  will  depend  on  the  assignment  approved  by  the Board  of  Directors,  according  to  a  proposal  made  by  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, and the level the targets of the Plan is achieved.\n\nIn the event of over-achievement of the targets, no additional shares will be provided other than those originally assigned to the Executive Directors.\n\n## D. TELEF\u00d3NICA EMPLOYEE PENSION PLAN\n\n## Contributions\n\nThe new Remuneration Policy, which will be submitted for the approval of the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021, which will remain in force until 31 December 2023, does not include any changes in this respect. The Pension Plan for the Executive Directors follow the same scheme and is aligned with the Pension Plan for Telef\u00f3nica's employees regarding its terms and conditions and the following contribution percentages:\n\n- \u00b7 Executive Chairman: 6.87% of his base salary, plus 2.2% as a  mandatory  contribution  to  be  made  by  the  Executive Chairman  up  to  the  maximum  annual  limit  that  the  law stipulates from time to time.\n- \u00b7 Chief Operating Officer: 4.51% of his base salary, plus 2.2% as  a  mandatory  contribution  to  be  made  by  the  Chief Operating Officer up to the maximum annual limit that the law stipulates from time to time.\n\n## Functioning:\n\nAs described in each of the Executive Directors contracts, the Pension Plan is a defined-contribution plan and the contingencies covered  are  as  follows: retirement; the member's death; the beneficiary's death; total and permanent disability  to  work  in  one's  usual  profession,  absolute  and permanent incapacity for all work and serious disability; and severe or major dependency of the member.\n\nThe  benefits  consist  of  the  economic  right  accrued  by  the beneficiaries  as  a  result  of  the  occurrence  of  any  of  the contingencies  covered  by  this  Pension  Plan.  It  is  quantified according to the number of account units that correspond to each  member  based  on  the  amounts  contributed  to  the Pension  Plan  and  is  assessed  for  the  purpose  of  payment according to the value of the account unit from the business day before the date when the benefits become effective.\n\nFurthermore,  the  members  may  also  exercise  their  vested rights, in whole or in part, on an exceptional basis in the event\n\nof serious illness or long-term unemployment.\n\nThe Pension Plan is  included  within  the  'Fonditel  B  Pension Fund,' managed by Fonditel Pensiones, EGFP, S.A.\n\nAs  took  place  in  2015,  in  the  financial  year  2021  applicable law has modified the financial and tax limits for contributions to pension plans. In this respect, as has been taking place, in order  to  compensate  the  difference  arising  in  favour  of  the beneficiaries,  a  unit-link  group  insurance  policy  has  been taken out through which the aforementioned differences that could arise are channelled in each financial year.\n\nThe  unit-link  insurance  policy  has  been  taken  out  with  the company  Plus  Ultra,  Seguros  Generales  y  Vida,  S.A.  de Seguros  y  Reaseguros  (after  the  merger  by  take-over  of Seguros de Vida y Pensiones Antares, S.A. by Plus Ultra, on 31 December 2019), and covers the same contingencies as those included  in  the  Pension  Plan  with  the  same  exceptional liquidity  events  in  the  case  of  serious  illness  or  long-term unemployment.\n\n## E. REMUNERATION IN KIND\n\nIn  addition  to  the  life  insurance  policy  covering  death  or disability described  above,  the  Executive  Directors  are provided  with  a  general  health  insurance  policy  and  dental coverage as remuneration in kind and they are also provided with  a  company  vehicle,  all  of  the  foregoing  in  line  with  the general policy applicable to the Company's Executives.\n\nMoreover,  it  is  reported  that,  on  the  date  this  Report  is approved, the 'Global Incentive Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. Stock Option Plan  for  Employees  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group'  (hereinafter referred  to  as  the  'Global  Plan'),  approved  at  the  General Shareholders' Meeting held in 2018, is in the final execution period.  Thus,  as  an  example  of  their  commitment  to  the Company  and  in  order  to  provide  an  incentive  to  other employees  to  take  part  in  the  Global  Plan,  the  Executive Directors contributed the maximum allowed according to the applicable Plan of \u20ac1,800. In 2021, the Executive Directors will receive  167  additional  shares  (equivalent  to  one  additional share for each two shares acquired), providing they have met the permanence and retention condition (one year after the end of the purchase period, i.e. until 31 July 2021).\n\nMoreover,  Telef\u00f3nica  has  taken  out  a  third  party  liability insurance policy (D&O) for its managers, executives and staff performing  similar  duties  in  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group,  with  the usual  terms  and  conditions  for  these  kinds  of  insurance policies. This policy also includes the company's subsidiaries in certain cases.\n\nRegarding remuneration in kind, there is no plans to propose changes  in  the  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will  be submitted  for  approval  at  the  next  General  Shareholders' Meeting in 2021.",

EXECUTIVE PENSION PLAN\n\n## Maximum contribution:\n\n35% of the Fixed Remuneration.\n\nContributions to the Pension Plan for Telef\u00f3nica's employees are  deducted  from  these  payments,  which  are  calculated according to the aforementioned percentage.\n\nPayment of any compensation related to the termination of the labour relationship is incompatible with recognition of any economic right related to this Executive Pension Plan.\n\n## Functioning:\n\nThe implementation vehicle of this Plan approved in 2006 is a unit-link  group  life  insurance  policy  taken  out  with  an insurance company.\n\nThe contingencies covered by the Executive Pension Plan are retirement,  early  retirement,  permanent  loss  of  working capacity  consisting  of  total  or  absolute  disability  or  serious disability  and  death.  However,  as  explained  above,  no economic  right  whatsoever  is  recognised  if  the  Executive Director receives compensation due to the termination of his/ her labour relationship.\n\nThe amount of the benefits from this coverage is equivalent to  the  mathematical  provision  corresponding  to  the  insured party on the date when the policyholder provides notice and proves to the insurance company that the relevant situation has arisen.\n\nThere is currently no vesting of economic rights in favour of the Executive Directors. The Board of Directors may make the appropriate adjustments in the case of legislative amendments on this matter, according to a proposal made by the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee.\n\nAny adjustments to be made to the Executive Pension Plan must  be  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  These adjustments  must  be  justified  and  proposed  by  the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.  The  reasons  for  the  adjustments  must  be  duly explained  in  the  Annual  Report  on  Remuneration  of  the Directors.\n\nEven though there are no changes planned for the functioning of  this  Plan,  it  may  be  updated  by  the  Board  of  Directors according to a proposal made  by  the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  to adapt it to amendments made to applicable legislation.\n\nRegarding  the  Executive  Pension  Plan,  no  changes  are planned  in  the  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will  be submitted  for  approval  at  the  next  General  Shareholders' Meeting in 2021.\n\n## Malus and claw-back clauses for the variable remuneration\n\nRegarding clawback formulae or clauses in order to claim the return of the variable remuneration components based on the results,  the  following  should  be  taken  into  account  if  such components have been paid based on data that is later clearly shown to  be  inaccurate,  and  in  order  to  adopt  measures  to avoid any conflict of interest the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 It  is  authorised  to  propose cancellation of payment of the variable  remuneration  to  the  Board  of  Directors  under circumstances of this kind.\n- \u00b7 It  will  assess  whether  exceptional  circumstances  of  this kind could even lead to termination of the relationship with the respective party or parties responsible, proposing to the Board of Directors that such measures should be adopted as may be appropriate.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2018,  the  Company  included  malus  and clawback clauses in the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023, approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held in 2018. According to these clauses, in the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, each time shares are delivered, it will be assessed whether or not  to  partially  or  fully  confirm  or  cancel  the  relevant settlement  in  each  financial  year  and,  if  need  be,  to  claim partial  or  full  return  of  the  shares  already  provided  (or reimbursement of their value in cash) if the number of shares delivered  was  not  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and conditions stipulated by the Board of Directors or when they had been provided bearing in mind data that have later been proven to be inaccurate.\n\nMoreover, in 2024, when drawing up the annual accounts for the previous financial year, it will be assessed whether or not the  return  of  the  shares  previously  provided  should  be partially  or  fully  claimed  (or  reimbursement  of  their  value  in cash) if the aforementioned situations have arisen. Moreover, the  Company  may  partially  or  fully  cancel  payment  of  the Plan  to  the  Executive  Directors  if  the  Company's  external auditor  includes  exceptions  in  its  report  that  reduce  the results taken into consideration to determine the number of shares to be provided.\n\nThe  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will  be  submitted  for approval  at  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  in  2021  will determine that the Board of Directors will decide, with a prior report issued by the Nominating, Compensation  and Corporate  Governance  Committee,  if  necessary,  on  the following:  (i)  partial  or  full  cancellation  of  the  variable remuneration  pending payment (malus) and/or (ii) partial or full recovery of any variable remuneration component within twenty-four  (24)  months  after  its  payment  (clawback),  if certain exceptional situations arise that affect the Company's results or are related to the Executive Director's inappropriate conduct.",

This clause  implies  that,  once  the  relevant  contract  has  been terminated and during the valid term of the clause (two years after  the  termination  of  the  contract  for  any  reason),  the Executive Directors may not indirectly or directly render their services  themselves  or  through  others,  either  on  their  own behalf  or  for  third  parties,  to  Spanish  or  foreign  companies that  engage  in  the  same  or  similar  business  activities  as Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nRegarding  the  conditions  related  to  the  termination  of  the contracts,  the  Executive  Chairman,  Mr.  Jos\u00e9  Mar\u00eda  \u00c1lvarezPallete L\u00f3pez, and the Chief Operating Officer, Mr. \u00c1ngel Vil\u00e1 Boix, have the same terms and conditions as in their previous contracts, which specify agreed severance pay for termination  of  the  relationship,  when  appropriate,  which could  amount  to  a  maximum  of  four  (4)  annual  payments. Each annual payment consists of the last fixed remuneration and  the  arithmetic  mean  of  the  sum  of  the  last  two  (2) amounts  of  annual  variable  remuneration  paid  pursuant  to the contracts.\n\n## Contractual terms and conditions for the Executive Directors\n\nThe contracts that currently regulate the Executive Directors performing their duties and responsibilities are of a commercial nature and include clauses that are normally used for  these  kinds  of  contracts.  These  contracts  have  been proposed  by  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee, approved by the Board of Directors and have not suffered any significant modifications in 2020.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  severance  pay  terms  and  conditions explained in the previous point, a summary is provided below of the main terms and conditions of the Executive Directors' contracts:\n\n- \u00b7 Term: Indefinite.\n- \u00b7 Prior notice: There is an obligation to provide prior notice in the  event  of  the  contract  being  terminated  due  to  a unilateral decision adopted by the Chief Operating Officer, being  stipulated  that  he  must  notify  such  unilateral decision in writing with at least three months' prior notice, except  in  cases  of  force  majeure.  If  this  obligation  is  not fulfilled,  he  must  pay  the  Company an amount equivalent to the Fixed Remuneration for the period of prior notice he had failed to observe.\n- \u00b7 Exclusivity: During the term of the contracts, it is prohibited to  sign  (either  directly  or  through  intermediaries)  any employment,  commercial  or  civil  contracts  with  other companies or institutions that engage in activities similar in nature to those of Telef\u00f3nica.\n- \u00b7 Non-competition clause: The contract states the relationship  is  compatible  with  holding  representative, administrative and management posts and other professional positions in other companies in the Telef\u00f3nica Group  or  in  any  other  undertakings  unrelated  to  the Company  when  expressly  notified  to  the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate  Governance  Committee  and the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  addition,  it  states  that  the  relationship  is  incompatible, during  the  term  of  the  clause  (two  (2)  years  after  the termination of the contract for any reason) with directly or indirectly  rendering  services,  as  an  employee  or  selfemployed, by themselves or through third parties,  to  any Spanish  or  foreign  companies  that  engage  in  activities identical or similar to those of Telef\u00f3nica.\n\n- \u00b7 Non-disclosure: While the relationship remains in force and also after the termination thereof, there is a non-disclosure duty  regarding  any  information,  data  and  any  kinds  of reserved  and  confidential  documents  that  they  have knowledge of or to which they have had access as a result of performing their duties.\n- \u00b7 Compliance  with  the  regulatory  system:  The  contracts include the obligation to abide by the rules and obligations set  out  within  Telef\u00f3nica's  regulatory  system,  which  are contained,  among  other  regulations,  in  the  Board  of Directors'  Regulations  and  Telef\u00f3nica's  Internal  Stock Market Conduct Regulations.\n\n## Commitment to hold shares on a permanent basis\n\nAs  stipulated  in  section  4.2  of  the  current  Directors' Remuneration  Policy,  the  Executive  Directors  must  hold (directly  or  indirectly)  a  number  of  shares  (including  those provided as remuneration) equivalent to two (2) years' gross Fixed  Remuneration  as  long  as  they  are  members  on  the Board of Directors and perform executive duties.",

In  any  case,  the  price  at  which  the  Executive  Directors acquired their shares represents an amount that far exceeds twice their Fixed Remuneration.\n\n## 4.6.7. The Directors' remuneration in their positions as such in 2021\n\nThe remuneration payable to the Directors in their positions as  such  is  structured,  within  the  legal  and  statutory framework,  pursuant  to  the  remunerative  criteria  and  items\n\nspecified below, up to the maximum limit determined for such purpose  by  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  pursuant  to the provisions in Article 35 of the Articles of Association.\n\nAccording to the foregoing, the Ordinary General Shareholders'  Meeting  held  on  11  April  2003  set  the  annual gross maximum amount for the remuneration at \u20ac6,000,000 payable to the Directors in their positions as members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  aforementioned  remuneration  is,  in  all  cases,  the maximum  amount  payable  and  the  Board  of  Directors  is responsible for proposing the allotment of the amount among the  various  items  and  among  the  different  Directors,  taking into account the duties and responsibilities assigned to each Director,  membership  on  Committees  within  the  Board  of Directors  and  other  objective  circumstances  that  would  be considered relevant.\n\nRegarding  the  financial  year  2020,  according  to  the  market information  available,  the  Committee  has  proposed  to  the Board not to increase the Directors' fixed remuneration, both in  their  positions  as  such  and  for  performing  their  executive duties. This remuneration has remained the same since 2012.\n\n| Board of  Directors   |         | Executive  Committee   | Advisory or  Supervisory  Committee  (*)   |\n|-----------------------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac240,000              | \u20ac80,000 | \u20ac22,400                | Chairman (**)                              |\n| \u20ac200,000              | \u20ac80,000 | -                      | Vice Chairman                              |\n| \u20ac120,000              | \u20ac80,000 | \u20ac11,200                | Proprietary Member                         |\n| \u20ac120,000              | \u20ac80,000 | \u20ac11,200                | Independent Member                         |\n| \u20ac120,000              | \u20ac80,000 | \u20ac11,200                | Other External  Member                     |\n\n(*) In addition, the amount of the attendance fee for each of the meetings of the Advisory or Supervisory Committees is \u20ac1,000\n\n(**)  In this regard, the  Executive  Chairman has waived  payment  of  the aforementioned  amounts (i.e. \u20ac240,000  as Chairman of  the  Board  of Directors and \u20ac80,000 as Chairman of the Executive Committee), as he has done in previous years\n\nThe Executive Directors can waive payment  of  the aforementioned amounts.\n\nMoreover, the Non-Executive Directors receive the remuneration  payable  to  them  due  to  being  members  of certain  management  bodies  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  subsidiaries  and investee companies.\n\nNo changes are included in the new Remuneration Policy that will  be  submitted  for  approval  at  the  company's  General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021 that will remain in force until 31 December 2023.",

Application of the Remuneration Policy in 2020\n\n## Summary of the Remuneration Policy applied in 2019 and the results of the ballot on the Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors for 2020\n\nThe remuneration payable in the financial year  2020  was  in line with the terms of the Remuneration Policy approved on a binding basis at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 8 June  2018,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  in  the  Article  529 Nineteen of the Spanish Capital Companies Act.\n\nFor further information, please see the Remuneration Policy in force in 2020 by accessing the following link:\n\n## www.telefonica.com/documents/162467/142439452/ politica-remuneraciones-consejeros.pdf/9f28515d-a87bce1d-9c66-eb19f508d584\n\nIn  this  respect,  the  remuneration  payable  in  2020  to  the Executive  Directors  and  the  Directors  in  their  positions  as such consists of the same components as those described for the current Remuneration Policy in force in 2021.\n\nThe  detailed  description  of  the  Directors'  remunerative system  for  2020  is  included  in  section  4.6.6  of  the  Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors for 2019. This report was  approved  by  89.3%  of  the  votes  cast,  with  a  9.2%  of votes against and a 1.5% abstentions. Therefore, taking into account  the  high  level  of  approval  of  this  Report,  the Company has considered it appropriate to draw up the 2020 Annual  Report  on  Remuneration  of  the  Directors  in  similar terms, modifying the text of some items in order to contribute to increasing the transparency level.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on application of the Remuneration Policy in 2020\n\nIn  relation  to  the  Executive  Directors,  the  remuneration accrued  in  2020  represents  approximately  51%  of  the maximum  total  remuneration  (57%  of  the  total  target remuneration).  Specifically,  as  a  gesture  of  responsibility towards  society,  customers,  shareholders,  and Telef\u00f3nica employees after the economic effects derived from COVID-19, the  remuneration  measures  adopted  by  Telef\u00f3nica  with respect  to  its  Executive  Directors  and  the  rest  of  senior management members have been the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed Remuneration Freeze: In  the case of the Executive Chairman, his 2020 Fixed Remuneration remained unchanged  (1,923,100  euros),  being  the  same  as  the received since 2016, which was set in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn  relation  to  the  current  Chief  Executive  Officer,  his  Fixed Remuneration  (1,600,000  euros)  is  the  same  to  that established at the time that Mr. Vil\u00e1 was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on July 26, 2017.\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain the Short-Term Variable Remuneration conditions established at the beginning of the year: The relative  metrics  and  weights  determined  for  2020  were OIBDA  (30%),  Operative  Income  (30%),  Free  Cash  Flow\n\n(20%) and non-financial  targets  related  to  customer  trust and other ESG targets (20%).\n\nIn  spite  of  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  economic forecasts  that  was  particularly  evident  in  the  second quarter,  the  Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee decided to maintain the level of the target objectives associated with each metric.\n\nBearing  in  mind  the  foregoing,  the  weighted  payment coefficient  amounted  to  89.9%  (see  the  achievement percentages in the table included in the section corresponding to the Short-Term Variable Remuneration in 2020).\n\n## \u00b7 Long-Term Variable Remuneration:\n\nIn  relation  with  the  vesting  of  the  first  cycle  of  the LongTerm Incentive Plan 2018-2023, the target measurement period ended on 31 December 2020. In light of the Relative TSR  and  Free  Cash  Flow  outcomes,  the  weighted  payout coefficient would be 50%. However, at the meeting held by the  Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee  on  23  February  2021,  the  Executive  Chairman propose to waive his incentive , which he deems appropriate,  as  a  gesture  of  responsibility  towards  the society, customers, shareholders and employees of Telef\u00f3nica and as a prudential measure due to the economic impact  derived  by  COVID-19.  The  Chief  Operating  Officer stated the same position.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee's proposal, accepted their waiver.\n\n## In relation with the grant of the third cycle (2020-2023) of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023 ,\n\nThe  difficult  context  arising  due  to  COVID-19,  both  the Executive Directors and the Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica deemed that adjustments were necessary for the award of the third cycle (2020-2023) of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023.\n\nIn this respect, it was proposed that the award of the third cycle of the long-term incentive of the Executive Directors approved  by  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  in  2018 would  be  limited  to  50%  of  the  economic  value  of  the shares provided in previous cycles, representing 37% of the maximum  value  set  for  the  Executive  Chairman  in  the Remuneration Policy in force in 2020 (33% in the case of the Chief Operating Officer).\n\nFinally,  it  should  be  highlighted  that  the  Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee decided to maintain the targets, weightings and metrics determined in  the  cycles  in  force  of  the  Long-Term Incentive Plan .\n\n- \u00b7 Waiver of remuneration in their capacity as members of the Board of Directors. The Executive Chairman waived to the  settle  of  240,000  euros  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  80,000  euros  as  Executive  Committee Chairman.",

In  the  case  of  legislative  amendments  on  this matter,  according  to  a  proposal  made  by  the  Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  the Board of Directors could make the appropriate adjustments.\n\nIn  addition,  if  any  severance  pay  is  received  due  to  the termination  of  the  employment  relationship,  this  will  be incompatible  with  the  being  granted  any  economic  right whatsoever linked to this Plan.\n\nThe  contributions  in  2020  to  the  benefits  plan  were  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Executive Chairman: \u20ac540,968.\n- \u00b7 The Chief Operating Officer: \u20ac487,840.\n\nThe expected rights on 31 December 2020 were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez: \u20ac9,389,409.\n- \u00b7 Mr. \u00c1ngel Vil\u00e1 Boix: \u20ac7,169,750.\n\n## Further information:\n\n- \u00b7 Malus  and  clawback  clauses:  These  clauses  were  not applicable in the financial year 2020.\n- \u00b7 During the financial year 2020, the Executive Directors did not receive nor accrue any payment for early termination or termination  of  their  contracts,  or  advances,  loans  or guarantees,  remuneration  from  other  companies  in  the Group or payments made by Telef\u00f3nica to a third party to which  the  Directors  provide  services,  or  any  other remuneration item apart from the ones already mentioned.\n- \u00b7 The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Executive  Directors' contracts  in  2020  were  the  same  as  those  described  in section 4.6.6 of this report.\n\n## Remuneration of the directors in their positions as such\n\nThe remuneration payable to the Directors in their positions as such is according to the same scheme as the one described in section 4.6.7 of this report and the one applied in previous financial years.\n\nIn this respect, as explained in the previous section 4.6.8, the Executive  Chairman  waived  payment  of  \u20ac240,000,  as Chairman of the Board of Directors, and \u20ac80,000 as Chairman of the Executive Committee.\n\nNon-Executive  Directors  also  receive  the  remuneration  to which they are entitled for belonging to certain Management Decision-Making Bodies of some Subsidiaries and affiliates of Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nAccording  to  the  foregoing,  the  aggregate  remuneration  for the items in 2020 was as follows:\n\n|                                                                             | 2020       | 2019       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Fixed amount due to being a  member on the Board,  Executive Commission and | \u20ac2,754,534 | \u20ac2,662,401 |\n| Fees for attending the meetings  of the Advisory or Supervisory  Committees | \u20ac248,000   | \u20ac212,000   |\n| Remuneration for being a  member on certain  Management Decision-Making     | \u20ac547,645   | \u20ac566,714   |\n\nDuring the financial year 2020, the Directors in their positions as  such  did  not  accrue  payments  for  early  termination  or termination  of  their  contracts,  or  advances,  loans  or guarantees, or payments made by Telef\u00f3nica to a third party to  which  the  Directors  provide  services,  or  any  other remuneration item apart from the ones already mentioned.\n\nThe  individual  amounts  per  director  are  provided  in  the statistical annex attached to this Report.\n\n## 4.6.9. Alignment of themuneration system with the risk profile\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's  Remuneration  Policy  has  the  following  features that enable its exposure to excessive risks to be reduced and adjustment to the Company's long-term targets, values and interests:\n\n## Adopting measures related to the staff categories whose professional work has a significant impact on the Company's risk profile\n\n- \u00b7 The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee  supervises  the  examination,  analysis  and application of the remuneration policy of the professionals whose  work  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  the Company's risk profile.\n- \u00b7 There is no guaranteed variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 The  variable  remuneration  is  only  payable  after  the  date the relevant annual accounts have been drawn up, once the achievement level of the operating and financial targets can be determined.\n- \u00b7 As part of the process to evaluate the variable remuneration, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee considers the quality of the long-term results and any other related risk.\n- \u00b7 The design of the Long-Term Incentive Plans, each one with three-year cycles, means that the results of each year are interrelated.  It  therefore  acts  as  a  catalyst  for  alignment with  the  Company's  long-term  interests  and  cautious decision-making.",

In  addition,  the company has included some malus and clawback clauses in the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023, approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held in 2018. In this regard, the  detailed  information  can  be  found  in  section  4.6.6  of this Report.\n\nThe  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will  be  submitted  for approval at the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2021 will propose  standardising  the  malus  and  clawback  clauses  so that  they  are  applicable  to  any  variable  remuneration component. In this respect, the possibility will be included to (i) partially  or  fully  cancel  the  variable  remuneration pending  payment  (malus)  and/or  (ii)  partially  or  fully recover  any  variable  remuneration  component  within twenty-four (24) months after payment thereof (clawback), when  certain  exceptional  situations  arise  that  affect  the company's results or are related to the Executive Director's inappropriate conduct.\n\n- \u00b7 The  Company's  Audit  and  Supervisory  Committee  takes part  in  the  decision-making  process  related  to  the  shortterm variable remuneration (bonus) of Executive Directors by  verifying  the  economic-financial  and  non-financial information  that  may  be  part  of  the  targets  set  for  the purpose of such remuneration, as this Committee must first verify the Company's results as the basis for calculating the relevant targets.\n- \u00b7 The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee  is  composed  of  5  members,  two  of  them  are also  members  on  the  Audit  and  Supervisory  Committee. The  fact  that  these  Directors  are  members  of  these  two Committees ensures that the risks related to remuneration are  taken  into  account  in  the  discussions  held  by  both Committees and in their proposals submitted to the Board, both in  the  determination  and  assessment  process  of  the annual and multiannual incentives.\n- \u00b7 According  to  the  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will  be proposed, the Board of Directors, based on a proposal made by the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance  Committee,  is  authorised  to  agree  on  the possible  revaluation  or  modification  of  the  remuneration linked  to  the  results  if  there  are  significant  internal  or external changes that mean they need to be reviewed.\n- \u00b7 Regarding  the  measures  required  to  avoid  conflicts  of interest by the directors, according to the provisions in the Spanish Capital Companies  Act,  the  Regulations  of Telef\u00f3nica's  Board  of  Directors  includes  a  series  of obligations  related  to  its  duties  of  loyalty  and  to  avoid situations of conflict of interest. Moreover, the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee's Regulations  determine  that  one  of  its  duties  is  to  ensure that  possible  conflicts  of  interest  do  not  harm  the independence  of  the  external  advice  provided  to  the Committee.\n\n## Consistency with the Company's strategy and focus on achieving results in the long-term\n\n- \u00b7 The design of the remunerative policy, consistent with the Company's  strategy  and  aimed  at  obtaining  long-term results, is as follows:\n- a. The total remuneration for the Executive Directors and Senior  Executives  consists  of  various  remunerative components,  mainly  composed  of  the  following:  (i) fixed remuneration, (ii) short-term variable remuneration and (iii) long-term variable remuneration. In  the  case  of  the  Executive  Directors, under  normal  conditions,  this  long-term  component has  a  weight  of  no  less  than  30%  of  their  total remuneration in a scenario of standard achievement of targets  (fixed  +  short-term  variable  +  long-term variable).\n\nIn 2020, the weight was lower because, as a gesture of responsibility  towards  the  society,  customers  and employees of Telef\u00f3nica due to the economic impact caused  by  COVID-19,  it  was  decided  that  the assignment value in the third cycle of the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2023 would be 50% lower than in previous  cycles.  This  implied  a  reduction  in  the  total remuneration (considered, for these purposes, as Fixed Remuneration,  Short-Term  Variable  Remuneration and annualised Long-Term Incentive) of approximately 20% for the Executive Directors.\n\n- b. Llong-term  variable  remuneration  plans  are  part  of  a multi-annual  framework  in  order  to  ensure  that  the assessment process is based on long-term profits and that  the  company's  underlying  economic  cycle  is taken into account. This remuneration is allocated and paid  in  the  form  of  shares  based  on  the  creation  of value, so that the Executives' interests are in line with those  of  the  shareholders.  In  addition,  they  are overlapping  cycles  that  generally  follow  one  another indefinitely over time, with a permanent focus on the long-term in all decision-making.\n- c. Pursuant  to  the  new  Remuneration  Policy,  once  the shares  of  the  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  2021-2026 have  been  assigned,  100%  of  the  shares  provided, within the scope of the Plan, to the Executive Directors and  other  members  determined  by  the  Board  of Directors  will  be  subject  to  a  retention  period  of  two years.  In  addition,  if  an  Executive  Director  does  not fulfil the commitment to permanently hold the shares, the  retention  period  of  the  shares  that,  if  any,  they receive due to any variable remuneration component will be increased up to 3 years.\n- \u00b7 A suitable balance  between  the  fixed  and  variable components of the remuneration: Executive Directors have a variable remuneration scheme that is fully flexible, which includes a minimum threshold below which no incentive is payable. The short-term and long-term variable remuneration  percentage  can  be  relevant  in  the  event  of maximum  achievement  of  the  targets.  In  any  case,  such percentage  with  respect  to  the  total remuneration",

This  Area  also  publishes updated Information Bulletins on IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) where to present a summary of  the  main  changes  in  accounting  matters,  as  well  as clarifications  on  various  aspects  that  may  arise  in  this matter.\n\nThe Telef\u00f3nica Group has also a training platform included in the corporate People management tool, which includes both a  Finance  School,  with  specific  knowledge  and  updating programs  in  financial  information  matters  and  an  internal control  training  program  that  includes  training  related  to auditing, internal control and risk management.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that based on the relevance of any  new  accounting  developments,  the  staff  of  the departments  involved  in  financial  reporting  attend  (when possible  and/or  necessary)  technical  sessions  given  by external  companies,  related  to  the  main  developments  in accounting.\n\nFinally,  in  2007,  the  Corporate  University  of  Telef\u00f3nica 'Universitas Telef\u00f3nica' started its activity, with the objective of contributing to the Telef\u00f3nica Group's progress through the ongoing development of its professionals. All the programs in the training offer of the University of Telef\u00f3nica are based on the development of the corporate culture, the business strategy and management and leadership competences.\n\n## 4.8.2. Risk Assessment of Financial Information\n\n## Main characteristics of the risk identification process.\n\nGiven the width of the universe of processes with impact on financial reporting at the Telef\u00f3nica Group, a model has been developed to select the most significant processes based on applying the so-called Scope Definition Model, which is a part of  the  Audit  Methodology  on  the  Internal  Control  over Financial  Information.  This  model  is  applied  to  the  financial information reported by subsidiaries and associate companies. The model selects the significant accounts, i.e., those accounts with the largest contribution to the Group's consolidated financial information and, subsequently, identifies the relevant processes  which  generate  the information of those accounts. Once the relevant processes have been identified, an analysis is made on those processes that  have  a  more  relevant  impact  on  significant  accounts,\n\nreviewing  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operating  of the key controls which address the main associated risks or 'objectives  of  financial  information'  (also  named  financial premises).\n\nThe aforementioned procedure for identifying and reviewing the  key  controls  covers  the  objectives  of  the  financial information  (also  named  financial  premises)  of  accuracy, valuation,  integrity,  cut-off  of  operations,  existence  / occurrence,  presentation  and  comparability,  as  well  as breakdown, and rights and obligations. This identification of the  key  controls,  aimed  at  addressing  the  aforementioned financial  premises  of  the  significant  accounts  and  relevant processes in  scope,  is  carried  out  annually,  verifying  during the period that no event has taken place so as to determine a modification thereof.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  process  for  identifying  the  company perimeter,  the  Finance  and  Control  Office  carries  out,  in  a periodic  manner,  an  update  on  its  consolidation  perimeter, verifying additions and removals of companies with the legal and financial departments of the different companies which are part of the Group, including the corporate departments.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica  constantly  monitors  the  most  significant  risks that  could  affect  the  main  companies  that  make  up  its Group. For that purpose  the  Company  has  a  Risk Management Corporate Model based on COSO (Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). It  is  implemented  in  a  homogeneous  manner  in  the  main operations of the Group, so that the persons responsible for the  Company,  in  their  field  of  action,  carry  out  a  timely identification,  assessment,  response  and  monitoring  of  the main risks.  Telef\u00f3nica's  risk  management  is  integrated  into the  planning  process  and  is  aligned  with  the  Company's strategy, in line  with  the  requirements of COSO ERM 2017, 'Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance'.\n\nThe process for the control and management of risks takes as  a  reference  starting  point  the  strategy  and  objectives  of the  Company,  as  a  basis  for  the  identification  of  the  main risks  that  might  affect  its  attainment.  Once  identified,  the risks  are  assessed  in  a  qualitative  and/or  quantitative manner  with  a  view  to  prioritising  their  monitoring  and response to them, either through mitigation plans or through actions to avoid or transfer those risks.\n\nIn order to have an integral model, oriented to the needs and the own configuration of the Group, the Model of Telef\u00f3nica considers  a  risk  assessment  with  four  complementary perspectives:  Top-down,  Bottom-up  and  cross  (in  projects and by processes).\n\nAccording  to  this  Model,  and  based  on  the  references  and practices recognised in risk management, four risk categories have been defined:\n\n- \u00b7 Business: risks related to the sector and especially to the Company's strategy, such as adaptation to the customer's mentality,  technological  innovation,  competition,  the regulatory  framework,  privacy,  as  well  as  those  arising from events affecting the sustainability and reputation of the Company.",

In these cases, the Consolidation and Accounting Polices Office establishes, likewise, the necessary operational coordination actions with the rest of the units in the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  in  their  specific  fields  of  action  and knowledge, prior to presenting them to the Audit and Control Committee.  The  most  relevant  ones  are  dealt  with  by  the Audit  and  Control  Committee  and  Senior  Management defines the presentation format in the annual accounts, prior to approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nFinally,  Internal  Audit,  within  its  annual  audit  plan,  among other actions, establishes annually work plans to assess the model  for  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  of  the Telef\u00f3nica Group, in line with the above stated. That is, the Internal  Audit  plans  include  the  review  on  the  design  and operability of the controls on the breakdown and reporting of financial  information,  as  well  as  the  assessment  of  the internal  control  system  of  the  mentioned  process  for  the preparation  of  financial  information,  and  the  review  of  any significant  modification,  during  the  annual  assessment period,  that  could  materially  affect  the  Group's  internal control  system  on  the  process  for  the  preparation  of  the consolidated annual accounts.\n\n## Internal control policies and procedures on information systems\n\nThe Global  Security  Policy  considers  an  integral  concept  of the physical and operational security of human resources the information, technologies, cybersecurity, and material resources that support them as fundamental assets, with the purpose  of  guaranteeing  corporate  protection  against potential  damage  or  eventual  losses.

For  operators  in  Latin  America,  these same functions are assumed and carried out by the Network and Information Systems Department of this segment.\n\nThe security activities developed by organisational structures, responsible for assets and employees for the four technological  platforms  defined  above  will  be  governed  by the principles of legality, efficiency, co-responsibility, cooperation,  and  coordination.  The  adequate  mechanisms must be established  to  foster  them,  conduct  them,  control them and improve them.\n\n- \u00b7 Principle  of  Legality :  ensure  the  necessary  compliance with all  laws  and  regulations  in  matters  of  Security,  both national and international, valid at any given time in any of the territories where the Telef\u00f3nica Group operates.\n- \u00b7 Principle of Efficiency : in order to reach the required level of  Security  in  an  efficient  manner,  the  anticipatory  and preventive  nature  of  actions  must  be  ensured.  For  this purpose, knowledge of potential threats must be privileged and  potential  risks  must  be  analysed,  as  part  of  an intelligence process where to identify and understand the most  relevant  threats  that  affect  the  organisation.  The\n\nobjective is to get ahead of their action and evolution, and to  safeguard  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  global  organisation from  their  potential  harmful  effects  and  mitigate  the damages from those risks down to an acceptable level for the business.\n\nWith the aim of reaching a homogeneous level of security, a Global Security Regulations Framework is defined, which will take into account the analyses of risks and threats as well  as  the  setting  of  precise  protective  or  corrective prevention measures.\n\nLikewise, strategic plans will be conceived and prepared so that they enable to identify and prioritise the projects and budgets  necessary  for  reaching  the  adequate  levels  of Security  and  Auditability,  minimising  the  security  risks identified  in  the  corresponding  analyses,  and  maximising the  effectiveness  of  the  investment  and  the  resources used.\n\n- \u00b7 Principle  of  Co-responsibility :  users  must  preserve  the Security of the assets that Telef\u00f3nica makes available to them,  in  line  with  the  security  criteria,  requirements, procedures,  and  technologies  defined  in  the  Security Regulations  Framework,  as  well  as  in  line  with  the applicable laws and regulations in this matter. At the same time,  users  must  exclusively  use  the  assets  for  the performance  of  activities that correspond  to  their workstation and assigned tasks.\n- \u00b7 Principle  of  Cooperation  and  Coordination :  in  order  to reach  the  levels  of  efficiency  required  by  Telef\u00f3nica business project, the global action and integral concept of Security  activities  must  be  preserved  and,  together  with the  aforementioned  requirements  of  anticipation  and prevention,  cooperation  and  coordination  between  all business units and employees must be prioritised, in order to generate the adequate synergies and to jointly reinforce the capabilities.\n\nThe  Security  Organisation  coordinates  the  Security responsibilities of the various Telef\u00f3nica Group structures, promoting  cooperation  among  them  to  guarantee  the efficient and joint protection of the assets.\n\nFinally, the Internal Audit unit, with the scope established in its  Annual  Audit  Plan,  sets  out  work  plans  to  verify  the efficacy  and  efficiency  of  the  information  technology  (\"IT\") governance  model,  the  Information  Security  policies,  the suitability  of  controls  and  their  effective  operation  and  the integrity of information.\n\nInternal control policies and procedures aimed at supervising the managing of activities outsourced to third parties, as well as those aspects of assessment, calculation or valuation commended to independent experts that may affect in a material manner the financial statements.\n\nIn the case that a process or part of a process is outsourced to  a  third  party  unrelated  to  the  company,  this  does  not",

Given  the  importance  of  service  outsourcing  and  the consequences that this can cause on the opinion about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, the  necessary  actions  are  taken  in  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  in order to achieve to evidence an adequate control level. The actions  that  are  carried  out  to  achieve  the  mentioned objective may vary among the three following ones:\n\n- \u00b7 Certification  of  internal  control  by  an  independent third  party :  ISAE  3402  and/or  SSAE  18  certifications  in their different typologies.\n- \u00b7 Establishing specific controls : identified, designed, implemented  and  assessed  by  the  Company  and/or  the Telef\u00f3nica Group.\n- \u00b7 Direct  assessment :  an  assessment,  carried  out  by  the Internal  Audit  area,  on  certain  administrative  outsourced processes,  with  the  scope  established  in  its  annual  audit plan.\n\nWhen  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  uses  the services  of  an  independent  expert  whose  result  and conclusions may present potential impacts on the consolidated  financial  information,  with  regard  to  the process  to  select  a  supplier,  the  area  that  requests  the service  and,  if  applicable,  together  with  the  Purchase department,  must  make  sure  about  the  competence, training,  credentials  and  independence  of  the  third  party regarding  the  methods  and  main  hypotheses  used.  The Finance and Control Office has established control activities aimed  at  guaranteeing  the  validity  of  data,  the  methods used,  and  the  reasonability  of  the  hypotheses  used  by  the third  party  through  the  recurrent  monitoring  on  the  own KPIs1 of each duty which enable to ensure compliance of the outsourced process according to the policies and guidelines issued by the Group.\n\nLikewise,  there  is  an  internal  procedure  for  engaging independent  experts  which  requires  certain  levels  of approval.\n\n## 4.8.4. Information and Communication\n\n## A specific duty in charge of accounting policies\n\nThe Consolidation and Accounting Polices Office of the Group is in charge of defining and updating the accounting policies for the purposes of consolidated financial information.\n\nThus, this area issues updated Information Bulletins on IFRS (International  Financial  Reporting  Standards),  where  this area presents a summary of the main changes in accounting matters, as well as clarifications on various aspects that may arise regarding this matter. These Bulletins are monitored in a systematic way by the Accounting Policies Area.\n\nAdditionally, the Telef\u00f3nica Group  has  a  Manual  of\n\nAccounting  Policies  which  is  updated  annually,  the  last update took place in December 2020. The objectives of this Manual are: to adapt the corporate accounting principles and policies  to  the  IFRS regulatory  framework;  to  maintain accounting  principles  and  policies  which  enable  that  the information  is  comparable  within  the  Group  and  which facilitate  an  optimum  management  from  the  origin  of  the information;  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  accounting information  of  the  various  Group  companies  and  of  the Consolidated Group by disclosing, agreeing and implementing accounting principles which are unique to the Group;  and  to  facilitate  the  accounting  integration  of acquired  and  newly-created  companies  into  the  Group's accounting system by means of having a reference manual.\n\nAll  companies  belonging  to  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  must comply in a mandatory manner with the mentioned Manual when carrying out their reporting for the preparation of the consolidated financial information.\n\nThis documentation is available for the whole Group on the Telef\u00f3nica Intranet.\n\nLikewise,  the  Accounting  Policies  Area  maintains  a  fluid communication  with  the  accounting  heads  of  the  Group's main  operations,  both  proactively  and  reactively.  This communication  is  useful  not  only  for  resolving  doubts  or conflicts  but  also  to  ensure  that  accounting  criteria  in  the Group  are  homogeneous  as  well  as  to  share  best  practices among operators.\n\n## Mechanisms for obtaining and preparing the financial information\n\nAs  stated  above,  there  is  a  Manual  for  Filling  in  the Consolidation  Reporting  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  which provides specific instructions for preparing the details which make up the reporting pack, provided by all components of the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  for  the  preparation  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group's consolidated financial statements and the consolidated explanatory notes.\n\nLikewise,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  has  implemented  a  specific system, through a software, which supports the reporting of the individual financial statements of its various subsidiaries, as well as the necessary notes and disclosures for preparing the consolidated annual accounts. This tool is used, likewise, to  carry  out  the  consolidation  process  and  its  subsequent analysis. The  system  is  managed  centrally,  and  all components of the Telef\u00f3nica Group use the same account plan.\n\n## 4.8.5. Supervision of System Operation\n\n## The ICFR supervision activities and results in 2020\n\nAs mentioned above, the Corporate Bylaws and Regulations of the Board of Directors state that the primary duty of the Audit and Control Committee shall be to support the Board of Directors  in  its  supervisory  duties,  establishing  among  its competencies to supervise the effectiveness of the",

In that  Policy,  'internal  control'  is  defined  as  the  process performed by the Board of Directors, Management and the rest  of  the  staff  of  the  Company,  being  designed  with  the purpose of providing a reasonable assurance degree for the attainment of the objectives related to operations, information and compliance. With the purpose of helping to the  achievement  of  its  objectives,  the  Company  has  an internal control model defined in accordance with the criteria established  in  Internal  Control  Integrated  Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO').\n\nLikewise, there is an Internal Audit Organization Policy, which includes aspects regarding the organisation and functioning of this area. According to what is set in that Policy, Internal Audit  is  the  area  in  Telef\u00f3nica  in  charge  of  confirming,  by means of appropriate evidence, the adequate functioning of the internal control and risk management structures and, if applicable, detecting possible inefficiencies or noncompliance  with  the  control  system  that  the  Group establishes  in  its  processes.  In  this  manner,  Internal  Audit becomes an area independent from the Company management  which  supports  the  Audit  and  Control Committee in its competencies on assurance, risk management and the internal control system.\n\nThe Internal Audit function is developed in accordance with the  International  Standards  for  the  Professional  Practice  of Internal  Auditing  and,  in  this  regard,  it  has  been  awarded  a Quality Certificate from the International Institute of Internal Auditors.\n\nWith regard to supervision of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR), Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., as company listed on the New  York  Stock  Exchange,  is  subject  to  the  regulatory requirements established by the North American regulatory bodies that affect companies listed on that Stock Exchange. Among those requirements is the aforementioned SarbanesOxley Act, of 2002, and, specifically, Section 404 of that Act, which  stipulates  the  need  for  companies  listed  in  the  US market to assess on an annual basis the effectiveness of the procedures  and  structures  of  the  internal  control  over financial  reporting  (ICFR).  In  order  to  comply  with  this requirement, and as stated above, the Telef\u00f3nica Group has a  model  to  assess  the  system  for  the  internal  control  over financial reporting (ICFR), Internal Audit is the area in charge of  performing,  on  an  annual  basis,  the  assessment  on  its effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally,  and  in  accordance  with  what  is  established  by this  Act  and  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of\n\nSponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission ('COSO'), the External Auditor issues their own independent opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  for  the  internal control over financial reporting (ICFR).\n\n## Review on specific processes and controls\n\nWithout prejudice to filling in the self-assessment questionnaire,  in  certain  companies,  according  to  criteria regarding  the  relevance  of  their  contribution  to  the economic-financial  magnitudes  of  the  Group  and  other considered  risk  factors,  a  direct  review  is  made  on  their processes and key controls, applying the 'Telef\u00f3nica Group's ICFR-SOX  Methodology',  specifically  the  'Scope  Definition Model' (which forms part of that assessment methodology), which enables to identify the significant financial accounting accounts for the purposes of evaluating the Internal Control System  for  Financial  Information  (ICFR)  at  the  Telef\u00f3nica Group  level,  based  on  the  aforementioned  evaluation methodology, which is also in accordance with the guidelines established  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 'Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013' report.\n\nOnce the significant accounts are identified Having identified within  the  scope  of  the  evaluation  based  on  the  calculated consolidated  materiality,  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  ICFR-SOX Methodology is applied as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify economic-financial processes associated with the significant  accounts  so  that  a  reasonable  coverage  is achieved in the evaluation.\n- \u00b7 Also  identify  Information  Technology  (IT)  systems  and tools  and  technological  infrastructures  associated  with these scoped processes.\n- \u00b7 Identify  significant  risks  regarding  financial  reporting associated to those processes.\n- \u00b7 Carry out Walkthroughs of the economic-financial processes in the scope of the evaluation.\n- \u00b7 Asses,  by  applying  the  corresponding  evaluation  tests based  on  the  identified  risks,  the  effectiveness  of  the design  and  operability  of  the  control  activities  that  have previously been classified as key.\n- \u00b7 Where  appropriate,  significant  and  material  deficiencies are reported to the Audit and Control Committee and the implementation  of  corresponding  action  plans  which  are regularly monitored by the Audit and Control Committee.\n- \u00b7 In the event that control deficiencies and/or opportunities for improvement are identified during the Internal Control System  for  Financial  Information  (ICFR)  assessment procedures, they are reported to Management through the corresponding  conclusions  issued  by  Internal  Audit,  prior analysis of their impact, both at individual and aggregate level, on the evaluation of the Internal Control System for Financial  Information  (ICFR)  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group.

These questionnaires address  aspects  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting (ICFR) that are considered minimum requirements in order to achieve  a  reasonable  assurance  of  the  reliability  of  the financial  information  reported.  The  answers  are  audited  by the corresponding Internal Audit Units.\n\n## Action plans\n\nIn  the  event  that  control  deficiencies  and/or  opportunities for improvement are detected as a result of the assessment of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  Internal  Control  System  for Financial  Information  (SCIIF),  depending  on  the  scope established,  the  control  owners  communicate  their  action plans agreed for solving the identified control deficiencies, as well  as  the  deadlines  scheduled  for  their  implementation which  is  regularly  monitored  by  the  Audit  and  Control Committee.  These  action  plans  have  as  fundamental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To  remedy  the  control  deficiencies  identified  in  the  ICFR annual assessment, so that the control activities operate in an effective manner.\n- \u00b7 To prioritise the implementation of improvement opportunities in the efficiency of processes; improvement\n\nopportunities  are  defined  as  such,  since  they  do  not constitute internal control deficiencies.\n\nConclusion  of  the  assessment  of  the  Internal  Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) as of December 31, 2020\n\nInternal  Audit  has  carried  out  the  assessment  of  the effectiveness  of  the  Internal  Control  System  for  Financial Information (SCIIF) as of December 31, 2020. To perform this assessment, the guidelines established by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission (COSO) in its 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013' report,  were  considered.  Based  on  the  assessment  carried out,  it  was  concluded  that,  as  of  December  31,  2020,  the Telef\u00f3nica  Group's  Internal  Control  System  for  Financial Information  (ICFR)  was  effective  in  accordance  with  these guidelines.\n\n## Weakness detection and management procedure\n\nAs previously stated, the Internal Audit area is also in charge, among other functions, to provide support to the Audit and Control  Committee  in  the  supervision  of  the  functioning  of the  system  for  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting (ICFR).\n\nThe Internal Audit unit participates in the Audit and Control Committee  meetings  and  informs  regularly  about  the conclusions of the carried out works, and also informs about the  action  plans  designed  and  agreed  for  mitigation  and about the degree of implementation thereof. This includes to communicate  internal  control  significant  deficiencies  and material weaknesses which may have been identified in the process for ICFR assessment, as well as the follow-up on the implementation  of  action  plans  related  to  significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.\n\nOn the other hand, the External Auditor also participates in the Audit and Control Committee, at the request of the Audit and  Control  Committee,  in  order  to  explain  and  clarify aspects of their audit reports and the rest of work carried out by the External Auditor, which including work carried out to audit the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting.  The  External  Auditor  is  obliged  to  communicate the  internal  control  significant  deficiencies  or  material weaknesses identified in the development of their audit on the  system  for  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting (ICFR).  For  this  purpose,  the  External  Auditor  has  direct access at all times to Senior Management and the Chairman of  the  Audit  and  Control  Committee,  the  External  Auditor also reports independently to that Committee the results of both  the  preliminary  and  final  phase  of  their  audit  on  the system  for  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting (ICFR).\n\n## 4.8.6.

Under  no  circumstances  shall  such  a  requirement not  be  fulfilled,  on  the  grounds  of  the  importance  or  the confidential  nature  of  the  information,  apart  from  in absolutely exceptional cases.\n\nIn  this  regard,  and  in  accordance with Articles 18 and 20 of the Regulation of the Board of Directors, at the beginning of each year the Board of Directors and its Committees set the calendar of ordinary meetings to be held during the year. The calendar may be amended by resolution of the Board itself, or  by  decision  of  the  Chairman, in  which case the Directors shall  be  made  aware  of  the  amendment  as  soon  as practicable.  Likewise,  the  Regulations  of  the  Audit  and Control Committee and the Regulations of the Nominations, Compensation and Good Governance Committee detail the operating regime of these Committees.\n\nAlso,  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  the  Board  and  its Committees  shall  prepare  an  Action  Plan  detailing  the actions  to  be  carried  out  and  their  timing  for  each  year,  as per their assigned powers and duties.\n\nLikewise,  all  the  meetings  of  the  Board  and  the  Board Committees  have  a  pre-established  agenda,  which  is communicated  at  least  three  days  prior  to  the  date scheduled  for  the  meeting  together  with  the  call  for  the session.  The  Agenda  for  each  meeting  will  clearly  state points  on  which  the  Board  of  Directors,  or  the  Executive Committee, have to adopt a decision or resolution.\n\nFor the same purpose, in general, the Directors are sent the documentation  related  to  the  agenda  of  the  meetings sufficiently in advance. In accordance with Article 19 of the Regulations  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors  organizes  the  debates,  promoting  and encouraging  all  Directors  to  play  an  active  role  in  the deliberations,  safeguarding  their  right  to  freely  adopt  their own position on all matters. Moreover, with the assistance of the  Secretary,  he  shall  ensure  that  the  Directors  are  sent sufficient  information  to  discuss  the  points  set  out  in  the agenda  sufficiently  in  advance  of  the  meeting.  He  also ensures  that  sufficient  time  is  given  over  to  discussing strategic matters,  and  shall  encourage  debate  during meetings,  safeguarding  the  Directors'  right  to  adopt  their positions freely on all points discussed.\n\nTo provide all the information and clarifications necessary in relation  to  certain  points  deliberated,  the  Group's  senior executive officers attend nearly all the Board and Committee meetings to explain the matters within their powers.\n\nFurthermore,  and  as  a  general  rule,  the  Regulations  of  the Board  of  Directors  (Article  27)  expressly  establish  that Directors  are  granted  the  broadest  powers  to  obtain information about all aspects of the Company, to examine its books,  records,  documents  and  other  data  regarding corporate  transactions.  Exercising  of  this  right  to  receive information  shall  be  channeled  through  the  Chairman  or Secretary to the Board of Directors, who shall respond to the requests  made  by  the  Directors,  providing  them  with  the requested  information  directly  or  offering  them  the  proper contacts at the appropriate level of the organization.\n\nC.1.39 Identify individually for director, and generally in other cases, and provide detail of any agreements made between  the  company  and  its  directors,  executives  or employees  containing  indemnity  or  golden  parachute clauses  in  the  event  of  resignation  or  dismissal  or termination  of  employment  without  cause  following  a takeover bid or any other type of transaction.\n\nNumber of beneficiaries\n\nType of beneficiaries\n\nExecutive Directors, Senior Managers and other Employees\n\n27\n\nDescription of Agreement: With regards to the conditions applicable to termination  of  contracts,  the  Executive Chairman, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez, and the Chief Operating  Officer  (C.O.O.),  Mr.  \u00c1ngel  Vil\u00e1  Boix,  mantain  the conditions of his previous contract which provided for agreed economic compensation for the termination of the employment relationship, where applicable, that can amount",

Annual remuneration  on  which  the  indemnity  is  based  is  the  last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of the last two variable remuneration payments received by contract .\n\nRegarding the contracts of members of Senior Management, in general, they are contractually entitled the right to receive the  economic  compensation  indicated  below  in  the  event that  their  employment  relationship  is  ended  for  reasons attributable to the Company or, in some instances, is due to objective  reasons  such  as  a  change  of  control  in  the Company.  However,  if  the  employment  relationship  is terminated because of a breach attributable to the Executive, he/she will not be entitled to any compensation whatsoever. That notwithstanding, in certain cases the severance benefit to  be  received  by  the  member  of  Senior  Management according  to  their  contract  is  not  calculated  as  per  these general criteria,  but  rather  is  based  on  other  circumstances of a personal or professional nature or on the time when the contract was signed. The agreed economic compensation for the  termination  of  the  employment  relationship,  where applicable,  consists  of  a  maximum  of  three  times  annual remuneration plus another year based on length of service at the Company. Annual remuneration on which the indemnity is  based  is  the  last  fixed  remuneration  and  the  arithmetic mean  of  the  last  two  variable  remuneration  payments received by contract.\n\nMeanwhile,  contracts  that  tie  employees  to  the  Company under  a  common  employment  relationship  do  not  include indemnity clauses for the termination of their employment. In these cases, the employee is entitled to any indemnity set forth  in  prevailing  labor  legislation.  However,  contracts  of some  company  employees,  depending  on  their  level  and seniority, as well as their personal or professional circumstances or when they signed their contracts, establish their right to receive compensation in the same cases as in the preceding paragraph, generally consisting of a year and a half  salary.  The  annual  salary  on  which  the  indemnity  is based is the last fixed salary and the average amount of the last two variable payments received b contract.\n\nState  if  these  contracts  have  been  communicated  to and/or approved by management bodies of the company or  of  the  Group.

Extent of Compliance with Corporate Governance Recommendations\n\nSpecify the Company's  level  of  compliance  with recommendations  from  the  Unified  Code  of  Good Governance.\n\nIn  the  event  that  a  recommendation  is  not  followed  or only partially followed, a detailed explanation should be included  explaining  the  reasons  in  such  a  manner  that shareholders, investors and the market in general have enough  information  to  judge  the  company's  actions. General explanations are not acceptable.\n\n- 1 That the Articles of Association of listed companies do not limit the maximum number of votes that may be cast  by  one  shareholder  or  contain  other  restrictions that  hinder  the  takeover  of  control  of  the  company through the acquisition of shares on the market.\n\n## Explain\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  26  of  the  Corporate  Bylaws,  no shareholder  may  cast  a  number  of  votes  in  excess  of  10 percent  of  the  total  voting  capital  existing  at  any  time, regardless of the number of shares held by such shareholder and in full compliance with mandatory requirements of law. In  determining  the  maximum  number  of  votes  that  each shareholder  may  cast,  only  the  shares  held  by  each  such shareholder shall be computed. It does not include additional votes  cast  on  behalf  of  other  shareholders  who  may  have appointed  them  as  proxy,  who  are  themselves  likewise restricted by the 10 percent voting ceiling.\n\nThe limitation established in the preceding paragraphs shall also  apply  to  the  maximum  number  of  votes  that  may  be collectively  or  individually  cast  by  two  or  more  shareholder companies belonging to the same group of entities, as well as to  the  maximum  number  of  votes  that  may  be  cast  by  an individual or corporate shareholder and the entity or entities that  are  shareholders  themselves  and  which  are  directly  or indirectly controlled by such individual or corporate shareholder.\n\nIn addition, Article 30 of the Corporate Bylaws stipulates that no  person  may  be  appointed  as  Director  unless  they  have held, for more than three years prior to their appointment, a number  of  shares  of  the  Company  representing  a  nominal value  of  at  least  3,000  euros,  which  the  Director  may  not transfer while in office. These requirements shall not apply to those  persons  who,  at  the  time  of  their  appointment,  are related to the Company  under  an  employment  or professional  relationship,  or  when  the  Board  of  Directors resolves to waive such requirements with the favorable vote of at least 85 percent of its members.\n\nArticle 31 of the Corporate Bylaws establishes that, in order for  a  Director  to  be  appointed  Chairman,  Vice-Chairman, Chief Executive  Officer or member  of  the  Executive Commission, it shall be necessary for such Director to have served on the Board for at least the three years immediately\n\nprior  to  any  such  appointment.  However,  such  length  of service shall not be required if the appointment is made with the favorable vote of at least 85 percent of the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Corporate  Bylaws  (Article  26)  restrict  the  number  of shares  that  may  be  cast  by  a  single  shareholder  or  by shareholders belonging to the same group in order to achieve a  suitable  balance  and  protect  the  position  of  minority shareholders,  thus  avoiding  a  potential  concentration  of votes among a reduced number of shareholders, which could impact on the guiding principle that the General Shareholders'  Meeting  must  act  in  the  social  interest  and interest of all the shareholders. Telef\u00f3nica believes that this measure  does  not  constitute  a  blocking  mechanism  of takeover bids but rather a guarantee that the acquisition of control  required  the  sufficient  support  of  all  shareholders, because,  naturally,  and  as  taught  by  experience,  potential offerers may make their offer conditional upon the removal of the defense mechanism.\n\nIn relation to the above and in accordance with the provisions of Article 527 of the Spanish Corporations Act, any clauses in the  Bylaws  of  listed  corporations  that  directly  or  indirectly restrict  the  number  of  shares  that  may  be  cast  by  a  single shareholder by shareholders belonging to the same group or by any parties acting together with the aforementioned, will rendered null and void when, subsequent to a takeover bid, the  offerer  has  a  stake  equal  to  or  over  70%  of  the  share capital which confers voting rights, unless the offerer was not subject to neutralization measures to prevent a takeover bid or had not adapted these measures accordingly.\n\nIn  addition,  the  special  requirements  for  appointment  as Director (Article 30 of the Corporate Bylaws) or as Chairman, Vice-Chairman,  Chief  Operating  Officer  or  member  of  the Executive  Commission (Article  31  of  the  Corporate  Bylaws) are  justified  by  the  desire  that  access  to  the  management decision-making body and to the most significant positions thereon is reserved to persons who have demonstrated their commitment  to  the  Company  and  who,  in  addition,  have adequate  experience  as  members  of  the  Board,  such  that continuity  of  the  management  model  adopted  by  the Telef\u00f3nica Group may be assured in the interest of all of its shareholders  and  stakeholders.  In  any  event,  these  special requirements may be waived by broad consensus among the members  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  namely,  with  the favorable  vote  of  at  least  85  percent  of  its  members,  as provided  by  the  aforementioned  Articles  of  the  Corporate Bylaws.\n\n- 2. That when the listed company controlled, pursuant to the meaning  established  in Article 42 of the Commercial  Code,  by  another  listed  or  non-listed entity,  and  has,  directly  or  through  its  subsidiaries, business  relationships  with  that  entity  or  any  of  its subsidiaries (other than those of the listed company) or carries out activities related to the activities of any of  them,  this  is  reported  publicly,  with  specific information about:",

That the board of directors is of an adequate size to perform  its  duties  effectively  and  collegially,  and that  its  optimum  size  is  between  five  and  fifteen members.\n\n## Explain\n\nIn accordance  with  article  29  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A. corporate Bylaws, the Board of Directors shall be composed of a minimum of five and a maximum of twenty members. However,  in  line  with  the  Good  Governance  tendencies  to reduce  the  number  of  Board  Members,  the  General Shareholder's  Meeting  held  on  June  9,  2017  approved  the establishment  of  seventeen  members  as  the  number  of Board of Directors members, based on the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors and the favorable report of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nThe  complexity  of  the  Telef\u00f3nica  Group  organizational structure,  given  the  considerable  number  of  companies  it comprises,  the  variety  of  sectors  it  operates  in,  its multinational  nature,  as  well  as  its  economic  and  business relevance,  justify  the  fact  that  the  number  of  members  of the Board is adequate to achieve an efficient and operative operation.\n\nLikewise,  it  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  Board  of Directors  of  the  Company  have  six  Committees  (the Executive  Commission  and  five  Advisory  Committees), which  ensures  the  active  participation  of  all  its  Directors. Likewise, the existing number of Directors makes it possible for  each  of  the  aforementioned  Committees  to  have  the ideal composition, taking into account their functions, which reinforces their proper functioning, the independence of the legally mandatory Committees and the adequate dedication of their members, who are not overloaded with work.\n\n- 14.

That proprietary and independent directors constitute  a  substantial  majority  of  the  board  of directors and that the number of executive directors is  kept  at  a  minimum,  taking  into  account  the complexity of the corporate group and the percentage  of  equity  participation  of  executive directors.\n\nFurther,  the  number  of  female  directors  should account  for  at  least  40%  of  the  members  of  the board  of  directors  before  the  end  of  2022  and thereafter, and not less than 30% previous to that.\n\n## Complies\n\n- 16. That the percentage of proprietary directors divided by  the  number  of  non-executive  directors  is  no greater than the proportion of the equity interest in the company  represented  by  said  proprietary directors and the remaining share capital.\n- This criterion may be relaxed:\n- a)  In  companies with a high market capitalization in which interests that are legally considered significant are minimal.\n- b) In companies where a diversity of shareholders is represented  on  the  board  of  directors  without  ties among them.\n\n## Explain\n\nThe  aforementioned  recommendation  16  refers  to  the composition  of  the  group  of  non  executive  Directors.  As stated in Section 4.1.1. of this Annual Corporate Governance Report,  at  December  31,  2020,  the  group  of  non  Executive Directors  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  was  composed  of  15  members (of  a  total  of  17  Members),  of  whom  4  are  Proprietary Directors, 9 are Independent Directors and 2 falls under the Other External category.\n\nOut of the four Proprietary Directors, two represent or have been proposed by CaixaBank, S.A. (CaixaBank), the holder of 4.70% of  the  share  capital  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.;  and  another two  represent  or  have  been proposed  by  Banco  Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., holder of 4.96% of the share capital.\n\nApplying the proportional criterion established in Article 243 of  the  LSC  regarding  the  total  number  of  Directors,  the stakes held by CaixaBank and BBVA are sufficient to entitle each entity to appoint a Director.\n\nMoreover, it must be taken into account that recommendation 16 stipulates that this strict proportionality criterion  can  be  relaxed  so  the  weight  of  Proprietary Directors  is  greater  than  would  strictly  correspond  to  the total  percentage  of  capital  they  represent  in  large  cap companies  where  few  or  no  equity  stakes  attain  the  legal threshold for significant shareholdings.\n\nIn  this  regard,  Telef\u00f3nica  ranks  among  the  top  listed companies  on  Spanish  stock  exchanges  in  terms  of  stock market  capitalization,  reaching  the  figure  of  17,933  million euros  at  December  31,  2020,  which  means  a  very  high absolute  value  of  the  stakes  of  CaixaBank  and  BBVA  in Telef\u00f3nica (that of CaixaBank was around 843 million euros, and  that  of  BBVA  was  around  889  million  euros).  This justifies  the  overrepresentation  of  these  entities  on  the Board  of  Directors,  rising  from  one  member  of  the  Board each  (to  which  they  would  strictly  have  the  right  in accordance with Article 243 of the Spanish Corporations Act) to two members, i.e. permitting the appointment of just one more Proprietary Director over the strictly legal proportion.\n\n- 17. That the number of independent directors represents  at  least  half  of  the  total  number  of directors.\n\nNonetheless,  when  the  company  does  not  have  a high  level  of  market  capitalisation  or  in  the  event that it is a high cap company with one shareholder or  a  group  acting  in  a  coordinated  fashion  who together  control  more  than  30%  of  the  company's equity, the number  of independent directors represents at least one third of the total number of directors.\n\n## Complies\n\n- 18. That  companies  publish  and  update  the  following information  regarding  directors  on  the  company website:\n- a) Professional profile and biography.\n- b) Any other boards to which the director belongs, regardless of whether the companies are listed, as well  as  any  other  remunerated  activities  engaged in, regardless of type.\n- c) Category of directorship, indicating, in the case of individuals who represent significant shareholders, the  shareholder  that  they  represent  or  to  which they are connected.\n- d) The date of their first appointment as a director",

That the annual corporate governance report, after verification by the appointments committee, explains the reasons  for  the  appointment  of proprietary directors at the proposal of the shareholders whose equity interest is less than 3%. It should also explain, where applicable, why formal requests from shareholders for membership on the board meeting were not honored, when their equity interest  is  equal  to  or  exceeds  that  of  other shareholders whose proposal for proprietary directors was honored.\n\nNot applicable\n\n- 20. That  proprietary  directors  representing  significant shareholders  must  resign  from  the  board  if  the shareholder  they  represent  disposes  of  its  entire equity  interest.  They  should  also  resign,  in  a proportional fashion, in the event that said shareholder  reduces  its  percentage  interest  to  a level  that  requires  a  decrease  in  the  number  of proprietary directors representing this shareholder.\n\nNot applicable\n\n- 21. That  the  board  of  directors  may  not  propose  the dismissal  of  any  independent  director  before  the completion of the director's term provided for in the articles of association unless the board of directors finds just cause and a prior report has been prepared by  the  appointments  committee.  Specifically,  just cause is considered to exist if the director takes on new  duties  or  commits  to  new  obligations  that would interfere with his or her ability to dedicate the time necessary for attention to the duties attendant to his post as a director, fails to complete the tasks inherent to his or her post, or enters into any of the circumstances  which  would  cause  the  loss  of independent  status  in  accordance  with  applicable law.\n\nThe dismissal of independent directors may also be proposed  as  a  result  of  a  public  share  offer,  joint venture or similar transaction entailing a change in the shareholder structure of the company, provided that such changes in the structure of the board are the  result  of  the  proportionate  representation criteria provided for in recommendation 16.\n\nComplies\n\n- 22. That  companies  should  establish  rules  obliging directors  to  disclose  any  circumstance  that  might harm the organisation's name or reputation, related or  not  to  their  actions  within  the  company,  and tendering their resignation as the case may be, and, in  particular,  to  inform  the  board  of  any  criminal charges  brought  against  them  and  the  progress  of any subsequent trial.\n\nWhen the board of directors is informed or becomes aware  of  any  of  the  situations  mentioned  in  the previous  paragraph,  the  board  of  directors  should examine the case as soon as possible and, attending to  the  particular  circumstances,  decide,  based  on  a report  from  the  nomination  and  remuneration committee,  whether  or  not  to  adopt  any  measures such as opening of an internal investigation, calling on  the  director  to  resign  or  proposing  his  or  her dismissal.  The  board  of  directors  should  give  a reasoned account of all  such  determinations  in  the annual  corporate  governance  report,  unless  there are  special  circumstances  that  justify  otherwise, which  must  be  recorded  in  the  minutes.  This  is without  prejudice  to  the  information  that  the company must disclose, if appropriate, at the time it adopts the corresponding measures.\n\nComplies\n\n- 23. That  all  directors  clearly  express  their  opposition when they consider any proposal submitted to the board  of  directors  to  be  against  the  company's interests.  This  particularly  applies  to  independent directors  and  directors  who  are  unaffected  by  a potential conflict of interest if the decision could be detrimental to any shareholders not represented on the board of directors.\n\nFurthermore,  when  the  board  of  directors  makes significant  or  repeated  decisions  about  which  the director has serious reservations, the director should draw the appropriate conclusions and, in the event the  director  decides  to  resign,  explain  the  reasons for this decision in the letter referred to in the next recommendation.\n\nThis recommendation also applies in the case of the secretary of the board of directors, despite not being a director.\n\nNot applicable\n\n- 24. That  directors  who  give  up  their  position  before their tenure expires, through resignation or resolution of the general meeting, should state the reasons  for  this  decision,  or  in  the  case  of  nonexecutive directors, their opinion of the reasons for",

That  high  market  capitalization  companies  have formed  separate  appointments  and  remuneration committees .\n\n## Explain\n\nArticle 40 of the Bylaws, and Article 23 of the Regulation of the  Board  of  Directors,  expressly  state,  on  regulating  the Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committees, that the Board of Directors shall be entitled to set  up  two  Committees,  separately  giving  each  of  them powers  for  appointments,  and  the  other  the  powers  for remuneration, while the corporate governance powers may be included in either one of them.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. has not considered appropriate, so far, separating  the  functions  of  the Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee because it believes that by putting the powers to assess  Directors  and  determine  their  remuneration  in  the same Committee, is helpful to coordinate and to produce a results-driven remuneration system (pay for performance). The  Board  also  considers  that  the  workload  of  the Nominating,  Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance Committee and,  therefore,  its  members,  is  reasonable  and does not make it advisable, for the time being, to divide it\n\ninto two separate committees. Furthermore, it is noted that the  Board  of  Directors  currently  has  five  Consultative Committees (Audit and Control Committee, the Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee, Regulation and Institutional Affairs Committee, Sustainability and Quality Committee and the Strategy and Innovation  Committee),  in  addition  to  the  Executive Commission.\n\nIn this context, the separation of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee would not have been appropriate with the facilitating objective of the reorganization of the Consultative or Committees of the Company, approved by the Board of Directors on April  27, 2016,  generating  unnecessary  inefficiencies  and  needs  for additional allocations.\n\n- 49. That the appointments committee consult with the chairman  of  the  board  of  directors  and  the  chief executive  of  the  company,  especially  in  relation  to matters concerning executive directors.\n- And  that  any  director  may  ask  the  appointments committee  to  consider  potential  candidates  he  or she  considers  appropriate  to  fill  a  vacancy  on  the board of directors.\n\nComplies\n\n- 50. That  the  remuneration  committee  exercises  its functions independently and that, in addition to the functions  assigned  to  it  by  law,  it  should  be responsible for the following:\n- a)  Propose  basic  conditions  of  employment  for senior management.\n- b)  Verify  compliance  with  company  remuneration policy.\n- c) Periodically  review  the  remuneration  policy applied  to  directors  and  senior  managers,  including remuneration  involving  the  delivery  of  shares,  and guarantee that individual remuneration be proportional to that received by other directors and senior managers.\n- d) Oversee that potential conflicts of interest do not undermine  the  independence  of  external  advice rendered to the board.\n- e) Verify information regarding remuneration paid to directors  and  senior  managers  contained  in  the various  corporate  documents,  including  the  annual report on director remuneration.\n\nComplies",

That the rules regarding composition and workings of supervision and control committees appear in the rules governing the board of directors and that they are  consistent  with  those  that  apply  to  mandatory committees in accordance with the recommendations above, including:\n- a)  That  they  are  comprised  exclusively  of  nonexecutive  directors, with  a  majority  of  them independent.\n- b) That their chairmen be independent directors.\n- c)  That  the  board  of  directors  select  members  of these committees taking into account their knowledge,  skills  and  experience  and  the  duties  of each committee; discuss their proposals and reports; and  detail  their  activities  and  accomplishments during  the  first  plenary  session  of  the  board  of directors held after the committee's last meeting.\n- d) That  the  committees  be  allowed  to  avail themselves of outside advice when they consider it necessary to perform their duties.\n- e) That their meetings be recorded and the minutes be made available to all directors.\n\n## Explain\n\n- 1.  The  supervision  and  control  committees  which  are attributed the powers referred to in recommendation 52 are the  Audit  and  Control  Committee  and  the  Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee.  The composition and operation rules of the two Committees are set out in the Regulation of the Board of Directors and in the specific  Regulations  of  each  one  of  them.  Likewise,  both Committees are not only consistent with legally dispositions applicable  but  are  also  an  improvement  upon  them,  in certain  areas.  For  example,  according  to  the  Regulation  of the Board of Directors, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee must have a majority of independent members, as opposed to the minimum of two according  to  prevailing  laws.  In  fact,  in  practice,  the Committee is composed of three independent Directors, and two with the category of \"Other external\".\n- 2. The Board of Directors has other Consulting Committees which  are  allocated  other  functions  (Regulation  and Institutional  Affairs  Committee,  Sustainability  and  Quality Committee, and Strategy and Innovation Committee), which are  strongly  linked  with  the  businesses  developed  by  the Company and with management aspects, and, in particular,\n\nthe  Sustainability  and  Quality  Committee  has  some  of  the functions set out in Recommendations 53 and 54 below.\n\nThese Committees are expressly regulated in the Regulation of  the  Board  of  Directors,  although  with  fewer  details  with respect  to  those  that  are  legally  mandatory.  However,  all these  non-mandatory  committees  are,  in  practice,  subject to the operating rules set out in Recommendation 52 c), d) and e).\n\nIt  has  been  considered  that  Committees  with  powers  in matters linked to the Company's businesses and management aspects do not necessarily have to be chaired by independent Directors nor, except for the Sustainability and Quality Committee in accordance with Recommendation  53,  do  most  of  the  members  of  the committees need to have independent directors, but rather it is preferable to take into account the technical knowledge and specific expertise of their members when appointing the Director to chair them and the other Directors who should sit on these committees.\n\n- 53. That  the  task  of  supervising  compliance  with  the policies and rules of the company in the environmental,  social  and  corporate  governance areas,  and  internal  rules  of  conduct,  should  be assigned  to  one  board  committee  or  split  between several,  which  could  be  the  audit  committee,  the nomination  committee,  a  committee  specialised  in sustainability or corporate social responsibility, or a dedicated committee established by the board under its  powers  of  selforganisation.  Such  a  committee should be made up solely of non-executive directors, the  majority  being  independent  and  specifically assigned the following minimum functions.\n\n## Complies\n\n- 54. That  the  minimum  functions  referred  to  in  the previous recommendation are as follows:\n- a)  Monitor  compliance  with  the  company's  internal codes  of  conduct  and  corporate  governance  rules, and ensure that the corporate culture is aligned with its purpose and values.\n- b)  Monitor the implementation of the general policy regarding the disclosure of economic-financial, nonfinancial  and  corporate  information,  as  well  as communication  with  shareholders  and  investors, proxy advisors and other stakeholders. Similarly, the way in  which  the  entity  communicates  and  relates with small and medium-sized shareholders should be monitored.\n- c) Periodically  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the company's corporate governance system and environmental and social policy, to confirm that it is fulfilling its mission  to  promote  the  corporate interest and  catering, as appropriate, to the",

That  the  environmental  and  social  sustainability policies should identify and include at least:\n- a)  The  principles,  commitments,  objectives  and strategy regarding shareholders, employees, clients, suppliers,  social  welfare  issues,  the  environment, diversity,  fiscal  responsibility,  respect  for  human rights  and  the  prevention  of  corruption  and  other illegal conducts.\n- b) The methods  or systems for monitoring compliance with policies, associated risks and their management.\n- c)  The  mechanisms  for  supervising  non-financial risk,  including  that  related  to  ethical  aspects  and business conduct.\n- d) Channels for stakeholder communication, participation and dialogue.\n- e) Responsible communication practices that prevent the manipulation of information and protect the company's honour and integrity.\n\nComplies\n\n- 56.

That only executive directors receive remuneration linked to corporate results or personal performance, as  well  as  remuneration  in  the  form  of  shares, options  or  rights  to  shares  or  instruments  whose value is indexed to share value, or long-term savings plans such as pension plans, retirement accounts or any other retirement plan.\n\nShares  may  be  given  to  non-executive  directors under the condition that they maintain ownership of the  shares  until  they  leave  their  posts  as  directors. The  forgoing  shall  not  apply  to  shares  that  the director  may  be  obliged  sell  in  order  to  meet  the costs related to their acquisition.\n\n## Complies\n\n- 58. That  as  regards  variable  remuneration,  the  policies incorporate  limits  and  administrative  safeguards  in order to ensure that said remuneration is in line with the  work  performance  of  the  beneficiaries  and  are not based solely upon general developments in the markets  or  in  the  sector  in  which  the  company operates, or other similar circumstances.\n- And, in particular, that variable remuneration components:\n- a)  Are  linked  to  pre-determined  and  measurable performance criteria and that such criteria take into account  the  risk  undertaken  to  achieve  a  given result.\n- b)  Promote  sustainability  of  the  company  and include non-financial criteria that are geared towards creating long term value, such as compliance with rules and internal operating procedures  and  risk  management  and  control policies.\n- c)  Are  based  upon  balancing  short-,  medium- and long-term  objectives,  permitting  the  reward  of continuous achievement over a period of time long enough to judge creation of sustainable value such that  the  benchmarks  used  for  evaluation  are  not comprised of one-off, seldom occurring or extraordinary events.\n\n## Complies\n\n- 59. That  the  payment  of  the  variable  components  of remuneration  is  subject  to  sufficient  verification that  previously  established  performance,  or  other, conditions  have  been  effectively  met.  Entities should include in their annual directors' remuneration report the criteria relating to the time required and methods for such verification, depending on the nature and characteristics of each variable component.\n\nAdditionally, entities should consider establishing a reduction  clause  ('malus')  based  on  deferral  for  a sufficient  period  of  the  payment  of  part  of  the variable  components  that  implies  total  or  partial loss of this remuneration in the event that prior to the time of payment an event occurs that makes this advisable.\n\nComplies",

That remuneration related to company results takes into account any reservations which may appear in the  external  auditor's  report  which  would  diminish said results.\n\n## Complies\n\n- 61.

That  following  the  award  of  shares,  options  or financial instruments corresponding to the remuneration  schemes,  executive  directors  should not  be  able  to  transfer  their  ownership  or  exercise them  until  a  period  of  at  least  three  years  has elapsed.\n\nExcept for the case in which the director maintains, at  the  time  of  the  transfer  or  exercise,  a  net economic  exposure  to  the  variation  in  the  price  of the  shares  for  a  market  value  equivalent  to  an amount  of  at  least  twice  his  or  her  fixed  annual remuneration  through  the  ownership  of  shares, options or other financial instruments.\n\nThe foregoing shall not apply to the shares that the director  needs  to  dispose  of  to  meet  the  costs related  to  their  acquisition  or,  upon  favourable assessment  of  the  nomination  and  remuneration committee to address an extraordinary situation.\n\n## Explain\n\nAs  stipulated  in  section  4.2  of  the  current  Directors' Remuneration  Policy,  the  Executive  Directors  must  hold (directly  or  indirectly)  a  number  of  shares  (including  those provided as remuneration) equivalent to two (2) years' gross Fixed  Remuneration  as  long  as  they  are  members  on  the Board of Directors and perform executive duties. The term set  for  achieving  this  target  is  five  years,  counted  from January  1,  2019  or,  in  the  case  of  Executive  Directors appointed  at  a  later  time,  counted  from  the  date  of  their appointment,  unless  the  Board  of  Directors/Nominating, Compensation  and  Corporate Governance Committee approve a longer term when exceptional situations arise.\n\nAlthough  this  requirement  came  into  force  on  January  1, 2019  and  the  Executive  Directors  are  allowed  until December  31,  2023  to  comply  with  it,  the  Executive Chairman  of  the  Company,  Mr.  Jos\u00e9  Mar\u00eda  \u00c1lvarez-Pallete L\u00f3pez,  held  1,812,359  shares  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.  on December 31, 2020, which were valued at a price of \u20ac4.1761 per  share  (according  to  the  average  value  in  2020),\n\nrepresenting 394% of his fixed remuneration. Likewise, the Chief  Operating  Officer  (COO),  Mr.  \u00c1ngel  Vil\u00e1  Boix,  held 418,218 shares of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., which were valued at the same  price  per  share,  representing  109%  of  his  fixed remuneration.\n\nThe  percentage  representing  the  value  of  the  shares, according to their average value in 2020, regarding the Fixed Remuneration of the Executive Directors, has been reduced compared with the previous financial year due to the lower trading  price  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  shares  in  the  financial  year 2020. In any case, the price at which the Executive Directors acquired their shares represents an amount that far exceeds twice their Fixed Remuneration.\n\nHowever,  the  new  Remuneration  Policy  that  will  be submitted for approval at the General Shareholders' Meeting in  2021  determines  that,  if  this  commitment  is  breached, the  shares  that  the  Executive  Director  receives  within  the scope  of  any  variable  remuneration  component  will  be subject  to  a  minimum  retention  period  of  three  years; therefore raising the Executive Director's level of commitment, thus complying with Recommendation 62.\n\n- 63. That contractual arrangements include a clause which permits the company to seek reimbursement of variable remuneration components in the event that payment does not coincide with performance criteria or when delivery was made based upon data later deemed to be inaccurate.\n\n## Partially complies\n\nThe Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee  is  empowered  to  propose  that  the  Board  of Directors  cancels  a  variable  remuneration  payment  in  the event  of  circumstances  such  as  those  described  in  this recommendation.  The  Nominating,  Compensation  and Corporate  Governance  Committee  will  also  assess  if exceptional circumstances of this kind may even entail the termination of the relationship with the person responsible, proposing  measures  which  are  deemed  pertinent  to  the Board of Directors.\n\n- 64. That  termination  payments  should  not  exceed  a fixed  amount  equivalent  to  two  years  of  the director's total annual remuneration and should not be  paid  until  the  company  confirms  that  he  or  she has met the predetermined performance criteria.\n\nFor the purposes of this recommendation, payments for  contractual  termination  include  any  payments whose  accrual  or  payment  obligation  arises  as  a consequence of or on the occasion of the termination  of  the  contractual  relationship  that linked  the  director  with  the  company,  including previously  unconsolidated  amounts  for  long-term savings schemes and the amounts paid under postcontractual non-compete agreements.",

These  procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7  Statistical and expert models for customer acquisition that are  used  to  forecast  and  to  manage  the  customer expected probability of default.\n- \u00b7  Decision  tools  allowing  the  implementation  of  tailored credit strategies by product, channel, geography and type of customer.\n- \u00b7  Continuous  monitoring  of  the  payment  behavior  and solvency of the customer portfolio.\n- \u00b7  Internal  and  external  collection  processes  designed  to increase  recovery  through  differentiated  actions  by  debt age and customer profile.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing controls over the credit risk exposure.\n\nThe customer credit risk management strategy is embedded in  the  day-to-day  operational  processes  guiding  both  the product  and  services  available  for  the  different  customer profile  and  the  management  practices  all  through  the customer life-cycle.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nAt  December  31,  2020,  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A.'s  long-term  issuer default  rating  is  \"BBB  stable  outlook\" from  Fitch,  'BBBstable  outlook\" from  Standard  &  Poor's  and  'Baa3  stable outlook\" from  Moody's.  During  2020,  Standard  and  Poor's revised  the  outlook  to  'negative'  from  'stable'  on  April  1, 2020  and  later,  on  November  20,  2020  downgraded  the rating  to  'BBB  - stable'  from  'BBB  negative'.  The  last changes in the credit ratings prior to that took place in 2016 when Moody's downgraded the rating to 'Baa3 stable' from 'Baa2 negative' on November 7, 2016 and Fitch downgraded the rating to 'BBB stable' from 'BBB+ stable' on September 5, 2016.\n\nIn 2020, measures taken to protect the credit rating included an  active  portfolio  management  through  the  agreement reached for the sale of the entire share capital of Telef\u00f3nica de Costa  Rica  TC,  S.A.  and  the  agreement  to  sell approximately 10,100 sites of Telef\u00f3nica Germany to Telxius (which  led  to  the  partners  making  equity  contributions  in Telxius).  Apart  from  that,  Telef\u00f3nica  decided  to  distribute dividends  for  fiscal  year  2020  through  two  voluntary  scrip dividends.  Additionally,  there  was  an  intensive  financing activity,  as  the  Group  took  advantage  of  the  historical  low refinancing rates to extend average debt life, while seeking to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTelef\u00f3nica also reached strategic deals in 2020 to reinforce its business profile, first with Liberty Global plc, with which it has agreed to combine their respective operating businesses in the United Kingdom in a 50-50 joint venture, and second, with Allianz, with which it has agreed to create a joint venture to  deploy  fiber  in  rural  areas  in  Germany.  In  January  2021, Telxius signed an agreement with American Tower Corporation  for  the  sale  of  its  telecommunications  towers division in Europe (Spain and Germany) and in Latin America (Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina).\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nTelef\u00f3nica,  S.A.'s  dividend  policy  is  revised  yearly  based  on the  Group's  earnings,  cash  generation,  solvency,  liquidity, flexibility to make strategic investments.\n\nOn  March  2017  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Telef\u00f3nica,  S.A. decided to define the corresponding payment periods of the dividends. Therefore, from there on, the dividend payment in the second quarter will take place in June, and the dividend payment in the fourth quarter will take place in December, in both cases on or before the third Friday of the corresponding month.\n\nIn February 2019, Telef\u00f3nica announced the dividend policy for the year 2019: 0.40 euros per share in cash, in December 2019 (0.20 euros per share) and in June 2020 (0.20 euros per share). According to this, the Annual General Meeting held in 2019,  approved  a  dividend  distribution  in  cash  charged  to Unrestricted  Reserves,  by  means  of  a  payment  of  a  fixed gross  amount  of  0.40  euros  during  2019  payable  in  two tranches,  0.20  euros  per  share  on  June  20,  2019  and  0.20 euros per share on December 19, 2019.\n\nIn February 2020, Telef\u00f3nica announced the dividend policy for the year 2020: 0.40 euros per share payable in December 2020 (0.20 euros per share) and in June 2021 (0.20 euros per share).\n\nIn  May  2020,  after  the  corresponding  analyses,  it  was concluded that the Company had a sufficiently healthy cash position  to  maintain  the  previously  announced  dividends payment. However, for reasons of financial prudence in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and in order to grant greater  flexibility  in  regard  to  cash  outflows  and  different alternatives for the shareholders, it was deemed appropriate to propose for approval of the Annual General Shareholders Meeting  held  on  June  12,  2020  the  implementation  of  the payment  of  sums  to  be  made  during  this  fiscal  year  2020 through  separate  scrip  dividends  (the  'Telef\u00f3nica  Flexible Dividend'), which as is known, provides all shareholders with the choice of receiving the relevant compensation in shares or in cash, at the shareholder's discretion.\n\nThe Annual General Shareholders Meeting held on June 12, 2020  approved  the  Proposals  of  the  scrip  dividend,  which were executed in June and December 2020.",
