For the JR East Group, it was an extremely challenging fiscal year. Due to a major downturn in customers' service usage, we recorded the first loss since our establishment in 1987. As a leader of the management team, I take this result very seriously, and I am determined to achieve renewed growth by advancing a range of initiatives.\n\nDespite the difficult environment, the concerted efforts of all Group employees enabled us to fulfill our social mission through the provision of transportation and other services that are part of society's infrastructure. To us, this achievement reconfirmed the fundamental robustness of the Group. In addition, we completed forward-looking projects for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games on schedule. For example, we completed large-scale renovations of railway stations, which included the establishment of barrier-free facilities, and opened new station buildings and hotels.\n\nIssues that the fiscal year underscored were the size of fixed costs in the Group's business structure and the weaknesses in business development focusing on railway stations. As demand for transportation services declines, how much we can reduce fixed costs will be critical. In fiscal 2021, we urgently reduced our operational costs. Going forward, we will make our cost structure more flexible by continuing to reform fundamental components of our businesses and by advancing structural reforms through digital transformation. In conjunction with these efforts, we must revamp our employees' workstyles. In particular, I believe that our employees have realized that they can no longer take for granted the stability of JR East as an organization. As a result, I sense the emergence of a mindset whereby each employee is considering what needs to be done in their workplace and then taking the initiative to put their ideas into action.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the Group, I view the crisis as a great opportunity for transforming the Company and moving forward positively to achieve further growth. While taking on forward-looking challenges, we will continue to make safety our first priority in business management, and all of the Group employees will work as one in pursuit of ultimate safety levels.\n\nBy pursuing ultimate safety levels, we will our customers.",

        "page_content": "A Message from the President\n\nSpecifically, we will develop a railway system with even higher levels of safety in accordance with Group Safety Plan 2023, our five-year safety plan.\n\nIn addition, we will foster personnel who have a thorough understanding of the true nature of their work and who are able to adapt. Also, we will steadily implement natural disaster countermeasures, install automatic platform gates, and put in place safety measures for level crossings.\n\n## Recovering and Advancing Steadily toward Renewed Growth in Fiscal 2022\n\nWe view fiscal 2022, ending March 31, 2022, as a year of 'decisions and actions.' Through the implementation of structural reforms and the production of concrete results based on a medium- to long-term perspective, we will make fiscal 2022 a year of achieving steady progress. Our timetable revision in March 2021 marked the beginning of two priority measures for a post-COVID-19 society.\n\nThe first measure has made last-train departures up to 30 minutes earlier in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The measure aims to secure time for maintenance and realize workstyle reform for those engaged in construction work. While the volume of construction work at railway stations, such as the installation of automatic platform gates is increasing, the number of construction workers is decreasing due to the decline and aging of the population. Consequently, heightening construction efficiency as much as possible has become an important task. The 30 minutes gained by bringing forward last-train departures will shorten overall construction periods. Also, we will establish efficient operations by promoting mechanization. Furthermore, shorter construction periods will allow us to speed up the introduction of automatic platform gates and other facilities, enhancing safety and service quality.\n\nOur second measure entails 'shifting' or mitigating peak travel periods. Here, we are referring to peaks that occur in two different time frames: seasonal and daily. We experience seasonal peaks when more passengers use our services during the Golden Week spring holiday, the Bon Festival summer vacation period, and the New Year period. The key to mitigating daily peaks lies in leveling demand during the morning peak period. As a first step to this end, we have launched the Off-Peak Point Service . Ever-increasing numbers of customers want to avoid crowded places. But the efficacy of simply asking customers to stagger their commuting times is limited. Customers need to accrue concrete benefits from commuting in off-peak periods. For this reason, our efforts will not stop at awarding points. We are also considering off-peak commuter passes with fares that are differentiated by time period. We envision reducing the prices of commuter passes that can only be used in off-peak periods, while implementing widespread but marginal increases in the prices of commuter passes that can also be used during peak periods. With a view to realizing such commuter passes, we want to resolve issues through discussions with companies that pay for their employees' commuter passes and authorities that have jurisdiction over the fares system. The spreading out of the usage peaks that occur at certain times and seasons will enable us to realize cost reductions by operating with fewer facilities and employees-the numbers of which have been determined by high passenger volumes during peak periods. Such medium- to long-term structural reform will be an indispensable part of our efforts to make the railway business more sustainable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Real Meaning of Speed Up 'Move Up' 2027\n\nWhen we announced the JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027 in 2018, our goal was to look 10 years ahead and transform our business model based on the changes in lifestyles that were likely to accompany a decreased population and the spread of e-commerce. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, scenarios we had envisioned for the future suddenly appeared in the present, making rapid realization of 'Move Up' 2027 an urgent task. Although we have not changed the overall goal we should pursue, we must raise the level and speed of our efforts to achieve this goal while catering to new types of demand in a post-COVID-19 society. This stepping up of efforts is what our updated vision Speed Up 'Move Up' 2027 really entails.\n\nFurther, as a new target for fiscal 2026, we aim to realize a ratio of 6:4 between the operating revenues of the Transportation segment and those of non-transportation segments. Moreover, we hope to change this ratio to 5:5 as early as possible. Until now, the JR East Group has primarily developed and provided services in a limited field comprising railways and railway stations, which have been used by numerous customers. Going forward, however, people are expected to have fewer opportunities to travel and gather. Consequently, it is important to adopt an approach to value provision that is focused on individual customers. The Group has three businesses: Transportation, Life-style, and IT & Suica services. The key to realizing the aforementioned target ratios for operating revenues lies in expanding the areas where these three businesses overlap because increased overlapping will enable us to meet more customer needs and create synergies among the businesses. For example, we will offer products based on an understanding of each customer's needs acquired through JRE POINT . Also, we will create services that use the overlapping of business fields to provide new value, such as logistics services that utilize trains.",

        "page_content": "A Message from the President\n\n## Beyond Stations Concept-Transitioning toward Platforms for Connected Lifestyles\n\nIn creating new businesses, the Beyond Stations Concept will be a central strategy. Under this concept, the Group aims to connect all of its real-world advantages with the digital technology space to transform railway stations from transportation hubs into platforms for 'connected lifestyles' in which people, products, and services are interconnected. To this end, we will roll out new services based on tie-ins with e-commerce and the sharing of our 5G antenna infrastructure. Further, the mitigation of peak travel periods will allow us to use the freed-up space in railway stations for the development of a variety of businesses. In the aforementioned ways, by going beyond the use of railway stations simply as physical spaces, we will utilize railway stations as a multi-layered form of infrastructure.\n\nTakanawa Gateway Station, which opened in 2020, epitomizes the new type of multilayered railway station that will be created under the Beyond Stations Concept. In addition to featuring new functions, such as unstaffed convenience stores, cafes that accept orders made via smartphones, and shared offices, the railway station has served as a testing ground for leading-edge technologies, including cleaning and security robots as well as avatars that offer a range of travel-related information. Also, the new station is the centerpiece of our initiative to realize town development that 'anticipates the coming century' by integrating railway stations and towns. In fiscal 2025, the opening of the town adjacent to the railway station will reveal this integration in its completed form. As the site of Japan's first railway 150 years ago, the Takanawa district is steeped in the history of railways. Thus, Takanawa Gateway Station will become the hub of a district linking both the history and the future of railways, which were the Group's inaugural business.\n\n## Workstyle Reform and the Provision of Value for New Lifestyles\n\nUntil now, we have mainly engaged in improving the convenience of services centered on railway stations and railways, but we will adopt a new approach to service development that is focused on catering to changes in lifestyles and workstyles. For example, we will cater to new workstyles by providing value in the form of satellite offices, shared offices, and 'workations'. Also, with an eye on regional revitalization, we will take measures to enable the purchase of regional specialties and fresh foods through JRE MALL .\n\nMajor structural reform will be required to realize a ratio of 5:5 between the operating revenues of the Transportation segment and those of non-transportation segments.\n\nCurrently, station personnel primarily sell paper tickets and provide information over the counter. However, the further introduction of ticketless boarding will allow customers to use train services more conveniently, without visiting ticket counters or automated ticket vending machines in railway stations. Meanwhile, as they will have fewer regular and routine duties to perform, station personnel will work more flexibly. Of course, providing information and responding to emergencies at railway stations will remain as important duties. At other times, however, personnel will be able to perform multiple tasks. In the regional areas, for example, our personnel can develop tourism businesses with a view to revitalizing local economies. In the Tokyo metropolitan area, meanwhile, it will be possible for personnel to provide life-style services and perform station duties. We are fully committed to realizing this kind of workstyle reform in order to offer new value.\n\n## Financial Policies and Other Policies Designed to Strengthen Management Efficiency Fundamentally\n\nTo create new businesses, it is important to strengthen the management foundations that support them. First of all, we will focus on normalizing cash flows, which became negative due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2021, we reduced costs by \u00a5150.0 billion Groupwide as an emergency measure, and our plans call for an additional \u00a570.0 billion in cost reductions in fiscal 2022. Although we are lowering overall investment, we will continue to steadily implement the investment needed to ensure safety and future growth. Our current revenue situation is tough, but we expect that the use of our services will gradually recover if the COVID-19 vaccination program proceeds smoothly. We intend to enhance our financial stability while carefully monitoring revenue trends. Further, the Group will expand its real estate business. In April 2021, we established JR East Real Estate Asset Management Co., Ltd., as a 'rotational' business tasked with efficiently monetizing the large number of our properties. We will accelerate the formation and increase the scale of the private placement funds that we have already established. Looking ahead, we will then build a structure similar to that of a real estate investment trust to attract more funds. At the same time, we will seek an early recovery in consolidated return on assets (ROA), which we view as an important indicator.\n\nWith regard to the reduction of fixed costs-our most important task-we will steadily implement medium- to long-term structural reforms. Specifically, we will create a leaner operation system by increasing driver-only services, reform railway station duties by expanding ticketless or smartphone-enabled boarding to establish an efficient sales system, advance smart maintenance by introducing condition-based maintenance (CBM) and mechanization, and streamline facilities. Further, Group companies will improve their productivity through such measures as the introduction of multitasking. Aiming to achieve a \u00a5100.0 billion reduction in the operating costs of the railway business by fiscal 2028 compared with those of fiscal 2020, we will create a flexible cost structure that can adapt to changes in customers' usage of our services as a result of COVID-19 and population decline. In addition, we will make the operational management of local railways more efficient while working with local communities to fully understand their needs and develop appropriate sustainable transportation systems.\n\n## Realizing a Sustainable Society through ESG initiatives\n\nThe business creation that is accompanying our drive toward the vision of 'Move Up' 2027 is helping to address social issues and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In these initiatives, putting ESG-oriented management into practice is paramount. With respect to the environmental component of this management approach, the Group will take steps to realize Zero Carbon Challenge 2050, which sets reducing CO2 emissions to 'net zero' by 2050 as a target for the entire the Group. Also, as the owner of power plants, the Group will reduce electricity-related CO2 emissions in three areas: generation, transmission and storage, and consumption. Further, the use of hydrogen will be a key factor going forward. Committed to realizing a hydrogen-based society, we will collaborate with different companies to promote initiatives focused on such areas as hydrogen power generation, fuel cell railcars, and integrated hydrogen stations. Also, in 2020 we began disclosure in compliance with the framework of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In fiscal 2021, we used data on demographics and past losses",

In the fiscal 2022, we will conduct an analysis of future financial effects based on scenarios in which climate change-related events cause river flooding that leads to damage, such as the damage caused by typhoons in 2019. Moreover, we will use our findings to verify the appropriateness of our countermeasures for natural disasters. In the years ahead, we plan to disclose the results of such analysis even more actively.\n\nAs for the social component of ESG-oriented management, we will focus on regional revitalization. In addition to further expanding our tourism programs, we will take on the challenge of new measures, including local digital transformation in the form of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). For instance, we will build a system that enables the seamless completion of procedures from reservation through to transportation and payment, and then connect the system to local sales networks to improve customer convenience and boost tourism. On-demand transport is one example of systems that enhance convenience. We also intend to actively participate in regional town development. The reality is that regional populations are declining and are expected to decrease even further in the future. In response, we will work with the municipal authorities of Akita, Aomori, and other core regional cities to develop towns that are focused on railway stations. With the increase in digital transformation and telecommuting, relocation to rural areas has become a new option for those who want to change their workstyles. To meet these needs, we will advance a workation-focused business and develop attractive towns. Also, as a new form of tourism, we will create services that combine tourism and support for agriculture, a major regional industry. In March 2021, we opened the experiential tourism farm JR Fruits Park Sendai Arahama . Through agritourism, we will create new exchanges and revitalize regions.\n\nEnhancement of the governance component of ESG-oriented management is crucial for efforts to steadily advance the aforementioned initiatives, sustain the Group's growth, and increase corporate value over the medium to long term. The Group will grow its value not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nonly by ensuring compliance, safety and security, financial loss prevention, and financial soundness but also by developing risk management with a view to forays into new business fields. In April 2022, the Tokyo Stock Exchange will restructure its market segmentation. Ahead of this change, Japan's Corporate Governance Code was revised in June 2021. In light of this revision and other considerations, the JR East Group will enhance its governance even further.\n\n## Using Adversity as an Opportunity to Provide Our Stakeholders with Medium- to Long-Term Value\n\nWe are grateful to our employees who, even amid the extremely challenging conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, have never once looked back and are forging ahead with new initiatives in their respective workplaces. Their positive attitude also gives us a sense of new possibilities. Individual employees will play a key role in 'Move Up' 2027, and heightening employee engagement will support the growth of the Group. By more closely aligning the Group's goals with those of each employee, JR East will create an upward spiral of participation and growth. In addition, we will create a more flexible work environment, which we hope will broaden the scope of employees' work and allow the emergence and realization of various ideas from frontline operations.\n\nReflecting a continued commitment to 'Thriving with Communities,' our business development has been rooted in local communities for more than 30 years. Until now, we have mainly been involved with local communities through railway operations. However, by expanding the scope of our involvement through the initiatives we mentioned earlier, which include the promotion of local digital transformation, regional town development, and relocation support, we will contribute even more to the development of local communities.\n\nIn conclusion, let us assure our stakeholders, who have continued to support us even in these difficult times, that we will accomplish medium- to long-term structural reformsthereby transforming the Company and putting it back on a trajectory of sustained growth. Although challenging conditions are likely to continue for another one or two years, We would like to ask our stakeholders to adopt a medium- to long-term perspective and provide us with their continuous support.\n\nJuly 2021\n\nPresident and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## JR East Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027\n\n## Providing Services That Match Customers' New Ways of Working and Living\n\nWe have been facing an extremely challenging business environment due to the decrease in usage of both rail and life-style services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The clock has jumped forward 10 years, and changes in the business environment envisioned in 'Move Up' 2027 have suddenly become today's reality. On the other hand, the initiatives we need to take have not changed. Therefore, we must heighten the level and speed of initiatives aimed at realizing 'Move Up' 2027. To this end, Speed Up 'Move Up' 2027, announced in September 2020, calls on the Group to rebuild growth and innovation strategies and strengthen management efficiency fundamentally through ESG-oriented management.\n\nAccordingly, the JR East Group will combine the advantages of its real-world networks with digital technologies to propose new lifestyles and take on new ventures. Further, by adopting a people-focused approach, we will evolve our railway-based business model and advance structural reforms, thereby enabling us to work in partnership with local communities to become a sustainable corporate group.\n\n## Changes in the Business Environment\n\nThe economic situation in Japan has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For some time to come, the JR East Group is likely to continue experiencing a very challenging environment due to a decline in demand for transportation and other factors.\n\nOver the medium to long term, a transformation of the business environment is expected to result from the further decline and aging of the population, technological innovations such as autonomous driving technology, and changes in the nature of globalization.\n\nFurther, as the Group was established over 30 years ago, we must address various tasks arising from changes to railway systems and the rapid transition to the next generation of employees.\n\n## Basic Policies of 'Move Up' 2027\n\nDuring the 30 years following its  establishment, JR East developed a business model that generated profits by encouraging many customers to use railway services and railway stations through the enhancement of their  convenience. With the affluence of everyone in their daily lives as our starting point, we will create new services and provide society with them by utilizing 'real' networks and introducing technologies and knowledge from outside the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of 'Move Up' 2027\n\nWith people ('everyone') as our starting point, and with 'Safety,' 'People's daily lives,' and 'Happiness of our employees and their families' as our focus, we will continue to create the values of 'Trust' and 'Affluence' in cities, regional areas, and around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Plans for Achieving 'Move Up' 2027\n\nTo achieve 'Move Up' 2027, we are taking concrete action. Medium-term plans for our individual businesses and fields establish medium-term goals as well as clear measures and milestones for each fiscal year, and we also monitor and disclose progress toward these milestones on a single fiscal year basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, our customers' commuting styles and preferences have changed dramatically. To cater to the diversified commuting styles of the customers who use our railway services, we have launched two new services based on JRE POINT. Also, we are advancing STATION WORK , which facilitates new ways of working, as well as logistics services that take advantage of the rapid delivery capabilities of trains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Off-Peak Point Service\n\n-Supporting Comfortable Staggered Commuting-\n\nOver a fixed period, customers who use Suica commuter passes that are registered with JRE POINT receive points for avoiding the peak commuting hours by beginning journeys during either the 'early riser time slot' or the 'leisurely time slot' on weekday mornings in specified areas and then ending their journeys in specified areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase in Services That Incorporate JRE POINT\n\nInitially, JRE POINT was used mainly for shopping and short-distance trips. However, the launches of the Off-Peak Point Service , the Repeater Point Service , and the use of JRE POINT for STATION WORK have broadened the scope of JRE POINT services to meet the needs of commuters. Moreover, we are adding some new services of leisure travel to JRE POINT services. For example, since the end of June 2021 customers have been able to use reservations website eki-net to exchange their points for JRE POINT Discount Tickets . In this way, we will continue to activate a cycle of granting and using points by extending the scope of JRE POINT .\n\nMarketing Strategy Group, Marketing Department, Railway Operations Headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Repeater Point Service\n\n-Giving Customers More Freedom to Choose Times and Locations-\n\nCustomers who use Suica card or mobile Suica that are registerd with JRE POINT receive points equivalent to one fare if the Suica card's balance is used on segments with the same train fare 10 times in the same month and receive points equivalent to 10% of the fare for each subsequent journey on segments with the same train fare in that month.\n\n## Shared office business ' STATION WORK '\n\nBased on the concept of 'valuing workers' every single second,' STATION WORK will continue offering and enabling new workstyles. Catering to diverse workstyles, we will not only roll out STATION WORK in railway stations but also step up the pace of our partnerships with hotels that provide spacious individual rooms designed for use as work spaces.\n\nWe will expand the STATION WORK network nationwide with a view to establishing 1,000 locations by the end of fiscal 2024.\n\n## Logistics Services That Utilize Shinkansen and Other Trains\n\nAiming to promote regional revitalization, increase revenue, and expand businesses in the post-COVID-19 era, the JR East Group is advancing logistics services that utilize Shinkansen and other trains. Capitalizing on the advantages of railways in terms of rapid delivery capabilities, regularity, and network coverage, we are collaborating with a wide range of businesses to transport various products to destinations inside and outside railway stations. Cargos include fresh fish and produce-for which a high degree of freshness adds value-and fresh confectioneries with short shelf lives. As goods are delivered to customers on the same day, this service has been very well received.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Strategic Vision as a Core Pillar 'Beyond Stations'\n\nUnder the 'Beyond Stations' Concept, we are pursuing initiatives aimed at creating and maximizing customer value that enriches everyday life. JR East Group will interconnect all of our real-world advantages with the digital technology space and combine our tangible and intangible assets in innovative ways. These initiatives will transform railway stations from transportation hubs into platforms for 'connected lifestyles.' By extending the scope of JRE POINT and building connections with the lifestyles of our customers and the residents of line-side areas, we will enrich everyday life in the kinds of ways that only we can.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To provide high-quality services, meet customer expectations, and become a corporate group that is trusted by customers, we will add to the services that we have already realized and continue creating new value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSTEP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## Service Quality Reforms to Date\n\nSince the establishment of JR East, all Group employees have made a concerted effort to reform the quality of transportation and services. Thanks to these efforts, we have achieved steady improvement in service quality in such areas as transportation reliability, ability to respond to emergencies, initiatives for an inclusive society, and multilingual compatibility.\n\n## Initiatives Aimed at Creating a Comfortable Environment for Passengers\n\nIn addition to initiatives to provide information on the status of train services and improve convenience for customers with disabilities, we are enhancing passenger comfort by offering information on congestion at railway stations and in railcars to help customers avoid congestion and complete their journeys unimpeded.\n\n## A color LCD at Tokyo Station\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Free space on E235 Series train\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making congestion at railway stations visible\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Real-time train congestion information\n\nSTEP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Toward a New Stage in Service Quality Reforms\n\nChanges in society stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic are having a major impact on the Group's management base, and responding to new challenges is an urgent task.\n\nWith this in mind, we have launched the Vision for Service Quality Reforms 2027. Rather than treating Transportation, Life-style, and IT & Suica services in isolation, the vision calls for the creation of new value through coordination among business areas and optimization of the Group as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating New Value-Enhancing Services through Kodo\n\nThe Vision for Service Quality Reforms 2027 uses the Japanese word kodo as shorthand for an approach to service provision in which Group employees think and act on their own initiative. More specifically, we will encourage each employee to adopt a thoroughly customer-oriented viewpoint as they take steps to improve services and realize their individual potential. By putting kodo into practice, each employee will meet the expectations of customers and make the JR East Group a trusted company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## An Example of Kodo : Measures for Customers Who Become Unwell\n\nThe JR East Health Promotion Center supports overall health management, through checkups and a range of consultation services, so that our employees can work with peace of mind. The center recently received an inquiry from station personnel asking if it would be possible to provide more effective assistance to customers who suddenly fall ill. In response, the center and related departments worked together to make a training video that explains key points for dealing with customers who become unwell. Station personnel with confidence in their ability to assist unwell customers will be able to respond to them swiftly and appropriately. Furthermore, having these skills in-house will help us to resume operations faster. Going forward we will continue helping to improve service quality throughout the Group from a health management perspective.\n\nJR East Health Promotion Center\n\n<!-- image -->",

To further reduce potential risk, JR East is committed to steadily improving tangible countermeasures and also to ensure that each one of its employees takes all possible intangible measures. Our quest to ensure safety is never over. The JR East Group will continue to work together to take on the constant challenge of improving safety.\n\n## General principles of safety\n\nJR East has prescribed General Principles of Safety in the code of conduct for its safety-related employees.\n\n- I. Safety is the most important mission in transportation.\n- II.   Ensuring safety is based on exact observance of rules and procedures, and is achieved through constant practice.\n- III.  Enforcement of confirmation and complete contact is most important for ensuring safety.\n- IV.  For ensuring safety, we should cooperate together and go beyond our official responsibility.\n- V.   When we have questions or must choose among several options, we should remain calm, think by ourselves, and take the safest course after thorough consideration.\n\n## CONTENTS\n\n| Our Fundamental Concept of Safety .................. 26     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| JR East's Safety Management Organization ...... 28          |\n| Efforts to Further Improve Safety Levels ............ 30    |\n| Current Safety Record of JR East ....................... 39 |\n\n## Group Safety Plan 2023\n\nSince our establishment, JR East has been implementing a series of 5-year safety plans. In November 2018, we formulated Group Safety Plan 2023, which is our 7th safety plan. Together with JR East Group companies, partner companies, and affiliated companies, JR East as a whole group will aim for 'Ultimate Safety Levels' starting with the 'Safety Actions' of each person.\n\nJR East 'Group Safety Plan 2023' consists of two building blocks: 'Evolution' and 'Move Up', which are based on 3 Pillars: 1 Evolution and moving up of each person's 'safety actions', 2 Evolution and moving up of 'safety management', and 3  Maintenance of safety equipment by actively utilizing new technologies. In consideration of rapid environmental changes both within and outside the Group, we will take specific measures to properly respond to these changes.\n\n## Further evolution of our safety culture\n\nThe safety culture, which JR East Group has continually placed great value on, including the '5 Cultures,' the 'CS (Challenge Safety) Activity,' and the 'Three Actualities Principle,' is the foundation of various safety initiatives.\n\n## Stop the train if we feel something is dangerous\n\nSafe and stable transport is important for our railways. Safety means protecting lives, while stability means ensuring the on-time operation of our trains. However, although stable transport is important for us, safety comes first. Trying too hard to keep to schedule sometimes results in not properly following safety confirmation procedures, which leads to risking the safety of train operations.\n\nTo secure the safety of our railway operations, the whole JR East Group will always follow our firm code of conduct to 'Stop the train if we feel something is dangerous.'\n\nOverview of 'Group Safety Plan 2023'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup companies, partner companies, and affiliated companies join together\n\n## Aiming for 'Ultimate Safety Levels' Starting with the 'Safety Actions' of Each Person\n\n## Basic concepts\n\n- Bring out the strengths of each employee\n- Actively promote and deploy technological innovations\n- Place greater focus on safety measures and accident prevention measures for platforms, level crossings, disasters\n\n## 'Ultimate Safety Levels'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Conditions' that should be pursued continually\n\nZero accidents involving passenger injuries or fatalities and zero accidents involving employee fatalities*\n\n*  Includes all people involved with railway-related work, including JR East, Group companies, and partner companies\n\nNumerical targets are compared to FY2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  Train accidents (train collisions, derailments, train fire), Accidents at rail crossings, Fatalities or injuries, and Physical damage to property\n\nFor more information, please see: https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/data/pdf/group\\_safety\\_plan.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further ingraining the 5 Cultures\n\nA culture of proper\n\nreporting\n\n## A culture of noticing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA culture of direct\n\nconfrontation and debate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A culture of learning\n\nA culture of action\n\nSafety can be ensured only by taking safe actions.

        "page_content": "Our Fundamental Concept of Safety\n\n## CS (Challenge Safety) Activity\n\nWe encourage all employees to be autonomous (take the initiative) in taking charge of safety, and we promote initiatives to share in safety-related deliberation in the workplace.\n\nThrough our CS Activity, we aim to change our emphasis from 'reactive safety' to 'proactive safety', such that each employee thinks about safety and acts autonomously. We cultivate a culture of ongoing efforts to enhance safety, where individual employees are aware of safety, and where field sites, branch offices and the head office, are united in the process of discussing safety and formulating safety measures.\n\nTo share information useful to these activities, we periodically publish a safety newsletter, ' Challenge Safety Aoshingo .'\n\n## The 'Three Actualities Principle'\n\nAccidents and incidents always occur at the Genba *. This means that the sources of accident prevention can also be found at the Genba .\n\nJR East Group continues to search for answers which cannot be found on paper, using on the 'Three Actualities Principle' as its standard for action: actual locations, actual objects, and actual people. * Genba : ' Genba ' means actual locations, objects, and people directly related to the safety of our operations including points of contact with our customers and fields or workplaces of transport or services.\n\n## Actual locations:\n\nVisiting actual locations to understand actual conditions\n\n## Actual objects:\n\nViewing actual objects (rolling stock, equipment, machinery, tools, etc.) in order to understand actual conditions\n\n## Initiatives to emphasize from here on\n\nVisit field sites regularly and make exhaustive efforts to discover risks\n\nRather than simply going to field sites, also take the initiative to connect them to actions\n\n## Initiatives which have been ingrained up to now\n\nVisit field sites\n\n- \u00b7  Propose measures to prevent accidents and undesirable events\n- \u00b7  Instill the tragedy and danger of accidents into us\n\n## Facilitate understanding of the 'Essence of Work'\n\nTo properly respond to large environmental changes, rather than merely learning the procedures and methods of work, we must be conscious of the '7 Guidelines' which include the purposes of work, the origins of rules, and the operating principles of equipment, to deepen our understanding of the 'Essence of Work.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JR East's Safety Management Organization\n\n## Safety management regulations\n\nIn response to a revision of the Railway Business Act, JR East formulated its safety management regulations in October 2006. These stipulate various safety management-related matters such as the responsibilities of top management executives in ensuring the safety of operations and on organizational matters and the selection of chief safety management officers, operation managers, and train crew training managers. To ensure transportation safety, we have built a system to promote operations centered on safety management officers and involving executives responsible for safety through to front-line staff.\n\nIn April 2019, we established the Shinkansen General Management Department to integrate and specialize in managing Shinkansenrelated operations.\n\n## Structures to Promote Safety Measures\n\nIn 1987, we established the Railway Safety Promotion Committee, chaired by the director general of The Railway Operations Headquarters, at Head Office. This committee aims to enhance railway safety and prevent accidents by elucidating the causes of major accidents, formulating measures to prevent recurrence, and determining and promoting measures for safety-related equipment and rolling stock.\n\nWe also have Regional Safety Promotion Committees, which are chaired by the heads of the Shinkansen General Management Department, branch offices, and construction offices. These committees enhance railway safety at branch offices and seek to prevent accidents. They also liaise with the Railway Safety Promotion Committee to conduct specific measures.\n\n## Actual people:\n\nMeeting face to face with people involved to understand actual situations\n\nFurther evolution of the 'Three Actualities Principle'\n\n## JR East's Safety Management Organization\n\n## Management structure for transport safety\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1 Chief safety management officer\n\nSelected from the Director General of Railway Operations Headquarters or its equivalent.\n\n## 2 Operations manager\n\nSelected from the General Manager of Transport & Rolling Stock Dept., General Managers of Shinkansen Transport & Rolling Stock Dept. or their equivalent.\n\n## Rules for reporting accidents and incidents\n\n## Investment in safety facilities\n\nWe endeavor to accurately understand accidents and incidents, analyze their causes, and implement measures to prevent them from occurring and recurring. To this end, we work to further enhance safety through accident reporting and by establishing rules pertaining to classes of accidents.\n\nJR East has invested more than \u00a54.7 trillion in safety since its establishment. In its Group Safety Plan 2023, JR East plans to invest approximately \u00a51.2 trillion in safety measures during the five years from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024. We will continue to focus on putting safety facilities in place. At the same time, we will more actively embrace new technologies and respond to new risks.\n\n## Railway accidents\n\n\u00b7 Train accidents: Collisions, derailments, and fires \u00b7 Level crossing accidents   \u00b7 Railway accidents with casualty \u00b7 Railway accidents with material damages\n\n## Incidents requiring attention\n\n\u00b7  Events with possible risks of fatalities or injuries to customers / employees\n\nIncidents requiring a report \u00b7  Events resulting from a failure in handling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Near misses\n\n\u00b7  Event that could lead to a failure in handling\n\nThorough analysis and\n\ncountermeasures\n\nPreventing reoccurrences\n\nby utilizing 4M4E analysis\n\nand other tools\n\nActive uncovering of\n\nMy Hiyatto event\n\n## Trends in safety investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3  Train crew training manager\n\nSelected from the Manager of Drivers & Conductors Depots.",

This facility provides opportunities for all employees to learn about and reflect on the tragedies of past accidents and the major social responsibility railways bear. In October 2018, we expanded the Accident History Exhibition Hall and placed on exhibit the rolling stock involved in a 2014 accident involving a derailed Keihin-Tohoku Line train at Kawasaki Station, as well as a road-rail vehicle. We also opened the Interactive Learning Hall to encourage consideration from various perspectives of the train derailment accidents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccident History Exhibition Hall\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting the use of educational and training facilities\n\nAs one aspect of its efforts toward training personnel to respond to environmental change, JR East is promoting the establishment of educational and training facilities that facilitate an understanding of the 'essence of work.'\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2020, we had installed crew training simulators at all transportation-related workplaces. We also opened the Shinkansen Education and Training Center with the aim of teaching staff about the specific rules and mechanisms of the Shinkansen through the use of related equipment.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe division of work continues between JR East and Group companies. In order to improve safety, however, we must have the same sense of values. We built JES-Net (JR East Safety Network), and 39 companies have now joined it. JES-Net\n\nConfirmation of the work by JES-Net\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncarries out checks that safety works have been carried out correctly, facilitates the exchange of opinions, and works to solve problems and improve safety levels across JES-Net.\n\n## Safety measures for train operation and maintenance work\n\nIn addition, at each branch office we have educational facilities for learning about major incidents and accidents that occurred within that branch office's jurisdiction, looking at preceding events and countermeasures. We are promoting better safety awareness among all employees of JR East, Group companies, and partner companies to achieve 'ultimate safety levels'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCrew member simulator bringing the training experience to life using actual video\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTakasaki Branch Office, Safety Learning Center-Kokku Benrei Sha\n\n## Development of personnel responsible for safety\n\nWe are responding to the rapid transition to the next generation of employees by moving forward on a variety of initiatives that emphasizes cultivating employees that put safety at the core.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety Storytellers (Narrators of Oral History)\n\nTo educate employees who can share and pass on safety-related knowledge, leadership, and technological capabilities within the Company, we have appointed highly experienced and\n\nSafety Storyteller swearing-in ceremony\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnologically capable personnel\n\nin various specialized fields as Safety Storytellers (Narrators of Oral History).\n\n## The Railway Safety Symposium\n\nTo further enhance rail safety, each year we hold the Railway Safety Symposium.

Realizing that this problem could happen in our workplace too, we developed a device that uses sound and light to alert personnel if a hose has not been put away correctly. The device is solar powered, and was developed in collaboration with a number of employees.\n\nThe filth extraction hose connecting with the train and the device we developed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJR Morioka Railway Service Co., Ltd.

        "page_content": "## Efforts to Further Improve Safety Levels\n\n## Driving restriction notification system\n\nIf observed values exceed specified limits at times of heavy rain or strong winds, train speeds are restricted to ensure safety. In the past, the dispatcher transmitted the restrictions to the driver by wireless, but in September 2019, we introduced an automated notification system, thereby helping prevent human error.\n\n## Image diagram\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving the safety of maintenance work\n\nDuring track maintenance work, we ensure the safety of workers by using a track closure procedure, which prevents trains from entering the area during the work.\n\nThis involves meetings between the person in charge of the works and the person in charge of managing train operations. Recognizing the possibility of human error in communication between people, from December 2020 we introduced a system that closes the track in advance in a predetermined section for a particular period  of time. Staff working on the track enter and leave using the system. This eliminates the need for meetings on the day of work, reduces human error during communications, and eliminates complicated procedures to improve safety.\n\n## Image diagram\n\nSystem-based railway entry / exit procedures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shinkansen safety measures\n\n## Preparedness against natural disaster\n\nIn April 2019, we established the Shinkansen General Management Department as a new department for the centralized and dedicated control of Shinkansen-related measures. Through this department, we aim to strengthen our response to and management of unknown risks, training of Shinkansen specialists, maintenance and enhancement of unique technologies, and rapid decision-making.\n\nIn terms of Shinkansen-related safety measures, we are steadily implementing seismic retrofitting of viaduct columns and piers, and installing equipment to prevent rails from overturning. We have installed a trolley snow melting system at Okama Station on the Tazawako Line to reduce the amount of snow brought in on high-speed sections of the Komachi service . We have also built a full-scale simulator facility in preparation for large-scale renovation of the Shinkansen. In the future, we will promote technological progress in areas such as the development of repair materials and the mechanization of work.\n\nFurthermore, we are conducting various types of test runs using the ALFA-X test railcar, which is under development with a view to realizing the next-generation Shinkansen.\n\nFull-scale training simulator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe ALFA-X, a type E956 Shinkansen test railcar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction of Shinkansen operating regulations in response to abnormal weather\n\nOur Shinkansen network has a structure that is relatively resistant to rainfall, with a high proportion of bridges, viaducts and tunnels. However, in response to the unusually heavy rainfall observed in recent years, in order to ensure safe transportation, we have introduced new rules that require the Shinkansen to stop temporarily when it is raining heavily, until confirmation is received that it is safe to continue. With this system, instead of installing additional rain gauges along the railway tracks, we have adopted 'analytical rainfall', which is calculated by correcting the observed data from weather radar owned by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) with rain gauge data from all over Japan. The amount of rainfall in 1 km-square areas along the railway line can be confirmed precisely, making it possible to identify the places\n\nwhere it is raining heavily. Sections to inspect can be defined in detail, which we expect to reduce the time required for inspections. We will continue to review these rules while monitoring the status of rainfall and equipment.\n\nShinkansen General Management Department\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our measures against earthquakes\n\nSeismic reinforcement measures\n\nSince 1993, we have been enacting measures to prevent bridge collapses and to seismically reinforce elevated railway track pillars and bridge piers. Since fiscal 2013, following the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have proceeded with measures on sections identified as high priority. Based on knowledge gained from leading-edge earthquake research, in fiscal 2018 we expanded the countermeasure area and began new reinforcement measures targeting Shinkansen girder seams. The Fukushima Prefecture Offshore earthquake on February 13, 2021, caused damage to utility poles in particular, and we have been working to review countermeasure priorities and improve reinforcement methods. In addition, we are implementing new measures for  facilities that would severely impact transportation in the event of a disaster.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeismic reinforcement of elevated railway tracks Structural reinforcement of utility poles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Emergency train stopping measures\n\nWe are constructing systems to ensure that high-speed trains can stop as quickly as possible in the event of an earthquake. For the Shinkansen, we have installed seismographs along our railway lines, in coastal areas and inland, to provide early warnings of even minor movements. In addition, we employ earthquake early warnings from the Japan Meteorological Agency and underwater seismograph information from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience in our Shinkansen early-stage earthquake warning system.\n\nUsing the seismic information provided by this Shinkansen system, we have also installed an early earthquake warning system on conventional lines to provide emergency stop notification if large-scale earthquakes are observed.\n\nMeasures to prevent derailment on Shinkansen lines We have measures in place to prevent Shinkansen trains from departing from their path of travel even in the event of derailment due to an earthquake.\n\n## L-shaped car guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nL-shaped car guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nL-shaped car guide\n\n## Preventing breaks at glued insulated joints\n\nRail rollover prevention devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General emergency drills\n\nEvery year, we conduct a comprehensive disaster-preparedness drill, assuming an earthquake has struck. These drills are timed around disaster prevention week, which includes September 1. Training includes countermeasure headquarters operational drills, rescue/ lifesaving training, and training on evacuation guidance. We conduct such training in cooperation with local government agencies.\n\nDrills to operate an on-site disaster countermeasure headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrill to rescue passengers with firefighters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Preparing rescue kits and first aid kits\n\nIn the case of an earthquake with an epicenter directly beneath the Tokyo metropolitan area, many passengers could be injured and we might need to save the lives of passengers with the help of a limited number of our employees. For a major earthquake, JR East has prepared first aid kits and is also conducting drills to give personnel the necessary first aid skills.\n\nJR East Japan rescue/lifesaving course\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRescue kits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures against tsunami\n\nBefore the Great East Japan Earthquake, we had set operational restriction methods and tsunami danger zones for each location, prepared manuals, and were holding study sessions and conducting drills on guiding passengers to alight from trains for evacuation. We believe that these efforts led to the prompt evacuation of passengers away from tsunami danger zones at the time of the earthquake.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrill to guide passengers to alight from a train for evacuation\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Efforts to Further Improve Safety Levels\n\nFormulating action guidelines for evacuation to avoid tsunamis To prepare for a case when there is no time before the arrival of a tsunami, JR East formulated action guidelines for evacuation during tsunamis for each one of its employees to follow in January 2012.\n\n## Action guidelines for evacuation to avoid tsunamis\n\n- 1.  At a time of a large earthquake, be prepared for tsunamis. Gather information by yourselves and if communication lines are disconnected, make your own decisions for evacuation. (Do not be afraid to make a mistake.)\n- 2.  Once decided to evacuate, by judging the conditions of customers, promptly guide customers to evacuate.\n- 3.  In alighting from trains, evacuating and gathering information, ask customers and local people to cooperate.\n- 4.  Even after evacuation, go to a higher place without being satisfied and thinking this would be high enough.\n- 5.  Stay evacuated with customers and do not return to field offices or trains while tsunami warnings are still issued.\n\n## Tsunami evacuation navigation system\n\nLearning from the tsunami evacuation at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have developed and introduced tools to help crew on operating trains to guide passenger evacuations in unfamiliar locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures for rainfall\n\nTo prevent landslides due to rainfall, JR East takes disaster prevention measures for wayside embankments in all railway sections in accordance with its plans. Especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area and for all Shinkansen routes, we take thorough measures to secure safe and stable transport.\n\nCutting slope protection (spray framework)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmbankment slope protection (spray framework)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives to address flooding\n\nWe have been working to enhance flood-response measures, having suffered significant damage from Typhoon No. 19 (Hagibis) in October 2019, when overflowing rivers caused damage to railcars on the Hokuriku Shinkansen.\n\nFor railway facilities, we have been setting priorities for each facility and implementing hardware measures. In addition, utilizing hazard maps, we have introduced a 'Vehicle Evacuation Judgment Support System' at rail yards where there is a risk of flooding, to promptly evacuate vehicles in the event of a disaster. With this system, we have developed indicators to support decisions on vehicle evacuation, and when each indicator reaches the set value, an alarm sounds to notify the people concerned.\n\nVehicle Evacuation Judgment Support System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*  Evacuation of railcars judged based on comprehensive consideration of the system and general meteorological information\n\n## Indicators to aid decisions about evacuating railcars\n\n## River Water Levels\n\nRiver water level\n\nnear rail yards\n\n## Basin Rainfall Index\n\nIndicator quantifying the potential for river flooding near rail yards\n\n## Basin rainfall\n\nAmount of rainfall within the river basin upstream of rail yards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJapan Meteorological Agency indicator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmount of rainfall\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote:  We determine the level of urgency of flood disasters by comparing the basin rainfall index publicized by the Japan Meteorological Agency with flood warnings and other standard values.\n\nRiver basin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote:  In addition to these indicators, we use general meteorological information to make a comprehensive decision on railcar evacuation.\n\n## Protecting against strong winds and gusts\n\nSince a train accident on the Uetsu Main Line in December 2005, we have introduced the major wind-related initiatives described below.\n\n## Increased number of anemometers (wind meters)\n\nWe typically install multiple anemometers on sections where windbased operating restrictions are in effect. We have also increased the number of anemometers in locations where windbreaks have been installed. To ensure accuracy, we are also moving toward the installation of dual anemometers.\n\nInstallation of windbreak fences We install windbreaks to protect railcars from the wind.\n\nExpanded introduction of the gale warning system With this system, operations are halted if the values measured by\n\nUetsu Main Line, between Sagoshi and Kita-Amarume\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nanemometers exceed regulation levels. Wind speed regulations also call for the halting of operations if the maximum predicted wind speed a short time in the future is expected to exceed regulation levels, based on measured values on a time axis. We have installed this system on all sections of conventional lines where wind restrictions are in place.\n\nUtilizing meteorological information for operation control We have developed a method to restrict operations using meteorological information, such as rain intensity measured by the Japan Meteorological Agency's weather radar and the agency's 'nowcasts' on the likelihood of tornadoes, to predict gusts of wind that could be generated by cumulonimbus clouds. We are currently using this system along sections on the Sea of Japan during winter.\n\nDisplay of operation control area\n\nusing meteorological information (image)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperation control method against wind gusts using Doppler radar\n\nWe have collaborated with the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) of the Japan Meteorological Agency on a system that detects vortexes by using Doppler radar to measure the movement of raindrops in the air, and sounds an alarm if these vortexes come near train lines. We have put in place operating restrictions using this system in winter on the Uetsu Main Line and sections of the Rikuu West Line. Since the start of operations in 2017, we have conducted further joint research with the MRI to expand the range of observations used to regulate operations and to commercialize AI-based methods for detecting gusts of wind.\n\nDoppler radar installed at Kuromori, Sakata\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperation control method against wind gusts using Doppler radar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety measures at level crossings\n\nWe are working to reduce accidents on roads that cross railways.\n\n## Our efforts to eliminate level crossings\n\nOur principal measure for preventing accidents at level crossings is to eliminate such crossings. We are working with people in local communities to elevate, consolidate, and eliminate tracks. Where eliminating level crossings is difficult, such as for Class 3 and Class 4 crossings, we are converting them to Class 1 crossings.\n\nNo. of level crossings eliminated over past five years (including those transferred to third-sector operators)\n\nChanges to the number of level crossings (as of April 1)\n\n| FY        |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |\n|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Reduction |     42 |     19 |     67 |    101 |     18 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClass 1: With alarms and crossing gates\n\nClass 3: With alarms\n\nClass 4: Without alarms and crossing gates",

We began installing these devices in fiscal 2020 and are steadily increasing their number.\n\nIncreasing the Level of Sophistication of Obstacle Detectors with 3D Laser Radar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Function for detecting fallen objects\n\nIn the past, devices did not detect objects in certain areas to avoid oversensitivity, such as detecting small animals. We overcame this shortcoming by adding a function that broadens the detection area around the object in question.\n\n## Noise removal function\n\nWe added a function to reduce false positives for floating objects such as snowfall.\n\n## No. of locations of 3D laser radar obstacle detectors (as of March 31)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Installing omnidirectional warning lights\n\nRegarding level crossing warning lights to notify the approaching of a train, we are replacing conventional warning lights with omnidirectional warning lights so that they can be easily detected by elderly people with lower sight lines and automobile drivers who enter level crossings from roads.\n\n## Conventional warning light\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Can be detected from limited directions.\n\nOmnidirectional warning light\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Level crossing for easier passage\n\nBased on the Act on Promotion of Level Crossings, we are elevating and widening roads at level crossings designated for improvement. In addition, where necessary we are using colored pavements or adopting other approaches for roads that cross railways such as building pedestrian overpasses, and making improvements as dictated by local conditions.\n\nIn cooperation with road administrators, we are increasing the width of level crossings and separating crossings for pedestrians from those for automobiles by changing the colors of the roads and walkways.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInitiatives involving Class 4 level crossings\n\nClass 4 level crossings are not equipped with alarms or crossing gates. We are working with local communities to eliminate such crossings or upgrade them to Class 1 level crossings. In addition, as another measure to prevent accidents at level crossings we are erecting signs\n\nClass 4 level crossing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncalling for caution and erecting whistle boards to warn people at crossings of approaching trains.\n\n## Can be detected from all directions.\n\n## Safety measures at platforms\n\nTo prevent accidents involving customers falling from platforms or coming into contact with trains, we are installing platform doors. By the end of fiscal 2021, we completed the installation of platform doors at 61 stations (a total of 72 stations* by line) mainly on the Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Negishi lines.\n\nGoing forward, we plan to proactively deploy newly developed Smart Platform Doors. As a result, by around the end of fiscal 2033 we plan to have installed platform doors at all stations on the major conventional lines in the Tokyo metropolitan area (330 stations by line, including the 243 stations where we have completed the installation to date).\n\n* No. of stations is counted by line, e.g., Yurakucho Station is counted as two stations, one for the Yamanote Line and one for the Keihin Tohoku Line.\n\nRailway lines where platform doors are scheduled for installation by the end of FY2033 (as of March 2018)\n\nStations where platform doors are installed or scheduled for installation in FY2022 (as of April 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Stations where platform doors are in place\n- Scheduled for installation by the end of FY2021\n- Stations to be upgraded from FY2022\n\n* Trial introduction stations",

Through these efforts we aim to continue to meet the expectations of our customers and contribute to society as a trusted corporate group.\n\n## Implementing measures such as bringing forward the last train time\n\nTo help ensure that railways continue to contribute to society in the future, in March 2021, we brought forward the last train time on major lines, mainly within a 100 km radius of Tokyo. This will allow us to promote changes in how people structure their working lives and increase the amount of time available for maintenance work, thereby speeding up the installation and maintenance of platform doors and other railway equipment. Through these efforts we aim to improve the safety and reliability of our transportation and services.\n\n## Expanding the rail network and shortening travel times\n\nWith the March 2021 timetable revisions, we also introduced a new maximum speed of 130 km/h between Ueno and Omiya to shorten traveling times. By increasing the speed of the J \u014d etsu and T \u014d hoku Shinkansen lines, constructing the Yamagata Shinkansen approach line to Fukushima Station, and extending the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Tsuruga, we are improving accessibility between Tokyo and rural areas, thereby creating significant benefits for regional economies. In addition, the Haneda Airport Access Line (provisional name)  received a railway business license from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) in January 2021, and we will move forward with plans to start construction.\n\n| CONTENTS                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Relationship with Customers .............................. 40      |\n| Promoting Innovation .......................................... 50 |\n| Relationship with Society .................................... 52  |\n| Relationship with Employees  ............................. 60      |\n\n## Changes in travel times (Compared with 1987)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  Tokyo to Hakodate segment's top line shows time required after schedules were\n- revised in March 1988 (when the Seikan Tunnel was opened)\n- *  The shortened time between Tokyo and Hakodate is as a result of the time saved by high speed travel through the Seikan Tunnel.\n\n## Initiatives to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe JR East Group is taking measures to ensure that customers can use railways with peace of mind in accordance with the government's 'Guidelines for Railway Operators to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19.'\n\nIn addition to regular disinfection and sterilization at stations and the wearing of masks by staff, disinfection and sterilization are carried out inside trains, and train windows are opened for ventilation. Moreover, our JR East App provides information on congestion, and we are working on providing reserved seats with more space between seats, seat selection using seat maps, and clarifying the language on signs displayed on the floors of train carriages.\n\n## Constant attention to passenger comments\n\n## Collection and analysis of customer opinions\n\nWe collect and analyze customer opinions on a daily basis in order to understand the concerns and frustrations of our customers and to respond to them promptly.\n\nWe are endeavoring to collect passenger comments, including those which are received by our employees directly from passengers. We collect approximately 200,000 customer comments a year including those posted on the internet or given over the telephone, in addition to direct feedback received by staff from customers. These comments are promptly shared and analyzed via a Companywide database, New Green Information System.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, about half of the comments were related to such matters as station operations, facilities, and ticket systems.\n\n## Itemized breakdown of passenger comments in FY2021 (Total number of comments 216,104)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Utilization of social media\n\nOne way we learn about passengers' needs is through the feedback they provide directly to us. We also recognize the need to actively gather and analyze passenger feedback from a range of other sources. To this end, we foster communications with customers through our official Facebook and Twitter pages. We proactively send out information about various measures and campaigns, while working to understand customer needs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand opinions through 'Like!' responses and other customer postings.\n\n## Service quality 'Yokusuru Project'\n\nUsing posters, videos, and other media, we provide customers with employee insights on our policies and actions to improve the quality of our services.

In addition, when the T \u014d hoku Shinkansen could\n\nTransportation Group, JR Bus Tohoku Sales Department\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnot operate, we set up an emergency task force to respond to the situation. With the cooperation of group companies and partners, we were able to maximize alternative transportation to the Shinkansen, which was used by more than 10,000 passengers. Through cooperation with the national and local governments and collaboration with related companies, we used the experience we gained from the Great East Japan Earthquake to ensure a smooth response by JR East as a train company. Building on this experience, we will all continue to work to ensure that we can respond more flexibly in times of emergency.\n\nSeeing things from a customer point of view, we provide information to help people make quick, appropriate decisions about transportation.\n\n## Information enhancement\n\nWe share details about train operation and other useful information with our customers through various media. We also provide information to foreign customers in multiple languages.\n\n## Web services\n\n## Our website 'DOKOTORE'\n\nIn the event of transport disruptions, we provide information on the operation of trains and the cancellation of limited express trains on conventional lines.

We will continue to provide information promptly to help customers make decisions on their next moves.\n\n## Planned suspension of operations\n\nPlanned suspensions are implemented to minimize damage and transport disruptions by adjusting the number of trains operated in advance, when weather conditions and other factors are expected to have a significant impact on passengers due to prolonged suspensions or major delays.\n\nIn the case of typhoons, we make comprehensive assessments of the typhoon's path and magnitude, and provide information to customers and employees from an early stage using a variety of media (internet, emergency information displays, social media, etc.) to help them decide what to do. Once inspections and restoration work are completed, we review the specific operation resumption plan and announce the operation schedule to customers.\n\n## Customer services attentative to customer needs\n\nWe are striving to further improve the mindsets and skills of the entire Group by accurately understanding the kinds of situations that develop, the reactions of our customers, and how to respond to them appropriately.\n\n## Assistance and Support campaign\n\nTo help realize a harmonious society, we are working with transportation companies and organizations for people with disabilities throughout Japan. Initiatives include calling out to all customers, including those\n\nwith disabilities, who need assistance, and asking for the cooperation of all customers using our rail services.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, a drive to strengthen the Assistance and Support campaign was conducted in collaboration with 83 company bureaus and seven organizations. We intend to take the lead in creating an environment where all customers can live safely and with peace of mind by nurturing a culture that supports customers in need throughout society.\n\nAssistance and Support campaign poster\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ensuring that Help Mark customers can use our services with peace of mind\n\nThe Help Mark was created by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in order to make it easier for people with 'invisible disabilities' who need assistance or care to get help by making people around them aware of their situatiion. To make it easier for customers who use the Help Mark to use the train, we have put up posters at stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area to inform people about the Help Mark, and we have also put up Help Mark stickers near priority seats on conventional trains.\n\n## Improving passenger service\n\nWe use the Green Handbook, which sets out the concepts necessary for our company's services and the basics of hospitality required of employees, at workplace study sessions in an effort to enhance passenger service among all employees.\n\nGreen Handbook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquiring Service Care-Fitter Qualifications\n\nWe encourage our staff to acquire qualifications aligned with the 'spirit of hospitality and assistance skills' to help them assist our customers and ensure that they can use our services with peace of mind.

As of the end of March 2021, we had completed the installation of equipment in 521 stations.\n\n## Upgrading environments for people in wheelchairs\n\nTo narrow the gap between station platforms and railcar doors, we are installing platform doors equipped with slopes that lift up when trains arrive. To reduce the gap between the train and the platform, comb-shaped materials have been installed at each end of the platforms (two per platform) at some stations on the Yamanote Line, the Keihin-Tohoku/Negishi Line, and the Ch \u016b\u014dS \u014d bu Local Line. At\n\nsome stations on the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku/Negishi lines, we are reducing wait times at train stations for customers who prefer to get off the train on their own by eliminating the need to contact stations where they will disembark.\n\nComb-shaped sections\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Barrier-free railcars\n\nIn order to provide a safe and comfortable ride for wheelchair and baby carriage users, we have added priority seating in every carriage of the new E235 Series commuter trains that have been introduced on the Yamanote Line and the Sobu-Yokosuka Rapid Line. In addition, free spaces have been installed in all E235 railcars .\n\nFrom July 2021, a portion of Hokuriku Shinkansen trains are equipped with free spaces for wheelchairs in accordance with the revised standards for facilitating public transport based on the Transportation Accessibility Improvement Act.\n\nWe have also installed multi-purpose rooms and large toilets with improved handles for electric wheelchairs in the new E259 limited express trains and  post-E5 series Shinkansen trains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE7 Series Shinkansen free space for wheelchairs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE7 Series Shinkansen large toilet\n\nMulti-purpose room for E7 Series Shinkansen\n\n## App to alert personnel to passengers boarding and exiting\n\nWe have developed an app to automatically notify stations and railcar attendants when passengers in wheelchairs request assistance with boarding and disembarking from trains. We introduced the system on the Nambu Line in March 2020, the Keiyo Line in November 2020, and on the Yamanote Line in March 2021.

Furthermore, in cooperation with police and other railway operators we are actively conducting a campaign to eliminate molestation on trains, strengthening surveillance on trains and in stations and calling for the prevention of molestation, so that passengers can use our services with greater safety and peace of mind. These are some of the ways in which we are working to make our services safer and more secure for all.\n\n## Addressing measures to reduce congestion in the morning commuter rush hours\n\nWe have implemented a range of initiatives to spread out our customers' boarding times and promote off-peak commuting. Since congestion is one of the causes of delays during morning commuting, we have been notifying passengers of congestion trends for trains and road traffic using apps and posters displayed at stations on some lines. At stations where congestion is particularly high, we have established designated queuing areas and no-stopping zones to ensure the smooth flow of passengers. We also launched the Off Peak Point Service , which rewards passenger with JRE POINT s for staggered commuting on weekday mornings using Suica commuter passes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQueuing lines on the platform\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## System to respond to inquiries\n\nOur contact center fields several thousand inquiries each day.

In the planning department, meanwhile, I am in charge of etiquette management, and the feedback I receive and the feelings I experience while interacting with customers allow me to recognize issues and provide important insights for the implementation of measures.\n\n## Confirming results and making improvements\n\n## Identifying issues and using service quality diagnosis to confirm the effectiveness of measures\n\nWe provide a wide range of services and we believe it is important to analyze whether they meet our customers' needs. We therefore conduct service quality diagnosis to gain a quantitative understanding of the overall evaluation of our transportation services and levels of customer satisfaction, and to further improve the quality of our services for our customers. In light of changes in the social environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are conducting analysis that includes changes in customer needs and the implications for evaluations of the company.\n\nThe results of the diagnosis are used as a 'Service Quality Diagnosis Chart' to understand the results for each branch office. In fiscal 2021, 11 out of 12 branches improved their evaluations compared to fiscal 2020. By analyzing the results by branch office, we are able to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each region and reflect them in our regional goals and measures.",

In the future, we will\n\nposition Joi-Connect365 as a core device for total communication, including employees who are away from our business offices on childcare leave, or for other reasons, to enhance job satisfaction for our employees.\n\n## GNSS wireless railway crossing control system\n\nJR East is developing a new GNSS wireless railway crossing control system for rural line crossings that uses satellite position data technology and common wireless technology. By using satellites to pinpoint the location of trains and common wireless technology to transmit data, we aim to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs for railway crossing equipment.\n\n## Accelerating digital transformation (DX) through collaboration between railway operations facilities and planning departments\n\nThe JR East Group is promoting initiatives to improve the level of safe and reliable transport using the latest technology.\n\nThe Sendai Transport District, where I work, collaborated with the Technology Innovation Headquarters to develop technology for an application to support crew members in their driving duties. By including IT companies outside the company in the system and sharing roles through agile development, we were able to complete the application just three months after being set the task.\n\nSince then, we have continued to enhance its functions from the user's point of view, and we are now using this application in\n\nour work. We will continue to develop this approach not only in our own workplace but also across the Company, in order to improve the level of safe and reliable transport in the Group and to further reform our operations utilizing data.\n\nSendai Transportation Depot, Sendai Branch Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to achieve 'smart maintenance' we are installing monitoring devices on commercial trains to observe the status of railway equipment, tracks, and electric power facilities.\n\nFor E235 Series rolling stock, which has railcar equipment with condition monitoring functions installed, JR East has taken a new approach to maintenance: utilizing condition monitoring data. Since June 2018, some scheduled inspections have been replaced with data-driven functional verifications during operations. In addition, some rolling stock allows for the accumulation of condition monitoring data. For this rolling stock, railcar equipment data is analyzed to gain insights about the degradation of equipment and predict serviceable life, and we are looking into the use of such data in future maintenance.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2021, we had installed monitoring equipment on approximately 6,500 km of track, or about 70% of the track in our service area, on a total of 50 lines. By acquiring monitoring data, we are able to carry out preventive maintenance, including implementing timely repairs.\n\nTrack equipment monitoring systems (conventional lines)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe SMART-i dedicated maintenance railcar features Shinkansen track equipment monitoring systems for Shinkansen Lines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Use of digital twin technology and 5G in construction work\n\nWe will promote the improvement of workstyles at construction sites by conducting demonstration tests. Initiatives include using digital twin technology to reproduce the construction site in a virtual space through images and data acquired at the site, and utilizing 5G, which offers high-speed and large-capacity communications, to transmit the data so that quality confirmation and other operations can be performed in real time at offices and other locations far from the site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This new technology and expertise can in turn benefit domestic initiatives as well.

In fiscal 2021, we launched the My Project portal to disseminate information on the best practices of the My Project program to all employees. We are also encouraging employees to develop their skills by providing training based on initiatives by employees in the field, who plan and manage what they want to learn at each site.\n\n## Developing human resources to lead DX\n\nTo promote digital transformation (DX), it is vital to develop human resources who have acquired skills in digital technology (digital human resources) in addition to knowledge of their particular business field.\n\nTo develop digital human resources throughout the company, we are striving to improve the digital literacy of our employees by encouraging them to obtain the IT Passport basic qualification.\n\n## Transferring to the Life Service Department through the open recruitment system\n\nWhen I was engaged in station work, I was acutely aware of the rapid changes in customers' workstyles amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

We employ women in every area of the Company and their average length of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployment is growing. According to our First General Business Owner Action Plan covering the five years starting in 2014, we engaged in initiatives to promote the employment of women, support them in childcare and continued employment, and encourage promotions of women to higher positions. In fiscal 2020, we implemented a revised Second General Business Owner Action Plan, which calls for continuation of our initiatives to promote the employment of women and lengthen the average years of service for women, strengthens measures to support female employees with childcare, and encourages the promotion of female employees to higher positions.

Our current system surpasses the support required by law (three years of childcare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nleave, one year of nursing care leave), including options to take time off, work shorter hours, and work fewer days. Moreover, we are moving forward with changes that will add measures such as granting time off for spouses of those who have recently given birth and the expansion of leave for childcare and nursing care. Also, we have established on-site nurseries in all 12 branch office areas, which provide 24-hour childcare and other support for employees who work irregular hours. We plan to implement training and seminars to promote understanding when it comes to employees working and engaged in childcare or nursing care. We will also sponsor our Work-Life Program at workplaces. The program delivers information about working while juggling childcare or nursing care responsibilities.\n\n## Employing persons with disabilities\n\nWe will continue to create an environment in which employees with disabilities can work actively in various positions in addition to active recruitment. We have about 800 employees with disabilities as of June 2021, and an employment rate of 2.59%, which is above the statutory rate of 2.3%. We will continue our efforts to create a comfortable working environment for employees with disabilities.\n\n## JR East Green Partners Co., Ltd.\n\nJR East Green Partners, a special JR East subsidiary, was started in April 2009 and charged with the task of overall management of uniforms used in JR East.

The system, which has been extended to include JR East and its Group companies, is also designed to ensure personnel training and the passing on of technical knowledge throughout the Group as large\n\nnumbers of employees of Japan's national railways retire at once. As of April 2021, approximately 10,220 employees are enrolled and active as Elder Employees.\n\n## Promoting foreign employees\n\nWe strive to employ the best candidates regardless of nationality. As of April 2021, we employed approximately 90 foreign nationals in a wide range of areas including at stations and on train crews, as well as in the planning department and other areas.\n\nForeign employees representing JR East at an employment fair for students\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives to promote understanding of LGBTQ employees\n\nWe recognize members of the LGBTQ community as an important part of diversity and consider it our duty to create a comfortable work environment free from discrimination.

We have also implemented training and seminars for executives and all Group employees. In addition, in 2017 we added a section on the importance of understanding LGBTQ employees to our Compliance Action Plan Handbook. We strive to educate all employees on these issues every year. Further, for three consecutive years the Company has received a rating of 'Gold' (the highest) on the PRIDE Index, which evaluates companies' LGBTQ initiatives.\n\n## Opening diversity consultation counters\n\nWe are establishing a Diversity Consultation Window offering consultation for our employees on all diversity-related issues.\n\n## Human rights enlightenment\n\nWe have established a human rights enlightenment promotion committee at Head Office, which is working to improve employees' awareness of human rights. In addition, we are striving to establish an inclusive workplace environment for everyone.\n\n## (Concrete measures)\n\n- \u00b7  Implement human rights seminars and study conferences\n- \u00b7  Implement measures to increase thinking about human rights (company reports, creation of a human rights awareness slogan)\n- \u00b7  Exchange information with other corporate members of the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo Corporate Correspondence Society to mutually increase awareness",

We believe a better work-life balance can be attained by reducing the amount of time spent commuting to work and working more efficiently, and using the freed-up time to enhance personal lifestyles. Since 1997, JR East has had a flextime system in place for the corporate planning division and other departments, allowing employees to adopt more flexible work schedules. In 2019, JR East adjusted its systems in view of actual conditions, introducing a flextime system without a core work time alongside the rollout of remote work, while also expanding its satellite offices. In 2020, the Company expanded its flextime system to include construction offices, general rolling stock centers, power plants, and other worksites and we will continue to support diversification of workstyles.\n\n## Expansion of the reemployment support system\n\nSince 1994, we have been implementing a reemployment support system for employees who leave the Company in order to raise children or provide nursing care. This system offers such employees information on job vacancies within the JR East Group. In 2019, we removed eligibility restrictions, making it available to all regardless of the reason cited for leaving the Company, and revised the system to allow us to attract a broad range of human resources who used to work for the Company.\n\n## Improving our work environment\n\n## Health Management Mid-term Vision 2023\n\nThe JR East Group aims to ensure the physical and mental health of all our employees.

The smoking rate among employees at our branch office is significantly higher than the national average, which has negative implications for the health of our staff in the future. We conducted a survey on the status of smoking among employees, which found that both smokers and non-smokers have misconceptions about smoking, such as that it relieves stress. To help change people's perceptions, we conduct anti-smoking education using videos we have made ourselves. We are also promoting a policy discouraging all indoor smoking to create a smoke-free environment and prevent passive smoking. We are beginning to see steady results in response to our efforts, with the smoking rate decreasing 4.4 points from the start of the initiative in fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to improve the health of our employees, aiming for a smoking rate of less than 15%, as set out in the \"Health Management Mid-term Vision 2023'.\n\n## Support for recreational club activities\n\nWe support various recreational activities through our workplaces in addition to employee-managed clubs (30 in all) to make workplaces more cheerful through employee interactions outside of work hours.\n\n## Company sports initiatives\n\nCompany sports teams such as JR East Baseball Team (Tokyo), JR East Tohoku Baseball Team (Miyagi), JR East Running Team (Tokyo), JR East Women's Judo Team (Tokyo), and JR East Akita Basketball Team (Akita) are active in their respective regions and actively contribute to their communities by organizing initiatives such as sports classes for local elementary schools.\n\nJR East Akita Basketball Team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJR East Running Team\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, approximately 25% of energy consumed during train operations, etc., is renewable energy such as hydroelectric, solar, and wind power, which produce zero CO2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electricity generated by JR East's own power plants\n\nJR East operates a thermal power plant in Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture with total output of 809,000kW, fueled by city gas and natural gas. We are proceeding with the introduction of an efficient combined cycle power generation facility. Through the plant's renewal, it is being equipped with combined-cycle power generation units* with improved efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions. The renewed Unit 1 came into operation in June 2021.\n\nJR East runs its own hydroelectric power plants in Tokamachi City and Ojiya City, Niigata Prefecture with a total output of 449,000kW. These plants support our railway transportation operations as a clean energy power source that does not generate CO2. We also aim to harmonize with the river environment and coexist with the local community through the development of fishways and the release of salmon fry.\n\n- *  A combined-cycle power generation unit is a power generation unit that combines gas turbines propelled by combustion of gas with steam turbines driven by steam generated using the exhaust heat.\n\n## CO2 emission factors and power generation efficiency at thermal power plant of JR East\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25a0\n\nGeneration efficiency (left)\n\n\u25a0\n\nCO2 emission factors (right)\n\n## \u00b7 Calculation method\n\n- CO2 emission factor for JR East's thermal power plant is based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, and power generation efficiency is based on the method stipulated in the Energy Saving Act.\n- \u00b7   CO2 emission factor of electricity generated by JR East (thermal power and hydroelectric power): The emission factor adjusted in FY2021 was 0.283 (kg-CO2/kWh).\n\n## Progress in introducing renewable energy\n\nWe place solar panels on the roofs of platforms and station buildings and in rolling stock centers, using the energy they generate for our own use or for other trains passing through our tracks. In July 2018, we installed a compact wind power turbine at Oga Station. In addition to covering that station's electricity requirements, some power from the turbine is used for the ACCUM train, which is driven by an AC storage battery. Through such efforts, in fiscal 2021 we generated approximately 2.10 million kWh for our own consumption.\n\nIn addition to working with JR East Energy Development Co., Ltd. to develop renewable energy, we are actively introducing renewable\n\nenergy (wind, solar, and geothermal) initiatives, centered on the Tohoku region. Taking advantage of the feed-in tariff (FIT) system, we have steadily launched operations at mega solar power plants and large wind power generation plants. In fiscal 2021, we generated approximately 91.50 million kWh of electricity.Through the use of 'non-fossil fuel certificates' obtained from renewable energy and the supply of CO2-free electricity, we aim to achieve zero CO2 emissions for our train operations in the Tohoku area by fiscal 2031.\n\nOur targets for renewable energy power development are 0.7 GW in fiscal 2031 and 1 GW in fiscal 2051.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe star (\n\n\u2605\n\n) indicates JR East Energy Development Co., Ltd. development and investment projects.\n\n\u25cf\n\nWind power generation\n\n\u25cf\n\nSolar power generation\n\n\u25cf\n\nGeothermal power generation\n\n- \u25cf Wood biomass power generation \u25cf Biogas power generation\n\nWe plan to work with JR East Energy Development Co., Ltd., collaborating with local communities on further study and development to promote solar and wind power generation plants. By fiscal 2051, we aim to develop enough renewable energy to cover around 30-40% of the energy we use in the railway business. This figure rises to 50-60% for renewable energy if the hydroelectric power plants we operate are included.",

In addition, we have replaced some diesel vehicles in non-electrified sections of the railway with diesel hybrid vehicles and battery-powered trains (nicknamed ACCUM). Besides trains on the Karasuyama Line, all vehicles on the Oga Line have been operating by ACCUM since March 2021. As of the end of March 2021, 98.5% of the vehicles (12,198 railcars) were energy-saving vehicles.\n\nE235 series (Yokosuka Line)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEV-E801 series (Oga Line)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Train crew energy-saving activities\n\nTo reduce power consumption in operating the Yamanote Line, we have launched an energy-saving operations project team (PT) to collect and analyze data.\n\nThe amount of power saved by replacing old vehicles with new ones is about 3%, but we expect this energy-saving project to reduce power consumption by 10% or more.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to spread awareness of the importance of energy-saving operations throughout the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIkebuburo Transportation Depot, Tokyo Branch Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ecoste\n\nThrough our \"ecoste\" initiative, we are introducing a variety of elements at stations under the four headings of Energy Conservation, Energy Creation, Eco-Awareness, and Environmental Harmonization. Joining our 12 pilot ecoste stations, Takanawa Gateway Station was completed as an ecoste station in March 2020, and Sendagaya Station followed in December of the same year.

Such waste as magazines and newspapers is recycled into office paper that is used within the Group. Used tickets are all recycled into such items as toilet paper (recycling rate of 100%).\n\n## Reducing and recycling waste from construction projects and general rolling stock centers\n\nWith construction projects, which account for about 70% of the waste we generate, we are working to reduce waste by appropriately treating construction by-products and standardizing in-house design and construction methods. In addition, at general rolling stock centers, we rigorously separate waste into about 30 types and promote waste reduction and recycling.\n\nCollection and sorting work at the JR East Tokyo Materials Recycling Center\n\nOffice paper recycled from newspaperRPF made from waste plastic*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*  RPF (Refuse derived paper and plastics densified fuel): High-grade solid fuel from used paper and waste plastics mainly in industrial waste\n\n## Waste from stations, trains, general rolling stock centers, and construction projects\n\nAmount recycled Amount processed Recycle rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recycling rates\n\n|                                            | FY2014   | FY2019   | FY2020   | FY2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Waste from stations and trains             | 94%      | 94%      | 93%      | 93%      |\n| Waste from general rolling  stock centers  | 93%      | 96%      | 95%      | 94%      |\n| Waste from facility  construction projects | 96%      | 94%      | 93%      | 85%      |\n| Total                                      | 95%      | 94%      | 93%      | 85%      |\n\nJR East Tokyo Materials Recycling Center\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives to reduce use of plastics\n\nFrom October 2019 through September 2020, we implemented a Get Rid of Plastic Waste campaign to reduce plastic waste and raise awareness of plastic waste issues. Stores directly managed by Group companies had by the end of September 2020 completed the replacement of plastic shopping bags and straws with biodegradable alternatives. In December of the same year, we received an award for excellence in the corporate category from the Ministry of the Environment for our efforts in support of its campaign to reduce the use of carrier bags. In fiscal 2021, we set medium- to long-term targets for reducing the use of and using alternatives to single-use plastics.\n\n## Initiatives to tackle food waste\n\nIn addition to measures already in place, in fiscal 2021, we set a medium- to long-term target for reducing the final disposal amount of food waste by fiscal 2031.\n\n## Food recycling through biogas power generation\n\nWe recycle food products and operate a biogas electricity generation business through J Bio Food Recycle (jointly established by JR East Environment Access Co., Ltd. with the JFE Group). Since 2018, J Bio Food Recycle has been operating a power generation business that converts food waste to biogas at its Yokohama plant.\n\n## Others\n\n## Biodiversity Initiatives\n\n## Chemical substance management\n\nSince fiscal 2005  we have been planting indigenous trees to regenerate forests. In fiscal 2021, we carried out a tree planting project in Nakanojo Town, Gunma Prefecture.\n\nIn addition, WATERS takeshiba has been developing tidal flats and conducting observations and surveys of aquatic organisms in cooperation with local schools, and constantly conducts environmental surveys.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Under the Act for Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbon\n\nWe endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the Act on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and adopt substitutes that have less impact on the environment. Under the Act on Rational Use and Appropriate Management of Fluorocarbons, we reported a leakage amount of 4 thousand t-CO2e \u2606 for fiscal 2021.\n\n## Chemical substance management and reduction\n\nThe Company is classified as a business operator handling over a certain amount of specified chemical substances under the PRTR system*. Accordingly, 11 of our sites reported emissions and transfer amounts to the relevant local government bodies in fiscal 2021.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on ecosystems, we are working to reduce and substitute chemical substances, for example, by introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting.\n\n*  PRTR system: A system where companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances as required by the Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof (Law concerning Pollutant Release and Transfer Register [PRTR]). It encourages the monitoring and control of toxic chemical substances emitted into the environment and measures to prevent negative impact on the environment.\n\nIn our first venture in biogas power generation outside the Tokyo metropolitan area, we established Tohoku Biofood Recycling Co., Ltd. in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, in partnership with Tohoku Railway Transport Co., Ltd., JFE Group, and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. Tohoku Biofood Recycling's Sendai plant is scheduled to open in the spring of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJ Bio Food Recycle's Yokohama plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTohoku Bio Food Recycle's Sendai plant (Conceptual drawing)\n\n## Reduction of food waste by food sharing\n\nJR East Start UP Co., Ltd. and JR East Cross Station Co., Ltd. conducted an experiment in collaboration with CoCooking Co., Ltd., TABETE Rescue Deli, to purchase surplus food items that ' Ekinaka ' stores inside Tokyo Station have been unable to sell and sell them on to station employees after the stores have closed. The experiment began in January 2000 and so far we have achieved a reduction of about 4.3 tons of food waste. Full-scale operations began in March 2021.",

We examined physical risks after estimating passenger income based on future demographics as a baseline for analysis. We recognize the following points as major climate change risks and opportunities.\n\n| Main risks and opportunities   | Main risks and opportunities                                                                                                                                         | Timeframe   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Physical   risks               | Damage to railway facilities and equipment and suspension of  operations due to wind and water disasters Decrease in the number of passengers due to extreme weather | Short term  |\n| Transition  risks              | Cost increases due to the introduction/strengthening of a  carbon pricing system                                                                                     | Medium term |\n| Transition  risks              | Decrease in passenger numbers due to competition with other  means of transportation such as electric vehicles                                                       | Long term   |\n| Transition  risks              | Decrease in passenger numbers due to damage/change to  tourist attractions                                                                                           | Long term   |\n| Opportunities                  | Increase in passenger numbers due to preference for low-CO2- emissions transportation                                                                                | Long term   |\n\n## (2) Details of scenario analysis (physical risks)\n\nThe scenario analysis targeted the transportation services business. The number of passengers in the business is expected to fall due to population decline (declining birthrate and aging population), and it is predicted that the impact will be particularly significant in rural areas. In order to ascertain the financial impact of these factors and to verify\n\nthe adequacy of our business and environmental strategies, we conducted the following scenario analysis with 2050 as the target year.\n\n1 Estimated change in passenger income based on business area demographics\n\n+\n\n- 2 Estimated physical risk caused by natural disasters\n\n## 1 Estimated change in passenger income based on business area demographics\n\nWe estimated changes in passenger income up to 2050 based on data such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)* 1 data on population and GDP* 2 , which are used across a range of fields in climate change research. There was an 11% difference in the population estimate for 2050 between the scenario of 'Sustainability' (SSP1), which is our goal, and the opposing scenario of 'Regional Rivalry' (SSP3), and a \u00a5350 billion difference in estimated passenger income.

In the single year of 2050, the estimated financial impact (the sum of the decrease in passenger income and the increase in disaster recovery costs) came to \u00a53.4 billion under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)* 4 2.6 (2\u02daC) scenario and \u00a54.0 billion under the RCP8.5 (4\u02daC) scenario.\n\n## 3 Effect of natural disaster countermeasures\n\nJR East, based on an assumed scale of rainfall, has been raising the height of electrical equipment considered of critical importance to operations and installing water stop plates at building openings. In addition, we have developed a decision support system on railcar evacuation and we have prepared a vehicle evacuation manual (see 'Initiatives to address flooding' on page 34), and are promoting counter measures for  natural disasters according to the importance of equipment from both perspectives of hardware (physical facilities) and software (human responses). Taking this into account, the increase in financial impact in the RCP2.6 (2\u02daC) scenario becomes \u00a51.3 billion while under the RCP8.5 (4\u02daC) scenario it becomes \u00a51.6 billion. From here on, we will estimate the financial impact of other major scenarios and confirm the effectiveness of the countermeasures.",

In discussions of management policies, investment projects, and various reports at meetings of the Board of Directors, executive directors make comments not only on their own areas of responsibility but also on related areas, and outside directors actively speak from their own professional perspectives. The chairperson of the meeting takes the lead in responding to the comments of each member, and my impression is that discussions have been becoming livelier every year.\n\nI have worked as a researcher and research manager in the civil engineering field at a construction company. I participate in the social implementation of research and development results at several national research and development agencies specializing in disaster prevention, the environment, and energy. To realize a new JR East in line with 'Move Up' 2027 in the midst of the critical situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid changes in social trends, more precise and prompt decisions are needed, and the importance of the Board of Directors is greater than ever. At board meetings, I express my opinions based on the knowledge I have gained from my experience, with the mottoes of 'speak frankly' and 'don't waste opportunities.'\n\n## JR East's Corporate Governance\n\nI believe that we have an excellent system of governance from the standpoint of the railway business. In order to develop the business toward the realization of 'Move Up' 2027, by utilizing the enormous amount and range of data that JR East possesses, collaboration across the entire group is vital, and our corporate governance is becoming more and more Groupwide in nature.\n\nHowever, because the established governance system derives from the railway business, my perception is that we can hesitate to push forward with new businesses. To be able to compete in the post-COVID-19 era, we need quickly to establish a new business model based on JR East's version of 'Society 5.0.' And we need to build a corporate governance system centered on risk management. We must not be trapped by past successes, but eagerly absorb knowledge and take on new challenges.\n\n## Audit initiatives\n\nThe Board of Corporate Auditors is keenly aware of the importance of cooperation and information sharing with the internal audit division and auditing firms in order to constantly obtain a wide range of information when conducting auditing activities in a large corporate group such as ours.\n\nAs a lawyer, I believe that I have a responsibility to make full use of my expertise in the area of legal compliance, which is the foundation of corporate governance. In particular, I think that the perspective of 'preventive law' is particularly important; that is, to anticipate potential legal problems and prevent them beforehand. While utilizing my legal experience in auditing, I strive to look at things from an objective perspective as an outside corporate auditor. On the other hand, to conduct audits based on the actual situation of the company, I try to get to know things on the front lines as much as possible and listen to the voices of the company's employees.\n\nNow that the company is facing a severe business situation, having incurred the first loss in the company's history, I believe that improving the high ratio of fixed costs in the railway business is one of the major problems in establishing a profitable structure. I intend to keep a close watch to ensure, from an auditing perspective, that cost reductions are appropriately implemented while ensuring safety.\n\n## Corporate governance of the company\n\nWe have an excellent tradition of good governance in safe and stable operations in our railway business. On the other hand, management risks in the Life-style services business, which we are aiming to expand, are quite different from those in the railway business. For example, we expect to generate high returns in the Real Estate & Hotels business, but that entails a high degree of risk. I think the problem is how to take risks while conducting appropriate risk assessment.\n\nThrough various measures taken to realize 'Move Up' 2027, I believe that our corporate governance vision has become broader. However, people's attitudes are constantly changing. I believe that for governance to evolve effectively, each and every employee must hone his or her sensitivity to the ethics and other issues that the company should observe.",

The Board of Directors has established an Executive Committee consisting of 8 directors and 12 senior executive officers. This Executive Committee generally meets once a week and deliberates on matters to be decided by the Board of Directors and other important management issues. In addition, the Group Strategy Formulation Committee consisting of 8 directors, 12 senior executive officers, and 3 executive officers was formed with the aim developing all JR East groups, and meets as required to discuss important group issues such as management strategies for each business field.\n\nBefore resolving agenda items to appoint or dismiss directors or the president and representative director, in the interests of objectivity, appropriateness, and transparency we consult first with the Personnel Deliberation Committee, which comprises independent outside directors and other directors.\n\nWhen determining director compensation, we first consult with the Remuneration Deliberation Committee, which is made up of independent outside directors and other directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reasons for adopting our current corporate governance system\n\nWe have established a Board of Directors due to the need to make decisions that reflect various types of expertise and experience in such areas as safety assurance in the railway business, which accounts for a majority of earnings, and from a medium- to long-term perspective. We also have in place a Board of Corporate Auditors, which is made up of corporate auditors and is independent from the Board of Directors.\n\n## Changes in the number of directors (up to the introduction of the Corporate Governance Code)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Company's establishment  (1987)   | Full privatization  (2002)   | Introduction of Japan's Corporate  Governance Code (2015)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inside Directors : 16             | Inside Directors : 29        | Inside Directors : 14                                       |\n| Outside Directors : 2             | Outside Directors : 2        | Outside Directors : 3                                       |\n| 18 in total                       | 31 in total                  | 17 in total                                                 |\n\n## Audits by corporate auditors, internal audits, and accounting audits\n\nThe Company has five corporate auditors, two full-time and three part-time (four of whom are outside corporate auditors). One of the part-time corporate auditors is qualified as a certified public accountant and has extensive experience related to finance and accounting. We assign around 10 dedicated staff members to assist the corporate auditors\n\nIn accordance with the policy determined by the Board of Corporate Auditors, the corporate auditors attend the Board of Directors and other important meetings, listen to reports on the status of execution of duties from directors and the Internal Audit Department, inspect important approval documents, audit the status of business and financial assets, listen to reports on the status of execution of duties from the accounting auditor, and discuss major audit matters with the accounting auditor. Furthermore, the corporate auditors communicate with and exchange information with directors and corporate auditors of Group companies, and obtain reports as needed on the operations of Group companies. In fiscal 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some audit activities were conducted online. The Company's representative directors and outside directors regularly exchange opinions.\n\nFor internal audits, JR East has assigned approximately 100 full-time employees at Inquiry & Audit Department (Head Office) and at Audit Divisions (branch offices). We have a system in place to evaluate and make recommendations on the status of business execution and risk control from the perspectives of effectiveness, efficiency, and legality, and conduct audits of the head office, managing organizations, branch offices, and in-field offices based on audit plans.  If there is need for improvement, we ask for a report on the situation and provide advice. We also conduct audits of Group companies, and report the audit results to the president and representative directors approximately once a quarter.\n\nThere were no major violations of laws or regulations in the matters relating to products and service in fiscal 2021. KPMG AZSA LLC (an accounting auditor), which has an audit agreement in place with the Company, conducts audits during and at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nAs for the mutual cooperation between internal audits, audits by corporate auditors and accounting audits, regular liaison meetings are held between corporate auditors and officers in charge of the internal audit division and others. Corporate auditors listen to reports and discuss the status of the execution of duties by the accounting auditor, and corporate auditors, the internal audit division, and the accounting auditor exchange opinions.\n\n## Ensuring effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\nOnce each year, an analysis and assessment of effectiveness of the Board of Directors is performed, as described below.\n\n- \u00b7  The effectiveness of the Board of Directors is assessed from the perspective of the Board's roles and responsibilities, including transparent, fair, quick, and decisive decision-making.\n- \u00b7  As to the assessment method, all directors independently evaluate the Board of Directors' effectiveness. These results are analyzed, independent outside directors are asked for their opinions, and the Board of Directors' method of operations may be revised, if necessary.\n\n## Results of the analysis and assessment of Board of Directors' effectiveness at the Board of Directors meeting on May 14, 2021\n\nThe results of the self-assessment confirmed that the Board of Directors appropriately considers matters for deliberation, conducts sufficient reporting to fulfill its role in supervising business execution, and that it has a compliance system in place. On the basis of these results, the Company determined that its Board of Directors is sufficiently fulfilling its roles and responsibilities, and judged the Board as being effective.\n\nReflecting the opinions of the independent outside directors, to further enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors we have\n\n## Approach to evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors\n\n## Analysis and assessment of Board of Directors' effectiveness in FY2021\n\nItem\n\nDecision-making\n\nrelating to business\n\nexecution\n\nSupervision of the\n\nexecution of duties by\n\ndirectors\n\nManagement of the\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nHighly evaluated aspects\n\n\u00b7 Discussions are taking place in accordance with 'Move Up' 2027\n\n\u00b7 Outside directors are becoming more forthright in expressing their opinions\n\n\u00b7 Compliance and risk management levels are improving\n\n\u00b7 Increasing transparency in procedures for executive nomination and remuneration\n\n\u00b7  Improving support for outside directors, including site visits\n\nand advance explanations of board meeting agendas.\n\n| Item                                                  | Areas for improvement                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decision-making  relating to business  execution      | \u00b7 Deeper discussions on management strategies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic \u00b7 Formulation of strategies that further emphasize synergies between businesses |\n| Supervision of the  execution of duties by  directors | \u00b7 Balance of reporting between the railway business and other businesses \u00b7 Further improvement of risk management in businesses other than the railway business |\n| Management of the  Board of Directors                 | \u00b7 Improvement of board meeting materials \u00b7 Further enhancement of director training                                                                             |\n\n## Evaluation Items\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we have worked to strengthen the reporting of the status of progress toward realizing the Group's management vision 'Move Up' 2027 and to accelerate discussions on business direction and strategy beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\nThe Company pays directors who are not outside directors base compensation based on their roles as consideration for their everyday business execution, within the scope of compensation amount resolved at the General Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, these directors receive performance-linked compensation based on management performance, shareholder dividends, and their degree of contribution to operating performance and the achievement of the Company's medium-term management vision during that fiscal year.\n\nIn consideration of their job responsibilities, outside directors and corporate auditors receive no performance-linked compensation.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\nRatio of base compensation and performance-linked compensation for directors other than outside directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Indices for performance-linked compensation and the reason for their selection\n\nIn addition to 'a director's performance during the year,' a director's success during a given business year is measured through an overall assessment of indices including 'operating results including operating income and profit attributable to owners of parent during the year' and 'shareholder returns' (business characteristics strongly associated with cooperation among business departments) and 'level of contribution to 'Move Up' 2027' (business characteristics associated with a long span of time from the planning stage to the appearance of results). To assess performance during the year and the level of contribution, the President and Representative Director conducts goal-setting and tracing interviews with individual directors regarding the achievement level of annual plans and 'Move Up' 2027.

The amount of base compensation for directors in the above table includes the amount of compensation voluntarily returned.\n\n## Main indicators for determining performance-linked compensation\n\n- \u00b7  Performance of individual directors during the relevant fiscal year \u00b7  Operating results and shareholder returns in the relevant fiscal year \u00b7  Contribution to the achievement of 'Move Up' 2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTypical year Around 4:1\n\nThe president and representative director conducts goal-setting and tracing interviews with individual directors regarding contributions to the achievement level of annual plans and the Group management vision 'Move Up' 2027\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic on business performance both in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.\n\nNo non-monetary remuneration is paid.\n\n## Ratio of base compensation and compensation linked to performance\n\nThe ratio of base compensation to performance-linked compensation for directors who are not outside directors is typically around 4:1, excluding the variable portion for individual director's performance so that performance-linked compensation accounts for a certain percentage of total compensation. Of this amount, performancelinked compensation will be added to or subtracted from the basic amount for each position within the range of 30% to 40%, depending on the performance of each director. Further reductions may be made taking into account circumstances related to the Company's management, including the business results for the current fiscal year and the business forecast for the next fiscal year.\n\n## Internal Control System\n\n## Basic concept of internal control system\n\nIn the midst of a drastically changing environment surrounding our Group, in order to speed up our transformation and steadily achieve 'Move Up' 2027, it is essential to develop and properly operate an internal control system that is appropriate for our management and business environment.\n\nThe Group considers its internal control system to be the combination of efforts by all Group employees to realize the Group's philosophy and the Group's management vision in an appropriate and efficient manner. In addition to compliance, ensuring safety and security, preventing financial losses, and making sure of the soundness of financial statements, the Group is working on risk management from the perspective of expanding into new business fields, with the aim of developing the Group and increasing its value. The internal control system also motivates employees and supports staff in taking on new challenges that will lead to the Group's growth and structural reforms. We view it as a broad concept that includes systems to ensure the appropriateness of business operations based on the Companies Act and systems to ensure the appropriateness of financial information, based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.\n\nJR East Group's basic approach to its internal control system\n\n## Group Philosophy / Realization of the JR EAST Group Management Vision 'Move Up' 2027\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn addition to the development and operation of the Company's System for Ensuring the Appropriateness of Business Operations based on the Companies Act and the System for Ensuring the Appropriateness of Financial Information based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, we have also been striving to improve our risk management system by identifying various risks* faced by the\n\nGroup, prioritizing them based on their likelihood of occurrence and impact, and implementing the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle to consider and implement measures to avoid or reduce them, in an effort to curb the occurrence of risks and minimize their impact if they do occur.\n\nNevertheless, in order for the Group to improve profitability and undertake structural reforms to speed up 'Move Up' 2027, we recognize the importance of broad-based risk management from the perspective of proactively increasing the value of the Group, including risk-taking, in addition to considering risks from the perspective of reducing negative factors such as avoiding losses. In addition to ensuring stable and appropriate business operations, the Group's risk management is designed to support and encourage all Group employees to boldly take on challenges toward growth.\n\n- *  These include not only risks related to compliance, safety assurance, and natural disasters, but also those related to market changes, competitor trends, social and economic conditions in Japan and overseas, and management decisions related to new businesses.\n\n## From risk reduction to increased willingness to take up challenges\n\nTo realize 'Move Up' 2027, it is essential to establish and properly operate an internal control system that responds to changes in the environment.To achieve sustainable growth as a provider of a wide range of services, while avoiding and minimizing risks, the JR East Group continuously identifies, analyzes, and evaluates risks. Also, we clarify priorities, and take measures with a strong awareness of the importance of initial responses and collaboration.\n\nIn addition, to increase the value of the Group, it is important that these efforts promote reforms that are compatible with the business environment and consistent with internal controls and governance. We also need to identify risks in challenges to growth and to promote broad risk management that embraces risk-taking. The key here is the initiative of our employees and I believe that it is important to encourage their engagement from a bottom-up perspective.\n\nTo respond flexibly to various changes in the business environment, we need to promote and deepen cooperation between corporate planning, audit, and other divisions, and to put in place systems that facilitate the reduction of risk in each unit. We are also trying to develop risk management.\n\nRisk Management Unit Corporate & Legal Strategies Department\n\n<!-- image -->",

We adopted the Policy on Legal and Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Ethics as the Group's corporate activity guidelines, and we comply with all related laws including the Railway Business Act in our various business fields such as Transportation services, Life-style services and the IT & Suica services, and we thus conduct business in accordance with corporate ethics.\n\n## Overview of compliance at the JR East Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Policy on Legal and Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Ethics\n\nWe uphold regulatory compliance and corporate ethics in accordance with the Group's philosophy and principles. To improve the efficacy of\n\nthis policy, we have distributed the Compliance Action Plan Handbook to all members of the Group. This handbook outlines the actions expected of every employee. It is revised periodically to reflect changes in laws and the social environment.\n\nFurthermore, in conjunction with the development of overseas business, we formulated and announced the 'Basic Policy for the Prevention of Bribery Relating to Foreign Public Officials.'\n\nCompliance Action Plan Handbook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting compliance\n\nWe conduct compliance education for all staff each year, to help all Group employees better understand the importance of compliance. In fiscal 2021, we used e-learning to deepen understanding of how to tackle power harassment. In addition to deepening employee understanding of violations that have occurred at other companies, we worked to instill knowledge and awareness by discussing these issues in relation to our own workplaces.\n\nIn addition, we hold annual compliance seminars to consider compliance from a broad perspective, and talks are given by outside lecturers to provide an alternative perspective, which will be useful for future business operations.\n\nThe head of each workplace regularly checks operational appropriateness using questionnaires. We use the Confirmation Support Sheet of Basic Issues, which summarizes fundamental compliance-related matters, for ongoing checking and confirmation. To ascertain potential compliance risks inherent in customization activities, we distribute questionnaires to all Group employees in an effort to detect any early signs of major scandals.\n\n## Compliance hotline\n\nWe have established consultation desks both internally and outside the Group to facilitate consultation and reporting related to compliance. We accept consultations and reports from business partners and retirees and publish how we respond to them on our website. To enhance the effectiveness of our internal reporting system, we have registered for certification with Japan's Whistleblowing Compliance Management System (WCMS), through the program's 'self-declaration of conformity' process.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we received 249 consultations and messages on a wide range of issues from the handling of laws and regulations to problems in human relations including harassment, and we responded to them properly and respectfully.\n\n## Ensuring information security\n\nJR East has designed and introduced an information security management system outlined by the JR East Group's Basic Policy for Information Security and led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\nWe strive to minimize information security risks by promoting security measures based on the following basic concepts: in-depth defense with multiple security measures, development of a system to promptly detect and respond to cyber attacks, timely software upgrades to address vulnerabilities, and Groupwide deployment of security measures. In addition, we continuously conduct information security education to raise employee awareness of cybersecurity and undertake training to confirm initial responses in the event of a security incident.\n\n## (Specific initiatives)\n\n- \u00b7  Detection of fraudulent communications by the Security Operations Center (SOC)\n- \u00b7  Vulnerability assessment and countermeasures for business PCs and systems\n- \u00b7  CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) training on the assumption of cyber attacks\n- \u00b7  Thorough familiarization of all employees with '10 Points on Information Security' (rules for using information equipment)\n- \u00b7  Annual security training for all employees and periodic targeted email training, etc.\n\n## Personal data protection\n\nPursuant to applicable laws and regulations including the 'Act on the Protection of Personal Information', JR East Group has published its 'Basic Policy for Personal Information Handling' and formulated the 'Regulations for the Management of Personal Information', and we improve our handling of personal information in tandem with legal revisions. In addition, we are revising our rules to reinforce our personal information management system and\n\n10 Points on Information Security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeaflet entitled 'Points of Caution on the Handling of Personal Information'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreduce the risk of information leaks. We have aiso appointed chief privacy officers who have the responsibility of strictly protecting personal data. Furthermore, as one of several measures responding to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, we have now published an English-language version of our privacy policy and other materials on our website.\n\nThrough leaflets for raising employee awareness, articles in our internal magazines, and compliance education, we are also working to ensure that all employees remain fully aware of the need for the strict handling and management of personal data. Furthermore, in order to ensure proper control of personal data, the Group conducts periodical internal workplace audits.\n\n## Dialogue with investors and shareholders\n\nWe create opportunities for constructive dialogue with shareholders and investors to deepen their understanding of the JR East Group's businesses and to build long-term, trust-based relationships. As a result, we strive to ensure sustainable business growth and build corporate value over the medium to long term.\n\n## (Specific initiatives)\n\n- \u00b7  Financial results briefings, individual meetings, overseas investor relations, meetings on themes of particularly high interest and site visits to facilities\n- \u00b7  Shareholder-only events (examples include night-time visits to the Railway Museum, special tours of a Shinkansen General Rolling Stock Center, and tours of the Marunouchi Station Building at Tokyo Station)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communication with employees\n\nThrough on-site visits and other means, executives and other senior staff at the head office and branch offices actively communicate with JR East employees. In fiscal 2019, we began holding 'Move Up' 2027 Discussion, in which executives and head office management share opinions and hold discussions with employees in each area, to embed 'Move Up' 2027 in each workplace and encourage Group employees to take on challenges and make changes through their own initiatives. In fiscal 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, executives and head office management hosted around 50 online discussions with employees, as well as visiting each area in person.",

Also, JR East sought to improve convenience by encouraging the use of contactless service enabled by Suica and Shinkansen e-tickets . Nonetheless, the revenues of the railway business and bus services decreased significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Transportation segment recorded operating revenues of \u00a51,095.7 billion and an operating loss of \u00a5532.3 billion, compared with operating income of \u00a5250.5 billion in the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Group companies by segment\n\nJR BUS KANTO Co., Ltd.

These efforts included GranSta Tokyo in Tokyo, which is JR East's largest commercial facility inside a railway station; ecute EDITION Yokohama in Kanagawa; and Kimchi, Durian, Cardamom,,, Food Lab in Tokyo. However, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, stores inside railway stations as well as advertising and publicity saw a drop in revenues. Consequently, the business segment recorded operating revenues of \u00a5318.0 billion and an operating loss of \u00a513.5 billion, compared with operating income of \u00a534.3 billion in the previous fiscal year.\n\nWorking with local communities, the Group developed large-scale terminal stations and line-side areas to create cities that offer appealing lifestyles. These initiatives included the openings of the WATERS takeshiba complex in Tokyo and the JR SENDAI EAST GATE BLDG . in Miyagi. Despite such initiatives, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp decline in the revenues of station buildings and hotels. Amid these conditions, the business segment booked operating revenues of \u00a5271.2 billion and a year-on-year decrease of 79.7% in operating income, to \u00a515.1 billion.\n\nThe Group increased usage of Suica , and advanced railway projects overseas. As for Suica e-money, we continued to develop the network of participating stores and business establishments by introducing Suica e-money to cafes and supermarkets. Nevertheless, revenues from the data processing business declined, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic revenues from credit card operations also decreased markedly. As a result, the business segment's operating revenues were \u00a579.5 billion, while operating income was down 38.2% year on year to \u00a514.7 billion.\n\n## Group companies by segment\n\nJR East Cross Station Co., Ltd.
